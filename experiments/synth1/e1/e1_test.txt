0	this product was so disappointing that i discarded the entire box after trying one bar there are much better raw food bars on the market in terms of both nutrition and taste	8
0	sickly weak queasy stomach after eating the bar for 4 hours or more i havent felt so yuky and sickly in a long time you cannot return these or any food items to amazon the coconut was moist and tender yet no good flavor taste smells of cheap food grade oil the spirulina is too try and chalky too much dried spirulina in one bar again bad taste no good alive flavor spirulina and cashew coconut agave nectar elisha elishachristian earthlink ne	8
0	silly me ! i assumed that these bars would taste like spirulina and cashews but the only ingredient you can taste in them or any of their other flavors is dates if you really love dates go for it otherwise forget it	8
0	i agree with the person who said it 's hard to chew and here is why disect your slim jim length ways there do you see the hair \? it is \( allegedly \) all made of cow hair gross ! that is the beef part i guess trans fat \( partially hydrogenated veg oil \) and some really long word chemicals to make mechanically separated beef and chicken what looks like hair taste good \? no thanks glad i did not buy 100 ! my dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog 's p peewww ! ! !	8
0	slim jims may taste ok but that 's because they are so greasy that 's what helps the flavor i ca n't figure out why anyone would like these as i ca n't seem to chew them to a point where i feel comfortable to swallow it 's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat the amount of fat cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky i 'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff at least i can chew the beef jerky	8

0	flavor is just passable the cracker is too thick have not found a topping that will soften it	8
0	i had bought instant miso soup in the past and the taste was very similar with what you get at your usual sushi restaurant so i ordered this one and i should n't have ordered without trying because the taste is very strange not pleasant now we 're stuck with 12x4 of something we do n't like hopefully someone else can avoid our mistake	8
0	wow ! i use pacific foods beef and chicken stock all the time i guess i expected more ! convenience is n't worth it if the soup is super salty and tastes processed ! ! ! ! hardly any barley or beef ! i cooked up one bag i'm throwing the rest out	8
0	scant vegetables and beef surprisingly little barley gloppy texture much too salty does not taste fresh needed addition of fresh vegetables to be edible hard to believe but campbell 's is better	8
0	i really enjoy organic foods so when i came upon this item i was thrilled they were making organic popcorn especially newman 's own a brand i 've liked in the past i have to agree with the other poster the flavor is bland and almost flavorless there are other brands of organic popcorn that i 've found more recently that are far better do n't waste your money on so many of them ! !	8
0	this popcorn is rather bland i purchased it because generally i like newman 's own brand and i liked the idea of organic popcorn but it is flavorless i would not buy again	8
0	i ordered a 12 pack of this broth and so far i 've received a total of 3 bottles 1 original order and 2 replacements amazon still has n't sent me the 12 pack and now instead of correcting my order they want to cancel it and refund my money i 've been on and off of hold for over 20 minutes and they still have n't helped me i strongly recommend you find somewhere else to buy this product	8
0	purchased these for my sons lunch box and ca n't do it they are too salty he 's always been happy with veggy booty and that is what he 'll continue to get	8
0	the jerky seemed to be old and hard and was too tough to chew it also was a little bland for me i did like the peppered jerky much better	8
0	we ordered the favorite assortment pack but that is not what we received when we questioned our order we were told they were out of stock on our original order and we could not return the order we received we wo n't order again	8
0	only recieved one instead of 12 boxes and amazon not able to fix still waiting for remainder of orde	8
0	i tried it also as a less expensive alternative and wo n't be ordering again the flavor just tasted off to me kinda like old coffee that 's been sitting in pot for a couple of hours did n't have that freshly brewed taste	8
0	because of tummy troubles my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet well this stuff is just what the doctor ordered as it is almost completely tasteless i ca n't give it a one star which qualifies as hating it as i ca n't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients but it is not good it makes kraft mac and cheese seem very exciting ! i would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from annie 's this would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it	8
0	the balls were squeezed into the box and flattened the taste is not very peanutty i'm disappointed	8
0	i bought both the ahi tuna jerky and salmon jerky both were dried out and brittle absolutely the worst incredibly the salmon jerky was worse \( i e drier harder \) than the ahi tuna jerky	8
0	most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed they put no expiration date on the bags so i do n't even know if i was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way on top of this they were too spicy my dog seemed to enjoy it though the ahi tuna on the other hand was great	8
0	this salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough it is pretty much inedible and when you do painstakingly gnaw on it it does n't release much flavor but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth i had the misfortune of ordering this and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched and i'm not sure what to do with them i even tried soaking the jerky and tried boiling it with some macaroni and nothing seems to soften this stuff up ! what a waste of money go for some beef jerky instead and if you need salmon eat it fresh or canned this product is a joke	8
0	melitta coffee is certainly one of the better brands and i really like that each pod is individually wrapped i bought this because the senseo hazelnut was not in stock at the time caution senseo coffee maker users the melitta pod does not fit well in the senseo pod holders the single pod holder is too small for the melitta pod and the double pod holder is too big for one melitta pod too small for two melitta pods i found the coffee to be just a bit on the weak side but this may only be because i used it in a senseo machine	8
0	maybe i'm daft but i ca n't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine i 've tried tamping them which does n't work well and i 've tried just placing them in the filter in both cases i get watery dribble but no espresso as with other european products \( think ikea \) there are no printed instructions in english just line art drawings perhaps i'm just doing something wrong i like the concept of pods but i 'll stick to beans instead	8
0	i was very disappointed in the taste of this item not at all what i expected from splenda it is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste for instance if added to coffee you will not detect any coffee flavor only the splenda flavor much too strong i prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this splenda product without question !	8
0	taste great but the cap on the bottle does n't seal very well so when it is shipped they leak you can not take it with you without putting it in another container	8
0	really strange cardboard mushy texture flavor can be sickening at times but you get used to it i wo n't buy this again i am not sure this is even beef has a strange taste not sure where the other reviews came from \? \?	8
0	who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange i love beef jerky especially peppered and hot spicy varieties but this jerky lacks the chewy ness that i expect in a quality beef jerky this stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy grainy consistency the flavor is n't bad but after reluctantly finishing the first bag i ca n't bring myself to open the second one perhaps i was n't paying proper attention but i was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in brazil i would not have purchased it if i had known this	8
0	although this is a good coffee i was expecting something that tasted like a cappuccino this coffee tastes nothing like it it does n't even have a hint of cinnimon flavor as the package suggests if you want regular coffee then this is the coffee to buy but if you 're looking for cappuccino save your money	8
0	i was excited to try this product as i love oreos but do n't like all the garbage that goes into them we tried newman o 's originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all still i had to see for myself we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as oreo cookies for some reason others seem to think they taste great just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large	8
0	i picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that pirate 's booty was a great product these tasted rather odd to me and i wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just do n't go well together in my opinion it might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste but that was not the case here	8
0	after searching high and low i found a site for 'nossa familia coffee' that carries a coffee that is imported directly from a farm in brazil ! i guess this family has won the cup of excellence competition and they put their top coffees in the senseo compatible pods the site is www familyroast com and i highly recommend i	8
0	this mix was very sour and because of the way the fruits are dried there were a lot of crumbs inside the packets	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	i want to let you know that i received my order in today 's mail im unhappy to say this but the taste of this coffee is terrible i would have been better off if i had thrown my 37 00 out my car window these coffee selections should be pulled off from your web site i know you guys can not refund my money on this order but i am going to write to the products manufactorer and let them know how i feel about their coffee products the taste of the coffee makes you sick to your stomach if i were you i would post this commit under your customer 's reveiws to let other buyers beware of this terrible tasting coffee	8
0	then this is n't for you horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that i definately do n't care for not to say that you will not however if you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee this is n't the one to try	8
0	i bought these pods on amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store now i know why when i opened the package the senseo watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee buyer beware i am back to buying pods at the grocery store	8
0	these cookies were ok just ok i may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies every last cookies was broken i understand this is probably due to poor packaging the consistency was a bit grainy and dry though and milk did not help next time i 'll purchase a chewy brand or mrs fields	8
0	i received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas the chest is beatiful and will be great for future use however i am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea although the bags are highly aromatic the tea is very bland as if the bags were old i am sure bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty just not the box i received	8
0	liked the idea of the box but the tea tasted smelled like glue or paint or both once i removed the tea from the box it was ok	8
0	i had trouble getting the cups to function properly without getting grounds in my coffee at first i thought it was my coffee maker but the other brand of coffee i use worked fine sometimes it took 3 4 cup changes to finally find a cup that would work correctly without getting grounds in my coffee most of the time i would just give up again the other brand of coffee i use never does this not getting this coffee anymore i would comment on the taste but i never got to really taste it with the grounds and all donna marylan	8
0	i 've tried this coffee with all size settings it is too weak for my taste even at the smallest brew size and if it was stronger i still do n't think i would care for the flavor it just does n't taste like good colombian coffees that i 've had not even close this is definitely one i would not purchase again	8
0	this is very weak coffee do not buy unless you like it that way	8
0	i opened one packet \( which was quite large for a serving and shared it with 3 others in my office we all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible no one could continue eating it and i sent back 8 of the 9 packets not edible in our humble opinion sorry	8
0	this coffee does n't have anything special about it i like good kona coffee and i think 2 stars really tells it all	8
0	save your money and buy folger 's this coffee assuming it is kona as advertised is a lame example of the variety awfu	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	first of all the tea chest is disappointing to say the least the chest is made of cheep compressed sawdust and then coated with a plastic like 'finish' which makes the box look like it was constructed from cardboard and plastic the tea its self is alright sadly nothing special this item arrived a good 6 weeks after it was ordered all of the tea packets were wrinkled and crushed and the box broke after i opened it a few dozen times needles to say this product way disappointing all around	8
0	i was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews starbucks is good but i prefer bolder taste imagine my surprise when i ordered 2 boxes both were expired ! one expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes i admit that amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping but geez 2 years expired ! ! ! i'm hoping to find local san diego area shoppe that carries pods so that i can try something different than starbucks	8
0	they are kindof on the bland side and i 'd rather spend my calories elsewhere ! but they are on the low carb side 150 calories 7g total fat \( 2g saturated \) 8g sugar 5g fiber 1g sugar alcohol 10g protein	8
0	my sister worked at starbucks so i used to get their unground espresso beans for free on occasion i have a pump espresso machine but only a cheap blade grinder which should tell you that i'm only about mid range on the coffee snobbery scale that said i prefer the starbucks espresso to this in spite of the drastic difference in price when i buy it retail again though i'm not one of those people who examines this stuff overly much i only know what i like the taste of in fact i only drink it in lattes 4 shot lattes but lattes none the less	8
0	this coffee had an off sour taste it 's almost as if it went bad as in milk that 's past the date i only made one cup before throwing out the rest of the bag i certainly wo n't be ordering this brand again	8
0	these are not the greatest thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come not so they were not what i had expected	8
0	i brought this tea thinking it was a great deal then while steeping my tea i noticed something in the bag at first i thought it was a rock but it looked like a garden snail i cut the bag open and it was a garden snail ! yuck ! i checked several bags and approx 50 of them had snails in them this is the worst tea experience i 've had	8
0	i was very disappointed in this product i wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts but they are too stale to use they are not crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging unfortunately amazon will not let me return them so i'm out 20 i was going to try some other products by this brand but now i will not	8
0	i tried this once you can get the same thing by buying some popping corn in your local grocery popping it pouring it into a bowl and adding milk this made me reluctant to try other kashi products frankly i do n't see why people continue to pay an outrageous price for what amounts to popcorn ps amazon should add a zero star rating	8
0	the box arrived opened and although the packages were individually wrapped i opted not to eat them they also looked very oily and not fresh i got a refund after some time and numerous emails	8
0	i absolutely agree with the two other reviewers i had very high hopes too as i use mccann 's brown bread mix all the time i do n't think i could live without it so i was very disappointed with the fruit scones mix there is a very weird taste to me it seems like 'soapy' or something but definitely not a pleasure to eat i 've got tons of bags left of this mix which i will have to throw away i would definitely not recommend this product sorry	8
0	really dry and just not as good as could be a disappointment after using this companys other products	8
0	we are huge scone lovers and were absolutely disappointed with the taste of these scones the mix was easy enough to assemble and bake but the scones have a decidely odd smell and very caustic after taste my husband who will eat just about anything threw the whole batch in the trash after trying his first one we had high hopes but sadly this product just did n't deliver	8
0	i bought about a million of these pods for my single serving senseo machine they do n't fit one is too big for the single brewing well and two are too big for the double your only option is one pod in the double brewing well and the coffee comes out very weak just like this product	8
0	we have been buying the melita buzzworthy dark roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied recently they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines i also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling at the time melita made these changes i believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good accordingly i rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars we are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee	8
0	when i think dark roast i think full bodied and dark melitta pods are the worst i 've tried i 've tried senseo pods too which are only mediocre i did find the target brand archer farms pods to be the best the french roast really does rival starbucks home brewed its cheap too 3 99 for 18 pods if you like a full bodied rich dark and strong cup of cofee do n't do melitta i found senseo and archer farms pods fit in my melitta pod brewer just fine	8
0	this coffee was over three years old and was not drinkable very stale personally i ca n't believe amazon would sell a grocery product this old amazon did give me my money back	8
0	date on bottom of can shows an expiration of june 2007 i would expect a longer shelf life also the label shows mechanically extracted chicken meat this generally equates to bone fragments i'm not confident with this product	8
0	mushroom soup is one of my favorites so i was very disappointed in this version i agree totally with the first reviewer this is one bland and tasteless soup i'm only giving it any stars at all because it is organic and the attempt is appreciated	8
0	ordered a melitta 10 cup coffee maker and on the same page was an ad for the melitta filters they were very expensive and when they arrived they were not for a 10 cup melitta i advised the company but my complaint went to dead ears ! buy your filters at the local store they are cheaper	8
0	highest quality wholesome ingredients my aunt ida seriously how do companies get away with this nonsense \? \? \? the first ingredient is corn syrup followed closely by sugar that the harmony line would even consider masquerading as a healthier foods company and then try to pawn off this rubbish it 's revolting i say do n't buy from them just on principle yours the food zealo	8
0	i bought a case of these from amazon because someone on some candy forum claimed these were of excellent quality and that they were comparable to premium brands like haribro do n't believe it these are cheapo gummi bears no better than whatever cheapo junk your local drugstore supermarket bigbox sells pretty squishy \( not very chewy \) and a variety of bland flavors that all taste mostly like sweet there 's no point in buying these	8
0	ok so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty they also have a burnt flavor you could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order on the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good this is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first \( instead of buying 12 bags \) also note grocery items cannot be returned to amazon	8
0	as another reviewer pointed out i received only one pack of coffee pods i was sent a replacement order with guess what only one pack of coffee pods again i am getting a refund i would not recommend purchasing this one	8
0	stay away ! amazon sent me 1 bag of coffee pods 18 pods in total not pack of 12 like advertised unless you want to pay 30 on 18 generic coffee pods stay away i will be returning my product asap	8
0	overall the nuts were soft and lacked the flavor we had hoped for for the price we could have done better	8
0	i love this popcorn ! unfortunately you did n't send me what i ordered you sent me natural not natural light	8
0	i have been buying stoneridge orchards products for a long time so i decided to try the variety pack for quick snacks not only the product seems inferior to their regular packages but also the pouches were half open in the box what a rip of	8
0	while you could do a lot worse with other snacks much of the health benefit of eating fruit in this product are outweighed by the chemical additives high fructose corn syrup and dextrose are in many many grocery products but they are not natural as this manufacturer claims both are chemicals manufactured in labs and are not easily digested by the body hfc as it is called has been linked in high quantities to escalating the onset of diabetes i have not tried this product so i ca n't comment on the taste i would like to try a dried fruit product one which is truly natural and not laden with chemical additives	8
0	i 've tried many of the yogi teas and i really do n't like the taste of this one i recommend the rejuvination tea it is a green tea that also fights free radicals and aging but it has a much smoother taste	8
0	i was really disappointed with this item especially as it 's nutrition info is really amazing it 's very gritty and strong tasting and did not blend well it 's also dark green which is n't a big deal for a lot of items but can turn things a very weird color depending on what you blend it with i am returning them as there are better tasting and equally nutritious protein powders available	8
0	i found these to be very dry and just taste like dates i like the raw revolution bars a lot better	8
0	pretty ok coffee nothing special but i suppose its a fair deal for the price we picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash and it has worked well for that but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice \) of course my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff so the comparison is not very fair	8
0	i'm not sure what i was expecting but this was n't it just tastes bad do n't know how else to describe it sorry but i could n't even get through one bag oh well	8
0	okay yes i know the brand is dr kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product however i have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita these are very crunchy and do n't have a whole lot of flavor additionally they were shipped and arrived expired if you are shopping for a super healthy cracker this may be it if you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita keep shopping this is not it my next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia	8
0	i did not get what i ordered in this case i got licorice but it was not the salt type i ordered	8
0	this snack \( lol \) tastes like cheese that had been baked in the oven for about a month kinda looks like it too make sure you have a beverage near by when you try them very very dry	8
0	i thought this might taste like parmeson crisps you get in restaurants i was wrong they taste burnt and are hard to swallow even when chewed thouroughly also still had quite a bit of sodium	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	this is the best coffee i 've ever had very smooth with rich flavor	8
0	peculiar unpleasant taste with an unnatural texture after trying one package it was so bad that i had to throw out the rest of the case a waste of money	8
0	i bought both the ahi tuna jerky and salmon jerky both were dried out and brittle absolutely the worst	8
0	do not buy this product i donated my entire box to the local food bank cream filling has some peculiar smell such that you will not feel like eating these cookies seriously stay away for this produc	8
0	this product is way too salty i did n't like it at all and neither did any of my family you ca n't get the taste out your mouth either after tasting one	8
0	while i personally love and eat tons of organic and natural foods i have to say the 30 i spent on this case of cookies was a waster neither of my children will eat them nor will i they have a smell that once you get in your nose hinders any attempt at enjoying the very small bit of flavor they have nature 's path makes great cereal and energy bars but fall short with these cookies stick with the chocolate or peanut butter and you are okay the honey grahams will sit in your cupboard until trash day	8

0	i ordered these and received less than 300 some of the packages had holes in them and melted bags i contacted the supplier and they did nothing to resolve the issue i would not order from them again	8
0	i have been an avid senseo fan for about a year however i was getting a bit bored drinking the same dark roast every morning \( i found the other flavors too mild \) so i was very happy when i saw the new flavors \( sumatra colombia kenya and brazil \) sumatra and columbia are the two that i liked i found the kenya blend to be mild and sweet even my wife who previously used hazelnut did not like it too much	8
0	i had to throw out almost all of these raisins because they contained crawly things and or what looks like the droppings of crawly things i must say i generally love newman 's products and i was willing to give these raisins the benefit of the doubt with natural products sometimes bugs get in them that 's part of the territory with organic matter but i found white grubs and little brown dots that were n't a part of the raisins in box after shrink wrapped box some boxes were fine and i ate the raisins in them but the majority were tainted i 'll need to be assured there 's been an improvement in quality control before i try newman 's snack pack organic raisins again	8
0	i am sensitive to wheat gluten and i swear this product has gluten everytime i eat a bowl of it i get sick i bought tons of this cereal because it does taste good but now i do n't know what to do with it because i ca n't eat it i think they must process this stuff on the same equipment as other wheat cerel somehow it is getting contaminated i wish i could send it back it is too bad because it is a good product it 's just not gluten free	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	great looking beans unfortunately the packages are also full of drug store beetles a common pantry pest i could see them as soon as i opened the box why did they not catch this at bob 's red mill	8
0	the product has way too much liquid good for in a pinch	8
0	i expected this flavor to be as good as their lemonada and tangerine strawberry but it did n't even come close	8
0	i did n't like this at all i found it chemical and not nicely redolent of the ginger i o so love i just gave it away cute little tin and all i am adventurous so i do happen on things i feel are n't what i expected from time to time this was certainly one of them i'm sure some of you will like like it do n't let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds mine said this tea is not a real peach either	8
0	i have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all however this sweet corn is all but sweet i would say it should be called salty corn i think they would have a great product if they did away with the salt also or change the name to salty corn cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company i dont think they would give the other products a try from there line myfavorite is cherry berry and orchard blend	8
0	i can hardly eat this for all of the salt it leaves you thirsty it 's so bad the ingredients list reads literally 100 organic sweet corn sea salt and nothing else they need to make it 100 organic sweet corn and nothing else and they 'd probably have something really great as it is i'm stuck with 23 1 2 bags of salty corn that i 'll have to give away	8
0	wo n't ship to hawaii hawaii is a state in the united states some seem to think it is a forign country damn fools !	8
0	you just throw this in the microwave and it 's ready in 60 seconds the drawback is that it is dry and essentially without much taste also the consistency is very slightly rubbery	8
0	all of the bags were stale however amazon 's customer service quickly corrected the issue by giving me a refund i think the whole batch was stale	8
0	it 's easier to make one from scratch and you electricity bill wo n't skyrocket	8
0	i beat this mix longer than the 10 minutes suggested and it was still too runny to even stay in my angelfood cake pan it baked flat a disgusting rubbery texture and was completely inedible when i very nicely wrote about my concerns and to request a product refund the customer service person said they could not give me a refund and said thank you for your understanding huh \? \? i 'll never purchase any more of their products	8
0	i purchased a case of angelfood cake and the first three i baked did n't turn out very well i ended up giving the other three boxes away	8
0	this cake mix was like water when i baked it it was like acake of paste ! ! itdid not bake well at all flat raw	8
0	there is n't much of a blend its just i think plain too spicy for a normal taste bud extremely hot for those of you who like it ! i like hot stuff but this is just too hot	8
0	the tea was good but i was looking for a box to keep around for a while and the felt lining hardly hides the fact that it 's a cheap particle board box	8
0	i have been disappointed with this product we have always enjoyed annie 's products have never had a problem until now the cheese was so solidly clumped that i was unable to make a sauce without lumps i have used 3 different packages from my order have had the problem with all of them i am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse either way beware	8
0	the roast is a light medium tried various grinds with my wega espresso machine does not have the body and character to make a good espresso beverage look for a darker roast makes a pretty good drip	8
0	these pods perform poorly in my espresso machine while ground beans perform very well it could be the filter for the pods but the espresso comes out uneven from the spouts and the flavor is not very strong	8
0	i ordered the corn on the cobb popcorn since i could not find it in phoenix anymore it tasted just like regular buttered popcorn in the past the popcorn literally tasted like corn on the cobb my family fought over it ! not anymore !	8
0	this tastes nothing like buttered corn on the cob in fact it tastes exactly like regular salted white popcorn with no butter on the positive side it 's not greasy but do n't expect anything exciting from the taste	8
0	i bought a whole box of these and they tasted really rancid they were several months from their expiration date so that was n't the problem maybe i just got a bad batch but i 'd be unlikely to ever try them again	8
0	i bought these simply because i wanted an easy snack and the reviews were pretty good i took two bites and stopped the second bite was because i really could n't believe that i disliked something that much the odor is pretty bad too these smell very medicinal almost like a commercial disenfectant next time you 're at a doctor 's office try licking the counter it 's like that not that i 've ever done that but i ca n't describe it any other way please try one of these locally if you can i would n't suggest buying them if you ca n't	8
0	i got this as a gift and as a person who appreciates fine teas this is undrinkable in fact it 's unsmellable i opened the tin and the smell was overpowering and clearly not natural smelled and tasted like handcream yes i actually tasted it furthermore the tea was practically a powder and the teabags were cheesy the quality you 'd find in a no name tea from the dollar store the tab simply said ceylon tea it looks like bentley got stuck with a load of crappy teabag seconds sprayed them with jasmine perfume and stuck them in a fancy tin i gave it one star for the tin if you have even the tiniest discrimination when it comes to tea do n't buy this one	8
0	this is the second batch i ordered i have had to contact representatives at brucepac both times to complain about the quality of the product and they have kindly send me replacement jerky i have enjoyed the same world kitchen jerky from other vendors so i cannot understand why the order from amazon has been such a disappointment	8
0	i ordered teriyaki original and black pepper flavored ones the other two flovors are quite good but this one teriyaki is really sub standard it has sandy texture and quality is very uneven compared to the others	8
0	when you have dirt in your food you have to wonder about what you are really eating otherwise the flavor was n't bad i just ca n't eat the dirt it 's bad for the teeth	8
0	way too sweet for beef jerky it was similar to drinking a soda	8
0	ok i bought their 4 bag combo special which feature all their flavors back when their site was taking orders direct this jerky is not very good in fact i threw away about half of it because some of the pieces where very thick and hard kind of like eating leather and plastic mixed in together trust me when people say this there is much better jerky out there i even e mailed the company and told them that i was very unsasfied with thier jerky they offered me a refund and i should of taken it but i decided not to	8
0	i tossed it out the texture is aweful and brittle only a few pieces were over 2 inches long and there was some sand like grit making it completely unedible gross ! you get what you pay for	8
0	it 's not terrible but it 's not very good for the price you can go to your grocery store and get one that is just as good if not better i sent 8 of the 9 packets back	8
0	i have never eaten these because well they 're not vegan they are in amazon 's vegan section however whey is not vegan it is the very first ingredient	8
0	i love the flavor of this sauce but it rarely arrives undamaged packaging needs to contain a little tlc then it would be 5 stars do n't order if you need this for a certain dinner it may not arrive usable	8
0	i 've purchased this locally and it was delicious so i was happy to see a deal offered by amazon unfortunately it never made it to my door ups reported that the sauce was leaking out of the box and returned the package to amazon this seems to match what many other reviewers said	8
0	first quality tomato products should never be packed in plastic the high acidity may cause the plastic to leech into the food then these are pooly packed by amazon 2 orders both arrived cracked open as amazon just throws them in a box so they crack and make a nasty mess as for the sauce well it tastes fine but i think it is not well balanced very acidic we feel horrible after eating it for hours simple good ingredients so i'm not sure what it making us feel sick	8
0	but i may never know i ordered this item on october 27 when a shipment finally arrived there was only one container of this inside ! i ordered a four pack i'm sure so amazon offered to try again sending the item but it 's now november 30th the item has been in stock the whole time so i'm not sure what has caused the delay i'm just thankful i ordered it just to try it out and that i did n't actually need it by any certain date	8
0	i 've ordered this item twice from amazon and both times all of the plastic jars were smashed inside the packing box	8
0	i di n't love these at all the flavor combinations struck me as off there was no improvement in the pistachio taste by adding harissa also the texture was unpleasant somewhat soggy i like the healthy aspect but if you are n't enjoying the experience why eat at all	8
0	hello i have not received this item please send me the delivery receipt details	8
0	got a deal on the machine and love the concept but every senseo coffee i have tasted has been absolutely horrible i 've tried 4 oz with one pod way too bitter so 8 oz with 1 pod still the most awful coffee i 've ever had normally i drink gevalia but i use folgers sometimes or millstone i do n't think i could drink this stuff on a regular basis if someone paid me of all the purchases i 've made at amazon this has been the first time i 've ever felt compelled to give feedback that in itself speaks volumes	8
0	i ordered the chocolate mint variety amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly however i ordered the cookies in early november and they arrived with a best when used by date of december 4 2006 they will expire less than a month after they arrived ! i'm not sure if this is amazon 's fault or not the cookies are shipped in the manufacturer 's back to nature box so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on amazon com	8
0	i have to second the other reviewer 's comments about the partially hydrogenated oil that kellog 's is using in kid cereal ! \? ! \? it is the year 2006 time to start making these cereals healthy and without trans fat ridden cheap oils ! ! ! !	8
0	i was going to buy these until i saw that they contained trans fats \( partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in cocoa crispies fruit loops and corn pops \) who wants to send their kids off to school loaded up with deadly trans fats \?	8
0	i thought they had a stale texture and they did n't have enough salt ener g does make a type of sesame pretzel that is incredible but these are n't it hope this helps all the gluten free people like me	8
0	i'm sorry to give this a poor review but tea has to taste good in order for me to drink it i often drink a large variety of bedtime teas and have never tasted any tea this awful i ca n't speak for how well it works because i could n't drink the whole cup even though i attempted to force myself yogi makes some good teas but this i just could n't stomach	8
0	the sell by date on a package was less than a month so that they would not go bad i felt like i needed to personally eat more than i would have i have a retail store and i need a bit more time on new products this was a costly mistake also the wholesale price from the business itself was the same as amazon 's price except amazon gave free shipping and a discount coupon worth ten bucks ! cool deal beans amazon ! as a retailer i would think that i would be able to get a better deal from betty lou 's or get a reasonable sell by date very tasty and addicting	8
0	you have to really like spirulina to enjoy these the entire center is green too strong for my taste try the almond butter balls they are delicious	8
0	terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top the flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and i wondered what i was eating ! alone they were nearly tasteless and i 'll never purchase again yuck	8
0	i am a huge special k fan especially red berry but at heart i am a chocoholic i was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and i ran right out to try it it is your average special k flakes but with the addition of chocolate pieces the problem is they leave a horrible waxy coating in your mouth because of the poor quality chocolate i am sure this is because it has to stay healthy but i would rather have a fat free chocolate jello 100 calorie pack then deal with the feeling it leaves in your mouth so back to red berry for me	8
0	this is a strong blend when i want a cup of decaf i usually want a milder blend and after a cup or two of this blend i still seem to get jittery i question whether or not it is truly decaffeinated	8
0	the product is fine but the description is misleading each package contains 40 count that is 40 filters but this is not a \( pack of 12 \) as you would think from the description from the price reduction \( from 23 88 to 1 93 \) and from the shipping weight \( 4 20 lbs \) it 's just one box of 40 filters and you 'll pay as i did 11 for fedex to bring you this one box soon after i submitted this feedback i was issued a partial refund of 7 product description still needs correcting but at least customer service was responsive	8
0	the oatmeal tastes okay but the purchaser should be aware that this is not an instant version of mccann 's irish steel cut oatmeal the oatmeal it is famous for i thought mccann 's only sold steel cut oatmeal but it also apparently sells the regular type of instant oatmeal that is flavored i would not buy this again since the steel cut oatmeal is what i prefer and is much better for you	8
0	in amazon 's ultimate wisdom they will not return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in beta status i ordered the apple cinnamon in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone i 'd avoid the amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards	8
0	these were horrible i thought i 'd try raw foods and i amde a big mistake	8
0	is n't very tasty falls apart when taking a bite not recommended	8
0	i tried really hard to like this stuff you know organic and all that the elbow macaroni is fine but the sauce is gummy pasty and tastes like cheez whiz if you like cheez whiz you will love this mac cheez if not pass it by i 'd have given it to mikey but he does n't live at our house anymore my recommendation is to make your own from scratch it 's not that difficult and it 's so much better	8
0	there are bugs in the tea bags now these are n't the 'organic' bugs you find in your garden when you plant veggies these are the bugs that dig into expired produce there are about 4 5 bugs in each bag if you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go to bed this is the product to buy also the tea bags are n't made from organdy it 's some sort of plastic polyester i burnt a bag and it melted turned black and glued onto itself horrible unethical company	8
0	reminds me of the fruit bars from my childhood that first came out around the time fruit roll ups did they seem to have some kind of strong odor to them but if you can get past that they do n't taste so bad	8
0	yeah so i really do not like this one bit the 'cheese' is horrid dose not taste like real cheese the noodles are ok a little soggy but ok and it leaves a nice layer of starch in your mouth as rachal ray wouldsay 'yumo ! 'anyway i hate it and spirals depress me	8
0	this type of mac cheese pasta does n't produce as much as the elbow mac cheese other than that it tastes the same good stuff	8
0	last time i order this sort of thing online i realize that 'raisins' was the first ingredient but they were n't even good raisins and the raisins outnumber everything else by a good margin it 's basically raisin and banana with a few other things thrown in the coconut is an afterthought and completely tasteless the sunflower seeds settled to the bottom it 's edible but it does n't taste especially good and 'tropical' is definitely misleading	8
0	i was a bit disappointed in these they crumble very easily and have an unusual texture my son \( 6 \) does not like them	8
0	this peanut butter tastes even worse than regular creamy skippy a lack of flavor and dry texture makes me wonder if by palm oil they meant to write socks thoroughly disappointing i only finished the one jar i bought because peanut butter is a staple in my diet and i was n't about to waste it buy the real all natural peanut butters or even the cheap store brand which contains fully hydrogenated oils which are fine for you unlike partially hydrogenated ones	8
0	tastes just like regular skippy i e unnatural texture because it contains palm oil	8
0	this is not a natural peanut butter the listed ingredients are peanuts sugar palm oil and salt natural peanut butter such as smucker 's and whole foods contain only peanuts and salt palm oil is not a healty oil and is not recommended for cholesterol patients	8
0	i drink all types of teas but this is one of the worst tasting teas in my opinion	8
0	please be careful i did not read the product description so i do not know if they mentioned this but kava can cause severe liver toxicity even without prior liver damage please consult your physician before taking this or any other supplement ! thanks	8
0	i bought this tea because my job was stressing me out and causing a lot of anxiety indigestion etc and i use and love the other flavors of yogi tea unfortunately i ca n't handle the taste of this one it 's just too strong almost burns your tongue because it is so spicy i normally like ginger but this is too much	8
0	i 've only been on a gluten free diet for four months so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid the worst part is that amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this i 'd put it out for the squirrels but i'm not sure they 'd eat it if you 're expecting something that tastes anything like bread you 're in for a shock	8
0	this bar would be great if it was n't so full of sugar it gives me a sugar headache	8
0	i wanted to like this bar because it 's high in protein and fiber but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars \( 31g ! \) it 's much too sweet if they took away some of the sugar it might be edible	8
0	my wife and two year old like this cereal however i find them to be extremely crunchy and unpleasant to eat i prefer the purely o 's just wish they came in an eco pack	8
0	although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes drinks our experience is it wo n't dissolve without a blender simply put it clumps the taste is fine actually good so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement	8
0	without any sulfites preservatives hydrogenated oils artificial colors or flavors but not without a great deal of sugar and high fructose corn sweetener like the previous reviewer i bought these at costco brought them back due to the sickly sweet taste there was so much added sugar it was getting a little difficult to taste the berries if you prefer berries au naturel or with just a little extra sweetness watch the ingredient list on these sugar is the second ingredient by weight and corn syrup is the fourth	8
0	the quality of this tea is not very good especially compared to other superb teas by two leaves and a bud mostly powder inside the bag and has a very strong grassy smell and somewhat bitter aftertaste on top of that it took 2 weeks for amazon to deliver it	8
0	sadly this is pretty crummy tea for decent orange pekoe i remain sold on typhoo	8
0	i was excited to try this product as i love oreos but do n't like all the garbage that goes into them we tried newman o 's originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all still i had to see for myself we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as oreo cookies for some reason others seem to think they taste great just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large	8
0	i did n't like them too sweet and sticky my dog likes them though these just did n't do it for me	8
0	donot buy it i got the stuff even past the expiration day	8
0	amazon shipped me a replacement for this order which was 7 months past the sell by date on the package the replacement was eight months past due yuck i wo n't even bother calling them on it i just wo n't buy any food product from amazon hey guys these things aren t books ! ! ! they go bad	8
0	ingredients high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oil do a search and see what you think i wo n't touch this stuff	8
0	i was so very disappointed with this cereal it 's taste is very sweet if you look at the ingredients it 's filled with sugar corn syrup and and more sugar i counted 12 ingredients that were really just forms of sugar ! it is also loaded with salt i would give this zero stars if i could because it has more sugar than most sweet cereals why mislead the public into thinking they are making a healthy choice when all you are doing is serving sugar with a new label and adding a little bit of soy to the package \? absolutely ridiculous	8
0	as another viewer pointed out this product contains corn syrup not at all organic in fact the only organic thing in this product is the fig for those of us trying to maintain a healthy organic eating lifestyle you must read the list of ingredients before assuming the front label is accurate this goes for all products not at all an attack against paul newman products which my family does consume we enjoy their products that are truly organic	8
0	contrary to the maker 's claims this product is not made with whole grain flour instead the first listed ingredient is organic unbleached wheat flour an unhealthful refined carbohydrate the product is sweetened with common refined cane sugar and corn syrup all things considered this product is nutritionally equivalent to common grocery store fig newtons except for the claim that it 's organic snacks like this could be made with healthful nutritious ingredients unfortunately this one is not i would not choose to buy it again instead of this junk snack i would choose barbara 's whole wheat fig bars which are made with real whole grains and sweetened with fruit juices	8
0	bought dozens of different varieties of these all arrived way past expiration date and were terribly stale do n't chance it i'm not the only customer who has had this problems with these products	8
0	t may be expresso grind but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker think again bitter when drunk on own marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino i shoulda known betta	8
0	i was very disappointed in the taste of this item not at all what i expected from splenda it is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste for instance if added to coffee you will not detect any coffee flavor only the splenda flavor much too strong i prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this splenda product without question !	8
0	i really like splenda but this hazelnut flavor has a distinctly over chemicaled taste and just does n't have much nuttiness to it perhaps the other flavors are better	8
0	i'm afraid i disagree with the other two reviews i thought this pasta was extremely bland and not very close to what wheat pasta tastes like it does take longer to cook and you have to add oil to the water and stir it quite frequently or it clumps and sticks together terribly it 's an ok substitute but there are much better gluten free pastas out there although the glutino is cheaper i personally like orgran pasta 100 times better	8
0	the almonds are slightly seasoned with a 'barbecue' kind of flavoring which is subtle but nice the cashews on the other hand are hard to believe the taste conjures up images for me of them being stored in semi pervious containers in the paint and finishing room of my high school industrial arts class they are really awful and any lover of cashews will be appalled	8
0	i would n't describe this jerky as shredded but instead as powdered it 's not something you can tap into your hand and eat like a snack the best use we found was to pour one of the little tubes onto a salad for added protein still it had a fairly short shelf life for jerky the unopened tubes had gone bad \( mold \? or something \? ick \) within about 3 months	8
0	i 've tried this twice now and both times it had an off taste a bit rancid like it had been stored for too long at too high a temperature i 'd guess that amazon 's transport or storage has a problem they need to work out	8
0	i normally buy special k cereal i found these boxes to be stale	8
0	it 's not the regular strong earl grey twinings i come to love this version lacks strength and flavor two teabags are needed for regular strength tea it 's even states on the box light flavour strenght \( 2 leaves out of five \) beware !	8
0	my tea came after three weeks and it was only one pack instead of six i called and complained and the following week got another one pack instead of six that is all i ever received and my money was refunded do n't really know what happened never got an explanation from the distributor	8
0	it is not the wonderful twinings earl grey you have come to know and love they have pulled a new coke blunder and now the best earl grey tea ever is available no more ! this tea is weak and tasteless i hate stupidity especially from corporate marketers	8
0	the newly re packaged twinings earl grey tea \( has the word classics on the package \) is much much weaker than the previous twinings earl grey tea if you used and like to the old teas then you wo n't like the new version i wonder if they have weakened the britsh version of twinings earl grey tea	8
0	i did not enjoy this soup i will try a different brand next time	8
0	i love most jack links jerky products however i was disappointed with this product though it had all the heat the flavor was lacking true pepper taste it tasted like a bunch of powdered old hot spices not a true fresh pepper cure i think the mistake most people make with hot peppers is not removing the seeds before using as this can give a bitter as well as hot taste i have not given up on jack links just ordered their turkey jerky	8
0	i was very disappointed with this product i was sure i had tried cherries from this company but these had an off flavor were extremely sweet i gave away the 4 bags i bought	8
0	i bought this item thinking i was getting a healthy snack the fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup and it is extremely sweet not healthy	8
0	the cherries are listed as natural on the packaging there is nothing natural about high fructose corn syrup i am returning them	8
0	i thought these would be slightly sour like dried cherries i have enjoyed in the past no hfcs is high fructose corn syrup so these taste strangely sweet like weird raisins they are ok if i cook them in oatmeal or if i'm really hungry but i would n't buy them again if you are looking for tart dried cherries look elsewhere	8
0	this biscotti is just awful too sweet and too hard la tempesta is a real biscotti	8
0	although i love the nana 's brownie mint and peanut butter flavor cookies i found the ginger cookie disappointing it was too spicy to be enjoyable and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors \( the crumbliness is due to the gluten free rice flour \) also the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors i 've had 360 calories per cookie compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories note that nana 's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving but they count a serving size as half a cookie	8
0	i purchased two of these packages in mid jan 2007 i have only finished one box \( of four \) and am finding about 1 out of 4 packets have caked due apparently to a small air leak in the packet so moisture can get in \( only my personal theory \) i just pound on the packet with a knife handle to break it up and use it anyway but it is a problem and they have known about it now for a long time seems like they would have solved the problem	8
0	5 stars for the stevia product natural delicious ! 0 stars for amazon 's inability to correctly store this item in their warehouses i experienced the same trouble as other reviewers packets showing up hard and useless when purchased in the store i have never had one hard or brittle packet do n't bother purchasing from amazon instead head to your local trader joe 's where you can purchase 100 packets for 5 99 not the fiber supplement type but does n't clump and more per packet amazon really should n't even bother selling this product if the stevia shows up ruined	8
0	i ordered enough stevia packets to last me for 1 year most of the packets have the sugar hardened every so often i am finding one that is powder as it should be the others must have gotten some kind of moisture to them because they are hard i will never buy stevia from the company i purchased from again i do n't have the receipt or i would have returned them asking for a refund i have been upset about the way they came	8
0	i drink lavazza coffee nearly every morning at a local restuarant when i saw this on amazon i assumed it would be great but it is n't even though this is sold as drip grind coffee the grind is way too coarse for a drip coffee maker the result is that you need to use nearly twice as much coffee to get a decent cup and decent is as good as it gets not great not even very good just decent illy 's \( admittedly much more expensive \) drip grind delivers a much nicer smoother cup using 1 2 as much coffee so mabye it 's not all that much more expensive in the long run	8
0	i 've purchased this sauce at a retail bakery and it was fabulous i 've ordered it several times here and it never arrives usable jars are always smashed guess i 'll have to continue to buy it at a store very dissappointed ! !	8
0	it arrived rancid with mold in all 4 jars not so great i have purchased there other products and enjoyed but not this pretty gross overall	8
0	i bought this thinking it was going to be a good healthy snack of raspberries i was surely mistaken the raspberries are coated with sugar and other syrupy stuff and it tastes like you are eating gummy bears ! gross	8
0	received shipment early january of 2007 to find out the expiration date was in 2006 buyer bewar	8
0	i recently tried this cookie and the ginger flavor they were both disgusting the texture was similar to a protein bar the flavor of the chocolate one was very weak contrary to the label which states that it has a rich chocolate flavor the other one was very spicy with no sweetness to cut the spice not a pleasant experience i did n't finish either of them	8
0	this stuff tastes great but after doing some research it 's got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy the first item on the list \( which means that it is the highest mass ingredient \) is partially hydrogenated oils if you have any problems with cholesterol i suggest talking to your doctor or maybe you might want to be like many americans and just increase your lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers godspeed	8
0	amazon never sent the correct order i spend 2 hours on the phone trying to get them to send the right item i eventually had to decline the order on the 3rd time not getting the correct amount of pop tarts they kept sending once box when i was supposed to get 12	8
0	like the idea of getting some samples but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles do not buy	8
0	wish i would have paid attention to this one the the previous review the cost for what you get is outrageous only reason i gave it one star is because there was no place to give is zero starts do n't waste your money like i did ! ! ! find a more economical product \( plenty more choices on amazon btw \)	8
0	the price for this and all other 100 calorie packs is for one box this means you are paying almost two dollars per ounce this is the most ridiculous sham i have ever encountered the difference in price between this item on amazon and this item in a grocery store is outrageous \( this costs over ten dollars more here than at the grocery store ! ! ! !	8
0	sorry guys i do n't know if i was n't tasting real miso soup at my local restaurant but the thing is i did n't like this one bit and i still have lots of packages left ! haha i gave it a chance because i love the soup from the japanese restaurant i visited and i wanted to taste this soup whenever i wanted at home but i did n't like the flavor do n't know if i'm missing something but better buy one \( one \) a see for yourself	8
0	i had the exact same experience as heather shown below they sent me the less expensive non organic version of this product twice and then informed me that they could n't guarantee when the problem would be fixed remember that strawberries and cherries are on every list for crops containing the most pesticide now add that freeze dried snacks are concentrated finally take these concentrated levels and place them in a small child or toddler 's body and their pesticide exosure goes through the roof do the math note to amazon this is a great product with fruit and nothing else in its ingredients please retain it and get it right to benefit the scores of us that enjoy providing healthy treats for our kids	8
0	i was looking forward to this item but i was sent the cheaper non organic version twice amazon informed me that they could n't guarantee when the problem would be fixed if someone orders this and gets the organic version please post i 'd love to buy these in the future !	8
0	these things are just plain disgusting if you are ever in need of emegency rope get these but otherwise i doubt they are fit for human consumption it feels and tastes like eating soft plastic and i would hate to think what they do to your insides i have battled to even give some of these away so they ended up in the trash can where they rightfully belong	8
0	i'm sorry but what on god 's green earth are these people talking about when they say the highest quality wholesome ingredients \? \? \? the first ingredient listed is corn syrup followed closely by sugar god i'm livid corn is a subsidized crop in this country and corn syrup is a major culprit in the obesity epidemic spare yourself eat a damn piece of fruit many thanks the food zealo	8
0	order arrive in good time the tea is not flavored enough with the vanilla can not taste or smell the vannilla	8
0	i do n't recommend any of baxter 's soups these are terrible a waste of money will not buy again amazon i'm beginning to see why item 's are on sale you want to get rid of them zero stars	8
0	kind of fishy tasting with a few potatoes floating in it along with a few green herbs not worth the price its not awful but not great eithe	8
0	it almost seems like i received a different soup based on the other 5 star reviews the broth is thin mostly cubed potatoes and very fishy smelling do n't get me wrong it was edible but i wo n't be ordering another case of this flavor i'm still waiting to receive the mushroom and blue cheese flavors	8
0	although the product is very easy to use and the rice sticks together perfectly to make a sushi roll the rice is tasteless because it has neither mirin vinegar nor sugar nor salt in it \( commonly called sushi vinegar \) the nori wrappers are too small to make any decent sized roll and too thin to withstand any handling i have had better sushi rolls at the worst japanese restaurant the soy sauce is ok but without wasabi mustard you cannot achieve the taste of real sush	8
0	these are a little mealy or grainy but are ok pretty high in carbs though	8
0	if you really like chinese food you might like this chicken stew however it was much too sweet tasting for my tastes the main reason that i give it 2 stars is that it contains the artificial sweetner splenda \( see sucralose in the ingredients \) but that is not advertised anywhere on the package besides the small print in the ingredient list i personally do n't eat or drink products that contain artificial sweetners for various reasons and had i known the product contained splenda i would n't have purchased it honestly it has the typical splenda after taste	8
0	i too like the old smucker 's filled strawberry better \( aka fruit wheats \) this is ok but fruit filling is better they probably switched because it got to expensive to make unless they starting making in china thus you now have this nestle quick artificial strawberry tasting stuff	8
0	i wish that kellogg 's would return to the previous style of these the strawberry filled mini wheats the raisin filled and the blueberry filled were much better than these frosted varieties	8
0	bob 's red mill roasted oregon hazelnuts tasted stale and over cooked this is not a quality product and not good value for the money do n't waste your money on this item	8
0	my product should have been delivered a month ago this is very bad buisness to think that you can ship something whenever you feel like it i am a paying customer that should have been reinbursed in some way for the mistake that your copany made	8
0	i bought two flavors of gloria jeans k cups i loved the price the coffee is wonderful \( ! \) but i hate getting grounds in my coffee ! i 've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds under the filter so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup about a 1 2 teaspoon per cup lower price poorer manufacturing standards	8
0	these were a sticky mess in the bag the fruit juice leaked from the lollypops and leaked out of the plastic wrap they were also soft and seemed stale great ingredients but the final product was disappointing	8
0	i was trying these as a change of pace from the turkey jerky i normally eat they taste ok \( nothing special \) but several of the medallions \( in at least 3 bags so far \) had 'crunchy' bits in them i suspect it was gristle or possibly small bone fragments not pleasant to eat i may have just gotten a bad batch \( other than the crunchy bits i 'd give these a 4 star rating \)	8
0	i had tried this tea before purchasing a large quantity from amazon what i received was disappointing i suspect old stock that was no longer fresh i will not purchase tea from amazon again since you were not willing to accept a return	8
0	that about says it all this cereal is just too sweet their flax cereal is better	8
0	not only is the popcorn incredibly salty but they do not taste very crispy quite stale overall disappointing i sent my stuff overseas with delivery within 4 days after receiving them so it is not that i kept them too long too bad they are too far to return overall a disappointing experience	8
0	i first bought chipotle flavor and love that one that is my favorite flavor the gouda flavor is much too salty for my taste so i will not buy this flavor again the quality of the popcorn and amount you get in this product is excellent i will be trying other flavors in future just not this one	8
0	granola was very dry and not too sweet need milk i prefer costco 's granola it taste much better i would not recommend the purchase of this product now i got to find way to get rid of the other 5 packages also bought the fruit and nut one hope that 's better	8
0	these are fine if they were n't supposed to have blueberries there are essentially none most pouches of the 24 do n't even contain a piece of blueberry when you do find one it 's a very nice taste with the peanut but sadly that 's very rare avoid this variety	8
0	these were the absolute worst crackers i have ever tasted if styrofoam could be served in a box it would taste like these save your money	8
0	i bought a case they expire in one month they taste great but shame on amazon i also bough butter rounds they expired last year	8
0	the main ingredient should be salt ! 750mg per serving and there are 2 servings per can come on we usually sweat or need more salt in the summer but we tend to eat more soup in the winter my first impression was boy this is salty it would be great as a gravy but so is a much cheaper cambell 's cream of mushroom	8
0	this pack of mac and cheese had an expiration date of 10 31 06 not that we 're talking about the most nutritious food to start out with anyway but i hate paying for items at near their expiration date i expected some reasonable amount of shelf life	8
0	this jello cheesecake mix is not nearly as tasty as their sugar free banana cream mix \( that one tastes like real banana cream ! \) this mix does not have the flavour of cheesecake and also has a vague chemically taste	8
0	i was disappointed with this powder i thought it would give food a taste similar to using vanilla extract but it does n't when used in liquid it tends to sink to the bottom as it does not stay evenly mixed i wo n't buy it again i prefer using vanilla extract	8
0	pro no trans fat con no flavor basically tastes like cardboard my children wo n't eat it	8
0	when you can buy a 40 oz jar at the local grocery store for 4 59	8
0	i would love to have the above item actually really wanted it so much that i called about it twice both times i was sent 6 oz packages of pecans that i could have \( but probably would not have \) bought in any store my husband is extremely fond of the canned pecans and was very excited when i told him i had located them on line i do n't have to tell you the disappointment when we were sent the others sorry but i 'll have to really research the product before i order again ms judie cardwel	8
0	this product came to me packed in bags not cans disappointed	8
0	i ordered this mocha java because the green mountain brand was not available there is no comparison i am very disappointed in the flavor of this coffe	8
0	i thought these muffins tasted like white rice bread which is n't very tasty i 've made my own muffins mixing brown rice flour tapioca flour and potato starch flour and they are a million times better wo n't buy these again i expected these to be as close to the real thing as the glutino crackers are to regular crackers \( not the tomato basil but the plain ones \) but they were n't	8
0	the title is wrong this item contains twelve 5 grams \( 0 0175 ounce \) packets not twelve 5 ounce packets	8
0	i would n't buy it again i like to try to new things and i had never had this before but it was n't that good yes my crew ate it they eat almost anything this is n't moving	8
0	i am always looking for quality nutricious treats for my teens i bought the samplers to see if anyone had a favorite sorry to say that we just did not like any of these a little too spicy and we were looking for crunch and got chewy	8
0	i should have listened to the reviews this is not a good product and will not buy again	8
0	i bought this item thinking i was getting a healthy snack the fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup and it is extremely sweet not health	8
0	these apples are coated in sugar and other gunk \( like sunflower oil \) which gives them a strange taste i was very disappointed when i tried them i was wanting nice dried apples that taste like apples instead of oil sugar and preservatives now i'm stuck with two bags of a product that is not very good i also got stuck with the dried strawberries which are even worse i will not be trying any more stoneridge orchard products be aware ! ! these products cannot be returned to amazon so be sure before you order	8
0	soft chewy a little grainy but a good flavor mine were expired a week after i bought a whole 12 pack \( do n't expect whole berries basically everything is ground together odwalla bar is much better definitely try the spirelina balls though a little bit of a green flavor the energy ginsing one is well worth the cost here and not almost expired	8
0	these may be healthy but you 'll have to force yourself to eat it it tastes like paste with some fruit i would give them one star but i give them some credit for trying to make something healthy	8
0	i purchased diamond pecans in their shells in december '06 \( note not these already shelled ones \) and discovered after the kids were eating them that they were all rancid be sure and check the dates \( if you can there were n't any on the in shell nuts \) because there 's not much worse than ruining whatever you 're trying to make with rancid nuts i have learned to only purchase pecans from places with dates on the package or where i can smell and taste them	8
0	perhaps it was just my microwave or cooking it too long but the two different types of this soup i have tried \( chicken with noodles and chicken with rice \) have both left a nasty metallic taste in my mouth that is very hard to get rid of i would have thrown it out except it was the only thing i brought for lunch i do not recommend this soup	8
0	i could not believe how disgusting this product was i do not think it should be given a star at all i most certainly will not buy any of these products again \( i also bought the coconut balls \) this was such a waste of my money	8
0	i do agree that the quality is nothing to sneeze at these fill me up i know that they 're pretty good for you and i like the nutty essence too i guess that i really was disappointed in the taste though the chocolate was slightly bitter tasting and took me by surprise i love the other flavors but this one is my leat favorite i would recommend the almond butter balls before this one they 're soft and a little more on the sweet side	8
0	i eat pretty healthy and i'm always looking for new healthy snacks especially sweet ones ! ! but this purchase was a real disappointment the quality and quantity were fine but the taste was totally lacking if you 've ever had dr fuhrman 's date nut pop'ems this product is nothing like those i would say the primary taste is ground flax seed not a bad taste kind of mild but certainly does n't satisfy a sweet tooth	8
0	i read in a review that if you are on a blood thinner that this tea is not good for you what does it do that makes it unhealthy \? thin the blood more \? it did n't seem to affect my protime but i'm concerned	8
0	i bought these because they are described as 100 all natural dry roasted almonds now i read the label states that these contain maltodextrin modified potato starch sugar msg autolyzed yeast extract modified corn syrup solids modified corn starch salt	8
0	i was disappointed with this product i love dried fruit but this product is overly sweet and does not have much strawberry taste they have a strange smell but not a nice strawberry smell they are very dark in color and moist from sunflower oil simple dried fruit without the oil and fructose additions would be much nicer you should also know that this food product cannot be returned i would have sent it back in a flash if i could have	8
0	ok so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty they also have a burnt flavor you could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order on the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good this is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first \( instead of buying 12 bags \) also note grocery items cannot be returned to amazon	8
0	i think that this mix does not taste as good or prepare as quickly as the liptun cajun rice and beans \( 6 4 oz \) not at all	8
0	this is a terrible tasting bar i have tried many raw bars and this one is by far the worst i 've ever tasted it leaves an after taste	8
0	worst tasting nutrition bar i have ever had and i 've probably tried over100 different kinds this one tastes like soap	8
0	this type of machine just cannot make good espresso espresso must be made with a fine grind of beans correct temperature of water and high water pressure to extract the right amount of flavor from the beans for the right amount of time with a quick no fuss machine like the tassimo some of these ingredients are missing from this machine 's process so the espresso turns out rather sour adding the latte milk covers up the worst of it but it 's not a great latte either stick with regular coffee in the tassimo and although it 's not wonderful either it might get you through the morning	8
0	i suppose everyone who does gluten free baking is always searching for the holy grail that would make gf products have the same texture as non gf products this gluten substitute is not worth the effort save your money !	8
0	two of the six packages were beginning to mold but not even close to the expiration date one other package was visibly torn i was curious to see if any of the packs were still sealed air tight so i placed them in water five of the packs were exposed to air with small opening around the seal i imagine that they burst somewhere in their travels from changes in altitude pressure i cannot vouch for the actually taste of the product as i did not eat them the silver lining amazon has great customer service	8
0	the online product description lists the only ingredient as 100 natural cherries i ordered the product and discovered that it also contains sugar and sunflower oil buyer beware ! a better cherry choice is melissa 's dried cherries they do not contain any added sugar or oil	8
0	my own fault for not reading the ingredients but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading basically it 's a 10 bag of blueberry candy high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient oil and flavoring also added i do n't have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after i ate it i actually had to brush my teeth twice this product should not be in the natural and organic category do n't waste your money	8
0	i love blueberries both fresh and dried but these have sugar added which makes them far too sweet for my taste dried fruit is always naturally sweet added sweeteners just turn them into pure candy instead of a naturally healthy snack thumbs down for this one	8
0	i was excited to get these but did not read the ingrediants before purchasing big mistake to me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting i dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids the high fructose is insane and really i feel they would be better off with a fraction of what they add	8
0	beyond the glaring fact that most of their products are n't tomatoes this one is a blight on the just tomatoes ethos just but it has two ingredients it 's not just anything if it includes both bananas strawberries they do n't call cracker jack just peanuts popcorn and high fructose corn syrup nor is it just something when it comes in a package of 2 they do n't call a variety pack of cereal just grains and high fructose corn syrup the just tomatoes folks deserve credit for their aspirations to purity but this just goes beyond it it goes against the mimalist and reductive concept to the absolutely roccoco it 's just not right	8
0	there is no doubt that this tea does it 's job but the smell of it is awful i normally do n't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things but i have such an aversion to the smell of this tea it has a top note of moldy dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad the box says that it contains delicious sasparilla i do n't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all if you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it	8
0	i tried one bite of this cracker and had to throw it away for fear of cracking my teeth buy the wasa 7 grain instead the 7 grain is light and crispy	8
0	this bar would be great if it was n't so full of sugar it gives me a sugar headache	8
0	i wanted to like this bar because it 's high in protein and fiber but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars \( 31g ! \) it 's much too sweet if they took away some of the sugar it might be edible	8
0	not great coffee rocamojo and puravida which amazon also sells is so much better and those are n't great just good this is cheap coffee and tastes like it i ca n't complain much at about 3 a pound but it 's just ok drinkable but would n't buy again	8
0	i made the mistake of purchasing this 12 pack without testing it at the stores first due to glowing reviews on this site i have a sweet tooth but these were so sweet that it was nauseating i could n't taste any caramel or other flavor just straight sugar if you are considering this product and have n't tasted it before i highly recommend you purchase a small bag first so you do n't waste your money	8
0	i thought i was getting a mix of some sort this is just an expensive condiment	8
0	the quality of this tea is far below that of other matcha 's i have tried the packaging alone is careless and does not bespeak of the tender care that is typically given to green tea particularly the fine powder i would not purchase this product again the quantity that i do have i will cut with other better tea rather than waste it if you do try this product use care opening the package because the tea is inside without any barrier to keep it from spilling	8
0	this so called treasure is not a treasure at all a big disappointment	8
0	i'm sorry but these just were n't for me they have somewhat of a stale taste i recommend buying a single bag before buying a case if you are at all hesitant	8
0	i accidently picked these i really wanted the hot fries these just are not as good i guess if you like cheddar they are okay	8
0	this is just like cup noodles without the noodles eek	8
0	very sad to say that this is salty no i mean salty ! will try something else for my son annie please make these less salty and i will try them again	8
0	too salty for me there is a better brand out there	8
0	this stuff tastes absolutely terrible ! steer clear and do n't be mislead by the texture review below yup the texture is great but it the taste makes you gag it definately is n't worth it	8
0	i was excited to try this product as i love oreos but do n't like all the garbage that goes into them we tried newman o 's originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all still i had to see for myself we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as oreo cookies for some reason others seem to think they taste great just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large	8
0	they sounded good but are n't tart enough for my taste and are prepared with too much sugar	8
0	these dried cherries are more like candy than dried fruit i was expecting a chewy tart treat and got an instant sugar high instead i will use the rest of the cherries in salads or on cereal but i wo n't buy them again	8
0	i was very disappointed when i received the dried cherries i did not realize that they included sugar and sunflower oil when i opened the package you could feel the oil on the cherries i had to rinse them in hot water before i could use them this information is not included anywhere in the description	8
0	in amazon 's ultimate wisdom they will not return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in beta status i ordered these in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone i 'd avoid the amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards	8
0	i thought this would be a great tasting healthy snack after reading the reviews mine arrived safely and crunchy unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch however they were not sweet and tasty my sister described it as tasting like cardboard now i have 5 whole bags i do n't know what to do with maybe i 'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better if you can i 'd recommend try before you buy	8
0	do not buy crunchies products in the hot summer months they are heat sensitive as the packaging states important store in cool dry area the two cases i purchased arrived chewy and clumped together they probably cooked during shipping and are not a raw food and not as nutritious anymore two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened amazon com does not accept grocery returns it was a waste of 40	8
0	i bought two flavors of gloria jeans k cups i loved the price the coffee is good but i hate getting grounds in my coffee ! i 've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds under the filter so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup about a 1 2 teaspoon per cup lower price poorer manufacturing standards	8
0	why did they have to add coconut to these snack bars \? they would have been great without the coconut and now i find out i ca n't return them and i'm stuck with them if you want them let me know i 'll trade you for some decent granola bars	8
0	not my favorite of their products the rasins are hard and sometimes burnt it takes to long to soften	8
0	i ordered this brand because it had the least amount of sugar the cherries were gritty \( dirty \? sand \? \) and did not have the tart taste of locally purchased dried cherries now i'm stuck with a whole box of them that no one in my family wants to eat	8
0	it is a quick meal when you need it but hopefully you wo n't need it too often i guess you ca n't expect too much from a two minute meal but it would be nice if you could expect more than this it is an easy kosher meal when you do n't have a kosher microwave	8
0	i purchased these candies hoping for a good tasting soft licorice candy ummm no on both accounts taste was miles away from any of the licorices ive had and these things were hard as rock oh well at least i tried them	8
1	i bought the natural flavour did n't find it very palatable the first time but the next time was much better and now i am hooked on to it ! an acquired taste indeed ! the 11 ounce is difficult to down in one go though	8
1	if you dont like mangos you will not like this drink it does not taste like an organic mango but rather it tastes more like the essence of mango you would smell from an air freshener this does mix pretty well with cold rum i would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it this water does not taste like the water you would get from the asian countries i cant really explain why either	8
1	excellent one of the few food items i 've found on here that i think i 'll buy again remember that it 's best chilled ice cold if you 're ever gonna sample it not so good when not so cold great when actually cold very refreshing feel either way though after you 've had a drink	8
1	zico coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut if you never had coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12 some people may say it 's an aquire taste but i think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised i started drinking coconut water ever since i was a baby it 's very healthy and low in sugar currently i give it to my son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	8
1	this is the best snack bar we have tried it has the highest quality raw organic ingredients and they are blended into a delicious bar we have tried a few of their flavors and this and rasberry chocolate are our favorites	8
1	this is unlike any other bar i 've tried i like that it 's gooey green i'm tired of the drier oat like bars it 's satisfying tasty may not be for everyone though i only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the amazon descriptions most of these things are pretty high fat ok for a meal on the run	8
1	i received it quickly and was happy with the delicious alternative to plain granola it 's a healthy snack that 's great on yogurt and a good alternative to other cereals	8
1	absolutely scrumptious granola that is good for you low fat high fiber a delicious alternative to the bland tasteless granolas produced by the major american cereal makers i 've tried virtually all of the back to nature products and each and every one is sensational do yourself a favor and try this product highly recommended	8
1	back to nature apple strawberry granola are an excellent product for a healthy breakfast or snack each flavor of the back to nature granola is tasty i would be careful before ordering this product in bulk my order of 6 bags came in this week and they are due to expire on september 15th i did not realize before ordering that this product was getting ready to expire and would not have placed the order had i known this as this is a food product it is not eligible for return so while this is an excellent product i would not recommend ordering this from amazon grocery unless you are prepared to have a bulk order of food that is getting ready to expire	8
1	i have been using the navitas natural organic raw cacao nibs for four months now and it gives me a feeling of happiness well being and energy for the day we add it to our fruit smoothie in the morning i do n't eat chocolate with dairy and sugar as it gives me pimples however i can tolerate the nibs	8
1	these nibs are great on ice cream or with cool whip not good alone but paired with a sweet they are great i am going to try cookies next week ! i have already bought more	8
1	you have to use this product a special way to appreciate all it does for you it is very good for the body i tried to eat some right out of the bag but decided it is best to put it in other food items like homemade cookies or my applesause good stuff	8
1	these little nibs are very bitter i would n't recomend poppin them straight from the bag they were fabulous melted in a pan with some sweetner dip with chunked fruit lay on tray covered with wax paper and refridgerate for 20 min the chocolate hardens raspberries are my families' favorite but any fruit works ! also very good sprinkled in warm milk for a homemade hot chocolate this is a great product for experimental food people straight out of the bag disappointing	8
1	i have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat this led to me shopping in health food stores whole foods for anything in the cracker cookie snack category i once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3 4 supermarkets and could n't find any so i went to whole foods near my job i saw these crackers and bought the cheddar flavor and loved them i have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors who does n't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies \?	8
1	these cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers these are a good snack to give to your kids or eat yourself i was very pleased with this purchase	8
1	i bought the natural flavour did n't find it very palatable the first time but the next time was much better and now i am hooked on to it ! an acquired taste indeed ! the 11 ounce is difficult to down in one go though	8
1	if you dont like mangos you will not like this drink it does not taste like an organic mango but rather it tastes more like the essence of mango you would smell from an air freshener this does mix pretty well with cold rum i would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it this water does not taste like the water you would get from the asian countries i cant really explain why either	8
1	this product is great ! very refreshing it tastes just like you are drinking it straight from a young coconut it does n't have any added sugar it 's only 60 calories a serving i just wish it were cheaper	8
1	excellent one of the few food items i 've found on here that i think i 'll buy again remember that it 's best chilled ice cold if you 're ever gonna sample it not so good when not so cold great when actually cold very refreshing feel either way though after you 've had a drink	8
1	zico coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut if you never had coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12 some people may say it 's an aquire taste but i think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised i started drinking coconut water ever since i was a baby it 's very healthy and low in sugar currently i give it to my son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	8
1	if you have ever had trouble with leg cramps be sure to drink zico it will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium i have recommended it to others and it always works pat rampolla	8
1	bear naked is my favorite granola and fruit and nut is by far my favorite flavor i came across bear naked because one of my favorite breakfast 's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt when i went off of refined sugar i was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added bear naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup my favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture i recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat	8
1	bear naked granola is just fabulous i 've tried every granola around and bear naked strikes the right balance between crunchy sweet and ostensibly good for you and amazon 's price certainly beats what you 'd pay at the store	8
1	good low sodium low sugar granola that i feel i ca n't afford at the onesie price in the traditional shopping venues	8
1	i hesitate to write a review about a food because well one man 's meat is another man 's poison i like the not too sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand the banana flavour is our favourite the fruit and nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds \( so maybe too minimally processed \? \) also remember that 'all natural' is not organic even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store our local target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it	8
1	we love this granola ! bear naked makes wonderfully nutritious and delicious granola we love eating the banana flavor by the handfuls and the peak protein flavor mixed in with our yogurt amazon sells it for a great price too	8
1	this is the second time i 've bought these for my dog although they are not dog treats my dog loves them she is very special to me so i get her the best this is a great price for these slim jims if i buy them in the store i pay alot more for them i 've tried them also their very good they come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time just like the ones they sell in the stores if you buy them one at a time at 25c a piece you pay 25 00 dollars for them i think this is a great value !	8
1	these individually wrapped slim jims make great snacks for hungry kids toss a few in your purse and you have a portable filling treat while you 're out with the kids my kids love them and ask for them over fruit snacks or candy	8
1	i bought the natural flavour did n't find it very palatable the first time but the next time was much better and now i am hooked on to it ! an acquired taste indeed ! the 11 ounce is difficult to down in one go though	8

1	if you have ever had trouble with leg cramps be sure to drink zico it will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium i have recommended it to others and it always works pat rampolla	8
1	i personally like the taste of this product but i can see that others may not the taste is unusual with natural tones i definitely like the packaging standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time but a box of zico survived a 2 week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine	8
1	this is the best snack bar we have tried it has the highest quality raw organic ingredients and they are blended into a delicious bar we have tried a few of their flavors and this and rasberry chocolate are our favorites	8
1	my husband and i have been off sugar for several years we thoroughly enjoyed these spirulina bars sure they are green yet that is the color of spirulina my husband has passed these bars out to a neighbor and our chiropractor and they love the bar also my husband travels alot from work site to work site and this spirulina bar helps him with his hunger pain in a nutritious way	8
1	i 've been wanting to try spirulina the superfood that everyone in the health world swears by and figured this would be as good an opportunity as any to do so the bar is a medium sized green rectangle it smells interesting and is very moist and chewy i'm not a big fan of sour foods so i did n't like that it tasted a bit sour my brother however loved this bar more than all the others we tried has a lot of cashew and is very sweet and packed with good fats very filling ! overall if you like sour and sweet this bar is for you	8
1	this granola is great tasting and healthy other brands of granola have unhealthy oils in them but this granola does not apple blueberry is my family 's favorite flavor	8
1	could n't find this item in any stores in my town so i went to amazon \( naturally \) and found it ! the item was delivered on time too ! thanks amazon	8
1	these were exactly what i wanted and tasted great in my home made mint cocoa nib ice cream where the bitterness did n't turn you off from the product	8
1	my kids love these snacks and now they are in a handy bag for school snacks it makes me feel good that i 've sent my children off with a healthy snack will buy them again good price	8
1	i have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat this led to me shopping in health food stores whole foods for anything in the cracker cookie snack category i once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3 4 supermarkets and could n't find any so i went to whole foods near my job i saw these crackers and bought the cheddar flavor and loved them i have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors who does n't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies \?	8
1	my daughter is addicted to chedder bunnies ! lol ! ! which is fine because they are not made with any hydrogenated oils ! they are her favorite snack and she asks for them everyday ! we are always stocked with a box or two ! \)	8
1	just the right size snack pack for my 17 month old healthier alternative to other packaged crackers without sacrificing taste	8
1	these are just delicious and i like having the controlled portions in the bags a very satisfying snack for 150 calories	8
1	these cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers these are a good snack to give to your kids or eat yourself i was very pleased with this purchase	8
1	zico coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut if you never had coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12 some people may say it 's an aquire taste but i think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised i started drinking coconut water ever since i was a baby it 's very healthy and low in sugar currently i give it to my son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	8
1	so good i love bear naked i think the fruit and nut is the best out of their varieties	8
1	this is the second time i 've bought these for my dog although they are not dog treats my dog loves them she is very special to me so i get her the best this is a great price for these slim jims if i buy them in the store i pay alot more for them i 've tried them also their very good they come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time just like the ones they sell in the stores if you buy them one at a time at 25c a piece you pay 25 00 dollars for them i think this is a great value !	8
1	these individually wrapped slim jims make great snacks for hungry kids toss a few in your purse and you have a portable filling treat while you 're out with the kids my kids love them and ask for them over fruit snacks or candy	8
1	i have to say that this 100 count box is a great deal for your money although this is n't a full size slim jim but rather a shorter one it 's the perfect size for a lunch box surprise or a mid afternoon pick me up slim jim has managed after all these years to still provide the same taste of slightly spicy slightly salty goodness and you wo n't go wrong with the 100 count box	8
1	my whole family love these crackers it 's nice that they are organic with no artifical ingredients or hydrogenated oils the only thing i wish is that they were whole grain !	8
1	all 4 of mine love these they are great for a quick snack on the go or to pack in lunches when in a hurry	8
1	these crackers are great for the natural health conscious family as well as anyone else who loves goldfish or other cheese crackers they taste great and are all natural with organic wheat nothing weird you can actually understand what every ingredient is ! \( how refreshing \) plus i love this new big box 12 oz instead of regular 7 5 oz not only does it save packaging and cabinet space but it 's a better price per ounce ! great for us because we go through them so fast now that these are available here i also do n't have to go to the store \( some of my local stores do n't carry the big size anyway \)	8
1	the only way i drink this stuff is mixed with a cup of coffee makes a very nice late afternoon treat without a ton calories !	8
1	i love these crackers and was suprised to find them on amazon com i first found them in reading pa and here in florida could not find them high fiber is important to me and these have more than most	8
1	these are really expensive at the leading national overpriced healthy food supermarket and they are worth even the higher price do n't worry about buying too many with the six pack i was a little concerned about that when i bought here a few months ago but my wife and i ate all of them easily i'm not even the biggest fan of pumpkin seeds by themselves but in these euro style flatbread crackers they add something really good to the flavor	8
1	i am a south beach diet follower and these crackers are a perfect choice to fit the guidelines of the diet and they are delicious ! they are quite expensive in stores so i'm very excited to see amazon offering them at such a great price	8
1	i'm a vegetarian and although my husband is n't he enjoys this soup just as much the tofu in the mix creates a creamy texture if you 're expecting a potato au gratin flavor you will be disappointed however if you 've made homemade miso soup from scratch and like the taste this product makes an excellent time saving substitute the tofu serves a source of protein and the seaweed provides medicinal minerals this soup is excellent to drink when sick and remarkably soothes a sour stomach my local health food store charges 5 30 per box of 4 packets amazon sells it for 2 66 a box substantial savings	8
1	what could be better than this just read the label of what is in it and check your fridge do you have the items to make it in about a minute	8
1	we spent 5 years in brasil and senseo has captured the essence of the premium cafe taste from some of the better fazendas ! well done particularly for a dutch company	8
1	i am enjoying my senseo even more with the addition of the new varities i like the brazil blend as well as the sumatra	8
1	i find this coffee to be very rich in flavor yest strong enough for my taste	8
1	if you like strong coffess go with this its wonderful ! definitely worth it	8
1	ca n't rave about this enough if you like sardines this is the way to go just plain delicious	8
1	my wife and i have slightly different tasates in coffee i like mine darker and she like a milder coffee this one however is just right for both of us i drink it daily without cream or sugar \( which i only do when i actually enjoy the flavor of the coffee \) and we are on our second 5 pound bag ! i wish we had found this coffee sooner it is great	8
1	for anyone who needs a shelf stable quick lunch option this is the one ! the soup is delicious and the prep could n't be easier plus i love that you can prepare and eat it right in the bowl i always make sure i have a few of these in my desk drawer at work so i never have an i forgot my lunch issue and the portion is big enough to actually constitute a full meal \( for lunch anyway \) i love the udon flavor and my husband swears by the miso	8
1	authenic but a little bland for me i add ponzu sauce to taste and make sure it gets really hot in the micriwave if steaming when you take it out it tastes better pre rinsing the noodles \( as directed \) is nonsense just cover them with good clean water \( i never use tap \) stir in the sauce and toppings and nuke it about 90 seconds uncovered stir and serve it had everyone in my office drooling with questions ! best price is on amazon just order 2 so you do n't pay shipping	8
1	i 've tried several of the annie chun flavors and i liked most of them but the kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious ! this is the best packaged soup product of any kind that i have ever tried and i usually dislike canned or packaged soup products this is even better than my favorite canned brunswick stew that i have loved for so long ! it is moderately spicy but if you do n't mind a bit if spice this one is just too good to pass up i could practically live off of this stuff ! thank you annie chun for making a packaged meal worth eating	8
1	this annie chun 's udon soup is very easy to prepare i do n't think the first step is necessary either just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1 2 minutes add the sauce packet the noodles loosen up after you stir it if you what a more filling soup add meat vegetables my kids and i really love this soup ! i just purchased more from amazon because it 's a better buy here than at the grocery store	8
1	i have purchased this item several times it is good and can be expanded by adding more vegetables or chicken it comes packaged well and is easy to prepare it is also in an environment friendly bowl which is important to me	8
1	i moved from northern california to the ozark mountains of northern arkansas i can get starbucks at the nearby grocery stores or more expensive gourmet coffees but that 's about it i have been on the lookout for robust full flavored whole bean coffees at reasonable prices i tried pete 's espresso blend and liked it but it was n't available the last time i checked so i tried this fogbuster and i like it even more good thing since it comes in a 5 lb bag if you like starbucks french roast this compares quite favorably	8
1	first found this concentrate a few years ago in kroger and took it camping because of its small size small size big on flavor and not too salty was glad to find it online as i ca n't get it in stores nearby anymore	8
1	amazon grocery was fast and easy as usual and the mac cheese is great we ca n't get our five year old to stop eating it price wise its a fairly good deal in comparison to the grocery store	8
1	these cheese sticks are irresistible in fact for a substitute they taste far better than the original my kids love them and 1 ounce pack fits perfectly into a lunchbox	8
1	check the company 's website they select cook their tuna differently and that 's what makes their tuna the best it has the lowest possible mercury \( same as salmon and much lower than regular tuna \) plus they cook it only once after it 's canned so all the healthy vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids are still there in the can ! plus amazon has it for a great price	8
1	this is just what i 've been needing for a power lifting diet or optimal health in general the flavor of the meat is not masked by salt yet the aroma is not as overpouring as other brands great stuff ! four stars only because it is 3 75 per can	8
1	i bought this jerky at a xmas lot a couple of years ago and everyone raved about it this year they were sold out but i was lucky to find it on amazon even less expensive ! this is the best you can find the ones in the market to do not even compare believe me it does not last long in our house ! would definetly recommend the original and other flavors they are all great	8
1	my packaged arrived much quicker than i had anticipated since living in the midwest the last 5 yrs i 've had limited access to beef jerky i accidentally ran into 'oberto' beef jerky which was fine just extremely salty and overly seasoned world kitchens beef jerky tasted very natural and delicious i purchased it based on reviews and cravings and i would definitely purchase again superb beef quality texture and flavor thank you	8
1	i do n't think that it is possible to get better beef jerky for the price my wife and two kids also find it to be delicious	8
1	ordered 2lbs based upon the positive reviews i am happy with the quality of the jerky and taste of the product i will buy again my kids love the stuff not a bad snack	8
1	better beef jerky is not to be found anywhere shipping was good and it made alot of people happy at christmas time	8
1	i 've used this product for recipes such as chicken pot pie and shepherds pie to get height i whip the batter in my stand mixer to ensure lots of air bubbles are trapped to support the mix as it cooks they 've turned out great and you ca n't tell it 's gluten free i 've had less luck making biscuits out of it came out hard but that seems to be a hazard in any gluten free flour mix	8
1	they were thick like bisquick biscuits they tasted great would be wonderful in chicken dumplings the only thing i did wrong when making them was using bob 's red mill sall purpose gluten free flour to roll the biscuit dough in it made the outside of our biscuits taste like raw beans yuck ! i used white rice flour and they tasted great \) for a buttery flavor put butter \( or if you are gfcf a non casien containing margarine spread \) on the top for a taste similar to kfc taste great with jelly in the middle too \) i froze the unbaked left over biscuits and they turned out well 2 months later	8
1	easy convenient and tasty snack or breakfast particularly good for college students	8
1	i take these to work along with little minature milks i pick up at the convenient store they 're quite filling and get me through to lunch just fine and they 're not too bad for you either considering they 're all the sugary cereals your mom complained about when you were a kid in fact the one with the highest calorie count \( 280 \) is the rasin bran and that 's something that would actually be considered healthy all the rest fall into the 160 220 range	8
1	my spouse is on south beach diet and loves these i portion them out in ziplock bags \( 15 nuts each \) and they are grab and go lots of protein some fat and very little carbs fresh and tasty	8
1	these are good nuts very lightly salted just the way we like them but they are almost all almonds a little disappointed with that i was hoping they would be an equal mix of all the three variety of nuts	8
1	these are just wonderful when you want something quick for dinner just add chicken beef or seafood and any bottled sauce you like my favorite is alfredo sauce and some mushrooms family loves it	8
1	i tried this coffee on a whim my husband and i really enjoy our single serve coffee maker we easily use up an 18 pak in 2 to 3 days between the grown children and us this coffee has very smooth taste and mildly strong in flavor it is a very nice coffee that can be enjoyed daily	8
1	love bob s red mill organic golden flaxseed and will purchuse it again it is one of the best product on the market in my opinion i use flaxseed every day i start my morning with a oatmeal flax seed muffen that i came up with i also use it in a lot of my recipies good product thanks bob 's red mill	8
1	i was going to just put this on my cereal in the morning now i add it to my protein shake suppliments and i 've started cooking with it by using it as a breading for fish chicken or pretty much anything it 's fantastic ! i'm going to end up ordering more soon	8
1	for people with who need to eat something between meals to keep their blood sugar levels up these peanut butter balls are a godsend many 's the time i 've felt the familiar lightheadness and oncoming headache from low blood sugar and been saved by these things i always carry one in my pocket or purse and keep one in the glove compartment	8
1	this snack is superb in several ways first it is very good tasting the flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie nutritionally it has quite a bit of protein very very low in simple carbohydrates \( or sugars \) and is high in fiber i carry these with me to work and eat one in the morning and one in the afternoon to help me keep away from junk foods and excessive caffeine these would be excellent to carry with you on a hiking trip	8
1	faster than expected shipping ! great tasting product and good for you too	8
1	wow this beef jerky is so good it should come with a label warning highly addictive hands down the best beef jerky we 've ever eaten moist yet chewy very satisfying not too salty lots of flavor think maybe i 'll go eat some now	8
1	although i was a little put off by a prior review that indicated this product was nearly inedible we had purchased this salmon jerky at trader joe 's in smaller packets and really liked it so we decided to purchase here at amazon much less expensively yes this product is very dry but it also has none of the preservatives included in some of the more moist jerky products out there my family liked it and we are placing a second order that other reviewer should send her inedible seven extra packages our way	8
1	serves well as an in between meals snack got a good deal on amazon	8
1	even though i know it 's important to eat breakfast i seldom do it i 'd rather sleep a little longer these breakfast bars are a nice easy way to solve the problem i keep a box in the car and munch on them on the way to work in the morning they 're whole grain nice and filling and taste good to boot they 're also a nice treat on the way home the oats and honey are my favorite but the variety pack provides a nice change all of the flavors are tasty peanut butter cinnamon maple sugar all yummy	8
1	excellent green decaf tea at a great price we love this tea it has a strong delightful green tea taste and its decaf too by comparison many other green teas are too dry tasting for me and i like the convenience of the 40 tea bag size boxes as we drink a lot of this tea its great hot and good iced too	8
1	add mayonaise to anything and i love it that is espcially true of this white albacore tuna being packed in water lowers the calories and it 's fat free but it needs something to moisten it like mayo it 's delicious and totally clear of any dark tuna meat if you abhor even the slightest amount of dark tuna meat in your salad the tuna are supposedly wild caught in dolphin safe nets so are therefore hopefully lower in mercury content plus there is nothing added to the product so it 's truly all natural i happen to like dark as well as white tuna but if you only like the white like so many of my family and friends then this is the brand to buy	8
1	i love eating a lot of cereal in the morning like anybody i really do n't choose a cereal that is just good for you i really choose it for taste i loved special k before when it was plain flakes but i absolutely love it even more with the addition of red strawberries this cereal tastes even better with each morsel and bite with the addition of strawberries i like how delightful the strawberries taste after i add the milk into the cereal this is a great buy for anybody who loves special k cereal or for anyone who just has n't considered that special challenge price b taste a overal b	8
1	for a working mom these are the best quick easy heck my four year old can make them ! price wise \? i'm a cheapskate and only bought these when they were on sale for 1 a bag amazon offers them for less the garlic cheddar biscuits btw are the closest things i 've found to the red lobster cheddar bay biscuits and so easy	8
1	i did receive the splenda flavor packs and enjoy them alot	8
1	tastes great less calories amazon 's pricing is cheaper than my local grocery store so i stocked up	8
1	of the several brands of agave nectar that i have tried this one is by far the best it has the least taste to it it is just sweet \( very similar to simple syrup that you would make with sugar and water \)	8
1	i 've been using agave in my tea coffee cooking and on pancakes for over a year i'm a type 2 diabetic and need something with a low glycemic index this product is the best and it tastes wonderful my kids do n't miss honey on their pancakes any more and this keeps everyone from having sugar highs and crashes highly recommend	8
1	works great in coffee and tea and can be used in baking as well	8
1	there is one other cereal on the market that is very similar incrunchy tasteful cereal ! ! i had both in my pantry and tried each independently and then together this the one cereal that is good on any outing for breakfast with milk can of cream orjust plain water on a camping outing outfit your backpack withhealthy goodies no spoilage either i was hiking for four days with kashi dried fruit several cans of juices it is just the best approach for hiking with the minnimum lager on board	8
1	always soft and semi sweet real apples tastes kinda like a muffin without any air in i	8
1	very good tea weak but nice aroma mild good flavor excellect for the price	8
1	i got into various oolong teas from a great new york importer they really know their teas ! but this year the numi ti kuan yin is available at quality and price that bests the experienced importer i dunno maybe they got lucky at an auction or somthing but we 've been enjoying this tea ! you can spend 3 times as much and get better tea but then it 's too expensive to drink every day buy this	8
1	i ordered both the brown sugar jerky and the peppered and both were absolutely fanstastic this jerky has a slightly tender consistency which makes it easy to chew the flavor is sublime not too salty just the right amount of sweetness a real taste treat i am on my second 2lb order i am totally hooked	8
1	this is truly great jerky and a fantastic price do n't let the price fool you this is first class jerky i order for the whole office and every person raves my last order was for 36 bags of world kitchens \( some of all 5 flavors \)	8
1	a great product at a very good price we are repeat customers so that says it all	8
1	this is one of the best beef jerkys i have purchased moist tender with a great flavor i have tried the others that are like orginial dry and tough to chew leaves your jaws tired also a great price best i have found will order agai	8
1	after all the great reviews we did n't think we could go wrong these are really good but not as satisfying as maybe a protein bar then again did n't really expect them to be	8
1	my 2 1 2 year old is allergic to foods very common in traditional granola type bars wheat soy nuts we have tried various bars that were safe for her to eat and this has been by far her favorite ! i'm happy that they 're organic she loves the taste great all around they are individually packaged which makes them great for when we are on the go	8
1	these are very tasty not too sweet like some bars but plenty sweet enough nice fruity flavor my favorite of the three envirokidz bars even if i did n't need to eat gluten free these would be a favorite snack	8
1	what else do i need say for coffee for my favorite coffee maker the only thing else i need is some latt	8
1	i love the flavor it 's in a world of it 's own it has great taste and textur	8
1	the wife looked incredulous but i had the last laugh as i pasted a beefy juicy kiss of sugary goodness on her cheek last night just as she was dozing off to bed seeing the drooly goo drip off onto the pillow made the night on the couch all worth while thank you world kitchens for two pounds of steer delight	8
1	this jerky is not just an excellent value it is by far the best jerky we have eaten i buy it every year as christmas gifts \( and ofcourse save one pkg for us \) and everyone raves about it my family always looks forward to christmas because they know jerky will be there for the holidays you ca n't beat the price and the jerky is actual strips of lean beef that is flavorful the brown sugar has just a hint of heat with the sweetness i would highly recommend this product value and quality ca n't be beat a thanks !	8
1	this is quality jerky probably the best i have found so far	8
1	awesome jerky some pieces are tender some are tough had to knock off a star for the gas i can clear a stadium after eating a few pieces of this stuff	8
1	my husband and i like the newman o 's better than oreo 's and our 3 year old son loves them ! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo also the newman o 's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have	8
1	these cookies are superb all by themselves far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more keep out of reach of children	8
1	everyone in my family \( from 3 to 64 years old \) loves these organic cookies i purchased these cookies at several local stores before i discovered that amazon had them i sent a package to my grandson who is in the army in iraq and he raved about them newman 's has another big winner !	8
1	i do not like store bought cookies especially oreos \( too dry and greasy for me \) but upon the recommendation of several people i tried the ginger o 's and was pleasantly surprised they have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it if you like ginger cookies do n't hesitate to try these	8
1	my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream these are a bit softer than the o 's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat ! \) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too yummy	8
1	i love the original vanilla creme newman 's o 's so when i saw the wheat free dairy free on sale one day i picked one up i figured it would basically be the same as the original the chocolate and vanilla tastes are great but i found the cookies themselves to be rock hard so unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products i would recommend the original vanilla creme and not the wheat free dairy free variety	8
1	fresh tuna great price i would recommend this product	8
1	my order arrived before i could blink ! i am buying my coffee here from now on	8
1	the variety blend coffee pods are simply the best coffee i 've had in a long time i drink up to three cups of coffee a day but the one i look forward to the most is the cup i make in the morning on my senseo machine the origins pods are the best of the best these pods have a rich full bodied flavor that surpasses the other medium and dark roast pods that are available get the variety pack and try them all they are all wonderful	8
1	we first bought these crackers in a local store and loved them nutritionwise they are really good and have a great flavor and are oh so crunchy never attempt a conversation while partaking you 'll never hear the other person \) after our first purchase we bought directly from dr kracker then they told us of the great deal we 'd get buying them thru amazon and that 's what we 've been doing ever since aways good for an in between meals snack with butter or peanut butter then we 'll have something more substantial on them for our lunch from time to time	8
1	i saw this bread in my local health food store and it looked so good i decided to try it i must say it taste just as good as it looks this is by far the besting tasting cracker i 've ever tasted made completely from certified organic ingrediants this product is an excellent choice for the health conscious and the price here at amazon is a great buy in comparison to any local retailer i'm looking forward to this replacing the breads i usually use	8
1	i tried this about two months ago and really loved it i love the crunch and natural sweetness i also made corn chowder with their corn product i recommend this for any one who loves healthy natural snacks	8
1	this is a very tasty nutritious snack ! no fat sweet crunchy a great alternative to running out to the vending machine at work	8
1	i really enjoy these as a light snack they are only 85 calories a bag so it is easy to fit it in your diet	8
1	when i searched the net for pods there were lots of warnings that the senseo brand was n't so good granted i am not an avid coffee drinker however i really look forward to a good morning cup of coffee that wo n't burn a hole in my stomach i usually run one senseo pod through twice and have a perfect cup if anything needs a little more of the flavor \( i e hazlenut vanilla \) added to it but still very good	8
1	these pods are excellent ! same taste as your favorite coffee shop at a fraction of the price	8
1	this is great granola and at such a great price ! i usually make my own but for this price it 's not worth the effort ! thanks for the great value	8
1	good quality granola not too sweet would give it 5 stars but it does n't have enough nuts super nutty it is not it is worth the price though my wife would give it 4 5 stars she is mildly gluten intolerant and can eat this because it contains no wheat	8
1	the munch'ems were certainly a good buy they taste great and easy to pack best of all they are good for you too	8
1	these were very good cookies i loved the texture and flavor a nice surprise from a packaged cookie i would buy again	8
1	i had purchased a few of the tea chests as christmas gifts for my neighbors i thought it was so beautifully made that i purchased another for myself ! the wood chest is really pretty and the tea variety inside is great i put it out every time i entertain	8
1	very nice wooden tea box will make a nice present i have not tried the teas though	8
1	dr krackers are fantastic they are different from any other cracker i have tried they are very crispy which is what i love about them they are delicious plain or with cheese and dips because of their crispiness they hold up great for dips i cannot say enough about these crackers they come in several flavors while classic 3 seed is my favorite they are all very good	8
1	best snack i 've found in years i keep these in my desk at work for a mid afternoon appetite curb highly recommended by all my family and friends	8
1	i am addicted to these they are delicious not dry at all and there are lots of crackers in each container yum !	8
1	this coffe is so delicious ! it is bold and smooth there 's no bitter taste even when brewed strong if you 're looking for a great coffee with a smooth flavor and nothing bitter you' wo n't be dissappointed with timithy 's colombian la vereda	8
1	i use k cups all the time at work at home etc there are a handful of good k cup brands out there this is one of the best both decaf and regular timothy 's columbian are smooth and rich in flavor add some creamer and sweetener and goodbye to any other coffee ! ! you wo n't be disappointed believe it or not the home brewing k cup machine \( keurig \) gives a better cup of coffee versus the commercial k cup machine \( also keurig \) because the hot water does not blast too quickly through it fyi	8
1	we love the taste of illy coffees when brewed in our espresso machine smooth never bitter and the vacuum packed canister has a unique reusable design	8
1	i have tried everything for our francis francis espresso machine and had an extremely difficult time to make it taste wonderful i found this espresso and the first time i tried it i was absolutely hooked try it you 'll love it !	8
1	illy rules my favorite espresso roast great price excellent	8
1	i really feel like this is the best overall coffee that i have tasted as the name suggests it is intended for espresso but it makes an excellent cup of regular coffee i love this roast for my lattes because it is so easy smooth yet full flavored if you are in the midst of a decision for what bean to purchase make this your choice you shall not be disappointed	8
1	the south korean oysters are the only ones i will eat nice size tender flavorful avoid any from china	8
1	i 've always loved smoked oysters but most brands come packed in cottonseed oil which is vile to say the least the crown prince oysters are packed in olive oil a huge step up in health and taste they are convenient little bundles of protein that can be packed in a lunch etc they taste wonderful added to soup or stew great for last minute entertaining last but not least i like to have a case on hand in my disaster supplies	8
1	so these are basically ritz bits but with three differences 1 the crackers are better they taste more buttery and flavorful 2 the cheese is better it actually tastes like something that 's met cheese in passing and maybe even shaken its hand 3 they 're all organic 'n' stuff so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous and less like a slave to big food if you 're packing lunches for kids \( or snacks for yourself \) these are great	8
1	some people can tolerate spelt but not wheat and if you are one of those spelt flour makes a great bread it substitutes well but be aware that spelt requires less kneading \( it has a shorter gluten fiber and breaks down if kneaded too long we knead bread about three minutes \) spelt also makes lovely noodles and is fine in cakes it seems easier to digest it does have gluten and is a relative of wheat so if you are gluten sensitive this is probably not an alternative	8
1	we love cinna raisin crunch for breakfast the clusters are larger than average and hold up well in milk the cinnamon and raison flavor is right for me given few minutes to digest and it keeps me comfortably sated for hours if you prefer small bites or smooth textures in your breakfast cereal the usual cluster size in this cereal might not be right for you	8
1	these prunes are delicious to eat ! since we started eating newmans organic prunes the store bought ones do not compare we notice a difference and feel healthier for eating these amazon is a place to shop in which we feel good buying organic products from them thanks amazon !	8
1	these 6 oz packs of organic california prunes have more flavor than the non organic brands they are also drier and firmer which i was n't sure i liked at first i quickly grew used to it and now i prefer them this way they are sweet and chewy the freshness date is 16 months in the future so these would make a good addition to any emergency preparedness stock one might have you ca n't go wrong at this price for 12 bags this is one brand you can trust	8
1	very tasty coffee cake probably does n't cost much more than to buy all the ingredients to make it and easier ! ! ! nice weekend treat ! make sure there 's lots of people around to eat it so you do n't eat it all yourself !	8
1	read about panko in several cookbooks this was definitely the best buy out there although i have enough to last me several years ! would recommend this product	8
1	my family and i absolutly loved the sinamon flavor of lesserevil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family was it healthy \? well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you good stuff overall and amazon 's price is great \( just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas	8
1	these are not that cheddary i imagine that this is what the dried congealed waste water from making cheddar tastes like it 's good enough	8
1	it 's really taste good and let you feel good too it 's a easy way to get calcium only concern is the price is little expensive and ca n't affort to have it often	8
1	really great irish brown bread tastes just like the bread in ireland ! very easy to make i make it 3 times a week \( my husband is irish ! \)	8
1	this is my favorite side dish it is so versatile and so very easy to make it tastes great with any and every kind of sausage i 've ever tried i love to make it when i whip up a batch of hot wings	8
1	i find it easy to use at breakfast when added to my muesli honey and yogurt mix powerful healthy morning treat for the price you ca n't beat it as a health food	8
1	i got a few packages of these used some for my daughter \( for the omega 3 fatty acids as they help with brain function she is speech impaired \) and for my grandpa \( who has high blood pressure had a stroke \) you simply add a few spoonfuls to your oatmeal my grandpa 's cholesterol went down 50 points in one month \( none of his medication had been able to do that \) my 5 y o daughter did n't notice this in her oatmeal i tried it and there is no added taste just health benefits \) great product we always have it at our house	8
1	this is awesome soup ! ! i was a little iffy about it \( about any soup coming from a can or bag ! \) but ordered it anyway it sounded so good my hubby toddler and i love it and could eat it every week if we had more money to buy it ! we took some on a camping trip and shared with all of our friends that we were with and everyone agreed how great it was not as good as home made but really really good ! i'm not sure about the taste buds of the reviewer that gave it 1 star but we all thought it was worth getting again !	8
1	these bars are filling which is what i look for in my snacks breakfast foods they 're nice and sweet wo n't fall apart on you like granola bars yet do n't require too much jaw pressure to take a bite it 's the perfect consistancy a great way to get some portable protien if you do n't want to carry around a bag of nuts seeds with you	8
1	i have a briel espresso maker and these pods have made using the machine more convenient than my stovetop pot i have used the expensive pods and these taste as good and have fabulous crema enjoy	8
1	the espresso pod is easy to use easy to clean and makes very good espresso i am very happy with it and just ordered another box	8
1	about to order my fourth box this year it makes a smooth brew ideal for my latt	8
1	we use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church we consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes i like how easy they are to use no mess no tamping i am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily	8
1	i use this cereal for not only cereal but also to make rice crispy treats yum	8
1	it evens says snap crackle pop not only is it delicious but it is very filling it satisfies my urge to crunch and eliminates my problem with gluten products i highly recommend this cereal	8
1	my favorite things are often the most simple a healthy alternative to kellog 's rice krispies with the benefits of organic ingredients rice syrup instead of cane sugar and an incredible company behind it all to boot and this tastes even better ! also rice syrup wo n't give you the 'spike' and 'crash' of conventional sugar and in fact supplies a steady stream of energy	8
1	these are the best ! they remind me of rice crispy treats they 're so chewy and delicious i recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter products	8
1	if you love the taste of peanut butter then you will love the taste of these granola bars they are chewy and do not break into pieces while eating them a healthy delicious and quick snack	8
1	i really like these as they are a lot less sweet than other brands	8
1	they went over well in our house the sugar content is semi low and the peanut butter has good protein	8
1	delicious and very filling they can easily be used as a meal replacement	8
1	we have been using meyenberg 's powdered goat milk for several years we used to buy their milk in cartons at walmart and it was good the only problem was that we live so far from a walmart store that we would run out of goat 's milk between trips we decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk	8
1	i started using goat milk when my daughter was 1 because she did not digest cow 's milk that well this product is great has equal or more nutrition than cow 's milk has a good flavor just slightly different than cow 's milk is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go i do n't have to worry about it spoiling i just mix and give it to my daughter	8
1	i used meyenberg powdered goat milk with my first litter of pups five years ago and was very pleased with it so made sure to stock up before my second litter was born i supplement the mother 's food with it and mix it with ground puppy food to make a puppy gruel to transition the pups to puppy food the pups and their mother seem to love it and have suffered no digestive problems at all it dissolves quickly in warm water and is convenient and easy to store i recommend it as a nutritional supplement for nursing mothers and pups both	8
1	i use these beans in a jura capresso superautomatic everyone in our house likes the coffee because it has a refined taste many coffees sold taste rather muddy so if you like a clear tasting coffee with delicate notes give this one a try also has excellent crema	8
1	the roast is more smooth and mellow than starbucks i prefer it to illy produces ample crema it 's a good value after trying the first bag i ordered several more the lavazza has become my daily espresso bean at least until the 8 8 pounds runs out ! fwiw i grind with a rancilio rocky burr grinder and my espresso machine is a rancilio miss silvia	8
1	this is a terrific espresso i got hooked on lavazza in italy and have n't found any other espresso blends to knock it off it 's throne this is my first time purchasing lavazza whole beans and i think i 'll continue to buy the whole beans for the freshness factor would highly recommend !	8
1	great taste ! very creamy espresso with a natural sweet aroma does not need any other cream or sugar to ruin such a rich taste the reason why your \( to the previous reviewer \) coffee tasted sour is because you failed to use a decent and suitable home espresso machine if you had used the right method and machine it would have been nearly impossible for you not to enjoy the great taste this coffee can offer these are very high quality espresso beans with a taste so full and rich that you would want to keep going back to it after tasting other coffees	8
1	i spend a lot of time in my van while out shooting wildlife photos i buy a case of bottled water and keep some of these individual packets of drink mix open a bottle of water and put in a packet of this drink mix and you have an instant refreshing drink very easy	8
1	lots of bang for your buck if you are a discerning hostess who enjoys offering guests a slightly off beat non alcoholic beverage really like the packaging like the taste too kind of like mountain dew with ginseng	8
1	i will never make home made gumbo again this is so easy and good 30 minutes and you have great gumbo	8
1	this is my favorite of essn 's juices it is unique and has a beautiful color which you see when using it as a mixer in cocktails also a huge hit with kids ca n't beat 100 juice worth every penny	8
1	i did n't know tuna could taste this good ! and low mercury relieves worry about eating too much fish i love shopping amazon i experiment a lot and am never unhappy but this tuna is really wonderful	8
1	this was the first time i have bought this and am very pleased with it when you open the can the tuna is in one solid piece and not all sloppy like other brands it tastes pretty good too will buy again	8
1	i thought tuna in olive oil tasted good but this is better this is the tuna for salad nicoise maybe use the other for mixing tuna salad	8
1	am always looking for new ways to get whole grains into our diet the pudding recipe on the back of the package is very good even dh with incredible sweet tooth liked it	8
1	this is the same crystal light lemonade that comes in the round containersbut with the quanity buy much cheaper great taste	8
1	i discovered this in our local qfc grocery store which is the only place i 've ever seen it and amazon 's price is much better as i paid 8 for one package growing up my mom used to make us bowls of pastina as comfort food i call this whole wheat orzo my adult pastina \) cooks up really quickly and is versatile in recipes and tastes wonderful i highly recommend it	8
1	i 'd been looking for whole wheat orzo for awhile and it 's almost impossible to find in any grocery stores this is a very great pasta at a reasonable price i 've been very pleased with this pasta	8
1	this is a very good source of fiber with good taste and texture that even picky eaters enjoy	8
1	while i like all of the kashi products i 've tried this one has to be my favorite ! with a little fresh fruit how much more healthy can you get \? great taste with seven grains and sesame ! perhaps the other reviewer threw away the cereal and ate the box	8
1	the pods are great they taste great and brew great coffee although in my two different pod machines they brew coffee that tastes very different the one thing to be aware of is that the pods are slightly thicker than many other brands and they may not fit right in some machines the problem only occured with the double pod configuration for a bigger cup of coffee	8
1	this coffee rivals the name brand coffee house and right in my own kitchen i am the only coffee drinker in my home so i make one or two cups each morning and the no muss no fuss delivery of this system is unbeatable if guests want a cup of coffee i am not brewing a pot just a cup as needed	8
1	great flavor light and fluffy and good texture only down side is that the bread tends to dissolve with to much moisture and has a tendency to be a little dry but great for sandwiches unlike other gluten free breads that tend to be so heavy that they over power anything you put in the middle	8
1	i ordered this for the mocha flavor but really cannot say that i found it i will say however that this does make a very nice smooth cup of coffee so much so that although i ordered this for after dinner coffee i have been making it for breakfast	8
1	mocha java is one of the smoothest cups you will ever have with a full bodied taste it is so mellow it is almost buttery i love it	8
1	mocha java is almost as good as going to starbucks for a cup of coffee i recommend it to anyone who likes the mocha flavor of coffee	8
1	we have a new keurig coffee maker and just love timothy 's coffees any flavor but especially the german chocolate great price too	8
1	my family all enjoys this product the taste is good very little aftertaste the product is healthy and excellent for a quick snack	8
1	the title pretty much sums it up \) not too sweet and just absolutely delicious every time i have a different cereal i wish i was eating this instead i do n't even know why i bother with the other kinds now that i 've found this stuff and it 's good for you too ! can life get any better \? i submit that it cannot ! \)	8
1	this is the best blueberry cereal i 've tried not sickeningly sweet excellent flavor and texture stays crunchy even mixed with yogurt	8
1	this is a great crystal light product i like that you get vitamin c from it it is a great way to get extra vitamin c with out popping a pill or taking in extra calories tastes good too	8
1	the coffee was very good i just wish they had more items to select in the variety pack i'm still looking for that one flavor that says this is it i had a superb coffee in a local restaraunt and i 've been trying to duplicate that taste for a couple of years now	8
1	we have served this coffee at our sunday morning church services for 8 years it is wonderful to know that we are not lining the pockets of some mega corporation when we buy from pura vida but helping children and families i heard one visitor who moved out of state and had not been in services for over 3 years say i knew i would get a great cup of coffee this morning ! we love this coffee	8
1	though resembling nothing like the common graham crackers found in most grocer 's cookie aisle these small squares are quite delectable and relatively guilt free	8
1	i have ordered these twice now they taste so good ! i also tried the chocolate wheat free ones they were awful i would not order them again but have been waiting several weeks for the grahams to be stocked	8
1	newman 's own organics alphabet cookies are very chocolatey and very crunchy the first time i tried them i was hooked ! my two children also think they are fantastic if you are have not tried organic cookies before these cookies are a good starting point	8
1	this coffee has a rich bold flavor dark color and nice aroma very enjoyable drinking ! comparable with starbucks bold coffees	8
1	forget the white tea at starbucks clipper is the real deal ! quick to make requires just 30 seconds to steep i do it with non dairy creamer and a couple of tsp of sugar but this is pretty sweet by itself but bmake sure you get the six boxes advertised here or get them for pretty much the same price at whole foods	8
1	i bought one box of this and my entire family tried it it has since become a staple in each of our three homes great taste with or without sugar	8
1	pros very tastynatural \( no preservatives \) cons difficult to che	8
1	i love these ! the only thing good about being on a gluten free diet is discovering these cookies ! i'm hooked i love the coffee flavor mixed with chocolate and for a dessert all the ingredients are pretty good	8
1	these are quite good tasting ! even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time it would be nice as with most things if they were a bit less expensive and also did n't have to be bought 'in bulk ' but overall they 're very good especially compared to some other 'organic' offerings	8
1	i tried betty lou 's spirulina ginseng balls because i read the nutritioninformation and you get 40 of your daily requirement for vitamin a inone serving at this point in my quest to eat healthier i 've read lotsand lots of nutrition labels finding this much vitamin a in a snack israre finding something deep green in color that actually tastes pretty good is rare if you 're looking for a yummy sugery snack thisis not for you ! if you are looking for a healthier snack to replace grabbing for that cookie this snack is worth checking out	8
1	i ca n't believe how great these are i bought these about 9 months ago and they were going to expire so i decided to try one i feel amazing ! ! ! i had lots of extra energy without the side effects of caffeine it tasted pretty good	8
1	these are a great substitute for granolia bars and much better for you they are not based on grains but on greens instead taste is a tad bit green but if you eat whole foods at all then you 'll love these plus they give a good energy boost throughout the day !	8
1	i tried this item just because it 's a a ginseng snack i found it to be not particularly tasty but the overall effect of increased stamina is true i'm not sure about spirulina in general but one ball per day does the trick for me when it comes to increased stamina lasting several days	8
1	i definitely love a cup of freshly brewed coffee now that so many choose to have coffee numerous different ways there are just those who need the right filters melita knows that with their coffee filters they are convient and stronger in hold than any other filters on the market they work great with 2 coffeemakers and especially are convient for those who 've purchased the individual ground coffeemaker melita 's perfect brew and perfect start coffee filter cups where all you have to do is just boil water and pour and you will get a convient cup of coffee i really recommend melita a whole lot they are worth the price price b strength a overall b	8
1	some days after the kids leave the classroom i find myself reaching for the nearest available chocolate ! not any more this is a great healthy snack that satisfies the cravings and keeps me going for a few more hours and there are no hidden ingredients that set off my food allergies which i really appreciate they are maintaining their freshness well i bought them for the price but am now going to try the other items in betty lou 's kitchen	8
1	i have these and the worms i love them because they are soft i highly recommend them	8
1	i would buy this product from amazon anytime it has always been grea	8
1	i originally found these flatbread crackers while traveling after returning home i longed for them so amazon came to the rescue with a source of these great flatbreads	8
1	this kracker is just the absolute best eating it alone when you need something crunchy or with healthy choice peanut butter or low fat cream cheese it just is an awesome product and i buy it in bulk cause i never want to be without it ! i 'd love to see a variety pack kind of a sampling of all the dr kracker goodies available	8
1	i bought these crackers because i love cheese and seeds nuts and am a low carb dieter they are very good and i would have given them 5 stars except i actually liked the crackers without the cheese better these are great for an occasional cruncy crispy treat and i would purchase them again they have a less sweet taste than the regular crackers and the cheese flavor is mild not artificial or too salty i highly recommend them	8
1	i bought this product because it was a cheaper alternative to the senseo coffee pods i 've been buying i do n't have much to compare with but overall this decaff tases fine	8
1	i love pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are the best the taste great are really crunchy a key requirement for me and have just the right amount of salt the newman 's rounds are just as good maybe even better and as an added bonus paul newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity an unbeatable combination in my book	8
1	everyone loved these pretzels very flavorful not too salty i plan on buying more from amazon best price i 've found on this brand	8
1	i was attracted to these because they have more fiber than most along with more protein i think they taste great	8
1	my daughters love this tasty pb natural snack typically in the stores around here one box is close to 5 but this bulk buy makes it about 2 70 a real bargain already one day they 've finished off one box	8
1	i happen to love pecans and this product is loaded with them it 's too bad the cans are so small	8
1	i was really impressed by the taste of this cereal i was expecting the flavor to be like cardboard or something like this but instead it was really good it was sweet \( but not sugar sweet \) and crunchy i 'll definitely buy this again if the price went down i 'd buy it more	8
1	i love this cereal i like the slightly sweet wheaty taste and the fact that it holds its crunch in milk for a long time i also snack on it dry it stays with me for a long time keeping me from eating junk	8
1	my fav out of all nature 's path cereals and trust me i know nature 's path cereals calorie count perfect nutrition perfect everything is great about this	8
1	we initially discovered this cereal at one of the big warehouse stores but they do not consistently stock it we enjoy the flavor the fact that it is made from organically grown grain and the health benefits of flax seed and high fiber at the time of purchase we found the amazon price to be over a dollar cheaper per box than in our local grocery store we bought two cases !	8
1	this is an excellent quality product nice clean filets packed in olive oil instead of who knows what i really like having little glass jars instead of a tin that ca n't be reclosed if you do n't use all the filets at once my first food purchase from amazon was an excellent start	8
1	ever since i returned from spain i have been looking for some decent anchovies to eat as tapas these are just the right amount for a snack and the flavor is wonderful if you have never eaten anchovies except on a pizza you are missing a great treat i highly recommend these and even if you only eat them occasionally they will remain fresh in the glass jars	8
1	did n't expect much with the price being this low but it 's now a family favorite ca n't tell the difference between this and jeremiah 's kona blend but they are both have smooth rich tastes it 's one of our family favorites now	8
1	having moved from a state where this popcorn was always available we were aghast that no one carried it in our new area ! it appears that very few here like this wonderfully natural tasting lightly salted lower calorie popcorn but preferred those that heavily tasted of thick butter with lots of salt and coats the mouth with film this popcorn pops fully leaving no kernels unpopped and does n't need any additives ease of ordering and prompt shipment make this a wonderful way for those of us who just have to have it ! thank you	8
1	great flavored soup that you do n't have to start from scratch very healthy choice	8
1	i am a firm believer in the health benefits of hemp this product is the best i 've found the delivery was very prompt and efficient	8
1	if you like hempseeds like i do this is your best buy amazon has the best price the seeds came fast fresh and are terrific to me they smell and taste even more fresh then the retail packages the 5 lb bag comes vacuum sealed i took 5 mason jars packed them in and put them in the freezer i have a big bag in the refrigerator i toss these seeds all over my salads	8
1	i drink this stuff religiously it tastes great with very little bitterness coming through even when over steeped the yogi quotes are fun too	8
1	i am a huge fan of tea i have been drinking this one for years i am astonished at the price such a great deal anyway if you must buy tea in a box this is one to purchase i love the subtle flavors of this tea i always feel better after drinking a cup it 's even better if you add a little fresh \( organic \) lemon juice	8
1	other than the republic of tea the people 's green tea i really like yogi tea healing formula not only is it 80 organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract \( protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation \) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one 's daily life other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches body aches and pains digestion depression immune enhancement detoxification as an energizer and to prolong life the only side effect is insomnia and i'm suffering from it but i know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day !	8
1	this is a nice smooth green tea actually i have tried many flavors of yogi tea and they are all lovely bedtime tea really does put me gently off to sleep egyptian licorice has a nice little bite to it and the women 's formulas help with hormonal issues i have not found a bad flavor	8
1	i just began baking with splenda when we found out my dad has pre diabetes for easter i prepared a sugarless ricotta tart with splenda and it worked beautifully everyone agreed that it did n't taste sugar free and my dad really enjoyed it	8
1	i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea ! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the splenda there is none ! you can use this to cook with too ! it 's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar	8
1	i love splenda and i love getting it in a big bag as a good ole oklahoma girl i live for my iced tea and my tea must be sweet but sugar is n't an option so splenda to the rescue we use it in everything and are learning new ways to use it every day because my daddy has developed diabetes the big bags are often out at our local grocery store so finding them at amazon with our amazon prime takes care of that problem	8
1	i have found that splenda is a great sugar subsitute for a diabetic to use it is great alone on food and also for cooking with leaves no after taste like other sugar subsitutes do	8
1	there is juvenile diabetes in our family and we have no other choice but to bake with splenda after couple tries i found excellent splenda recipes and even guests could not tell splenda cookies from sugar ones if you still feel splenda cookies are not the same add a teasp of molasses in choc chip or oatmeal raisin and they taste exactly the same	8
1	i'm a diabetic so i ca n't have sugar in my opinion splenda tastes alot better than sugar and has no carbs from it so if you 're a new found diabetic and you think life is over cause everything food wise sucks just sub some splenda in the recipe and you 'll be good to go	8
1	the glutino penne pasta actually tastes like the real thing ! i 've had a few bad experiences with rice pasta but this stuff is pretty good i do n't notice a major difference when microwaving leftovers so this deserves 5 star	8
1	you ca n't tell this is rice nooles it tast just like regular pasta ! ! my celiac husband loves it and he doens't feel like his missng out	8
1	these are fresh and have just the right amount of licorice flavor they are much softer than most black licorice and are easy to chew this is the best licorice i have ever had bar none ! the bag is huge ! haribo really knows how to make candy	8
1	tellicherry pepper at this price is remarkable the product is excellent if a little difficult to pour from the large mouth into a small grinder otherwise great	8
1	agave nectar makes an exellant sweetner for cooking as well as for teas agave is better for your health than refined sugars and other manufacturedsweeteners on the market today my only wish is that will soon be available in larger containers for bulk sales and use thanks e	8
1	this product is the best no aftertaste it 's organic and has a low glycemic value i use it in beverages it 's lighter than honey in this bottle it squirts out easily i seem to require a less amount than honey or raw sugar to gain the same sweetness this is for the light easy storage and does not change consistency over time the regular might be heavier and could require even less for same sweetness	8
1	since going on the candida diet i 've had to find sugar substitutes for most things and this agave has been a fantastic replacement we 've even used it instead of sugar in some baking and it 's worked out great	8
1	i like the nutiva hemp protein a great protein source that is easier to digest than whey and also provides half of the daily required amount of fiber ca n't beat that ! it wo n't leave you feeling heavy and bloated like whey sometimes can i like the taste and texture too mixes great with cranberry juice cranberries stevia ice and water ! i add some berry green for extra energy and nutrients ! it 's my morning breakfast	8
1	i 've been using nutiva products for years now and the protein powder is wonderful i add it to a smoothie in the morning and it keeps me going for hours it 's a staple in my diet so i usually have one or two jars on hand i highly recommend it	8
1	i love the taste of this hemp protein powder i love to mush up bananas with a fork add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the nutiva hemp seeds it tastes great and satisfies me on every level i also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands i could n't believe when i saw that there was 14 grams per serving considering that 90 of americans are lacking in fiber this protein powder can be a great service to millions	8
1	i mix this with orange juice berries and a banana in the blender and it tastes great it took some time to get used to the grainy texture but it is much better than soy or whey protein	8
1	we recently ordered a case of this cereal from amazon and are down to our last box now ! my husband and daughter have celiac and i do n't but i eat more of it than they do it 's really that good	8
1	my kids have tried i think all the gluten wheat free ones and by far this is their favorite they stay hard in milk and i an adult even like them	8
1	i love this cereal it is crunch and filling as well as great tasting was very upset when stores stopped carrying it so i was very happy that amazon carries it many of my friends buy this also	8
1	smart monkey is my favorite brand of raw food bars they have so much flavor compared to the brands you find in the grocery store ! well done to whomever came up with the recipe you are a smart monkey	8
1	rather mild but pleasant tasting coffee typically consistent brewing	8
1	thanks for carrying this coffee our local stores only carry the medium roast cappuccino it 's nice that you carry such a variety	8
1	i loved the idea and ease of the senseo but i was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted the grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety so i decided to take a chance and order the columbia blend from amazon i have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what i had been getting if you are up for a change and want a smoother flavor but still a strong tasting coffee give it a try ! i will note that the bag only comes with 16 pods vs 18 in the regular bags	8
1	i am a coffee afficionado ! i'm a pickey coffee drinker and only use a french press to make my coffee from the freshest beans i can find i keep my coffee beans in the refrigerator and grind them fresh moments before making my daily cup of coffee ! this coffee was great and i have tried a million different brands ! ! ! organic and fair trade is important to me ! ! ! thanks for the extra effort ! i wish the big guys would make this kind of effort ! ! !	8
1	my husband 's favorite jerky used to buy single bag \( much higher price \) for special treat for him just wish he would not go through eight bags so quickly	8
1	these snacks are crunchy and mildly peppery the taste resembles that of cottage cheese a little under salted for my taste but still great watch out for blobs of undissolved jalape o mix you probably do not want to bite into those	8
1	i 've tried a lot of cold coffee drinks and this one wins on all counts \( even over frappacino \) i have to have one every afternoon for a 'pick me up' treat ! you will love this i'm on my 2nd case	8
1	if you need a boost its here ! ! tastes great and gives immediant energy ! i love it	8
1	i bought this tea chest for my father he loves it and it 's a good deal for the money it 's the perfect storage solution and a pleasant way to select your morning teabag too recommended	8
1	this cake mix is absolutely awesome very easy to prepare and is ohhh so good for those of us who have to avoid glutens in our diet sometimes baked goods just are n't at all tasty but this one is so good my husband who is not gluten sensitive eats it and says he ca n't tell any difference from the regular spice cake mixes will definitely be buying more of these	8
1	i have bought these krackers before at our local health food store and was delighted to see that they could be delivered to my door i received my shipment of these delicious spelt flatbread krackers this week however the sell by date on each package is a week old they seem to be fresh enough now but i am wondering about how long they will keep past the sell by date it also makes me wonder about other amazon orders and the sell by dates on them i will be wary of ordering other items with a short shelf life	8
1	hazelnuts are tasty a 4 pack is twice as many as you 'd expect as part of a single package	8
1	great way to pass the day at work fresh and tasty	8
1	these are as good as the ones you buy in the store i was concerned about the quality but was happy to see that they are the same as those purchased locally great price with discounts most stores carry them for 1 99 for a 5 oz packet	8
1	in europe you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet a great source of omega 3 oil you can improve your health by eating these tasty nutty seeds they are good for the gut and good for the heart the golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut brown seeds they look nice in baked goods like lighter breads they taste the same as the dark seeds ground they do n't show up in white bread so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber we like them sprinkled on oatmeal muesli or yogurt	8
1	this is a good price for this amount of quality licorice this is the traditional dutch concoction containing a strong salt taste and smell not for everyone the taste of this product is less sweet but more long lasting than the licorice candies we are used to eating in america if you know you like this strongly flavored licorice this is a bargain	8
1	double salt licorice is a very scary flavor for the uninitiated people do n't like it the first time then start to crave it if they stay with the taste if one does n't like this licorice it 's great to serve to unwanted guests	8
1	my kids like these just as much and i feel better giving them organic products \( the chemicals and pesticide herbicide residues in non organic foods make me nervous why take a chance when organics are n't that much more expensive anymore \? \) yes the cereal is n't artificially fortified with vitamins minerals but my kids get a high quality multi vitamin every day so there 's really no worry add a serving of fruit to increase the nutrition i also add a little protein powder to the milk since getting a protein boost in the morning is very important for sustained physical and mental energy	8
1	this is a wonderful \( and healthful \) snack crispy and tasty and low in calories each bag equals 1 2 cup of fresh fruit and the dried crunchiness of these seems to intensify the flavor of the fruits there is also enough substance to meet the munchies moments i highly recommend these	8
1	it 's a great new \( at least for me \) crystal light flavor my husband loves it	8
1	i tried to order this here but was sent tang instead when i informed them of the problem they resent the order and again i got tang their system seems confused by the tangerine description or they 're just not very bright at the warehouse i 've had this flavor before and it is good not too sweet and a bit tart refreshing	8
1	the stores near my house charge over 2 a box for the organic type half of me thinks it 's great to have it avail on demand through amazon for cheaper the other half is ashamed to waste the fossil fuel on a special trip to my house i think annie 's should be able to make their product a little cheaper by now it 's pretty dang popular oh well the alfredo variety is n't avail thru amazon right now anyway so i'm stuck \( again \) watching for sales and stocking up which makes the formerly ashamed half of me happy	8
1	i bought this for my wife who has many food allergies she cannot have wheat or items containg gluten this is one of the best products i have found its crunchy and tastes great it seems that most things we buy for her lack one thing or another this product has it all i even like it she absoultely loved it and i am out of the dog house for as long as it lasts	8
1	i have been drinking starbucks espresso but decided to give this a try i am so glad i did this is by far the best espresso i ever had and yea even better than starbucks	8
1	once i tried illy everything else tasted just ok truly an excellent coffee flavor smooth not bitter of overly strong and the price is lower than any store i 've check and even better than ordering directly from illy at a price of 13 per can i was ordering five cans at a time to get free shipping i love that i only have to order two at a time and it 's delivered to my door !	8
1	these instant potatoes are very tasty and so simple and fast to make a nice buttery flavor and all you need is water will be buying more	8
1	my kids love mashed potatoes these are sooo easy no melting butter just add hot water we love to have these as a midnight snack just add shredded cheese and some sliced green onion and ummmmmm good would have given them 5 stars but they 're not quite as creamy as hoped	8
1	great product what else can i say \? while i lived in the caribbean i ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there	8
1	good texture good taste on the ahi tuna almost as good as beef jerky avoid the salmon jerky most of the strips were hard and brittle some were so tough they were barely edible more fit for my dog also the salmon was too spicy	8
1	i eat these right out of the package they are easy to put in my lunch box the flavor is great i never warm them up but they would probably be even better if you did i really like the sauce they are in no complaints i just like em great taste do n't take up much space but very filling highly recommend	8
1	and i 've tried quite a few i tried over 30 varieties of green tea bags searching for a good cup and this one takes the crumpet ! the flavor is strong but mild the color golden brown and the aroma is light i threw out all the others \( or rather i gave them to my father in law who also like tea \) when i found this one and i bought a case of it	8
1	this is a great change from the canola oil and shortening ! ! when i first got it i pan fried some fish in it and it was really delicious does n't add a lot of extra taste that you might think also think it 's not as stinky when frying as other oils then i had to try it on my popcorn oh that is really wonderful only problem i had is in delivery the oil was n't sealed well enough and it got warm enough during delivery to become somewhat liquid some of the liquid leaked out in the box just a warning if you live in a warm climate area	8
1	i wont go into the quality of this product or the nutritional benefits as i think the 4 5 stars and the customer reviews speak for themselves however i think you will find the 54 oz for 20 bucks is the best deal on the internet especially when you buy two and choose the super saver shipping option i would challenge anybody to find a better deal for pure coconut oil of the same quality	8
1	they give 1 of all profit off the top to charity and activism truly awesome company	8
1	love this great substitute for shortening keeps baked goods moister and is excellent for cooking eggs and vegetables	8
1	i first had these in alaska and when i returned my taste buds could n't stop thinking about them ! they are a great alternative to fast foods	8
1	these are really great they are very sour when eaten alone but amazingly good in cereal or oatmeal a great fruit to have on hand especially when they are out of season	8
1	i love the way the fruit rehydrates in the milk in my breakfast cereal absolutely delicious	8
1	these are truly good gluten free cookies we have recently made the switch over to a casein free \( milk free \) gluten free diet for the sake of my son he is already a picky eater so i was worried about the transition these cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served \( ie in church school etc \) he is particularly enamored with them because they have kid friendly animal imprints being gluten free they do tend to break more which can be upsetting for young kids but they taste so good he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces	8
1	we use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church we consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes i like how easy they are to use no mess no tamping i am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily	8
1	over the course of one day while at my work desk as other reviewers noted they are light buttery and delicious ! i'm using the second box for homemade \( sorta' \) ice crem sandwiches they are so tasty they really are fine plain now i wished i had ordered several cases when they were on sale for 12 but maybe then i 'd eat too many	8
1	these butter waffles are very tasty very light yet rich and buttery they 're hard to resist could n't help but eat a whole box only downside is that it uses vanillin rather than real vanilla however it goes great with ice cream and fruits	8
1	from where i should start ! from the amazing taste the nice smell or the natural ingredients do you know \? try it and tell me your opinion	8
1	this product is a great evening tea to help you relax and gently eases you too sleep before this i was taking harsh medicines like tylenol pm 's and such and always woke up feeling worse than before i went to bed ! not with the tea ! let me clarify it will not knock you out but just help to relax you	8
1	we 've enjoyed this sparkling meyer lemon juice enough that we 've reordered it we love the sparkling blood orange and cranberry juice combo but it 's nice to have some variety the meyer lemon flavor comes through very clearly and is quite refreshing we also like the light sparkling quality of the juice this juice makes an excellent mixer for drinks	8
1	i tried this drink with some friends and everybody loved it the meyer lemon is very distinct and has a great taste essn meyer lemon makes the best lemon drop ever i would highly recommend essn for your next event or party ! !	8
1	nice clean meyer lemon flavor these lemons are just a tad bitter and have more sweetness than any other lemon chefs love using these lemons in recipes this flavor also makes a great lemon drop	8
1	this is my favorite cereal ever since i started eating only organic i picked this up one day and i love it i eat it every morning for breakfast	8
1	makes an excellent cup of coffee with eye opening aroma and better yet profits from this fair trade company are invested in an orphanage in the community where the beans are grown so drink a whole pot	8
1	having tried senseo pods millstone etc i was surprised that good old folgers is just as good and in some cases better than senseo 's newer flavors while made for the home cafe these fit senseo coffee makers and give you a good cup for a lot less than the more upscale brands	8
1	these are great and taste just like the real thing	8
1	never guess these are wheat free ! whole family loves them will continue to purchase	8
1	product arrived when it was supposed and exactly as in the ad i'm glad i ordered item	8
1	this kenya blend is a mild but very tasteful coffee no burned taste at all and it has become my favorite	8
1	good servive faor price this coffee could be a bit stronger to my tast	8
1	as with all newman 's own products you find great quality with what you 've purchased and also good value paul newman has given over 150 million in thousands of charaties worldwide since the establishing of the newman 's own line one box of these raisins is 130 calories with zero fat cholestrol it 's a good healthy snack to have around and enjoy from time to time	8
1	my kids love these lollipops ! so does my husband ! the flavors are great and they are the perfect size not too big and not too small they taste better than the other artificial ones you find at the grocery stores	8
1	these are the best tasting lollipops you will ever have because of my 2 year olds food allergies i discovered these and now her doctors office is purchasing them even the hospital my husband works at these are allergy free and amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	8
1	i 've been making holiday turkeys for over 30 years this year for the first time i used turkey perfect and without a doubt this was the best moistest most flavorful turkey i 've ever done i told a friend about this product she called me to rave about her absolutely delicious turkey even relatives who do n't really like turkey went back for seconds and thirds for the first time ever we had no turkey leftovers this year	8
1	this soup is delicious ! unfortunately it makes a bit much for one person but it is a good leftover very tasty	8
1	we really like these the lemon flavor is heavenly the cookies are crisp and light very very good	8
1	i was introduced to these when i bought a can at a big lots store and found that they were so good that i went on line and bought a case i highly recommend this brand to anyone liking sardines stan re	8
1	small no sugar a bit harsh tasting \( might end up better diluted a bit with club soda \) this is pretty well true of the four i have tried but in some ways the harsh tasting is good the 12 pack can be doled out at one per day per person does act as herbal medicine \? i have no idea but it 's very nice to have a treat that i do n't really want to consume all of in one sitting like for instance gummy bears	8
1	we bought these because there was an online coupon for them my children \( ages 11 and 14 \) take lunches to school and i was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices the price was right and with the free shipping when going over 25 it was hard to resist the fries are light and airy like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor they are a nice change and we 're really enjoying them	8
1	i love these things amazon is the only place i found to order these cheddar fries the 1 oz bag is the perfect snack size especially for those on ww each 1 oz bag is 3 points not bad for a junk food snack ! ! awesome price and fast delivery	8
1	this is a really delicious natural alternative to other frosted flake types of cereal and you cannot beat the amazon price	8
1	the other review was strictly from a nutritional standpoint and did not address taste where i agree nutrition is very important when you have a child with celiac disease or food allergies finding something that they will like to eat is a huge challenge ! ! this cereal is excellent for taste consistancy and it is gluten free ! if you need something for breakfast before school give them this and a multivitamin !	8
1	this is a good granola i like that it has lots of seeds with the grainy things and a few nuts tossed in nice taste thanks to amazon for carrying so many gluten free items ! makes like so much easier ! !	8
1	this granola is delicious being that it 's gluten free is a bonus since it 's so hard to find acceptable healthy foods within that diet but my family can eat whatever they want and they could n't stop eating it ! the cranberries bring a wonderful touch of sweetness to the nuts and crunchies this is a great treat to keep with you when you want a more substantial snack	8
1	i feel better serving this mac cheese than all the others out there no artificial colors or flavors and it tastes great ! cheese sauce is on the salty side so i throw a bit of my own pasta in with the shells to cut sodium content	8
1	tastes very good in my oppinion and in the oppionons of two of my friends who tried this product too not exceptionally great \( hence the 4 stars \) but good enough to enjoy eating big pieces of meat and plenty of it plus it 's all natural including the beef which was not from hormone fed cows which is also important in my oppinion would buy again	8
1	i loved the taste but the beef was quite dry it 's very easy to heat up and probably would be great for a college student as an emergency meal	8
1	if it were not for the fact that these nuts were not packaged properly they would be rated at least a 5 i called the manufacturer and they told me it must have been at the factory they were not full cans none were full to the top but two of the cans were not even half full the manufacturer sent me two coupons for the two cans that were about half full i felt the whole order should have been replaced but two cans is better than none as i said the product was excellent but i would not spend the money again to possibly get the quantity i got well all i can say is nuts to that gail napolitan	8
1	i love orange pineapple had these before getting more from amazon these are great as expected !	8
1	orange pineapple has been my favorite flavor for years when it 's out of stock at my local supermarket i go out and look for it it 's the best	8
1	the beautiful cobalt blue package contains deep dark shiny coffee beans that release a rich and robust flavor ideal for the real coffee lover the price ca n't be beat for organic coffee of this quality i will continue to buy it from amazon com	8
1	i had read other 's reviews about how great this coffee was but i was using another coffee that i thought was really wonderful i tried this one and now i am hooked it is wonderful if you like bold coffee which i do i also like the fact that it is organic i do n't drink a lot of coffee each day but the cup or two i have i want to be great just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee	8
1	this coffee is awesome ! the aroma and taste are like a little bit of heaven for a french roast aficionado like me ! the price is great and the shipping is quick i am really glad to see that it is organic as well this sure leaves that pricey brand in the dust	8
1	none of that super sugared candied dried fruit or flat tasting candy e g chocolate chips to mess up a yummy but healthy snack do n't get me wrong i love chocolate the darker the better but what they put in trail mixes is worse than nothing if i want candy i 'll buy the good stuff thanks amazon my local market no longer carries it	8
1	this has the perfect blend of sweet and salty combination without the guilt	8
1	i do n't normally review items but i had to write something on this because all of these it 's too salty comments are driving me crazy these are hardly salty at all there is far more salt in potatoe chips or popcorn or basically any other snack food my bag says its only 8 of your daily sodium which is much lower than you would think from the comments people are leaving i'm a man so i personally think these could use more salt	8
1	i used to love just corn but i like this brand even better i agree they could cut the salt a bit but i think some salt is a nice compliment to the corn	8
1	this is my new obsession i am a voracious snacker i love corn on the cob this tastes just like it only 70 calories per package i never thought i 'd be writing a review about corn but i like it i am going to try the other varities of this line	8
1	delicious and crunchy with a slightly sweet blueberry flavor healthy ingredients no added refined sugar and no wheat great product	8
1	these only take 1 minute to make the noodles are already expanded as in not dry they taste great and i dont feel like i just ate fast food when i finish one of them or two	8
1	this annie chun 's udon soup is very easy to prepare i do n't think the first step is necessary either just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1 2 minutes add the sauce packet the noodles loosen up after you stir it if you what a more filling soup add meat vegetables my kids and i really love this soup ! i just purchased more from amazon because it 's a better buy here than at the grocery store	8
1	i started to love annie chun 's udon soup in march 2007 although it was on my amazon grocery list for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great i just ordered many a chun 's soup noodle bowls and i will order more again in future annie chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on amazon com	8
1	ever feel like you want that little something with your tea or coffee but you abstain because you 're on a diet \? that was a problem for me at least i 've been trying to avoid white sugar and white flour in an effort to lose weight well just when i 'd about given up finding a suitably healthy alternative along came dr kracker spelt muesli crackers ! they are all natural contain no white flour or sugar do have some dried fruit for that right amount of sweetness that makes them satisfying as an accompaniment for coffee or tea ! highly recommended	8
1	was visiting my daughter and found these wonderful habit forming crunchy with a hint of sweet crackers i do n't want to eat anything else now ! hope i can get them where i live in ny soon	8
1	this is decent rice with a lemony herb flavor that is pleasant it 's a bit heavier than fresh cooked or frozen rice but works great in a rushed day	8
1	he did not know if he would but he loves them great for a quick snack or a snack to go please do n't quit selling these glad we bought them and will buy more	8
1	these are yummy vegan treats but they are kinda small for 120 calories and 4 5 grams of fat but they are a good snack	8
1	they taste so great i had to limit how many my kids could eat each day	8
1	just like all the other betty lou 's products i 've tried \( and become hooked on \) these are delicious individually wrapped they are a convenient and nutritious treat to take anywhere so good	8
1	even non celiac people should switch over here 's an amazing gravy for chicken or pork chops try it next time and serve next to mashed potatoes 2c water and 1 2c mix bring to gentle boil over high heat remove from heat immediately stir in 1 4c sour cream pour over meat browned in a skillet simmer on lowest heat until meat is cooked through turning and stirring often to prevent skorching hmmmm i'm getting hungry	8
1	i 've been gluten free for 5 years \( due to my son 1 1 2 personally \) i always had trouble duplicating my favorite casseroles because of them needing cream of mushroom soup concentrated with this mix i mix double the amount to the water so each container makes 3 instead of 6 and it tastes just as good as the gluten variety ! i have n't tried it as just a soup but it 's the only thing i 'll use in casseroles	8
1	i have used this cake mix many many times the first time my daughter made it for me for my birthday she said she thought it would be difficult to make it with a hand mixer but was a snap with my large stand mixer i have since made it many times and it is a favorite for birthday parties in our office even though i am the only gluten free person i add fresh orange juice and peel instead of the vanilla and serve it with strawberries or fresh fruit and whip cream yummy	8
1	this stuff is great and we ca n't find it in our grocery store in galveston co texas now i do n't have to wait until we fly to the northwest ! very cool	8
1	love this stuff great for adding invisible fiber supplements to as well no after taste at all	8
1	these are great ! very smooth and yummy the only thing is i think they are a little to sweet for me i just add a little more coffee and a tad of milk then they 're perfect ! i 'll buy them again for sure	8
1	i am a big fan of coffee other than water it 's all i drink so when i found this i had to run with it it 's cheaper than red bull has more power than it it 's better for you than red bull and it has a nice flavor that does not leave an aftertaste my frig is stocked with as i type !	8
1	both bags that i received were quite tender and had great flavor not too sweet and not too spicy i will definately be ordering some more my dog mr doodles also loves it	8
1	this was a very tender jerky it 's not the kind that wrenches at your teeth if you 're looking for hard core jerky look elsewhere back in my youth i used to love that sort of thing but with the sensitive teeth i have now i need to show a little discretion this jerky was great it was tasty it had a little heat which i appreciated the only drawback were the spice there 's something really hard in the spice mix that nearly broke my teeth on more than one occasion there 's 2 bags but it went fast it was that good	8
1	after reading that bentley 's has the finest ceylon teas in the world i decided to give this as a christmas gift to my husband he says it is the best tea he 's ever had and since he is somewhat of a tea connoisseur i would consider that a compliment the box is beautiful and it makes a lovely presentation	8
1	this drink mix is really good it tastes just like other drink mixes but is only five calories it is definately a good choice they also have other flavors such as lemonade peach tea raspberry ice pink lemonade and more	8
1	this mac cheese is really creamy without tasting processed and it has the right amount of salt very good product overall	8
1	this is real italian espresso the best you can find on the market if you have an espresso machine and know how to use it then you got it made rich flavor and sweet at the same time i 've known this product all my life growing in italy excellent the very best	8
1	i love the pod idea makes cleaning so much easier this is perfect for a quick shot of espresso after dinner excellent	8
1	wow no wonder you ca n't get this anymore they probably ca n't make them fast enough this is such an unusual gift set the pot is so cute as well as being a nifty display item the teas are all individually packaged and ones that you would n't find anywhere else makes you want to drink tea all day the box that it comes in \( as well as the individual tea box \) is reuseable and so pretty i hope that this item is offered for sale again soon as i would buy a dozen of these to keep on hand for gifts and maybe one for myself ! !	8
1	this is an incredible set for tea and some incredible tea at more than half the price it is a nice organic store you might find it at \( no offense to organic stores but a 200 mark up is a little much \) this tea is the best ive ever had great for a gift as well id get one for yourself and a couple for birthdays and whatever comin up	8
1	great for novelty gifts but do n't give it to true tea lovers ! ! ! different kinds of flowering tea look great very entertaining to watch bloom but taste pretty crummy i would say most of them taste somewhere between stale and tasteless nevertheless it 's a nice gift because of the experience and the cool box glass pot you get to keep	8
1	a great alternative to the junk filled mainstream variety i am hoping they come out with a regular flavor as well as the chocolate	8
1	when my kids started kindergarten they needed to pack a lunch everyday my wife realized that this was a teaching opportunity about nutrition making the right choices and responsibility each day the kids pack their own lunches from lunch box central each lunch must contain a protein \( usually yogurt \) a grain \( some form of cracker or grain filled bar \) and a fruit \( apple banana or fruit cup \) envirokidz organic crispy rice bars are a staple in lunch box central they 're convenient the kids enjoy them and they 're a reasonably healthy choice the kids are happy they 're learning and they 're eating well my wife is pretty smart	8
1	great taste and value ! it taste best with a high quality honey ! a must for tea drinkers	8
1	i love this popcorn and this was such a bargin price compared to store price thanks amazon ! ! !	8
1	i love this popcorn but ca n't find it locally thank goodness i found it online so i can still get it	8
1	it is so good to taste popcorn that tastes as if it were taken right out of a pot of boiling water buttered and salted to taste the smell of corn on the cob runs throughout the house great summer smell all year long	8
1	this spread is way too good ! my husband and i have both tried spreading it on toast but it really stands alone i like to eat it just straight out of the jar the spread is a perfect blend of flavors if you have a sweet tooth and do n't always have other sweets on hand a spoon of this stuff will satisfy all your cravings unfortunately this spread has no nutritional value to speak of so i doubt i will order it again 6 jars is plenty for us you have to order it at least once though !	8
1	very good not a rich dessert by any means but a healthy filling snack my kids really like them and while they are n't low calorie or really low fat it is n't full of sugar and it contains healthy fat the 5 grams of protein per serving really help with making you feel full	8
1	i love the iced jasmine tea at our local vietnamese restaurant in fact every vietnamese restaurant seems to serve the same wonderful tea i have tried many different brands tyring to find one like the one served in vietnames restaurants light in color a light tea taste and a strong jasmine taste and scent i finally found my brand	8
1	i just bought some of this golden nut crunch from planter 's last week and i snack on it at work it is really one of the best trail mixes i have had before i love it it lasts a while also it lasted me about 4 days at work just snacking on it periodically i would definitely recommend this snack it 's healthy too	8
1	i love these bars ! i highly recommend these for a quick breakfast on the way to work	8
1	considering you get at least twice as much jerky per dollar than the other brands out there this is a good pick i did n't find any grit in it it might have a few pieces that are tougher but not really even that tough this is a good deal	8
1	our family loves these balls they are very similar in taste and texture to the cheddar pirate booty maybe a little crunchier they 're by no means healthy for you but you feel a little less guilty no fake orange coloring etc	8
1	these cookies do not taste like they ever saw the inside of a box they taste like real butter and fresh ingredients and they just about melt in your mouth i 'll be buying these again	8
1	i 've tried the andy capp hot fries reg cheddar and white cheddar these hot fries are the best they 're the best of the 3 products and best all on their own ! i'm getting addicted to them \( ordered a second carton before finishing the first \) definitely nicely hot that 's part of the addictive quality and an enjoyable to eat with the good underlying corn flavor and non greasy crispness that i like about the andy capp products	8
1	this seller shipping was very quick and the product was perfect ! i highly recommend this seller	8
1	my wife hates hot food but for some reason loves hot fries if her salsa has the tiniest spice she wo n't eat it yet these mouth burning beasts are her favorite snack they are sometimes hard to find having them by the case helps solve that problem the size offered here is the size that you will normally find \( around here at least \) printed with the 99c price so you can also figure the price savings somewhere around what 40 \? wow	8
1	pacific foods beef stew is wonderful for hot lunches at work inexpensively the all organic ingredients make the pacific foods very tasty and filling ! way to g	8
1	these things are so satisfying on many levels chewy crunchy sweet but not too just the right size with whey protein for energy which is the best source there is all that and organic peanut butter and organic agave syrup too i am so happy i have a whole tub of them	8
1	these peanut butter balls not only taste great but they are good for you my daughter has celiac disease so foods like these are really blessings in our life i have eaten these when i did not have time for lunch they are filling and energizing and taste delicious you ca n't ask for more than that !	8
1	let me count the ways they 're great for a quick energizing snack breakfast healthy dessert and tonight i even had one for dinner they are delicious and you feel good about eating them because they 're good for you ! plus you get a lot of bang for a deceptively tiny ball they 're very filling and only about 200 calories genius	8
1	high quality refined balance and intriguing flavor two thumbs up form people who like to cook	8
1	i thought this was great but it just was n't as competitively priced as i would have hoped for buying a case from amazon so delicious though when i make it for people they ca n't believe it 's a mix	8
1	this frosting is great ! it tastes good and has a wonderful consistency if you use room temp margerine and mix for a little longer than stated it actually tastes almost fluffy the vanilla is good but the chocolate is the best i 've every had hands down and i have no allergies ! this product is a easy and convient for those of us who have children with food allergies and all his friends enjoyed it at school	8
1	i thought these were amazing my favorite is the socorro blend a review said they were soggy but i'm not sure what they mean they are very crisp with nice and chewy fruit despite the fruit they are n't sweet but the sweet in the fruit really balances out the hotness of the other seasoning as for the price these are expensive nuts and high quality ingredients the flavors are unusual but perfect i am defiantly going to order more	8
1	unusual and fresh tasting i really really enjoyed these nut blends i will definitely order them again	8
1	sahale snacks were a pleasant surprise they 're not over sweet nor over hot and they 've got a lot of flavor and texture over all i 'd say they 're among the best snacks you can buy not only in terms of taste and freshness but because they 're far healthier than a lot of the stuff you find on the grocery shelves however the price is pretty high for the amount you get even at the substantially reduced price of the variety pack it 's a little high however for the occasional treat it 's well worth the price it 's just not the sort of snack you can dump into a bowl and pass around while watching movies	8
1	i am ordering more of these goodies they are not only delicious and top quality they are the most interesting assortment i have ever had and are great for my sensitive stomach too ! very excellent price as well !	8
1	i'm placing my second order for the variety pack because i liked every flavor and appreciated the variety all have a sensational blend of flavors spicy sweet salty without being overpowering truly delicious and healthy munchables i'm so glad i decided to try out a package in my supermarket	8
1	what a deal ! great tasting treat at a good price ! i will definetly be ordering other flavors and killarney again too	8
1	arrived in 4 days best price i 've found flavorful coffee	8
1	if you are looking for a healthy high fiber cereal that tastes good and does n't have too much sugar this is it ! i love this stuff	8
1	the product is pretty good but is only 10 calories less that the optimum power which has blueberries in it it is a healthy and fairly satisfying cereal but not my favorite	8
1	great nutrition profile for the calories involved the different textures make for a healthy organic snack	8
1	the back to nature graham sticks honey are delicious ! they are a great tasty snack there 's no way you can eat 'em without a cup of milk not because they 're rich but they 're a little on the dry side i still like them so much that i quit buying them at the supermarket started buying them in bulk	8
1	these are wonderful cookies ! however the reason i could n't give a full 5 stars was because so many of the boxes in the case had a lot of crumbled cookies the boxes were not damaged in any way so i am guessing they could have been packaged that way not cool ! otherwise they are much better tasting than oreos in my opinion i 'll never go back to those	8
1	these cookies are great my kids love them i saved a bundle by ordering the case beware though i also ordered the peanut butter flavor in july06 and when they arrived at the end of july the expiration date on the case was aug06 i did n't have any problems with the classic the expiration date was nov or dec i ca n't remember off hand	8
1	my family prefers the blue agave to the lighter colored and sweeter agaves we use it to make raw truffles \( sooo good \) and on top of pancakes and waffles cereal rice pudding etc we had no problems with shipments leaking so far	8
1	by far the best no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels worth every penny	8
1	because of health problems i 've had to give up sugar the agave organic sweetener in my morning cup of coffee has been a perfect substitute i also use it with cereals and any other food or drink where i used to use sugar thank you blue agave	8
1	this is a great product for a mother of five it made my mornings and some snack times wonderful thanks	8
1	my kids and i love the variety of cereals this assorted package has comes with a bowl ready to eat in plus you can recycle the bowl	8
1	i bought this to simplify our morning routines and save them from pouring large bowls and throwing it away the kids loved the choices the only downside was the portions were extremely small even for my 4 year old on average they ate two a day	8
1	this case offers a great variety of favorite cereals for everyone but this is not for 2 people the cereal went stale before we could eat it but this would be great for a large family	8
1	i recently have become more health conscious and am trying to eat more organic foods staying away from hydrogenated oils corn syrup etc you know all the stuff that makes you fat \) this jerky is a great healthy lowfat snack ! ! it tastes so amazing you 'll never go back to any previously bought brand of jerky again i love jerky and have tried many different brands this jerky is well worth every penny and i 'll keep coming back for more thanks amazon for making it affordable	8
1	this is the best frosting i have ever had and i do n't have food allergies i used it on the gluten free cherrybrook cupcakes and my son 's teacher pulled me aside to tell me how wonderful they were she also send people to me for the recipe i love all the cherrybrook products but this is my favorite	8
1	full flavored and smooth lingering winey aftertastes never bitter tolerates higher concentrations very well actually enhancing body and complexity of flavors those who are unfamiliar with bean coffee should be reminded to use about 1 3 more by volume to get the same amount by weight as with pre ground coffees	8
1	these might appease your sweet tooth while providing excellent nutrition in a 200 calorie natural food bar they are not overly chocolately like those chocolate covered protein bars the bar has delicious chocolate throughout with a terrific crunch of sesame flax and sunflower seeds i'm hypoglycemic and they are perfect to keep in the car for the quick pick up to prevent the need for glucose and a true crisis i highly recommend oh i have ordered both from nutiva and from amazon amazon is less expensive and faster delivery	8
1	tastey and straong for a bag tea it really works as a sleep aid it does have ingredents that may aggravate sensitive people	8
1	i highly recomend this product to those who are able to use herbal treatments it helped me greatly in getting a more sound sleep	8
1	there are all kinds of things that i will eat for health 's sake but my husband is more taste oriented there are a lot of energy bars etc that he wo n't eat but he loves these	8
1	my family and my healthfood store lady all say this is one of the best of betty lou 's nut butter balls i do not have any problems at all with the taste in fact it beats the heck out of the coconut ones which are extremely sweet yes they look green in the middle but we found the taste rather clean and refreshing not overbearing you will also enjoy the lift in your energy level these spirulina ginseng balls provide now that i know about these little guys i am getting ready to buy tons for christmas gifts ! we would not be without them anymore	8
1	this cereal taste delicious the chocolate pieces are not supper sweet and the chocolate is rather dark which goes well with the cereal	8
1	we enjoyed this coffee however decaf may still contain some caffeine i was watching a news report about disturbed sleep studies and the medical staff at the center stated that not all caffeine is eliminated in decaf good to know if you have trouble sleeping or with the jitters	8
1	this is an excellant product cooks up very well great with any sauces mac'n cheese and also makes a fantastic macaroni salad the price from amazon was really a bargain as all gluten free foods are so very very expensive i just wish we did n't have to buy so many packages as storage becomes a problem	8
1	nothing like this in the usual grocery stores splenda sweetened to help keep the calories down great texture and just plain good ! i want to try the other flavors soon	8
1	the cereal is delicious i put half of a banana in it it is fulling for me it is low in carbs and no sugar i am pre diabetic my sugar count is very good with this i will need them again soon	8
1	do n't think i'm weird but essentially the only thing i have at all to eat regardless of what time is nature 's path cereal the heritage collection is my favorite wholesome filling crunchy perfect	8
1	hearty great tasting cereal has a whole grain flavor originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals \( which is better for my reduced carb diet \) but it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through amazon com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores	8
1	this is one of my favorite cereals ! it appears to be nutritionally superior to the heritage o 's and less crunchy the only downside to this cereal is that it does n't keep me full for long i feel like an hour later i'm hungry again i 've combated this by adding banana slices or blueberries to add some bulk to my bowl in hopes of more lasting power an upside to the 'downside' is that this makes a terrific between meals snack ! i have no problem with polishing off all six boxes in a timely manne	8
1	i'm happy with the product and the swiftness of the delivery for sure i will be ordering again very soo	8
1	these are my most favorite of all the smart monkey bars and raw bars in general the best part is they are not dehydrated so they still have the live water content try to stay away from too much dehydrated food i'm an avid raw foodist i absolutely love these i can eat three in a row	8
1	it is hard to believe all you do is add water and then enjoy the best mustard	8
1	this is the best mustard i have ever had in my life ! prepared mustard you buy in the store does n't even come close to this mustard when you make it according to the directions on the container ! strong hint of horseradish caught me off guard at first but i love horseradish so this mustard is the best ! i will never buy prepared mustard from the staore again ! thank you	8
1	this is the best mac and cheese on the market just try it its rich and creamy and all organic and as healthy cheese and pasta can possibly be amazon also has a very reasonable price on this to stock your pantry	8
1	my son literally shakes with delight when i offer him this snack its also a healthy alternative to other fruit snacks out there so it keeps mom happy too	8
1	someone told me to look on amazon to locate this product it 's great as a broth but also for gravy and jazzing up beef and poultry entrees' the taste is out of this world and so easy to make i inject the turkey broth into the turkey before cooking and it enhances the flavor added bonus since the holidays are just around the corner thank you for having this product on amazon	8
1	to using bouillon cubes once you 've used and tasted this great product you 'll also wonder why you 've been taking pantry space for years with cartons and cans this is an amazingly simple and easy to use packaging concept \( no scissors no can opener \) for a first rate chicken broth with a really deep home made taste the beef version is excellent too	8
1	the only better broth i 've had was homemade by my hubby ! my daughter will even heat it for a quick snack i love it	8
1	i have always been pretty picky about my poptarts so i was n't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when i first got them they are great poptarts my kids love them	8
1	i'm french and i love these galettes they are the typical kind of cookies you can find in brittany \( bretagne \) with a light salted butter taste i like the tin too you can keep it to store whatever you like ! make a great gift to french cookies lovers	8
1	tasted ok better than the other pure bran thingsand great source of fibe	8
1	granted this is not one of the better tasting cereals but when you consider that it will provide the daily recommendation of fiber in just 2 3 cup the trade off is worthwhile if there is an easier way to get 26 grams of fiber i have n't found it just be aware that if you prefer sugary sweet cereals this definitely is not the one for you	8
1	this cereal is a wonderful \( better \) choice instead of the chex line of cereals it has more fiber organic ingredients and no bht excellent as both a cereal w milk and also when used as part of a homemade trail mix	8
1	this is a great cereal it is very similar to crispex only a whole lot better for you	8
1	we love this product in our house and it has helped me \( mom \) kick the diet soda habit i add my soluble fiber and other powdered supplements and i am on my way ! very true lemonade taste with no aftertaste at all	8
1	from where i should start ! from the amazing taste the nice smell or the natural ingredients do you know \? try it and tell me your opinion	8
1	i 've tried 15 20 different k cups and would rate timothy 's parisian night \( can you say french roast \) in the top third at the 7 25 oz setting it makes a full bodied dark brew with a nutty almost earthy taste it 's very much a european style blend and with a dash of half and half makes a passable viennese 'brauner	8
1	we love our keurig maching and this coffee is rich dark and delicious very smooth and strong yum	8
1	the crystal light iced tea brand tastes better than all the regular sugared as well as the low calorie sweetened teas if you like it a bit sweeter put an extra pack of splenda in it	8
1	i tried a two lb pack and then ordered this for a reorder tart cherries great for oatmeal and sauses as well as snack	8
1	this product is the most flavorful and savory tasting broth i have ever tasted it is excellent as a cup of broth or a gravy base	8
1	full of good health goodies ! lots of fiber omega 3 flaxseed cooks fast i use the stove top method add raisins and pecans	8
1	i discovered nature's path organic heritage flakes cereal while i stayed in seattle wa for almost 6 months in the year 2000 i fell in love with it wholesome good taste and organic back in los angeles i had difficulty finding it in traditional health food stores last october i received an e mail from offering food items among them my beloved cereal right away i order 6 bags each of 32 oz i received it a few days after and ever since i feel very happy to get back to this wonderful combination of cereals besides that i'm getting economies of scale with the 32 oz compared to the 13 oz box i used to buy at the health food stores	8
1	i think my title says it all of course the packaging is not recyclable but it is at least minimal by today 's standards this is a lot of cereal for one person so i hope it has good shelf life	8
1	my favourite tea in loose leaf form it just does n't get any better than this the tins are a good size \( not so small that it 's gone after four cups of tea but not so large that it 'll be stale and moldy before you could possibly finish it \) that fit nicely in my desk at work as well as on the counter by the teapot the tea is fresh and flavourful with the quality i 've come to expect from twinings	8
1	this lady grey loose tea is a sensory experience it is light and citrusy with just the right kick of caffeine the flower petals are pretty but i cannot taste any difference they might make in the steeped tea it would make a nice gift for a woman who you do n't know very well all in all it is worth a try	8
1	lady grey is practically the only tea my family and i drink first we bought it because of cornflowers which are kinda symbol of russia where i was born but we stayed with it for the taste try it cold with lemon it 's amazing	8
1	i ca n't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea the bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary the color and aroma are just lovely making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery i carry the bagged variety everywhere i go	8
1	if you hav n't tried lady grey try it and then buy the loose leaf at this price you wo n't regret it this is one of the best everyday teas i 've found with a healthy dash of citrus and a flowery finish with no cloying flavors it really is a good all around tea for any time of the day buying it on amazon saves a lot of time trying to find it in stock and it arrived faster than the books i ordered at the same time	8
1	this is a great product and was better then i expected i needed a large quantity and working through amazon was great i was a little disappointed in the packaging because the box was basically open due to poorly placed tape but being able to track the package was great	8
1	this tea really does help with stress i just sort of takes the edge off i have been drinking it for years and was very happy to find it at a good price on amazon	8
1	is very similar to raspberry teas found at your favorite eateries we found it necessary to drink with our sweetener a refreshing drink but has a slight after taste to it maybe making this tea in large quantity is what did it \( 4 qts \) i would have rated a 5 but taste was a little off	8
1	economical way to purchase a cold brew tea that has natural flavoring easy to make and tastes great no guilt with this drink	8
1	these teas \( both the raspberry and the blueberry \) are priced lower than in the grocery store \( 3 49 per individual box \) where they are usually a seasonal item this is frustrating since my husband and i are hooked on them and probably brew and drink a full pitcher per day they are the best tasting cold ice teas and great for the antioxidant benefits this seller shipped them promptly and they were very well packed we will be a repeat buyer for sure a ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	8
1	i really like this cereal by nature 's path it is very good and tasty however i just found a new favorite which is the zen version with cranberries and ginger i highly recommend both of them though the optimum has more fiber and has a completely different taste then the zen so if you need to change it up go for this one too	8
1	i love this cereal it is the greatest and looks like amazon offers the best price i like to add frozen wild blueberries to it with milk yum	8
1	and mild just a hint of fruitiness the white tea is n't as bold as green but equally as or better for you	8
1	do n't mind the reviewer saying it tastes nasty it 's quite good and as with any tea you can brew it as light as you want i do n't think this tea is too strong at all i brew it with the hottest water i can for as long as i can it 's a very healthy tasty beneficial tea highly recommended	8
1	i am a true fan of all things ginger and this tea is wonderful very warming and spicy	8
1	high in protein low in calories and great flavor i split them in half and eat the first portion as a mid morning snack and the second portion as an afternoon snack they keep me feeling full and prevent me from eating junk food which has been great for my waistline i ca n't say enough good things about kashi	8
1	they 're a quick fix and they taste incredible best protein bar around	8
1	i love kashi stuff and this bar is no exception there have just a greattaste not too sweet no funny aftertaste and very satisfying wheneaten between meals highly recommended	8
1	tastes too good to actually be healthy sound too good to be true \? i thought so but it is really true nice job kashi if you have never eaten kashi products you are in for a treat there are some i like better than others but for food that is good for you it is a pleasant surprise	8
1	i'm on no wheat dairy or sugar diet restrictions and this is my treat that i really look forward to \( sometimes every day ! \) thank you nana 's ! and the price is great from amazon	8
1	these are the only cookies i have found that i can safely eat without feeling poorly afterwards and which taste similar to a real chocolate chip cookie i try to limit refined sugars wheat flour and dairy products in my diet for health reasons but oh how i miss cookies the ones i bake myself just do n't taste that great but these chocolate chip cookies from nana 's help me keep to my prescribed way of eating i do n't know what i 'd do without them ! i like to freeze them and sometimes i top one with a bit of rice dream ice cream on top yummy !	8
1	we love this cereal it is nice and crunchy and it does n't leave you hungry for another bowl like the over processed cereals in boxes i definately will buy this again	8
1	i ordered these lorna doone 100 calorie cookies from amazon because they can not keep them on the shelves at any grocery store around my area i even called a friend 45 miles away and he couldnt find them either you should try them they taste great without the extra junk in them my kids love them 2 \)	8
1	the dried berries arrived promptly and in good condition we thought they were moist and tasty	8
1	i found a package of these berries first at costco in arvada colorado and found these to be the best dried fruit i 've ever had i 've since requested at my local costco \( honolulu hawaii \) that they carry these and i keep waiting and waiting i was thrilled to find these on the amazon website and ordered four bags right away thank you for carrying it	8
1	this is a dream ! quick brew and blueberry ! it 's slightly slower brewing than plain lipton quick brew tea but it does brew up in about three minutes it 's definitely blueberry flavored and it 's a little red in color for we impatient flavored tea lovers this is a great product	8
1	this is one of the best tasting teas i have used keeps well in the refrigerator for two days retaining its excellent flavor i reccommend this tea to everyone and have shared with many family and friends	8
1	these are very good biscotti ! i've ordered 4 boxes of 12 in the past few months they were nice to give as gifts they were good to bring to someones house for dessert the chocolate decadence and the ones with the toffee bits and almonds are very good the only negative is the shipping and handling cost if i did not get the free shipping and handling i would not have ordered them they're good but not good enough to spend an extra 20 to deliver	8
1	i was looking for a crispy crunchy not too sweet flavorful biscotti this prduct certainlyn fills the bill	8
1	twinings orange pekoe tea is a delightful smooth tea it delivers a pleasing cup of tea without acid harshnest yet it is full of flavor and rich amber color a good choice in the evening or anytime you want to pamper yourself with pleasure it 's a tea to be savored	8
1	love these as a snack when the day wears on great quality and taste	8
1	green is good of course but what 's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies pn os beat the bootie out of any oreo variation crunchier more filling \( without being smarmy \) much better taste \( and this goes for the mint the vanilla and the chocolate \) fast eddie felson i love you	8
1	these cookies are superb all by themselves far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more keep out of reach of children	8
1	my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream these are a bit softer than the o 's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat ! \) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too yummy	8
1	how often do you eat a parsnip \? well i do n't make the opportunity very often so i'm thrilled to see parsnips in my fancy black snack chip bag vastly superior to corn or standard potato chips no trans fats colorful too delicious dipped in hummus made by a division of hain for you health food business knowledge nuts	8
1	these are a great deal cost 2 75 per box they are 3 99 per box at our local grocery store they are also very tasty and a healthy snack our whole family loves them i worried about buying a case just seemed like a lot but they are going fast and if you are box top saving people there is one on every box ! so they are good for schools too !	8
1	for rich deep flavor without tasting burned or smelling like chemicals these beans ca n't be beat nor can the pura vida company 's mission look into it	8
1	this is a great tasting coffee i highly recommend it as it is shade grown and fair trade certified	8
1	normally delicious product but amazon sent an expired batch the second time i ordered this item that was not the only time i received old expired or damaged batches from amazon grocery i really hesitate to do business with amazon you just never know what you will actually get	8
1	i have been a fan of jack links turkey jerky for about 5 years now ever since i first tried it all time favorite snack ! ! only jack links brand any other kind of turkey jerkey i have tried has been blah to say the least highly recomend ! ! ohh skip there ham jerkey and a1 sauce new products though eek	8
1	my kids love these i do n't mind the figs are the only part that are organic my kids will only eat these and not the other brand	8
1	i'm not exactly sure how good these are for you \? \? \? but i do know they taste great ! ! i bought these because i never have time for breakfast in the morning and i'm also sort of a choco holic and these with coffee or better yet hot chocolate are excellent !	8
1	for flavor i could give these cookies a 5 but the health aspects demand that they only rate a 4 all told they taste great and are the best on the go lunch i have found for hubby \( he often eats on the run \) the price is right and it keeps him from cruising though the nearest drive though	8
1	these things are great i love baker 's breakfast cookies this flavor is pretty darn good too big chunks of chocolate and lots of flavor does n't taste fake at all i prefer a couple other flavors more but this is definately a winner these cookies taste like a treat but are really healthy for you they will fill you up for hours especially with a glass of water juice or milk to wash it down	8
1	these cookies are a nice break from the run of the mill granola bar based on oatmeal not too sweet filling great value i would purchase again	8
1	this is a nice tea not bitter i do n't need any honey or sweetner at all i 'll be getting more of this for sure	8
1	without a doubt this is the easiest buttermilk buscuit mix i 've ever used super simple super fast ! you wo n't be sorry you bought this	8
1	my mother absolutely loves this tea it 's the only kind she will use i received a container of it in a gift basket and called bentley to find out where i could purchase more and they told me they do n't sell to the public my mom was very upset i then went on to amazon \( which was great for all my christmas shopping \) who put me in touch with bently so my mother had a wonderful christmas ! ! !	8
1	what other food is 120 calories \( only 25 from fat \) and 5 grams of fiber or 20 of your daily value \? an ideal breakfast or snack just one fills you up a lot and i must stress that they are delicious	8
1	i do n't like plain coffee but even more i do n't need or like all the calories and fat that come with using flavored coffee creamers even the sugar free creamers have a ton of fat part of which is hydrogenated partially hydrogenated flavor blends for coffee are a wonderful alternative to fatty creamers easy to use and they come in portable small packages you can take with you anywhere this is not a creamer but more a flavored sugar one packet gives a yummy subtle hazelnut flavor but without being too sweet the way some things with splenda are	8
1	this is a pretty good splenda flavor but the mocha is best in my opinion the french vanilla is a second favorite hazelnut is better than no flavor at all i use one flavored packet and one regular splenda packet in a large \( 14 oz \) mug and it 's perfect not necessary to use two flavored ones as it is a little pricey and one has enough flavor for an entire travel mug	8
1	when i am short of time and want a fast side dish i make these and my family loves them when i do n't have time to peel dice boil potatoes these save the day teens can prepare them with ease too we like all varieties and they taste great	8
1	these are the best banana chips i 've ever had and the dried cherries are a great combination ! i would highly recommend this product	8
1	i orginally bought this for my youngest daughter who loves this product soon after my husband was hooked and has been eating it for breakfast every morning since ! another great deal on amazon we buy it regularl	8
1	this tastes and looks like the real thing \( wheat semolina \) my kids ca n't tell the difference i'm not wasting my time sampling all of the others now	8
1	these are great take a little longer to cook than wheat spaghetti and you must strain them but other than that you cant tell any difference	8
1	i liked this so much i gave some as gifts to friends \( before i polished it all off \) i am better able to stick with reasonable and healthy portions at my evening meal if i can look forward to a little treat later in the evening i serve it in a small cup that will hold a third of a box satisfying and healthy what a deal	8
1	i tried most of jack links' products i will classified this one as good but i personally prefer beef nuggets since it tasted juicier	8
1	these do taste almost like the biscuits at red lobster they are so easy to make and so delicious ! i have a muffin maker and they cook perfectly in about 10 minutes	8
1	we bought this bulk box because we drink a lot of tea it 's a great bargain if you 're a tea drinker ! ! ! \)	8
1	this is mine and my husbands favorite tea it has such a smooth satisfying taste we have tried about all the earl grey teas and this is the best we ca n't always find it so when i found it on amazon i was elated being able to buy it in the 50 count boxes \( pack of 6 \) was just what we were looking for and we will continue to buy it here thanks amazon	8
1	these colombian d'ordado pods work well in my krups home cafe machine the overall flavor is good i do like my coffee a little stronger so i use 2 of these pods and the two 6 ounce cup setting for a nice big mug of morning coffee	8
1	this is a very good value i use it to put in many asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth the result is a more authentic asian taste to my recipes	8
1	we ordered 4 jars and love it it has great flavor and is on the spicy side it is easily frozen in the plastic containers the 20 oz size is just about perfect for our family of 5	8
1	i ordered this sauce which is very good and very spicy the only drawback is that when i opened the package one jar had cracked and leaked \( a real mess \) amazon sent a replacement and the same thing happened because they were not shrink wrapped first they were loose in the box with just some bubble wrap	8
1	typical of central italy this sauce has the characteristic of being hot after all arrabbiata means mad in italian although tolerance to spiciness is very subjective this sauce will not overwhelm your palate enjoy this beautiful blend of flavors the freshness of parsley a hint of hand picked organic marjoram and the madness of the habanero recipe suggestions excellent as a dip for shrimp or chips spicy and delicious over tacos quesadillas or any mexican dish unexpectedly delicious over chicken cutlet or poached fish grilled vegetables au gratin or saut ed portabella mushroom ! we 've also added it to a seafood bouillabaisse for a fantastic dinner party idea	8
1	i love this mac cheese it has all of the comfort food aspects of easy mac \( warm and gooey orange cheese \) but without that vague chemical aftertaste it tastes so cheddar cheesey and is wonderful to keep on hand for those days when there is just no food in the fridge \( you do n't even need to add milk to this ! \) my favorite comfort food when i'm sick	8
1	annie 's homegrown deluxe shells real aged wisconsin cheddar is the best mac n cheese straight out of the box i ever tasted kids and grown ups agree a note to the other reviewers do n't try to ruin my mac n cheese comfort food experience with your cardboard tastin' whole wheat pasta and no salt sauce if you 're so inclined to have it just how you would make it go ahead and make your own it 's just mac n cheese after all	8
1	my children and i agree this is the best tasting mac and cheese on the market this is a great price too about 1 30 a box less than i usually pay when kids are eating several boxes a week that adds up quickly i do agree with the other reviewer about the ways this mac and cheese could be even closer to perfection but i have one child who is very careful about what she will and will not eat and for her this product is a gift highly recommended	8
1	beautiful and easy to use ! the grater stays sharp after many uses and guests always ask about it i wish it came with a dish to put the salts in it would make a great gift if it came with a decorative dish	8
1	these cherries are large and plump and may need to be chopped for your recipe	8
1	shipping was fast and cherries were great the best dried cherries we have bought	8
1	i do not understand the bad reviews of this product they smelled great had a nice texture and tasted like a dried cherry should they did not clump at all like many dried fruits out there do they also did not taste like cardboard or were dried like nasa space food like some of the dried fruit out there does i use these in my tea i chop them up and toss in my vanilla ice cream and i eat them straight out of the bag these are the best dried cherries i have ever eaten	8
1	the price was great it arrived quickly and it was exactly what i ordered great deal and great service	8
1	i am a devoted earl grey tea drinker and have enjoyed earl grey tea all over the world ahmad tea has been my favorite for years i'm so pleased to be able to obtain it through amazon i used to have to carry it by the suitcaseful back from london to stock up	8
1	i bought select items to include with other items in gift bags for christmas the ahmad selection teas make two excellent cups per bag everyone receiving the tea commented on the fine quality of the product highly recommended !	8
1	i had been using sweetleaf before buying it at the local super market health food section buying here is around a 50 savings this product works so great at sweetening with no better after taste i just love that it is a natural product	8
1	a delicious nutritious cereal that rebounds energy at breakfast or for a quick snack very vegan and very good	8
1	this is a deliciously smooth tasting coffee rich flavor and no acid stomach ! i 've had a hard time getting it locally and amazon has saved me	8
1	this is the only type of microwave popcorn we buy it tastes like a high quality popcorn my husband i love the flavor	8
1	if you are ever in the mood for summer sausage but do n't feel like cutting a piece off of a large log these are the ticket they have a great taste and are the perfect the snack ! highly recommended !	8
1	for those of you who like the addition of briny olives and capers to your sauce here is the answer what a great balance of flavors and a quick and easy yet delicious dinner alternative	8
1	adding another italian classic to our product line puttanesca comes from the expression puttanaio which to put it modestly translates into a lot of things going on at the same time the rich combination of flavors garlic black olives capers and fresh herbs come from the tradition of southern regional cooking recipe suggestions use it over pasta or to add some spice to chicken fish or your relationship just heat and serve or bake it in try mixing it in with scrambled eggs rolled in pita bread for a brunch alternative ! the favorite \? grill or pan sear swordfish and pour it on	8
1	this pasta is very good it works great in salads casseroles or regular pasta dishes i 've only been gluten free for a few months and i think this tastes very similar to wheat pasta granted i 've only tried one other kind of gluten free pasta \( made all of brown rice \) but this pasta is far better and i like it enough that i feel no need to keep shopping around and trying other kinds	8
1	excellent coffee good value plus you are aiding the growers which is a big plus	8
1	dried fruit \? the point of debate here is dried fruit these are delicious i ate many many handfuls each serving their more like gum drops because of the sugar added by infusion i'm suprised that the oil does not factor into the flavor at all not a typical dried fruit highly reccomended ! !	8
1	these things are so delicious i think that we have gone through 2 bags already put them in your cereal ice cream yogart and any other place you can think of i keep a bay by my bedside for those nite time muchies	8
1	oh my good god these are quite possibly the most delicious things i have ever eaten in my life i came across these raspberries last year at a costco here in socal and then to my dismay they recently stopped carrying them i 've since been searching everywhere and i am thrilled to finally find them here ! no other brand of dried fruit can compare their blueberries and cherries are also excellent \( and i usually do n't care for either \) highly highly highly recommended !	8
1	this sauce is so delicious ! it 's full of good ingredients and has a great shelf life my husband and i ca n't get enough of this sauce	8
1	i recently used it over a few smoked sable fillets tasty ! we also like the marinara so versatile flavorful and convenient	8
1	what a great line of sauces the scarpetta brand brings to the table i have tried all of them and the time saving of having these already in my kitchen is very helpful i am able to put a what seems to be a different slow cooked italian meal on the table each night in just minutes the flavor profile of each of the scarpetta brands is unique and tastes truly homemade you can feel the love that went onto each sauce try them you wo n't regret it	8
1	first i 'd like to say that many of nana 's cookies are most delicious and i 've tried most of the flavors my favorites tend to be this one and the chocolate coconut chip as one of the other reviewers pointed out you have to have a particular palate to enjoy this type of cookie for those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions vegan sugar substitutes etc these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we 've been led to believe we want thanks nana 's for the natural foodie options	8
1	i used to have a hard time getting my kids to eat fruit until we tried the just tomatoes products now i have a hard time getting them not to eat the whole tub in one sitting to have a picky eater eat all the fruits from this company is amazing to me i love them too great for a quick low calorie healthy snack	8
1	our dog loves these treats and we love how good they are for him amazon has also been the best deal we 've gotten for them petsmart petco are a lot more expensive and do n't have all the flavor choices	8
1	these are great our vegan golden retriever seems to love them \( and is very healthy \) the cows pigs chicks are pretty darn happy she 's eating veggie treats the treats are organic and newman 's donates the profits to charities ! now that 's a win win win win ! i only gave them 4 stars since the bags are so small and cause a lot of packaging waste which newman 's should be well aware of \( why should we have to buy 6 packs of 10 oz bags instead of 30 oz or 60 oz bags \) \? when that 's resolved they 're getting 5 stars from me	8
1	excellent our dogs love them we have small dogs so the size is perfect little hearts for little dog	8
1	my little cockapoo loves newman 's own dog treats especially the peanut butter flavor she 'll usually eat anything but i feel better about giving her treats that are healthy organic and made with high quality ingredients that i could eat no by products here ! great price highly recommended	8
1	my husband and i like to buy newman 's products we love their cookies so we thought our dogs might like them too so we got these dog treats and the love them they 're even shaped like hearts ! they come with 6 bags so they 'll last a while but they 're packaged so they wo n't go stale	8
1	great for cooking really tasty and handy only drawback is having to order 12 but they keep try to split with a friend	8
1	i use plenty of this product regularly when making ice cream cookies cakes etc i find that this product has a sort of natural sweetness or flavor on its own because of this much less added sugar is needed in baked goodies and in some cases added sugar is eliminated to obtain this i use this organic unsweetened coconut in combination with organic whole milk	8
1	these are the perfect snack for on the go actual real fruit no sugar ! no roll ups with 10 fruit ! they are not dry or leathery and even little kids can chew them well just the right size for toddlers and small kids \( and moms too \) great to stick in the diaper bag or purse for an impromptu healthy snack works in any weather \( wo n't melt \) and even survives at the bottom of the purse ! comes in lots of flavors an organic version and bigger bars too for a bigger snack cheaper than lesser products at the grocery store great !	8
1	i used these to add to a christmas gift basket filled with special cocoa mix spiced tea mix fancy jam spread and three or four scones for family and friends and unexpected company everyone loved them and i had apackage or tow left for myself and they are delicious they are such a good value for the money and an exdciting addition for these gift boxes	8
1	we just love nonni 's biscotti products especially the limone ! it 's always refreshing not too sweet not too tart finding them on amazon was exciting because we have n't found them locally since coming to florida the product offered by amazon was also a great bargain	8
1	this is a delicately flavored not too sweet treat just the right thing for that mid morning coffe break and indivdully packaged for convenient transportation to work	8
1	this is a great alternative to chicken soup if you get sick it will alkalinize you blood and help to get better much faster than you would normally do also try it in the morning instead of your regular cup of java it will perk you up without the jitters of caffeine true it has a lot of solium but this sodium is from sea salt that brings with it much needed trace minerals the seaweed veriety is the best open minded and adventurous folks will love it right away for others it may take some time to get used to do try your body will thank you	8
1	looks like it got squashed a little and i guess somebody opened the package because i think there was supposed to be a seal there since this is new but i checked everything inside it counted all of the peices and everything was there i tried one and its great this is a good buy for what you get i just got a damaged package but its not damaged that badly just the outside is a bit squased overhaull 4 stars out of 5 i will buy here again fast delivery thank	8
1	i received the correct item in a timely manner and it was organic my kids love them \( as do i \) i love finding healthy snacks that do n't have any additives or junk in them	8
1	i even drink it when im at home i carry a few in my make up case and when im away from home and thirsty instead of buying a soda full of sugar i buy a bottle of water and add the small pack and ready ! ! a delicious low calorie sugar less drink and this flavor is specially delicious ! !	8

1	these are my husbands favorite thing to eat thank you for making available at such a great discoun	8
1	the product if reviewed just on taste would only warrant a two but the convenience is worth a five it is probably the best la briute product that i have found it is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable but it is way too salty	8
1	unlike the december 2006 review and much like the most recent reviews there 's not much in this soup other than very small bits of seafood and some potato i'm thinking that 1 \) the recent quality has gone downhill or 2 \) the december 2006 review was a plant anyway the taste was okay but it definitely does n't rate up there with legal seafood \( which i 've had at one of the restaurants and at the boston airport both much better than this \)	8
1	this is the best home style sushi kit you get the basics excellent rice sushi wrap sheets soy sauce i made these added thin sliced cucumber smoked salmon in the rolls as i assembled them the best ! ! ! ! the possibilities are endless ! ! ! ! try it you 'll see sometime i can be all thumbs but this was very easy the quality of the food was excellent	8
1	quite tasty ! no flavorings in the rice but still a very nice light lunch can be a bit messy for those of us who are not skilled sushi roll wrappers i was planning on making this a regular part of my pantry but see that the price has just gone up changing it from a good value to not enough food for the money if the price goes down i 'll buy it again but not for 15 dollars a six pack	8
1	to get you through to your next meal my children and i love this flavor and it really tastes like peanut butter	8
1	pretty good solid peanut butter taste and no digestive problem i enjoyed them for hiking and biking i do n't recommend them near water because when wet they taste not so good good snack for kids when hungry and its better for them then sugarly things	8
1	my husband loves ensavor garlic chicken stew he loves the taste the convenience and the fact that it is made for diabetics my husband is pre diabetic and is on a medically supervised diet for his condition he keeps ensavor in his office for lunch in his briefcase for meals out with clients and takes it with him when he travels it 's a great product	8
1	i just finished up my first bag of this coffee it 's great i normally buy starbucks breakfast blend just so you know for comparisons purpose but i am switching to this brand it 's just the perfect blend for me smooth but strong enough to wake me up	8
1	if you like almonds and cruchy granola bars these bars are for you they are higher in fat than i would like them to be but they are delicious great for a quick breakfast or snack there are 2 bars in each packett and i usually eat one for breakfast and then one later for a snack	8

1	this broth tastes just like roast beef rich delicious and full of flavor some may think it 's a little salty so taste your food before seasoning with extra salt i'm definitely going to buy more because it is so easy to turn into broth and takes up much less cupboard space than the boxes of stocks excellent product	8
1	i bought these nuts for my wife as she likes hazelnuts she seems to love this brand and she snacks on these nuts very often my only complaint about these nuts is the price but then everything that is good costs money	8
1	we love this product we use it in granola and in making the best chocolate hazelnut bark ever	8
1	last weekend as a volunteer at vegfest i had the absolute pleasure of getting to sample all three sauces for four hours i worked alongside the creator of these heavenly cooking sauces the wonderful thing about them is that they are not only delicious but are also so simply to use recipes are on the sides of the jars and they allow you the freedom to choose your favorite foods i ca n't recommend them highly enough	8
1	great substitute for high fat potato chips good amount of soy protein \( 6g per serving \) excellent flavor good crunch and texture these are actually pretty healthy and a great substitute for someone looking for a low fat diet no trans or saturated fats my wife and young daughter who do not need a low fat diet as i do love these woohoo	8
1	i love black pepper and have only recently discovered sea salt as a very tasty addition to foods and i like soy products and i am sorry to say a potato chip junkie so when i saw the description of these potato soy crisps i had to order them to try them boy am i glad i did ! they are very good right out of the bag but they are almost in the shape of little bowls so dips and spreads even cream soups can be scooped up in them they go with everything ! nice fresh taste too this one will be a staple in my pantry	8
1	i brought a few bags to a work day in may and people are still asking me about them because you ca n't buy them in stores around here they 're a cross between the soy version of rice cakes and potato chips but people eat them by the handful like potato chips but instead of making you sluggish like a bag of chips the soy protein gives you energy	8
1	i love this pasta ! it only takes three minutes to cook and has a great flavor i would prefer a 100 whole wheat pasta but this tastes so good i will continue to purchase this	8
1	the southwestern spanish flavor is pleasant but not overpowering and the rice is fluffy not clumpy like other brands i always keep a pouch in my car and at the office for when i do n't have time to get out for lunch and in my suitcase for when i need a late night snack while travelling we always take viva la rice when camping backpacking or boating this is an excellent product at a very fair price	8
1	my kids really like to eat this as an after school or late night snack however they like it best when it has been heated for 90 seconds instead of the 60 seconds recommended on the package my oldest takes it to high school as part of his lunch because it is so quick and he has only 30 min for lunch	8
1	the best tasting lollipops the fact they are organic is a huge plus our main focus in our house is to be free of chemical dyes and these fit the bill they have been a hit with my kids and all the other children we have shared them with	8

1	thse are the best lollipops i have ever tried organic or not the flavors are delicious honestly i would highly reccommend them to anyone !	8

1	i was n't sure about this as i normally buy green tea it is a very pleasant tea it smells great and is light	8
1	i was hesitant to buy this tea since all of the lipton brand teas i have tried have a musty taste and odor to me but the idea of a mango and peach flavored tea \( my two favorite fruits \) was irrisitable to me i am so glad i gave it a try the scent was incredible and the taste just as good with a little honey it was one of the best cups of tea i have ever had	8
1	its a shame they quit carrying it i would have reordered twice by now	8
1	nutritious soft delicious organic zero trans fats whole grain hempfor fiber omega 3 's and some protein we just love em ! !	8
1	these bars are terrific very moist unlike many other snack bars they are quite tastey and my kids really like them too	8
1	my son loves the yankees so i thought these were great when i saw them on teh website my son loves finding them as a surprise in his lunchbox	8
1	this product is great for those meals when you have no time or patience for a larger meal plan and it is so handy for any camping or trips where vegetarian food may be scarce it can be added to any rice or noodle dish or eaten plain with vegetables the taste is pleasing	8
1	these airforce drinks have reasonable flavors and clear attributions as to their ingredients additionally they seem to provide a little nutritional support beyond the comfort provided by functioning as a polite treat i like this mandarin mint flavor the most but all are pretty good the small red bull style cans look chic in the refrigerator and are a lovely rather special no trouble hospitality offering for guests and visitors	8
1	i was a little surprised i'm not a huge fan of packaged rice or noodle dishes but sometimes i need to throw together something quickly i was intrigued by the list of ingredients and decided to give fox river rice creole a try i'm glad i did ! this is seriously good stuff lots of flavor easy to prepare etc best of all it 's not overly salty one of my pet peeves with packaged food it 's great as a side dish but i think it would also be wonderful with a little dded sausage \( maybe some andouille \) i 'll definitely be purchasing this again	8
1	my children love smart puffs i love the smaller packages for school lunches	8
1	this is a tasty on the go snack if you are lucky enough to get good fresh batch the last bunch i got wasnt as enjoyable as i was used to i realised it was because it lacked crunch would buy it again though great guilt free snack great for kids too	8
1	these are sweet and crunchy and i love them my only concern is the price at a dollar a piece it 's a little more than my buget allows for a snack luckily one packet is usually big enough for me to split for my kids	8
1	full bodied and flavorful make the medium cup for a smooth and mellow cup of java if you make the tall it will be alittle weak	8
1	of the gloria jean coffees mudslide is my favorite good taste when used with the keurig b70 and the 9 25 oz size brew i am on my 2nd order over 50 k cups made and have never had a misfire the previous reviewer simply had a bad batch	8
1	this jerky is awesome ! great shape extremely good taste \( kind of sweet for jerky but very tasty \) and very healthy \( no nitrites no msg no hormones etc \) try it	8
1	anyone who thinks cereal is boring for breakfast has n't tried this one it 's so tasty yet also healthy it 's my favorite but lately has been impossible to find kellogg 's is missing the boat by not giving this cereal a top notch advertising campaign because once people try this cereal they 're hooked ! now if we could only get it back on the grocery shelves or the online grocery again \( are you listening amazon \? \? \) in the words of another old commercial try it you 'll like it !	8
1	i was never big on cereals until i tried this one now i'm hooked thisis a very flavorable cereal with a nice mix of strawberries and blueberries it 's great for anytime you have the munchies but do n't want to eat empty calories it 's also the best of all the cereals thatadd fruit	8
1	we 1st found this coffee at a local store the local store decided not to carry it anymore and we were without it until we found that amazon sold it it has a good aroma and taste plus it is organic as well	8
1	this is the first gluten free product i found that my daughter likes perhaps likes is n't the right word she eats large helpings every time i serve it for a little variety i put some broccoli cuts or carrots right into the mix this is the favorite in our household	8
1	another viva la rice ready to eat product that is delicious with just the right amount of flavor and great texture ! i do n't know how they do it but it is just right in size to take to work camping or to have at home	8
1	these brownies have a wonderful chocolate flavor and i can eat them without worrying about hydrogenated oils preservatives unnatural colors or flavors because there are n't any ! so far i have made two batches neither batch came out perfectly chewy the first batch came out a little hard but the 2nd batch was better than the 1st and i think i'm getting the hang of it this is better than anything else i 've tried i had given up on the other commercial mixes due to additives so this is a great treat	8
1	these brownies are pure and natural being all organic there is no chemical flavor that is usually present in boxed brownie mixes this mix makes a delicious batch of chewy chocolate heaven you can taste the richness of the real organic ingredients i urge you to try a box a chocolate lovers dream	8
1	if you are looking for gluten free cereal that is not sweet this is the one it tastes like corn flakes and holds milk well	8
1	the number of palatable gluten free cereal flakes is quite limited and they are usually quite expensive this cereal costs 7 00 bag at my local health food store one needs a place to store a case of 26 oz bags but it 's worth it to buy from amazon com by the case	8
1	when it comes to prepared cereals this has to be one of the best manufactured in north america in terms of value for money that it is also delicious and that it does n't go soggy as soon as you pour on the milk are two more good reasons to try and buy mesa sunrise and if you are concerned about all that other stuff mentioned described with words like organic kosher gluten free and so on then by all means enjoy the extra feelings of vindication	8
1	i hate oatmeal i am not an oatmeal person i 've tried lots of different brands and flavors because i like the health benefits of eating oatmeal i bought this because of the flax seeds and wanting to incorporate more omega 3 fatty acids in my diet but what i got was a pleasant surprize this is a good tasting oatmeal i heat it up and add soymilk at the end to the consistancy that i like	8
1	this instant oatmeal is the only one i have had that tastes like real oatmeal it does not have that artificial taste that most instant oatmeals have	8
1	this bruschetta topping is made from perfectly ripe tomatoes and capers and has a full baslamic base note the chuncky texture is perfect for those who would prefer home made but the quality is as good or superior to the sauces i 've made at home i like the other flavors of pasta sauce too but the bruschetta topping is my favorite for its chunky texture ripe fruit and deft balance of seasonings	8
1	unbelievably rich and chocolaty without sugar ! no artificial sweetener aftertaste i like that it 's low fat and high in calcium plus the canister \( instead of individual packets \) lets you vary the portion to match the size of your mug or your strength preference yummy on a cool day	8
1	this is my first freeze dried fruits experience fruits are very sweet except the kiwi was a little tart i have tried other fruits from the same merchant pleased and just received the apples i will slowly try the rest of flavors need to say more	8
1	i like flavored coffees but not my husband that 's part of why we got keurig maker have started trying the different flavors and this is the dessert y kind of flavor i'm looking for \( and my other top favorite so far is green mountain 's caramel vanilla cream \) been making it on the 8oz mug setting and just fine	8
1	this is a wonderful tea aromatic smooth and robust i have n't come across a better earl grey yet	8
1	this is in my opinion by far the best earl grey tea in the market loose tea is significantly better in taste than the tea bags from the same manufacturer the 6 pack is a great deal	8
1	the opportunity to get twinings earl grey in large containers at a very reasonable price was too good to pass up	8
1	outstanding full flavored earl grey tea better than the other non branded earl grey teas	8
1	these are great the whole family loves them and they have 5 mg fiber per package really tasty nice and crunchy i have several boxes of them in the car for when the little ones need a little something when we are on the go other snack ideas include those little raisin boxes \( but then raisins get everywhere \) and packages of dried fruit \( which seem to work pretty well since they are not as sticky as raisins \) these all bran snack bites really go over well and they are much healthier than candy i sure wish amazon would sell these online	8
1	these are a delicious and nutritious snack ! my husband who would otherwise never eat such a thing wolfs these down because they are so scrumptious the all bran bars are great too keep up the good work kellogg	8
1	quickly became my favorite when it first came out tastes great and the milk does n't turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals i also use it on ice cream to add crunch i would give it 5 stars but even though it think it 's great it is overpriced price here is about the same as out local safeway	8
1	my family always enjoys mini wheats and this shipment was no exception everything was just as tasty as store bought i have recommended amazon to family and friends when i had a question amazon was right there to solve the problem	8
1	finally a gf cf granola ! this stuff is amazing ! i got it for my husband and daughter \( 2 \) who are gf cf but i love this stuff too ! and i am truly not a nuts and seed person but i ca n't stop eating it ! i'm so happy to be able to give my daughter a snack that has such great protein in it and is so easy to eat ! my husband is just going to keep a bag in his car to snack on	8
1	my was addicted to all kinds of cheese crackers when she had to go gluten free we searched for some adequate substitute while they are not cheddar goldfish crackers they are very tasty and satisfying	8
1	tastes great and the price was good	8
1	my wife loves strong coffee this is the only k cup that did the trick for her makes a good bold cup of coffee	8
1	excellent replacement for the campbells condensed soup i am able to cook gluten free for a crowd and no one can tell the difference with this simple substitution it is the best	8
1	this is an excellent source for omegas and efasand also great tasting all the benefits with out the drive to the healthfood store and their high markup on the price fantastic product from outside the us because ofuneconomic gullible politician false impressions	8
1	nutty taste this good for you oil makes great iol based salad dressings	8
1	i was surprised to find out that amazon sold groceries and at a much better price then could be found in a supermarket a to amazon	8
1	what i like most about these muffin packs is that the whole mix only makes 6 muffins total many other mixes make 12 or more and if you have a small household you 're stuck with way too many muffins these were better than expected they are soft flavorful and baked perfectly also use a small amount of cooking spray on your muffin pans and these will pop right out of the pan after cooking it is n't the healthiest food out there but overall i 'd recommend this mix	8
1	this is simply wonderful licorice with an intense layered flavor my dad 's a long time licorice fan and this stuff gives him a big smile so he 's getting a four pack for christmas ! great texture great flavor great price	8
1	increases nutritional value of soups and smoothies and tastes almost like nuts	8
1	i first tried this product when i was studying in philadelphia i ordered it for an organic group i lead on campus and the reviews were outstanding i simply love the product and taste of the hemp seeds no trace drugs just natural nutritionally beneficial components	8
1	would highly recommend this product i 've bought it for friends even to show them that granola could be this wonderful i 've tried the flax plus also but it was n't as good as the hemp plus i would also recommend the bar form of this product which does n't seem to be on amazon currently and is a bit pricy in stores	8
1	hardley any bad ones in the whole bag i bought these through figis and theirs were terrible compared to these and had a lot of bad ones in them plus they cost more	8
1	the nuts used tasted very fresh the bite sized chunks were just right it is lightly sweetened but not too sweet very satisfying \)	8
1	these nuts are excellent just a light glaze to sweeten tham a bit	8
1	i 've enjoyed this product for several years and it was very convenient for me to be able to get it in the mail from amazon thank you	8
1	the granola bar has a high sugar content but not excessively sweet however the bar tastes good and the trace of honey is appealing it has a crunchy texture the manufacturers have added peanuts too the mixture providing a rich taste the prohibitive price makes these bars less attractive 12 bars go quick i recommending waiting until a coupon opportunity surfaces and then buying the bars in bulk the bars have good self life and make a nice addition to your food storage the bars are great for snacks for trips and a energy pickup mid morning and later in the day	8
1	these bars have an amazing mildy sweet and nutty flavor ! the bars are very crunchy and hearty in texture and are therefore super satisfying as a snack at any time of the day ! they 've been around forever and i have n't found anything new that beats them yet ! the oats n honey is our family 's favorite flavor ! we 've tried others and always gone back to the true classic ! i usually purchase ours at the local grocery store but i am in the middle of trying to figure out if amazon offers a better deal try it you 'll like it	8
1	this is a very tasty creamy hot cereal if you 're gluten sensitive give this a try after i switched to a gluten free diet i was missing oatmeal something awful i thought i would give this a try as an alternative and was glad i did ! with some brown sugar and raisins and a little imagination you can be satisfied with this cereal	8
1	these were absolutely delicious i bought them as a treat for my co workers they disappeared very quickly we could n't stop eating them and will be ordering them again they are not shiny covered almonds like we were expecting rather they are hand dipped in a lot of very good chocolate and have drizzles over the top and a flat bottom edge very fresh taste	8
1	i love swiss miss cocoa especially the little marshmallows they put in the pack the milk chocolate is great the rich chocolate has a little deeper chocolate semi sweet to darker flavor and the marshmallows are just cool great for the wintertime stock up and enjoy also great to use part of a pack in a cup of coffee get the sweetness of cocoa and the kick of coffee got me through a few late nights	8
1	they taste like graham crackers and are great portion control ! i ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it if you are counting calories this is the way to go	8
1	i bought a case of these at the same time as i purchased the cheddar fries these are smaller packages so you get more in a case these are white cheddar steak fries where the cheddar fries are thinner and longer these white cheddar steak fries are white and very cheesey and salty snack they have unique flavor and do n't taste anything like the cheddar fries at all i gave it a 4 star cause i prefer the cheddar ones better	8
1	i love andy capp steak fries but be warned about long shipping times it has been two weeks since my order and i have n't received the product i do n't know if fedex style shipping would have helped	8
1	these are slightly thicker than regular gluten cornflakes but still tasty do n't expect them to be sweet like frosted flakes they are just plain very good though and great in recipes	8
1	as anyone who has tried bahlsen hit cookies knows they are absolutely yummy despite the odd packaging and name a nice crunchy cookie not sickeningly sweet good with cream and sugar tea funny thing about the minis though both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction so that one of the sides is the wrong way with the printed side towards the cream just a sidebar no detraction from how tasty these cookies are	8
1	with free shipping using prime beats local grocery at twenty five bucks for six boxes	8
1	i have to agree best earl grey there is robust but not bitter i have tried the other brand \( s \) and none compare oh look 4 o'clock tea time	8
1	best damn earl grey on the market the bergamot is well balanced with the black tea flavor still good even if the bag is left in for 'too' long buy this tea	8
1	so delicious and so healthy fresh and crunchy much better than peanuts i love these soy nuts	8
1	we enjoyed these and they are a healthy snack they are not low calorie but very nutritious	8
1	i have tried many brands of chocolate covered toffee and i have to say virgina diner english chocolate covered toffee is one of the best ! it is very fresh and it melts in your mouth	8
1	we love popcorn as an occasional treat at night but do n't like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn we had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something this is just right low in fat no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose and organic to boot i also feel good about buying newman 's products because of the causes they support and all the money does n't go to corporate profits	8
1	this coffee is amazing we stayed at the shore club in miami beach and we had some of this coffee with our breakfast at ago restaurant hooked ever since this is the only coffee i ever drink now starbucks caribou are nothing compared to this one sip or sniff of the aroma will get you hooked forever if you ever make it out to south beach illy has a store on ocean drive	8
1	i received one of these meals after hurricane rita they were being handed out by first responders to people in the area before our utilities were restored excellent product i wanted more so i could stock up in case of another disaster or emergency i found their website and discovered that they were not for sale over the internet i was very disappointed until today i went back to their website and saw that the meals are now available from amazon ! this is great news ! i suggest that everyone stock up on these meals in case of emergencies they really come in handy	8
1	this peanut butter was wonderful ! ! smooth and creamy just like they said ! good price too	8
1	i love orville redenbacher 's sweet buttery there is no other popcorn like it i'm a little upset because they took it off the self in jersey city if i ca n't find it i will buy kettle corn second best	8
1	my title says it all a perfect blend of salty and sweet best of both worlds	8
1	the mix was a little lumpy had some hard chunks that would not dissolve they were as hard as rocks and some had to be fished out of the batter the mix was not expired it was as if it had been exposed to moisture or improper temperatures during storage still came out o k and tasted great	8
1	just tried this granola today it 's really good ! the packaging is also great just like a milk carton no broken bags or messes to deal with and really easy to pour this granola has the perfect blend of grains and just the right amount of raisins	8
1	twinings blend of ceylon and indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor in non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness brightness strength and flavor normally i would n't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses trucks and stores for long periods of time yet twinings seems to hold up well i love tea would drink 24 7 if possible and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and twinings is definetly one of them	8
1	most green teas have a grassy astringent taste to them but this tea is unbelievably smooth and slightly sweet highly recommended as are all of rishi 's ancient tree teas	8

1	we really enjoy the crackers just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of august 2006 and the expiration date on the product of november 10 2006 feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case amazon needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not otherwise they are great crackers	8
1	i first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them my daughter is allergic to soy and soy free crackers are very hard to find i bought them and to my amazement my picky husband also loves them ! he prefers them to all other similar crackers i purchased a large number of boxes \( which i keep hidden \) as they tend to disappear rather quickly	8

1	i love these snacks especially the valdosta blend the others are good but lack the crunchy punch of the valdosta it 's a great snack or salad topper delicious and good for you	8
1	no complaints on this one at all very mild and easy to drink	8
1	the kids love 'em and what could be better than that \? i bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here we tried the strawberry frosted and like other reviewers i agree not too sweet right amount of frosting ca n't wait to try the next flavor	8
1	these are our new favorite breakfast food fantastic ! ! ! ! we love them and that 's even after we 're on our second set of 12 boxes the strawberry flavoring tastes real not fake like regular pop tarts overall the taste is sweet but not overly so this flavor is better than the apple cinnamon which we have also tried definitely one of our best amazon purchases ever	8
1	satisfying and good tasting a little heavy on calories unless it is a meal replacement	8
1	very tasty and healthy product however i ordered many and discovered expiration dates when i got them some had only a couple of weeks which was not sufficient wish the date could be a lot longer and at least remind us about expiration dates in the ad	8

1	fox river rice pudding is incredibly fragrant almost overwhelming when you open the package the finished product is mellow and delicious not too rich i'm going to try it in the crock pot one of these days glad i tried it	8
1	this fox river rice pudding rocks ! quick cooking and you can adjust the consistency as i prefer it to be fluffy as opposed to creamy the cinnamon stick is a nice touch although i would not recommend this product for those of you on a high fiber diet \( like myself \) to lose weight as the overall fiber content is low it is a nice treat that is low in fat and is extremely delicious	8
1	my family really enjoyed this rice pudding i loved the real cinammon stick it gave the rice a rich flavor the aroma in the kitchen had everyone looking forward to a real treat best of all is how simple it was boil the water empty package wait 20 minutes enjoy !	8
1	just what it says all white meat individually sized portable and easy to prepare perfect alternative for tuna sala	8

1	the love at first sip pods brew a very good \( but small \) cup of coffee in the melita one cup coffee maker the directions say that you can use the pod for two cycles \( which would fill a large mug \) but that is only if you enjoy your coffee very weak this pod and system is perfect for people who only drink 1 2 cups a day and hate the waste and inconsistancy of a self measuring system	8

1	i love these crackers for several reasons they are absoutely delicious to begin with and they do not use ingredients like partially hydrogenated soybean oil they are hard to find in stores it 's a hit or miss thing here in the northeast so i ordered from amazon propmpt delivery and ease of purchasing will keep me coming back	8
1	i tried this snack tonight and it was all i could do not to eat the whole bag well the night is young so i probably will i love the flavors and the spiciness of it	8
1	i bought the variety pack and tried this flavor fourth i buy natural snacks for my kids \( freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar \) but i find them bland so i ordered these and i love this flavor in fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it it was n't too spicy for her they use black pepper which is flavorful but i would n't call it spicy	8

1	since i love kellogg 's fruit harvest with strawberries and blueberries ithought i would try this one it is good but not as flavorable as kellogg 's it also has a nice mix of berries which includes raspberries as well as strawberries and blueberries you ca n't beat the prices forboth kellogg 's and golden temple in the supermarkets amazon is the wayto go for the best prices	8
1	these are the best almonds i 've ever had though it is true that the amazon ad states they are all natural \( an error on their part not on emerald \) they are very close to it the pricing here is a bit high at our higher end market i pay 5 49 for an 11oz canister the pricing is better to buy at the store than through amazon overall but if it is convenience that sways your buying preference this comes fairly close \( about 7 8 higher \) i do highly recommend this brand	8
1	this is dark rich coffee without a bitter taste i 've had to resort to adding creamer to get through other bold dark k cups the san lorenzo is good straight up	8
1	timothys coffee is my favorite ! and the 2 packs boxes is a very good value	8

1	fast and easy to make delicious to eat and no sugar or fat ! buying in quantity is economical and efficient	8
1	i love pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are the best the taste great are really crunchy a key requirement for me and have just the right amount of salt the newman 's rounds are just as good maybe even better and as an added bonus paul newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity an unbeatable combination in my book	8
1	well what else can i say i love zatarain 's add a little sausage and you have a great quick meal	8
1	i bought these as gifts for the price you ca n't beat it the tins each had a horrible sticker on them about shipping the items as a unit i assume instructions for the warehouse packer when peeling them off a lot of residue was left behind but it easily came off with rubbing alcohol	8

1	i love twinings but 300 packets of it are a bit too much to purchase at one time there needs to be an option for smaller packaging with this product	8
1	this is one of my favorite teas this is 1 2 the cost of my grocery store and since the bags are individually wrapped freshness is not an issue	8
1	what can i say about lavazza that has n't already been said i was in rome two summer 's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets decaf is usually not so great but this is they must be doing something right	8
1	i love my tassimo ! for years i have been searching for an economical and convenient way to replicate starbucks lattes and mochas at home and this is the system that finally achived it i do n't use the latte capuccino milk pods unless i'm in dire straights it 's better to steam real milk \( search for milk steamer on amazon that 's a great product too ! \) but the espresso is great and i have n't been to starbucks in weeks hands down recommended no holds barred	8
1	i love my coffee machine but i normally do not buy t discs from gevalia due to price but found this on amazon wow 2 for 1 ! price is great even when you add in any cost for shipping etc still beats bead bath beyond with a coupon ! service and delivery were excellent	8

1	i 've tried almost every green tea on the market and this is one of my favorites it has a great flavor and it really does help me keep from snacking between meals i do n't think it 's possible to find great organic green tea at this price anywhere else	8
1	this is some great coffee \) perks you up gets you moving a good tasting highly energized morning wake up \) even better as an afternoon pick me up even thinking about making coffee now just wakes me up	8
1	i am so glad i tried this coffee ! i also shared some with my neighbor who has a business and she took some to the office with her and now it 's the only coffee they want ! if you try this you 'll never want any other coffee i even travel with my own for my hotel stays \( perfect travel packs \) ! great job shock coffee and i love your sleep is overrated slogan	8
1	a trained eye would see that shock coffee is a blend of arabica robusta coffee beans ! just like many other ingredients there is good and bad robusta arabica beans wines are made from different grapes and it 's the individuals' pallet that distinguishes between good and bad in europe the coffee bean of choice is robusta as they appreciate a stronger and bolder coffee with that said i 'd recommend shock for anybody who wants that extra kick with a better than average taste i 'd also like to reiterate that robusta beans are given a bad rap but the truth stands that some robusta beans have a great robust taste no pun attended !	8
1	i love this coffee it has a strong flavor and aroma and gets you moving in the morning i do not believe it is meant to be a fancy gourmet coffee but rather what i would call trucker or cowboy coffee if you like strong coffee buy it if you like delicate coffee buy something else	8
1	this snack blend is the best ! i tried it on the recommendation of a friend and have come to love it it 's perfect alone but i enjoy putting the mix on salads it definitely spices them up a bit and the flavor is amazing i have become a big fan of this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to add a little excitement to their everyday snacks	8
1	i love these chips they have a taste that gets better the more you chew them and they give you plenty of fiber and soy protein i wish they were n't as high in fat as they are but they 're good for a once in awhile indulgence	8
1	this is very good coffee and is one of my favorites the moca gives it a little different flavor but it goes well with the dark roast beans i have purchased this item several times and would recommend this product to others	8
1	sorry i could not have rated 10 stars i feel they taste better than if i picked them myself ! i want to purchase more thank you amazon always ofering the best	8
1	bigger and more luscious than any other available dried blueberries they make a huge difference and are worth the extra price i substitute them for the raisins in our favorite quaker oatmeal cookie recipe and everyone loves the results hope the oatmeal and blueberry health benefits cancel the butter sugar calories !	8
1	why are people demonizing high fructose corn syrup \? the only reason it 's cheaper in the us is america has lots of corn eat more corn use more corn syrup unripe berries have less fructose mass harvesting them probably places unripe berries into the mix and its compensated for	8
1	i enjoy eating the product however the blueberries are very sweet the sweetness helps satisfy my sweet tooth and i do no have the desire for candy the nutritious value i am receiving from eating blueberries is beneficial for my wellbeing i keep them at bedside for a satisfying snack	8
1	i 've been a big fan of ener g foods alternative food products ever since i discovered that i was wheat and gluten allergic these have been my only substitutes for breads these muffins are very tasty and crispy when toasted and are instant favorites of mine also check out ener g 's light brown rice bread for sandwiches and their cookie assortment these are so good that i do n't even miss regular wheat breads and cookies	8

1	i have never ordered anything such as this online i was surprised that the nuts arrived in about half as much time as the site said it would take i will consider ordering again once i have used these up the walnuts were so fresh and nice not all broken up as some have been when i have purchased them at the grocery store	8
1	get your children to eat a little bit of fiber ! ! these are really good of course their almond and mixed nuts flavors are even better !	8
1	hain popped corn cakes are simply delicious just enough crunch and sweetness to satisfy my hungry teenagers very healthy too	8
1	i absolutely love the taste of this tea and so does everyone else i 've encouraged to try some \( even my coffee drinking daughter \) i drink a lot of herbal teas and this is definitely my favorite i ca n't tell if it 's really detoxifying my liver and kidneys but i do know that drinking a cup boosts my energy level and make me feel better also do n't let the name of the tea make you think you can only drink it occasionally the box states that it 's mild enough to be used every day for up to 30 days my only disappointment at the moment is that the six pack on amazon is n't currently available	8
1	i too totally disagree with the other reviewer who did n't like this this is a mild tasting smooth tea that you could drink anytime it is one of my favorite teas	8
1	maybe i'm crazy but i totally disagree with the other review i think this tea is delicious i do n't know if it really detoxifies your body but it tastes good	8
1	if you like a tasty oil sesame oil is one to try and this is a good flavorful sesame oil perfect for asian cooking and for 'tweaking' traditional foods that can use a touch more flavor	8
1	my two year old loves these and prefers them over goldfish i did a taste test with goldfish and the cheddar bunnies seem cheesier they seem less dry too	8
1	this mix is a blessing for those w food allergies ! even if we did n't have any food allergies i 'd buy this mix i do have to cook it a bit longer than the box states and a lot longer \( 10m \) if using a glass dish	8
1	i have tried all of cherrybrook kitchen products and they are fabulous ! even without eggs dairy and peanuts these products taste even better than if i made it from scratch their brownie is deliciously chocolately and if cooked for about 16 minutes comes out fudgy also ! i also like the chocolate chips right in the mix ! i would highly recommend it	8
1	the first thing you notice about this cereal is the aroma it 's reminiscent of fish oil supplements having never eaten flax of any kind before i do n't know if the aroma is typical of flax at first serving i was sure i 'd consume the rest of the box \( eventually \) but would not buy more yet with each serving the aroma is less and less noticeable i enjoy this cereal and will buy it again it has more fiber than any other cereal \( organic or not \) i 've seen	8
1	this product has no fat this is a good thing i like to mix it with my coffee for instant mocha	8
1	flavor is very good the reason i could n't rate it higher is that i have trouble getting it to thoroughly mix in	8
1	my husband who has celiac disease thinks this is the best bread on the market it definitely is the easier to make only requires oil and water and turns out perfect every time amazon 's price beats those health food stores by a long shot ! try it	8
1	this bread is fabulous ! ! it actually tastes like bread and is light and airy not heavy like most wheat free products thank you orgran ! !	8
1	if you must have a cookie might as well make it a healthy one i bought a case and they went fast	8
1	i 've tried a few types of vegan chocolate chip cookies and was always disappointed with how bland they were and loaded with fat and calories these are not only the least amount of calories that i 've seen for a vegan cookie of this size but i found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non vegan ones i 've had in the past ! they are so so so good whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate \? i have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that i am far from deprived ! two thumbs up and highly recommended from this vegan chocoholic	8
1	this tea is amazing ! it tastes fresh smooth and light it 's just perfect i have about 2 3 cups a day makes me feel great	8
1	this makes a lovely gift everything is well packaged and looks expensive the teas are of good variety and well packaged to insure freshness recommend	8
1	gluten free diets can be so much more varied with this product it can be coating to chicken or meat or can be added to juices broths to thicken it can even be used to make a perfect stuffing for chicken or turkey it has make my boring diet almost feel normal no feeling of deprivation any more	8
1	these are sweet and lightly chewy with a touch of lemon it 's been a long time ago since i could get three organic healthy snack bars for a buck	8
1	i am addicted to wasa crispbread multi grain and you will be too very crisp and hearty flavor a healthy product with no saturated or trans fat and only 60 calories per portion the other wasa products are also worth a try especially sesame	8
1	i 've never reviewed a food item before but this delectable little bar was so heavenly i had to change my mind at the time it was a mere snack in between classes afterwards it earned a place in my heart as well as my eternal devotion toffee and almonds chocolate sigh what more could one ask for \?	8
1	high in protein low in calories and great flavor i split them in half and eat the first portion as a mid morning snack and the second portion as an afternoon snack they keep me feeling full and prevent me from eating junk food which has been great for my waistline i ca n't say enough good things about kashi	8
1	ok i eat a lot of protein fiber bars and most taste like cardboard or something worse this bar is the best i eat it for breakfast lunch or as dessert after dinner the texture reminds me of a chewy rice crispy treat seriously love it	8
1	i love kashi stuff and this bar is no exception there have just a greattaste not too sweet no funny aftertaste and very satisfying wheneaten between meals highly recommended	8
1	i like the basic special k flakes made from rice wheat \( though i really should n't eat gluten \) mostly i use cereal to snack on vs with milk \( boo lactose ! \) special k tends to have more nutritional value than most cereals which i like too but i was n't enamored with either the fruit or the yogurt parts of this particular cereal frankly i think it would taste better without them or with something else the yogurt pieces did n't seem to merge well with the cereal imho but then that 's why there 's chocolate vanilla	8
1	this is a great tea and very economical when buying bulk from amazon i'm very happy with it	8
1	if you like strawberries you 'll love crunchies ! only 98 calories per pouch i snacked on one pouch all day and did n't finish it off ! very convenient resealable i have other varieties on order !	8

1	seitenbacher is a fabulous soup mix ! one canister makes 40 cups of broth which makes it incredibly inexpensive it 's also delicious it makes a truly versatile soup base people love my nabeyakiudon \( japanese noodle soup \) matzoah ball soup \( jewish dumpling soup \) golden lentil stew \( indian bean stew \) all of which have seitenbacher as the base it works for people with allergies and food sensitivities \( no gluten no lactose no msg no soy \) it 's all natural and vegetarian \( no gelatin \) and i ca n't emphasize enough the rich deep flavor	8
1	thanks to our purchase of a keurig i am a converted coffee drinker timothy 's german chocolate cake is my absolute favorite a delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium bodied blend it is n't too sugary it 's just right ! in fact my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too it is scrumptious	8
1	great flavor and aroma an excellent choice for an evening coffee break	8
1	i love velveeta and i love the rotini and cheese i have had it before but it is hard to find in the grocery stores i shop at i found it not to be as good as i remembered the broccoli was minimal at best	8
1	i was eager to try the sugar blend for baking i noticed a difference in the consistency of the cake batter and it did not rise as high and seemed to be more compact the usage guide was helpful and included a recipe on the package the flavor was comparable to regular sugar and those with diabetes are now able to enjoy some of the sweeter things in life	8
1	i am crazy about splenda i mix equal parts splenda and brown sugar for my hot cerael it saves money and calories asparteem \( nutrasweet \) gives me loose bowels splenda meets my sweetner needs without calories	8
1	all the splenda products are good but i like the ones that are part splenda and part sugar as they are good for baking good if you have a diabetic in the house or are trying extra hard to lose weight and are a sugarholic	8
1	this stuff is delicious ! i 've been buying it for years as a good quality fairly nutritious snack food for myself \( i feed the kids veggie booty and hog the sweet stuff \) and it seems to be a pretty good choice it does n't take a lot to satisfy and it 's not really that bad for you \( sugar sure but not as much as some other treats \)	8
1	i love these ! my son loves these ! you would think there would n't be a problem but he sucks on them as they melt his hands get sticky and then the furniture or toys he touches gets sticky also ! but they are so yumm ! fyi 13 g of sugar healthier cereal have 5 7 g so i guess it is n't so bad	8
1	excellent cookies my boys love them know they are a treat that is on the healthy side we will buy these again	8
1	i love these cookies too ! they 're crunchy animal cookies with a lemony coating that does n't feel waxy in your mouth the lemon taste is great and they 're not too sweet they 're a perfect afternoon snack when you want a sweet treat but do n't want to overdo it with calories or sugar the box is a little skimpy on the number of cookies you get but the taste is worth it	8
1	these are a perfect size for work and great portion control ! i ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it if you are counting calories this is the way to go	8
1	i so love this jerky it is moist but not too moist and has great flavor we have tried several of their flavors and they are all awesome great prices for hormone free stuff and no preservatives jerky tastes so much better and richer without msg in it	8
1	it was a little expensive but well worth it it lasts allday long or several teapot	8
1	i love these cookies ! the only complaint i had is that i ordered a case \( 12 boxes \) and the expiration date was 4 weeks from the day i received the shipment yikes i still have over half the case left and i 've been eating them daily \( and giving them away \) ! i probably will not purchase again from this vendor for this reason alone however if you 're looking for a great organic cookie without trans fats this is a nice healthy option	8
1	i doubt if most kids would like this bar but health food fanatics will love it subtle flavor mixed with chocolate bar is very filling dry use with water	8
1	my son \( 3 \) and i love these he likes to hop them around and kiss them before he eats them he likes all the bunny graham varieties \( chocolate honey cinnamon \) they taste like the traditional graham crackers	8
1	okay so i realize this is n't a real veggie merely a veggie that 's been pureed and turned into a pea pod shaped chip but man they are good what 's more there are n't any bad ingredients in this product and they 're baked not fried ! better still my kid prefers them to chips so while i do n't totally win the make your kid love veggies award with this snack i feel i'm one step closer oh and i love them too	8
1	these are a fun little snack they taste good and are crunchy so you can pass on the potato chips they have two grams of fiber and a small amount of vitamins they are not low in calories so be careful of the amount you eat my daughter likes them which is a plus the price was good at amazon but the shipping was steep	8
1	i 've been over here in japan for the past 3 years and have n't made too many visits to the states i will be returning next week though however this stuff is definitely one addictive snack in japan it 's marketed by the same company as saya endou not a strong flavor just something to munch on not too salty and not too sweet kampeki \( perfect \) a purchase of the snack is a victory against terrorism	8
1	this is a wonderful gf cereal ! it is crunchy a touch sweet and the fruit is a wonderful addition this is the first gf cereal that my son will really eat he frequently has 2 bowls and he does not eat much ! highly recommend	8
1	i'm not a huge coffee fan most of the time i find it bitter then there 's the whole language you have to learn if you want to order it at one of the popular coffee joints but occasionally i do feel like i need that little surge of energy this kona blend coffee is the perfect choice it has a lot of flavor but none of the bitterness i find in a lot of other coffees this is the one i put in the coffee maker when i plan to spend the day cleaning house or working on my thesis it makes great iced coffee too	8
1	that 's all that matters to me i ca n't always find it in stock at the local store and i want my husband to be able to enjoy it i'm not a real coffee drinker but this kona blend seems to lack the bitterness that first turned me off coffee years ago in the first place so i enjoy some of it too occasionally and whatever blend he 's drinking my husband likes millstone brand i know it always smells wonderful	8
1	i love this soup it is healthy vegetarian and low calore for a light meal i eat it alone when i want something more substantial i mix in leftovers and a dash of hot sauce the microwave bowls make a good portion size it is really convenient to have it delivered in bulk to my door	8
1	i 've tried the andy capp hot fries white cheddar and these regular cheddar these have a satisfactory flavor and do n't over do it i find them a good snack with tasty underlying corn flavor and a non greasy crispness that i like about the andy capp products they are different from cheese doodles cheese doodles are more about orange coatings and are uneven in texture i think it must be the corn potato combo in the andy capp products that makes them feel good to eat	8
1	andy capp fries have become my favorite crunchy snack i like both the chedder and hot fries the texture and flavor from both varieties surpass my love of potatoe chips and cheese doodles highly recommend andy capp fries in both flavors	8
1	supposedly this is the safest artificial sweetener and it tastes fine too favorite uses coffee tea and hot cereals such as oat bran and unsweetened oatmeal i ordered two of these gegunda boxes and am grateful for the opportunity to save so much money vs supermarket prices unfortunately there was a terrible delay i ordered on feb 2 and did n't receive until march 20 otherwise no complaints and i'm fixed for sweetener for a good year	8
1	i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea ! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the splenda there is none ! you can use this to cook with too ! it 's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar	8
1	this product has been a lifesaver to me with wheat allergies and loving pasta i thought i would never get to eat it again ! the pasta tastes great and my family does n't even notice the difference they like it too ! thanks orgran	8
1	i have sensitive to sugar teeth and these are beautiful and healthy most granola bars you find in stores are full of sugar and have next to no nutritional value no thanks these are good for you and taste rather good too they are a bit bland but i like the texture with what 's in them and how they 're held together they 're a bit like rice krispy treats but taste healthy yum i love taking these to work for a quick snack instead of vending machine	8
1	i bought this tea for my mom for her birthday and everyone in the family loves it this is excellent chai tea	8
1	this is amazingly good ! worlds apart from the usual mac and cheddar products on the market really worth trying ! delivery was fast and everything arrived just fine i highly recommend this product	8
1	pemmican premium and long lasting peppered flavor is the best i have ever had by far and i am a certified jerky freak they are not stringy or rubbery simply easy to eat and absolutely delicious	8
1	excellent taste and texture the apples are the crunchiest but even the pulpier fruits have a pleasing texture if you really like your crunch i 'd go for the all apple product my only disappointment is that you 're not getting a lot for your money i love the convenient portion control packaging but 1 10 for a 3 4 ounce 70 calorie serving makes me more worried about my wallet than my weight when considering what to snack on in the afternoon so i 'll order more but these have become an occasional snack and not an everyday one	8
1	i found timely service and a surpisingly good tasting snack i have never had this type of dried fruit and was very satified as usually healthy things just do n't taste that good nice surprise	8
1	i bought some nana 's no refined sugar cookies in several flavors when a local health food store was having a moving sale they were so incredible i looked online and was delighted to find them on amazon and bought some here these cookies taste fantastic and they are very moist as well really all of the flavors i tried \( choc chip coco chip and oatmeal raisin \) were outstanding	8
1	green is good of course but what 's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies pn os beat the bootie out of any oreo variation crunchier more filling \( without being smarmy \) much better taste \( and this goes for the mint the vanilla and the chocolate \) fast eddie felson i love you	8
1	my husband and i like the newman o 's better than oreo 's and our 3 year old son loves them ! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo also the newman o 's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have	8
1	my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream these are a bit softer than the o 's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat ! \) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too yummy	8
1	nice chewy texture not fossilized like the health food store bulk bin kind and great taste packaged as they are \( 2 resealable packages of 20oz each \) it 's a very economical buy too just store one in the 'fridge or freezer until you finish the first our kids like these better than raisins	8
1	i have ordered stoneridge orchards dried montmorency cherries twice the cherries have arrived in good condition and taste wonderful	8
1	i was very pleased with these dried cherries they are delicious not too sweet not too tart healthy too	8
1	i 've never been a big fan of dried fruit good for you or not they are just too sweet for me but these montmorency cherries are wonderful it 's the right mix of sweetness with tartness i love to eat these straight out of the bag	8
1	this is yet another fabulous blend of ingredients not too sweet not too salty great for kids and us big kids who are on the go and tired of the same old trail mix protein bars on the run keep up the good wor	8
1	i am a prediabetic person this product helps keep my sugar under control my numbers are great after i eat this cereal	8
1	love this oatmeal ! no sugar which is a bonus for athletes wanting good complex carbs w o added sugar one packet gives you a nice creamy treat much creamier than other instant oatmeals highly recommend it	8
1	this is great instant oatmeal i eat it almost every morning i used to buy the quaker or store brand of the same flavor in the grocery store but i will continue to buy this it is very convenient to order this in quantity even though i'm the only one in my household eating it since i go through it pretty quickly	8
1	since the description says this product contains splenda i do n't understand why the guy who posted a bad review would avoid amazon grocery products at all costs just because he apparently did n't read the description before buying mccann 's makes great oatmeal read the description before buying anything would be my adivce	8
1	excellent product amazon 's prices were very good a few months ago however now the price is more than the popcorn costs in the grocery store	8
1	my family and i absolutly loved the sinamon flavor of lesserevil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family was it healthy \? well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you good stuff overall and amazon 's price is great \( just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas	8
1	delightful popcorn mix which is great for snacks and is a really nice treat for lunches very tasty and hits the spot for those sweet tooth cravings without being too far off the old diet buying it here is a bargain too	8
1	not only does this stuff taste wonderful but it 's much healthier than most of the items on the grocery store shelves i would definitely recommend this as a great snack	8
1	even though it 's all natural the taste is rich with fresh fruit flavor in this way it 's even better than standard dried fruit	8
1	one of the best varietals i have tasted smooth and rich almost syrupy like most of timothy 's coffees delicious ! !	8
1	nice flavor and aroma i like the darker blends and this is a little light but still flavorful	8
1	these cookies are unbelievably good perfect with a cup of coffee or tea perfect alone i stopped buying them because i just could not stop eating them if i could buy them in packs of three or four then i could have them in the house again	8
1	planters cashews in milk chocolate are so so delicous ! i am absolutely addicted ! they are so good a great snack or dessert and they even come in different sizes one size for home and one smaller size for on the go ! i could not ask for tastier chocolate or more wonderful tasting cashews ! try 'em amazoners you will love them ! thank you	8
1	tastes great and the price was good	8
1	i have used this product for a long time as lipton has always been a trusted brand i do go through a lot of tea so buying it on amazon was quick and more affordable then other stores	8
1	my family loves this coffee this decaf is very smooth it does not have a weird decaf aftertaste and we will continue to order this it 's the next best thing to having kona coffee which we cannot always afford	8
1	the shells are a nice change from the otherwise limited choices of gltuen free pasta shapes i will buy these again	8
1	wonderfully totally delicious you don't want to finish the last kernal it's just so popp'n good	8
1	both adults and kids alike very much enjoyed this popcorn nice cheddar flavor without any yellow hands	8
1	i buy this at sam 's club for about 12 2 before i became enlightened re organic products i was a folgers user this coffee is a deeper roast and has a higher acid level but is flavorful for the price this is an incredible deal	8
1	this tea is comforting when feeling ill or under the weather also it has a pleasant taste i highly recommend it	8
1	the grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly i 've become weary reading labels i 've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality nature 's path organic blueberry toaster pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious they heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack i 'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies therebeccareview com	8
1	i enjoy this cereal with vanilla rice milk it is good especially when i eat it which is what i do	8
1	this fills me up and it tastes very good i only with the box was bigger i can only get 2 bowls per box	8
1	i have eaten this amazing cereal every morning for a year and i still look forward to eating it it has an interesting flavor that i know i will never get tired of i highly recommend trying it	8
1	this is my favorite cereal i recommend it to everyone i can i eat a bowl every morning at 9 am and am still full at lunch time best of all it tastes great i agree with previous reviewer that the flax seeds are tasty but probably useless as the body ca n't break down a whole flax seed to obtain the omega 3 but it adds nice texture and nuttiness also amazon has a great price on this vs grocery stores	8
1	this is our favorite cereal and it 's so much cheaper here than at the grocery store the boxes run out fast so it 's nice to have several and not have to buy it at the store all the time	8
1	like oatmeal with good taste and texture a little sweet \( i cut it with plain oatmeal \)	8
1	you wo n't want anything on them either ! they are that good warning be prepared for quite a number of broken and crumbled crackers from the shipping	8
1	excellent product for those on a wheat free diet have a hamburger again with a real bun ! even better if you microwave for 20 seconds prior to eating enjoy	8
1	these cookies are very good and you can actually eat quite a few before the calorie count starts to add up i shared them with some friends and everyone thought they were excellent	8
0	i bought this watch for my husband but did n't take the time to read the description carefully so it 's my fault i had to send it back he is in the army and leaving soon for iraq i thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift unfortunately it does not work if you 're more than 2 000 miles from colorado if you are not going to leave the continental united states i suppose it would be a good watch	17

0	these earrings were very uncomfortable i'm not sure if it 's actually the size of the post so much as the shape and angle more like an angled bar than a round post i do n't have particularly sensitive ears although i generally do n't wear large or heavy jewelry either these earrings are on their way back to amazon i also was n't thrilled to see how much the price has varied when i ordered 4 6 07 they were 34 99 some reviewers bought them for less yet the current price seems to be even more caveat emptor	17
0	these earrings are very pretty but the post is way too thick they killed my ears and i had to return them i would guess the post is at least 2 5 times as thick as a normal post and my ears did not like it ! ! !	17
0	i was very disappointed in these earrings they were only about the size of a nickel and for 50 i expected them to be as large as earrings i have found from several other merchants for the same price if you are looking for average size hoops say the size of a quarter these are not the earrings for you i can only imagine how tiny the 30 pair is	17
0	my 5 year old daughter was thrilled with her locket it is really beautiful we were both quite disappointed however when the locket itself broke the loop that attaches to the bail completely came off she is a normal kid but was not overly rough with the necklace it is currently at the jeweler 's to be fixed	17
0	we bought this locket for my daughter and had it personalized with her initials on one side and the year on the other this is such a small locket that it will be very hard to put a picture in it also the locket is very very hard to open the top of the heart was n't closed all the way so the locket kept falling off the chain we had to have it fixed now it stays together my daughter loves it and wears it every day but i would have bought a different locket if i had realized how small this is and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn	17
0	the locket on this cable chain is so tiny you will not be able to put a picture in it after opening the box and being completely disappointed i opened the locket to see how it worked it would not close properly after opening the quality of this necklace is not good do not waste your money	17
0	these were nice earings which i received as a gift off my wish list but after i wore them about 3 or 4 times one of them fell out and is now lost the post does not stay in place very well i am frustrated because i put these on my wish list because they are advertised as having an innovative clasp which avoids lost earings but they did not work well for me by the way after i first wrote this review i called amazon to complain they sent me another pair right away at no charge this suggests to me that others have complained in the past i appreciate that they were so responive	17
0	i ordered this watch and i got a woman 's watch the model number was the same i do n't know if there was a mix up but what i got was definitely not a men 's watch luckily amazon has a great return policy	17
0	this is way too small for a men 's watch both the face and the band the band would n't even go around my wrist i think this must be a women 's watch mislabled nice looking but i sure ca n't use it i'm going to have to return it	17
0	i bought this tool after reading all of the glowing reviews i thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches rather than paying 10 each time to have a professional do it i was so disappointed in this tool the link remover only pushes the pins out halfway you are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way as you can imagine this is not easy my husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out knowing what i know now i would definitely have invested in a different link remover	17
0	the product pretty much snapped in half while i was trying to remove two links from one watch the other one i tried before this one did n't fit in the adjustment piece at all so with that said do not buy this product at all it 's very poorly made and terribly annoying to use instructions are very unclear i ended up throwing it away and going to a watch shop to get it fixed	17
0	i had loved it at first but i am one to leave a necklace on forever it started to get all kinked up and i could n't figure out how to straighten it out but the company did offer me a discount on a different chain even though it was past their 30 day policy nice for once in a while wearing and be careful when handling it	17
0	this ring had such great ratings after visiting it often i finally bought it as a gift when i saw it in person i was not impressed it does look like the picture but it also looks cheap i do realize it costs cheap i just was n't impressed it did arrive very quickly though	17
0	this was a cute locket but far too small to put any sort of a photo in it the only use it would serve would be a charm never to be opened not worth the price	17
0	i bought this watch for a gift overall the watch is nice but it does n't work properly we will have to send it to fossil for repair	17
0	for 10 these were too good to pass up first noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem the earring is not all one piece first time i wore them lost one because the back slipped off though they were n't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out this is the second pair i bought first set was fine seems like the quality of construction may be slipping \( or a different supplier \? \)	17
0	though the design is cool the quality of this pendant is poor they are so light and the color is strikingly white which makes them appear cheaper they look like toys ! i also bought the earrings set with the same design and i'm so disappointed with both \( only the packaging is of good quality in this product i suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design	17
0	though evenly matched the color of the amethysts are much lighter than the product image both stones are feathered in areas and have visible blemishes though these are n't apparent if you are wearing them about the quality you 'd expect from mervyn 's or sears on sale not terrible but not great	17
0	the color of the actually received ear rings was quite light a darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive since that showed a much darker colored amethyst i wo n't buy jewelry from amazon again when it comes to a colored stone hsn depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products	17
0	after about 3 weeks of wearing the necklace the cord came loose from the metal fasteners the glue used to keep the cord from unraveling was comepletely useless and the cord became unwound the cord looks very nice but the quality is terrible	17
0	it 's does n't look like as it appears in the photos i bought it to gift my husband and i wz very disappointed ! ! i returned it back !	17
0	there two major problems with this watch one auto atomic setting do not work as described in manual second unable to even set time using good old fashion manual way returned to casio for repair hope they get it right	17
0	fair warning had i had the benefit of some of the reviews that have since appeared about this company 's watches i never would have bought one do yourself a favor and read the reviews for the various models before wasting your money the percentage of watches that work for any length of time is distressingly low	17
0	i was very excited to get these earrrings for my daughter for christmas however upon opening found that one of the front of the earrings was dented now i need to return them other than the dent they were cute even though they were only 25 00 there should be some quality control by the manufacturer	17
0	i love the actually pendent the time it got there was great but i really did n't like how they show the pendent on a chain because i bought it for the whole package \( chain included \) so when i got it i was shocked that it did n't included it so buyers beware this supplier does n't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra 15 30 even thou they adversities it in their ad	17
0	i purchased this watch for my granddaughter as her first watch however it never worked i do n't know if it had a dead battery or if it 's broken the cost to replace the battery will be nearly as much as i paid for the watch i will try to resolve the issue with amazon	17
0	the earrings are nice a great value at 30 however the posts are too thick for my liking and make my ears sore the posts are not the typical size one might find in us stores the posts are more typical of earrings that i have purchased in central southern america in fact this is where the earrings were made i returned them	17
0	this ring does not look as pictured it arrived today \( almost 3 weeks after i ordered it \) and is extremely thin has tarnish marks and the metal filigree on the crown shows up only in random places it looks like it came out of a vending machine and i'm obviously pretty disappointed i wo n't be buying anything from this vendor again	17
0	actually i only wore it 2 days to work i took it off at night and put it on in the mornings on the 3rd day i noticed the silver peeling off i tossed it i know it was inexpensive but that was down right cheap never again ! ! ! !	17
0	make sure you read the fine print ! this bracelet is silver toned not sterling silver the embossing is also not the greatest clear on the one side but hard to see the letters on the other	17
0	this watch looks good but the movement is terrible i got this watch as a christmas gift but the 24 hour register was synchronized to the hour hand i must warn you if you purchase this watch then do n't be suprised if it does n't work right it may look like a rolex but it does n't work like one	17
0	i bought two of these one for each of my boys for christmas one of the two watches never did keep time properly i even changed the battery an expensive fix that did not work	17
0	this item was a nice gift the stones were a little discolored but that 's what you get for only paying 100 for 1 4 carat earings online	17
0	one earring was damaged and instead of replacing it as i requested they fixed it i will not be using amazon to purchase jewelry anytime soon	17
0	i purchased two of these necklaces but the first one broke the second time i wore it good thing i purchased two	17
0	the clip holds the money but the credit card holder is a bit scary it just does n't work that well plus it is very heavy if you put 5 bills in there even without the credit cards this thing is like putting a brick in your pocket i would not recommend it	17
0	as title says there were kind of a water mark on the face of the watch maybe a leak from the solar panel \? i did not exchange for another one because it is a cheap watch no point paying shipping back and forth anyways the instructions were easy to understand buttons on the side a little bit hard to push blue led on red face looks bad because of the dark face for the solar panel it is not easy to see this watch is now sitting on my desk collecting dust i am just waiting to see when the solar panel stop leaking and the watch fail	17
0	this watch was a disappointment it has a huge dial but the chronograph functions are extremely tiny it 's also an extremely flashy watch the image on the web site makes it look classy not so additionally the watch is completely useless under low light conditions it neither fluoresces nor does it have a light up function returned it after a week got my money back	17
0	the product doesnt appear as is shown on the picture at all its not red and its too small to even imagine i knew it would appear bit smaller than on picture but this is beyond my imagination the chain can break any time ! ! ! and the stud ! ! ! ! ! ! ! gosh i cant even see it ! now i'm gonna check if its really gold or not ! ! dont buy this product ! save yourself the money	17
0	do n't buy this item i was cheated now i am gonna send it back its really waste of your money do n't go by the price i will never buy anything from this site	17
0	like the looks of the watch however it 's very noisy and the clasp tends to come apart after removing the watch the face can also be difficult to read in bright light \( reflection \)	17
0	nice looking but with very serious design and or manufacturing flaw after less than 2 month of use in office environment glass cracked without any impact whatsoever now i 'll have to find out if skagen 's customer service is any good for 70 watch i certainly expected better quality after reading other reviews for this models i realized that many other people had the same issue bottom line avoid ! !	17
0	these were the worst pair of earings i have ever seen they were yellow from a mile away amazon was very accomodating when i returned them but save yourself the hassle the price is too good to be true with these earings	17
0	the quality of the stones is horrendous there are significant inclusions which are visible with naked eye from as far away as 3 feet these diamons should have been turned into diamond dust not set into jewelery	17
0	these diamonds should n't be offered in this size for jewelry the imperfections in them seriously hinder the sparkling characteristics a diamond is known for great price but you get what you pay for	17
0	i bought these for my young daughter i understood the basics of diamond ratings and was n't concerned with the inclusions they may have contained i expected low quality stones with some particles visable to the naked eye what i did n't expect was the cloudiness although these were n't yellow in color they were the absolute worst pair of diamonds i had ever seen there was no clarity just two milky looking stones these diamonds should have been grinded and used for diamond dust or chips only	17
0	i can see why they are priced so low i figured that they would look like the photo or something like it but the ones i received are very cloudy i guess you get what you are paying for as for the k clarity i have no idea what that is so i never thought they would look this bad	17
0	i like it but i do n't like box 's watch which obsolescence i hope my boy friend will love it	17
0	i purchased this watch as a birthday present for my husband when he opened it he noticed that the days of the week were in both spanish and english and there does n't seem to be a way to set it to just one or the other since there were limited instructions with the watch by the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund not happ	17
0	i returned the pearl earings they were of very poor quality the colors were not pretty and the shapes were not even	17
0	this watch does not work according to the manual i have tryed to get it to work about 75 times my wife has tryed about at least 25 30 times and i took it to a jewler and even he could not get it to work this watch is a piece of jun	17
0	great watch manual very bad all depends on how much time you have to invest it will take it because of sorry manual	17
0	as per the review i decided to buy the item i received it it was very thick and ugly looking it just looks good in the picture as mentioned by someone it has plastic back cover which makes it worse it also is very large and long so to remove the small braces cost more overall unhappy and returned to amazon with loss of money in shipping	17
0	daylight savings time in the us has changed these watches continue to use the old daylight savings time rules while you may not mind having to manualy set the watch for a few weeks twice a year it kind of defeats the whole purpose	17
0	bought this as a christmas gift for a cousin who is mentally handicapped thought i could program it and have him enjoy the ease of reading the hands and the glow in the dark feature however it is now january 18th and i still cannot program the watch frustrate	17
0	as a talisman it is good but the product metal it is made of is critical	17
0	it was larger than i expected from the images thicker too in my opinion it did n't look as classy as the picture made me believe i was very disappointed that the regular second hand was not in fact the large sweeping thin hand that 's actually only for the stop watch the regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle really with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which and the cheaper look of the watch in person i never actually put it on before sending it back	17
0	these were on my mom 's wishlist so i bought them they just arrived and i'm totally disappointed i 'd return them if it would n't cost me and i was n't so lazy they look pretty darn cheap for starters also they came in a little plastic zipper bag inside of a little pseudo velour bag with a price tag for 3 30 on it save your money it 's best not to buy jewlery sight unseen	17
0	the topaz earring is nice enough and probably worth 45 but be aware that it is smaller than it looks on the web page the shaft that hangs between the two stones is about 5 16 long the larger stone is about 3 16 wide and 1 4 high the small stone is about 3 32 wide essentially you get what you pay for	17
0	i 've purchased this watch a month ago and although it 's nice the battery died already very dissapointed	17
0	i bought this to help change the leather strap on a beautiful watch the v notched end was too thick to fit i used my pocket knife instead maybe there 's a knack to it but i did n't want to scratch my watch while practicing the pointed end works very well for pressing in those tiny spring bars and the small recessed auto set buttons for which a ball point tip is too big and a needle is too clumsy but you probably have something around the house that would work just as well \( mini screwdriver the point of a phillips head	17
0	i was very disappointed with how tiny this eternity cross is i do n't know if the measurements were in the description for it or not or if they were and i just did n't see or pay attention to them but this cross is so tiny it really seems like it 's meant for a very young child the necklace may be 18 but the pendant itself was so small not at all what i was looking for so i'm going to give this as a gift for a niece what i was really wanting was a larger heavier duty sterling silver eternity cross as a slide for an omega chain for an adult never have found one yet	17
0	these earings were ok quality but were really small they would be better suited for a child	17
0	i was bought this present for valentines day it 's pretty i do wear them for everyday us	17
0	the diamonds are waaayyy too small nothing like the picture sent it back	17
0	when i received the earrings i got very disappointed because they are very very small i had to sell them my wife never wanted to wear them	17
0	my order arrived quickly but upon first use the clasp broke on this necklace since it was n't an expensive item i joined the ends together with a small wire ring i already owned since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced perhaps with another faulty item as they say you get what you pay for !	17
0	i recieved it promptly but it did n't work i took it to walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler i did that buying a battery for twenty dollars and still cannot get the time to set right i 've read the manual over and over my sons did the same it looks nice but does n't work and its been very aggravating i would n't recommend it	17
0	i got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch after wearing invicta 's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist when i received it i noticed the small scratches all over the crystal nothing deep but they really pick up the glare atomic signal i am unable to get it to pick up one in memphis tn i think i should be in range and all my atomic clocks sync up fine i have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house still no good basically i spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight lesson learned	17
0	this looked great when it came but broke in only one day really poor craftmanship	17
0	i bought these for my mom she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment the entire earring is tiny the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver from not very far away at all they just look like a gray blob very hard to tell what shape not impressed i suggest you look for something else i will be returning these immediatel	17
0	here is an example of the deception of photos on the net the smallest photo they showed of these earings was 4x larger than the actual product ! ! we had to put them on our 9 month old grandaughter and even then they still appeared tiny on her baby ears ! ! rip off never buy jewlery from amazon again !	17
0	this item cost alot of money but is a piece of crap do n't expect to put alot of money in this because it wo n't hold it my clip broke after a week do n't buy this item you can find better ones for a lot less money	17
0	i have owned several timex ironman watches over the years loved 'em all i do n't if amazon sent me one with an almost dead battery or if it 's a flaw in the watch however when punching through the modes everything is really slow if i go to alarm i have to wait a few seconds for it to appear then wait a few more when i choose to modify it not quick an easy like my other ironmans great features though if it was n't for this annoying delay 5 stars easy so i do n't know to blame amazon or timex for this either way it is a problem that dropped the score for me	17
0	it might just be really bad luck but after three fossil watches \( 1 x blue 2 x titanium \) i 've never managed to make them last more than two years each they are really cool look great and the price is reasonable but this is the third time fossil lets me down and to get them repaired through the warranty is extremely painful this time i'm looking for another brand as i feel i'm wasting my money	17
0	i bought this watch as a christmas gift for my boyfriend after 2 weeks the round thing on top of the watch came off the seller says it has to be sent to repair and it will take 3 to 5 weeks to get back i am so embarassed of the poor quality gift i chose and ca n't belive they will not replace it with an apology their answer is just not acceptable but there is nothing else i can do but write this review i have two fossil watches myself and after the good reviews i read i was happy with the gift but now i am so disapointe	17
0	the link remover is too flimsy to work i ca n't even say it works poorly one of the two tweezers is missing the case is nice	17

0	poor quality one of the screw driver is already broken by using 2 times	17
0	this watch stinks crappy manual the band is so big it could fit around my leg and when i received it it didn't work now i have to pay extra to fix the band and to get it working so much for what i thought was a nice looking inexpensive watch i would 've given it no stars if i could don't make the same mistake i did avoid this watch	17
0	since the product was not received i cannot give a good review for this transactio	17
0	i work in a bank where every year each of the branches does a stupid secret santa thing around christmas time i bought this as a gift for the guy i got stuck with the thing comes in a nondescript box and looks like a paper clip if i had given this as a gift people would have thought i raided the supply closet at work for a present total garbage	17
0	i got the watches as party favors for my 10year old party guests but none of the kids or i have been able to reset it my daughter has been frustrated with it and says some of her friends she inquired from had the same issue with the watch the 2 little knobs ca n't be manipulated as indicated on the accompanying instruction sheet needless to say the watches are beautiful and attractive but if kids for whom they were made can not reset them and use them then the purpose is defeated the service was great but the product is unsatisfactory phyllisunsatisfied custome	17
0	i know these watches were inexpensive but 2 right out of the box were broken and others broke very easily the clock functions well but the straps fall apart easily	17
0	one screw is gone amazon did not help me to replace it therefore the key ring is not operational the screws are very problematic	17
0	i love the size \( small \) and quality of these earrings that were ordered for my 6 year old the website picture shows them as a blue and purple color when i got them they were pink and green even the replacements they sent were pink and green i have not been happy with their customer service on these and will not order jewelry again	17
0	i bought this for my daughter the display was dead when it arrived i took it a local jewelry counter for a new battery and the live battery let some display show but it was a garbled display and not able to be set or used my daughter found a much cheaper watch at target with more features \( a stopwatch ! \) this one was n't even worth sending back	17
0	the image really looks much better than the actual product stones are quite brownish not red as one would expect of garnet i would n't recommend anyone purchase this	17
0	they ship really fast which is nice but ultimatly this item reminds me too much of something that would come out of a 25 cent machine it is a piece of crap and it looks a lot dinkier in real life then it does in the pictures plus the stone is not garnet it more so resembles the color brown like a turd	17
0	i bought this ring for my girlfriend and 2 months later it completely fell apart the bands on the ring actually broke apart and piece by piece the ring crumbled poor quality i am not sure if it relates the thin bands that construct the puzzle ring or the fragile nature of the metal i wish i had my 25 bucks back	17
0	i bought this ring for my fiance since i have one and it 's a terrible ring we got it apart and then have not been able to get it back together it 's been over a month now we went online to get the directions that did n't help either plus the ring is so cheap it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape it is cheap and completely useless	17
0	someone please help me ! ! i have tried all the online help videos and guides and such and i still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again ! please help	17
0	i did n't feel it was necessary to read the reviews before i purchased the watch this is disney and tinker bell ! the word flirt did n't bother me either because tinkerbell was a flirt wow after reading the full product description with hot and saucy on the wrist band i was shocked that this watch is under the children 's section i needed this for my grand daughter 's birthday like it was said before i could have given this five stars but hot and saucy for a young girl oh no	17
0	to much trouble to send back but arrived with a dead battery ended up getting another gift and still carry watch around in trunk to get a battery put in it watch looks nice but it would be nice if it worked	17
0	having read the other reviews i expected something small but decent the particular pair i received had two defects 1 one of the back clasps was bent so that it could not provide the correct tension on the post for reliable wear and 2 one of the stones had a very large visible black inclusion near the top it was visible to my naked eye \( i do n't have a jeweler 's loupe \) even though it was partially hidden behind one of the mounts maybe i just got a bad pair but given those two problems and the small size of the stones i sent them back and did not try again	17
0	the gold balls came off their posts four weeks after use i would not recommend	17
0	i bought these for my wife for christmas 2005 by august 2006 one of them fell apart the gold loop is attached to the white gold loop by a very tiny and fragile weld which broke it was not due to any abnormally rough handling it would have cost 50 00 to have repaired now they 're throw aways	17
0	earings are too big no way of knowing they were as big as they are nothing i will wear	17
0	got the watch friday in the mail it looks cool and nice and teh band is shiny the number lines glow nicely in the dark i willoberserve the watch and come back in a month to say my opinions	17
0	looked good on me this watch but i found out just in time that this did not carry seiko's regular two or three year warranty since it is a grey market watch having read the many complaints about this seiko monster i decided i needed a warranty so for this simple reason i had to return it to amazon right away and am in the process of exchnaging it with another brand that does have warranty	17
0	when i first got this watch i was thrilled it has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination the problem started when i went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists the guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing at the time i thought he was just po 'd because i didnt buy the watch at the store as soon as i was home though the bracelet fell apart what a piece of junk ! i regret buying this watch and i advise against it	17
0	very disappointed in the watch and amazon the day date did not work on delivery but i was unaware of it until the end of february when i tried to manually change the date i found that it was broken at that time about a week after i received the watch the day date did change automatically each night amazon refused t orepalce it because i had the band adjusted seiko refused t oreplace it but said they would repair it and have it back to me in 3 4 weeks ! had i purchased it from a reputable local store i could have exchanged it for a new watch	17
0	seiko has produced a loser of a watch i really liked the design and seiko reputation of building a tough watch i have purchased seiko divers in the past with no problems i didn t know these watches were made in singapore maybe this is why my monster doesn t work who knows toke to authurized dealer for repair he wanted 175 dont buy seiko	17
0	i purchased this pair of earrings for my 5 year old granddaughter to wear as the flower girl in my niece 's wedding when the purchase arrived they were too small for my granddaughter therefore i had to return them	17
0	i orginally purchased this for myself when it was 10 as soon as i received it i went to put it on and it broke right away i was very disappointed so my boyfriend purchased another one for me for 10 i went to put that one on and it broke as well i was never able to wear the necklace even once i do not recommend this product to anyone ! ! ! ! !	17
0	it turns out the metal in the stems irritates my wife 's ears i assume that the stems must not be white gold \? other than that they are as expected not perfect but not bad for the price	17
0	okay i may be picky but these earrings are just too thin ! i get the idea of delicate sparkly things but these do n't look so much delicate as they do insubstantial they are pretty and sparkly but the crystal looks like all i could afford was a thin slice the picture also makes the crystals appear blue ish but mine are more of a yellow ish tint not what i expected	17
0	the earrings looked so pretty in the picture in real life they look cheap they look like plastic not like crystal very disappointed	17
0	i read all these nice reviews and had a good impression of these earrings i should never have bought these ! ! they look nothing like the picture if you get these earrings you will be setting yourself up to be disappointed they look cheap and tacky like something you pay 25 cents for out of a gum ball machine	17
0	recieved my orange monster last september i have worn it every day i like the look and design of this watch but unfortunatly this watch does not keep very accurate time often losing about five minutes a week i have friends who also own the black monster and anonther orange monster and they have the same complaint if i was to buy another watch i would not buy this seiko again	17
0	the heart on the bracelet came off after the second day of wear i do not recommend the product but the delivery and service were done well	17
0	this thing is miniscule it barely fits on my \( petite \) seven year old 's neck although the size is mentioned in the description the picture is misleading the pendant itself is smaller than the image on the screen and i consider that borderline false advertising i should have been a more aware buyer so this review is n't to say the product is bad just be aware of how small it is my daughter could n't even find it in the bag when i gave it to her it was so small she thought i 'd bought her an empty bag	17
0	not what i expected the box was handmade the instructions were some other tool i have contacted seller and was not satisfied with response	17
0	you ca n't use this watch opener alone you need a vise to hold the watch the gromets that go into the opener that are supposed to fit into the watch back grooves do not stay in as soon as you turn it over they fall out i 've already lost two of them it 's a poorly made item and if it wold n't cost about as much to return it as keep it i would return it	17
0	so beware for regular size watch 's only will not open a marine star or anything bigger	17
0	it is constructed nicely however i could not open any of my watches with the pegs kept falling out of it hard to work with	17
0	loved how quiet it runs have one double the price and twice the noise ! only one problem the bottom turn table stopped within the first week ! ! yet the top turn table kept working contacted amazon and they secured a return only problem cost 11 00 to return seems the quality control needs improving	17
0	i bought this winder for my husband because of the price but it is so loud ! ! ! ! we had to put it another room because it was way too noisy for the bedroom i would n't recommend this i guess sometimes you get what you pay for	17
0	i'm in the military it hard for me to purchase items especially stationed overseas it 's always been easy to order from amazon as always i never had any problems the earrings were beautiful but the post was very hard to remove from the earrings when i pulled to remove the post while in my ear the post broke off from the ball earring i only had them for two weeks	17
0	earrings were very lightweight hollow and the hoops were very thin not good quality i could have done better at walmart i expected a lot better from amazon com especially for 50	17
0	i still have not received this item not sure what is going on \? if you have any answers i would love to hear about it \? thank	17
0	i saw this cute photo and bought it for my girlfriend when i got it it was the most horrible one	17
0	this pendant is on the cheap looking side but you get what you pay for i guess	17
0	i liked the watch i had to send the first one back because the date would never change i got the second one a month ago and have n't been able to wear it for the past two weeks because the band gave me a skin rash nice looking watch too bad i have to carry it around in my pocket now	17
0	big plus was the large digits on display i'm short sighted and run without my specs so i needed that the feel of the watch is nice however one big problem with it was that moving my wrist around kept poking the buttons and changing the display without warning \( maybe because i have big wrists \) bigger problem yet it took all of about 4 months for the plastic strap to break	17
0	this pendant looks great in the picture but when i received it it looks like yellow glass does n't look like a crystal at all i'm very dissapointed	17
0	there are n't any colors in this pendant just a ugly topaz which ruins the pendant same happened with heart i ordered from this seller normal swarovski crystals do not have a topaz covering the beauty of the crystals sorry i wasted my money should have bought from swarovski site	17
0	i bought a couple of pair of these for my wife for everyday ear rings the tiny stone fell out before she could wear one pair the earring is so small it makes it difficult to get on do not buy these	17

0	i bought these for my wife for x mas based on their picture they arrived she put them on both earings had the stones fall out and frame break within a half a day they are junk and the company that sent them cannot be trusted be careful ! ! !	17
0	come on ! i thought they had erroneously mailed out czs ! these earrings dont have even the faintest tinge of blue in them ! what a rip ! the sterling silver was nice and well constructed but i purchased these earrings on the strength of what i thought were the dazzling blue topaz stones quite a disappointment ! i had to buy an emergency back up christmas gift for my best friend	17
0	please read mr marcus c dunn 's review because i agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings in my case i bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee when i first received it today i was really liked the design of the earring but after closer examination i noticed that the blue stone was very light blue good quality earring for a young teenager \( 9 to 14 years old \) but not for the woman i'm going to spend the rest of my life with returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson jewelry has to been seen and bought with your own eyes and not through fancy photoshop website with touchup enhanced photos	17
0	the display fogged up within a week i got a replacement and it 's doing the same thing would not recommend this product	17
0	this watch did not last long in the water even though it said it was waterproof for 200 meters it lasted 2 weeks if you plan to purchase it for water look somewhere else	17
0	i loved my timex at first i have had it 6 months and have put 3 batteries in it i give up ! i guess timex no longer takes a licking and keeps on ticking i am going back to fossil brand	17
0	this was a present to myself for my birthday i thought i was purchasing a quality product two weeks after receiving the item it stopped working i took it to a certified jewler for battery replacement and a few days after that it stopped again i sent it back for a refund and not very happy i have to pay a restock fee for a defective item i will be rethinking future purchases	17
0	these earrings look like pieces of glass not diamonds no sparkle at all i feel i wasted my money caveat emptor	17
0	i got these as a college grad gift and while i love to wear them because of the thought behind them and who they came from they have very large very visible flaws i know the color and clarity were posted on the website but the other reviews made me wonder if i got an exceptionally bad pair \? people wo n't notice anything without taking a good close up look though and like i said i still love to wear them despite the quality	17
0	i do n't know who 's running the show at amazon but thier packing is atrocious they packed this watch with only a single air bubble of course when i received it it fell out of its tin and was scratched be wary of buying anything from amazon in regards to precious jewelry watch was fine though so if you really want this item purchase it somewhere else	17
0	croton makes very superficial products they look good on the shelf but are very poorly constructed once you get them home they start to fall apart they have no customer service at all nobody answers the phone or returns email before buying a croton watch call their customer service you wo n't get through	17
0	this is great looking watch at a good price but very heavy i am unable to wear this watch with activities like golf and tennis	17

0	i am very disappointed with this ring it is very pretty but once you take the string off it falls apart and there are no instructions to put it back together my husband and i have been trying to put it back together based on the picture of the ring on this website and have had no luck now all i have is a pile of silver rings that i cannot wear if anyone knows how to put this back together please post how ! thanks	17
0	the diamonds sold by this company contain heavy carbon deposits as a result the diamonds are dark in color and do n't sparkle like one would expect for the money paid i'm still waiting to receive a full refund after returning almost 3 weeks ago i do not recommend purchasing from this company if you 're looking for a diamond that truly catches the eye	17
0	most of the items were fine they were just given as gifts with 4 damaged i have tried to return without success i am disappointed that i am not able to return damaged or not functioning items i may think twice about ever doing this agai	17
0	the chain was much thicker than i expected and it 's pretty obvious that it is n't real silver but if you want some cheap metal bling this will do it	17
0	we never did figure out how to make them work the saddest thing was we gave them as gifts to our nephews boys and they could not use them very dissatisfied with this purchase	17
0	i purchased this as a gift for my daughter and was disapointed in the quality of the blue topaz they look dirty or something i went with the all blue topaz one that amazon sells and was quite impressed that for less money i ended up with a nicer necklace	17
0	i received the watch and it is definitely a great looking watch unfortunately the crown would n't pull out \( to set the date time \) so i returned it immediately fortunately amazon 's return policy is very easy and convenient with no charge for shipping \( either way \) for broken items i 'll probably try again with another invicta from amazon	17
0	these are nice amethyst earrings nice purple color however i'm returning them because they 're too big for my ears the basket setting makes them stick out too much the setting is not very pretty the gems are set very low into the basket	17
0	the watches looked very cheap could not gift it to friends	17
0	i have not yet been able to fasten these things while they are in my ears they are not useful to me at all	17
0	the watch came in a great looking case the face of the watch was attractive then oops could n't fasten it because there was no fastener it came with a return address slip for sending it back which is nice but i 'd rather get what i thought i ordered	17
0	these earrings have no blue in them ! the picture is extremely deceiving	17
0	the aquamarine earrings do not look at all like aquamarine which is supposed to be light blue they had no color so i ended up returning them	17
0	i loved these earrings and at the price i thought they 'd be great however when i got them i quickly discovered that the back for one of the pair was too loose to actually stay on the earring within two days the earring had fallen out and i have yet to find it there 15 down the drain	17
0	waveceptor doesnt work properly it doesnt get in sync with new daylight savings and you dont even have a knob to manually correct it the watch i bought is just of no use to me now i would have to return it to casio for repair	17
0	i bought this to change my watch battery tools broke after using it once worthless complete waste of money on this cheap toolkit	17
0	the packaging the bracelet came in was quite upscale nice black leather case much nicer than the bracelet deserved however the bracelet itself is light weight and the heart attached is ridiculously cheap it is not rounded as pictured but flat like a dog tag \( only much smaller \) i'm using mine as a base for a charm bracelet but i would never wear it by itself i understand though that it is not an expensive bracelet and the weight is probably about right for 925 silver at that price	17
0	product is not as pictured looks like a dimestore fake i had purchased this for one of my bridesmaids and now have to spend more money to buy her something else i would not give this to a 4 year old let alone a 34 year old i am very disappointed ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	17
0	i'm very disappointed in the watch we bought as the second hand broke off is there some way i can get a new one or get my back \? please let me know	17
0	beautiful color but very small in size i guess i should have checked he pearl size first instead of just looking at the pictur	17
0	these watches sounded like a good deal given the original price i ordered two one for myself and one for my brother they arrived today and both could not be set that is the pin on the side of the watch which you pull out to set the date and time would not pull out they were both stuck in the case so tight i broke a nail in the attempt and i agree with the others that the minor dials are so small they are useless they go back tomorrow	17
0	i ordered this bracelet as a christmas gift for my best friend based on the reviews it seemed to be a really nice product at a decent price however upon receipt of the bracelet i was so disappointed in its quality that i felt the need to purchase another gift to give along with the bracelet	17
0	i was very disappointed in this purchase and eventually ended up returning it the actual product did not live up to my expectation while the cross was of average quality \( not great but ok \) the chain was very cheaply made it did not even have a clasp on it you had to pull it over your head to get it on the price of this item did not match the quality of the product by any means even though i was disappointed with the item i have to say that the company was extremely easy to work with as far as getting a refund their customer service staff were very friendly and took the item back no questions asked	17
0	i have purchased eight of these units over the past year two of the eight have stopped working altogether and this morning one of the turntables on a third unit now fails to revolve the seller replaced the first unit that failed and when i requested replacement of the second unit i was told that it has been replaced by a newer model with vertical stacking and more timing features they could not offer the new model to me in exchange but they did offer a 20 discount it arrived today and seems to be working well if you are considering purchasing any unit made by this manufacturer \( garnin \) consider it as suitable for short term use rather than long term usage	17
0	i guess you get what you pay for but i thought it would be a bit nicer than it was very cheap looking not well mad	17
0	not worth the even 15 cheap and unattrctive gave it to my ki	17

0	i found the pendant to be too large the for delicate chain it hangs from and the pendant is flat and thin i will be returning it	17
0	the watch winder is very quiet and inexpensive however the quality is suspect one side stopped rotating after a week you probably get what you pay for too much hassle and does not make economic sense to ship back and incur international shipping charges	17

0	bought this for our 20 year old son for x mas i was very disappointed with the quality of this 85 pendant and returned it the very next day the chain looked and felt like plastic my initial reaction when i took it out of the box and felt how light it was in my hand was that it came from a bubble gum machine went to a christian bookstore the next day and found a beautiful sterling silver cross pendant for 28 that was 1 000 times better than this 85 one	17
0	i really thought this necklace looked good in the picture and then i recieved it today wow ! it is so light and the quality of the chain is terrible i have bought this for my boy friend for christmas and now im wondering whether to even give it to him it should cost 20 bucks maybe	17

0	i bought this for my grandson for christmas and when his mother was taking it out of the box the clasp broke and it 's not repairable apparently it 's attached to the box with staples and unless you have a staple pulled it 's too fragile to just pull from the holder	17

0	very lousy quality faceplate fell off on arrival	17
0	when i got this it said 2 5 caret weight well they came and are 2 caret weight and are so small i will give them to granddaughter not worth sending back as it's too much bother to do ! ! what a rip off i went back to see if i read it wrong and it's still listed at 2 5 caret size !	17
0	i never recieved this watch and about 30 or so days later amazon refundedmy payment i don' understand why this supplier could not come up with such a common item but i got my money back so i am not upset this is why i try not to buy from an amazon seller preffering to buy directly form the amazon site	17
0	watch is great looking but there was no battery in it now i have to get it to a jewlers to buy a battery there was no indication of this in the ad or in the instructions	17

0	this was a total waste of money it 's a real cheapo like something out of a cracker jack box	17
0	i am still waiting to receive my item so i couldn't possibly rate something i don't have except to say that its taken way too long to receive	17
0	this watch is a good size pretty comfortable and nice looking for a sport watch but resetting time or date or figuring out how to turn off the alarm when you set it by mistake \( when you were trying to figure out how to reset the time and date \) is super frustrating the buttons are impossible i 've had it with mine and will buy another product	17
0	the watch is quite lightweight and comes with good features however i think it is very hard to use you have to hit the buttons just right and for the certain amount of times to change anything if you lose the directions you will never remember how to change it it took me over 6 months to change it i had many people try to alter it but it was to no prevail additionally the watch is not very water resistant i went swimming a couple of times and now i hardly see the time due to the water i would recommend paying more for a lot better watch for this was a waste of money !	17
0	i find it intresting that i am being asked to rate a product that was ordered 6 weeks ago and i still have not received or have been given a notice of shippment	17
0	this product is not worth the price by itself it 's fair at buy 1 get 4 free the time function works fine the compass on the other hand is virtually useless having gotten 5 watches all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions	17
0	i recently bought this casio automic solar powered watch and was very excited by the automatic time keeping feture it is agreat watch but does not have a timer built in which i need when working out fartlek runs and in between sets it has a uselesss feture of recording time of events which i am not sure why anyone would actually need this with out the data of what actually happpened during those 30 recorded events \? wish casio would put a timer in it guess i'll go back to a timex ironman later	17
0	i 've had three of these watches but the band loosens up and falls off with no way to put it back on its ridiculus b c seems like the band worsens in water and this is supposed to be fore triathlons however the interval counter is a great feature but whats the point of having a watch that the band wont last more than a year or two	17
0	this is not a rosary it is just a necklace with a crucifix and medal attached a catholic rosary has 5 decades \( 1 our father 10 hail marys \) this has no spaces to designate the our father from the hail marys it also has 17 extra beads on the rope and 3 extra beads on the beginningjust after the crucifix	17
0	i 've had this watch for about 5 months now and the threaded crown or body stripped so the crown no longer locks in place i 've tried contacting citizen for waranty and they say it 's not covered citizen claims that i over tightened it or cross threaded it while screwing down so it will cost 50 100 to repair total joke ! i 'll never purchase a citizen watch again i 've always thought they were cheap to begin with this just confirms my thoughts	17
0	i really liked the watch as it looked in the picture but when i purchased it i realized that its way too shiny if you have a thin wrist then the watch looks really bulky besides the 12 o'clock mark on the watch is not exactly to the north so you have to tilt your head and make sense of the time i am going to return this watch	17
0	when i received these earrings i was delighted they were just what i wanted however after wearing them for a few weeks one of them had a major discoloration on the back portion it was not normal tarnish which one might expect from sterling additionally i was experiencing extreme irritation which might suggest that they are not as sterling as stated with much disappointment i ended up throwing them away	17
0	this watch is very attractive however the clasp is not stable and it has fallen off my arm several times i rarely wear it as a result and am always surprised it 's still there when i do with a more stable clasp this would be a 4 star watch but this problem is severe enough that it makes the watch worthless to me \( hence 1 star \)	17
0	i loved the watch when i first received it i wore it two or three times then a piece of the wire mess that the band is made of broke and was sticking up i tried to bend it around but the loose wire continued to snag my clothes so i stopped wearing it	17
0	ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what i received was worse than expected in part because amazon sent the wrong item spoke with customer service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first however the same wrong item was again sent the problem is the item has been switched with another silver heart locket one even cheesier than the product listed i contacted customer service regarding the replacement they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct eventually both lockets have been returned there did n't seem to be any way of getting the proper locket i wound up ordering a completely different design from another vendor	17
0	i agree that this is a beautiful product however i returned these earrings not long ago the reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring i tried to wear them but the half arrow was too big and i could n't get them through my earlopes	17
0	some spot was off on the white paint on the guess women 's white chronograph was off when i got it i did n't like that at all	17
0	the quality is not so good i also got a smaller carat than i bought i contacted the seller for a return but they are not cooperative and did not provide information on how to return the item looks like i will dispute the charge on my credit card beware	17
0	the first day i wore this ring one of the stones fell out the day it fell out i was typing on the computer did not even know it came out till later did not find the stone would not recomend this ring	17
0	which makes the wrench completely useless i 'll have to buy another wrench elsewhere from a vendor that supplies the bits also the wooden handles have splinters and are extremely cheaply made do not buy this product	17
0	the instructions that you do get are wrong the items i get and the ones listed are totally different it does n't tell you how to use each of the tools some of the tools i'm still puzzled in what to do with it the soft head hammer that is used to knock the pin back into bracelet does n't look too soft too me !	17
0	extremely poor quality tools complete waste of money for this price barely worth 10	17
0	the kit looks professinal it would be nice if they would include instructions i have no idea what each tool is for and how to use them it is not designed for a homeowner would not recommend it	17
0	the kit is a batch of tools that are mostly not defined with little to no instruction most pieces are of junk quality and break after one or two uses if they last that long clearly not worth the price	17
0	i recently ordered this item and was disappointed the chain is of poor cheap quality which makes the necklace look tacky i 've bought necklaces in the same price range of much better quality i will be returning this item along with the other items i ordered from nvie also of cheap quality	17
0	i 've bought a lot from amazon over the years this was the first watch though i 've bought and owned several seiko watches this is probably the worst experience that i 've ever had with amazon and seiko too ! the watch came with a box that looked water damaged the watch itself has a broken clasp it looks beautiful but i bought it as a gift when she opened it the clasp refused to lock its never gone far enough to have the time set or even being tried on amazon actually tried to sleeze out of it by telling me to follow the waranty pocedures how long does she have to wait for her birthday gift \? the warranty process could take weeks	17
0	i work in nyc and live on long island and the watch would never connect the whole point of th watch was that it did that but it never did i returned right away	17
0	i am rather picky but liked not only the look of these earrings on the webpage but also the name they were not what i was expecting when they arrived they are okay but not nearly what i thought they would be they are not very sea opal ish they look too glassy and transparent the silver is also okay but could be better i would not recommend	17
0	this set of earrings was only 10 and the delivery from silver insanity was fast but false advertising really pisses me off they do not look nearly as nice as the picture and in fact the glass part of the earring is plastic and it even has bubbles in it it 's ugly the other earrings that i bought from them also do not look much like their photos	17
0	battery died within a month i had already gotten rid of the packaging	17
0	not as they appear ! march 8 2007reviewer rappster \( denver co \) see all my reviewsi ordered these earrings on a 'gold box' special and waited eagerly for them to arrive they were such a disappointment i returned them the next day i did not expect the diamonds to be huge based on their cttw but the earrings themselves are miniscule ! they look like they were made for children i tried on one earring and could n't even see the earring in my ear much less tell there were any diamonds it looked like i did n't even have an earring on !	17
0	i just received this locket which was intended to be a gift for my niece for x mas and had to decline on giving it to her when i received it i actually thought amazon forgot to put it in the bag it came in i shook the bag felt for the necklace and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant it 's so small i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself i was very disappointed other then the size and over priced tag i thought it was cute but i will be returning it sorry	17
0	this watch died \( battery \? \) one year after i bought it i like the watch it fits well and i'm able to swim in the pool and ocean with it but i ca n't find a place to repair it here on maui it has a 3 year warranty but i 'd have to mail it in after the battery is changed it needs to be pressure tested what a hassle	17
0	i had a watch like this from pulsar years ago and it worked well this one i am returning to amazon because it ca n't keep time and the calender keeps resetting to jan 1 it was made in china so what can i expect i am deeply disappointed in this product no more pulsars for m	17
0	i was hoping for a little bit higher quality but you get what you pay for i gues	17
0	i bought a nike triax c5 heart rate monitor watch a year ago the strap is already falling apart near the bezel the watch has a 2 yr warranty but do not cover the strap or the crystal even if the problem is poor workmanship	17
0	i'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because their customer service \( communication and such \) have been very good i purchased this bracelet a few months ago and \( a few days ago \) had the unfortunate experience as the previous reviewer i was taking it off and it snapped in the middle once you could see the insides it was obviously not pure sterling silver as the materials portion indicates i will be returning this item for a new one \( already gave my girl a matching one \) and may not even wear it at all very disappointing	17
0	although this product is pretty to look at one must remember not to bend it to fit as it will crack the silver plating and the bracelet will fall apart in your hands i do not suggest buying this item as it is not solid sterling silver as you are lead to believe	17
0	the good news is the watch 's case is quite nice now the could be improved points it 's sized weird it 's a lot larger than you think add to that it 's bracelet is rather small so now that i removed a single link i can barely get it over my average sized wrist and once it 's on it 's still too loose weird but true frankly it 's good looking but i do n't think i 'll get another one	17
0	i really liked the way this cross and chain looked unfortunately i only got to enjoy it for about a week before the flimsy chain broke and i lost the whole thing	17
0	i ordered a swarovsky crystal pendant which i thought was clear like one i had purchased once on a visit to a swarovsky factory the one i received is clear but not like the first one it is transparent but has a gold tint which keeps it from being as transparent as the first one i was disappointed	17
0	heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture there 's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal swarovski crystal in other words no colors shine at all same thing in on other sites for like 1 speedy delivery was the only positive	17
0	the pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design it does not go with the center design i think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either	17
0	the first watch i received did not work at all the second watch runs fast i really thought seiko made a better product maybe it really is n't a seiko	17
0	the pic online is not a true representation these are more like baby cuffs was so embarassed to give as a xmas gift	17
0	i bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off i felt like the biggest loser when i contacted amazon they said that because it was over 2 months that i had bought the earrings i could n't return them what a rip off these earrings do n't even deserve 1 star	17
0	i chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo they felt quite flimsy when i got them i do like a lightweight earring but not a flimsy one the studs on these are not attached as firmly as i would like one has already come off they are however very pretty the quality was just not what i expected	17
0	these earrings looked great and i really liked them but in less than a month the posts broke completely off and the earrings are now completely useless	17
0	band deteriorates rapidly \( 4 months \) design makes it exceptonally dificult to replace withouttedious modification see other reviewactual picture of band shows how replacemnt band fails to follow curve of watch body real dud monthly cost of ownership makes it as costly as a role	17
0	i bought this watch about 7 months ago and had all the issues listed to some degree or anouther but all in all it was still a good watch for the price that is untill 5 days ago when all the digital functions on the watch quit and then a day later went blank leaving me with a standard watch but i guess you get what you pay for	17
0	i recived the watch and it is fine however i want to complain above amazon 's way to pack purchases amazon pack a tiny watch box in a huge box then i have to pay lots of money paying a mail forwarder because to this policy i use a mail forwarder from miami to caracas \( venezuela \) and i spread 19 instead 5 because box size and i recived a huge box full of air bags this situation is not the first time to happend and i hope amazon compense me in any way	17
0	the watch obviously looks nice and the links have a nice unique design unfortunately i have had terrible issues with the pins between the links there are multiple links that wiggle out throughout the day and i have to shimmy them back in all day long i tried having this issue addressed with a jeweler but it did n't last this is the kind of issue i would expect from an inferior watch perhaps one well under 100 bucks	17
0	earrings are pretty but look cheap and very flimsy i know they are supposed to be delicate but they are not what they appear to be from the picture	17
0	wife liked them so much she asked me to buy her a set of black ones she was also happy that they had 14k gold posts she loved the quality	17
0	this watch is lightweight and elegant in appearance but the clasp loosened repeatedly in ordinary wear i returned the item for credit	17
0	this is a great watch to wear casually or formally it works very well easy to read and is stunningly elegant in its design amazon was a fantastic place to get it the best price and the shipping was quick	17
0	these earings are the worst ! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color ! on was grey and one was black ! i dont recommend this	17
0	the earrings are very pretty but the posts arrived bent the material for the post is too soft	17
0	this is a beautiful watch but just a word of warning it is big ! i actually returned it for a smaller one the watch face is 30mm which is quite a bit larger than most women 's watches the face was almost the size of my husband 's watch if you like big watches then you will love this one it is beautiful but if you want a normal size watch i would reccommend that you keep on shopping	17
0	though the design is cool the quality of this earrings set is poor they are so light and the color is strikingly white which makes them appear cheaper i also bought the pendant with the same design and i'm so disappointed with both \( i suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design	17
0	this locket was dime sized much smaller than i had anticipated it was also very plain and looked cheap the mother of pearl locket was much better	17
0	i liked these earrings when i got them they were smaller than i hoped but would wear them anyway i lost one earring the first time i wore it ! ! ! ! ! i am so bummed ! so if you get them put a back on the wire part of the earring	17
0	the closure for the earings was not secure as a result everytime anything brushed against your ear the closure came undone and within two weeks i lost one earing this type of closure is not practicle for anyone who is remotely active	17
0	i bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch for swimming and running unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming is unbelievably bulky and has this strange time setting system which only works in the usa and europe \( i live in australia \) in the end i gave it to a relative in the usa	17
0	i think the picture is better than the real thing the gems are actually pretty decent they are a good size and have a hint of color however the setting is so deep and so bulky that when the earrings are on you ca n't see the sparkle of the stones if the setting was daintier and the stones had more color these would look great but as they are the earrings look like blobs not tanzanite	17
0	i have had this watch for about 4 months if you do n't have a job operating a jack hammer it will probably run itself down i am very disappointed in the watch it was not cheap i paid about 200 for it and i expected better i am one of those people that never take my watch off and it still winds down and stops i made a big deal about this watch with my wife and now i get a lot of grief when i complain about it it is sturdy having hit the wall several times	17
0	the description states that it holds large watches but they hit the glass when the top is closed especially casio 's larger g shocks the lock did not work but i do n't care about that the beige material on the inside and pillows peels off ! i will not purchase another case of this brand	17
0	this watch was of such poor quality that the second hand fell off by the third day of use the cost of shipping to claim a defect under warranty was more than the initial cost of the watch a total disappointment and waste of time and money do n't buy this watch	17
0	clip is uneasy to use arrows fell off after my first run would never by anything from this manufacturer again	17
1	elegant yet tough this particular casio has a metal bracelet and is extremely comfortable to wear the display is sharp clear and very easy to read i only wish it had a thermometer the watch is big and looks very macho on your wrist	17
1	i wear this watch every day and i usually work outside i am very pleased with the features and the durability it seemed daunting to work the features at forst but a short time with the instruction book made them accessable and easy i have only two complaints one is that the metal band has developed a slight squeak when i move my wrist sometimes the tin man needs oil the second is that despite being placed by a huge window every night the watch does not always get the time signal from ft collins i have gone as long as several days without getting it but when you consider that most watches do not get it at all i am ok with the spotty reception	17
1	i love this watch it has radio controlled time so it gives you exact time automatically easy to read numerials watch is attactive the only down side is that it is a little bit on the heavy side	17
1	this watch just absolutely filled the wish for my 4 year old grandchild ! she is unable to tell time yet but she wanted a princess watch to help her learn and she was thrilled when she received it my daughter told me it was pretty and soft looking i insisted that the watch be one with hands not digital so we all were happy and satisfied ! ina lan	17
1	comes in nice display box with cushioned spaces a quality time piece band has a felt backing for extra comfort the smaller items are buttons that are afixed with tie tack type closures	17
1	great deal and gift if you want something different and at a good price	17
1	comes in nice display box with cushioned spaces a quality time piece band has a felt backing for extra comfort the smaller items are buttons that are afixed with tie tack type closures	17
1	i love knowing the exact time \( even if my mom thinks i am crazy \) and it works like a clock ! i never have issues with the updates \( in illinois \) but i do have a few minor issues the watch is too thick \( 5 8 inch \) the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human the buttons are hard to press and the manual is too small and hard to read still if i had a choice between this watch or my borhter 's rolex i will take his rolex and exchange it for 40 casios thank you casio	17
1	i live in eastern pennsylvania about 1600 1700 miles away from the atomic time signal station and this watch syncs fine right on my bureau 4 feet from a window and in a watch case when i received the watch the battery indicator was on medium after about 30 minutes or less on a sunny windowsill it achieved full charge i'm quite pleased with it	17
1	i bought two of these for my twin two year old nephews who liked my watch they 're too young to tell time but love the watches and asked to put them on in the mornings while i was visiting it has great features to help kids learn how to tell time and the watch is small enough for tiny wrists but with a face big enough for learning	17
1	i returned these because they were too large for me to be fair to zina they were as described and i was n't sure they would work the only reason i'm not rating them a 5 is that having returned them i do n't know how long the clasp would work i kept gold small hoops i bought at same time very happy with them zina 's product descriptions are exceptionally good	17
1	i love the look and function of this watch but guys if you have any hair on your wrists be prepared to have it forcibly removed by the metal band i 've had 3 other fossil watches and never had this problem i think fossil needs to address the clearance between the links on this one ouch !	17
1	i got this watch one week ago its very good looking watch its 85 but looks like 150 watch all of my friends are asking about this watch as it catches others eye very easily it upper dial \( having number 05 15 25 etc \) rotates clock wise this is a functionality to keep the time accurate while fast driving its bit heavy but now i am used to it i would recomend this watch to everyone who like heavy looking watches on their wrist	17
1	the earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find my daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one but that is no bash on the earrings the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment i would definitely buy them again	17
1	i got these today and was so shocked when they arrived wow these are amazing hoops for 25 dollars i am more than pleased do n't have an idea what some of the other reviewers were complaining about i am floored at the price and the quality at the same time with free shipping these are a must great gift idea and everyday earrings amazon got them to me in a matter of 4 days and i'm in hawaii they also came beautifully packaged i'm in love with them do n't let these sell out	17
1	these were perfect the girl liked them they 're the perfect size not very expensive great gift	17
1	i sent these for my cousin \( who has everything ! \) on her 16th birthday when i saw them later they were smaller than i expected but she wears them everyday and they look very cute and understated they are a nice color and look better than cheap silver ones plus if you are like my cousin and your ears get irritated with anything but gold i would recommend these	17
1	i have shopped with this company before and have never been disappointed fast shipping and delivery reasonably priced and always what you expected	17
1	this invicta 2699 watch it 's a nice watch the case of stainless steel polished looks very well solid with transparent case back although there is nothing exceptional to look at dial of mother of pearl clear and clean with not too many words or other dials on it looks elegant the roman numbers are very good for that dial the hands are big enough to be seen even in poor light conditions the movement is a miyota automatic with 21 jewels works fine for the price it has poor power reserve so if you do not use it for 24 hours it will stop nothing to worry about	17
1	exactly what i wanted at a great price	17
1	these have quickly become my favorite pair of earrings they look substantial when worn but they are lightweight and comfortable they go well with either silver or white gold necklaces they are shiny and have a classic appearance plus the snap bar locks them securely in place buy them and you wo n't be sorry ! they also make a great gift item	17
1	i did n't expect the earrings to be so beautiful and they 're really easy to wea	17
1	silver insanity continues to produce gorgeous items of celtic jewellery the drop hook earrings come with nice size faceted oval synthetic amethyst stones very light weight looks like you would pay 4 5 times the price silver insanity just delivers time after time	17
1	quality of leather looks nice i can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off it 's metal squeazed to leather and that 's what i expected you just have to keep an eye on it and do n't sleep or shower in it it looks nice	17
1	these are so beautiful picture does not do them justice gorgeous celtic knot design	17
1	these earrings are very good quality sent to me quickly and in a jewelry bag a very nice gift	17
1	i was getting worried if it would arrive before my girlfriend went home for the holidays then as promised it arrived today last day in the estimated delivery window hey its christmas i understand shipping sucks this time of year but i still would have been angry if it was late ok item itself looks great i love the chain that came with it the box looks a little to cheesy on the outside to be romantic but the wrapping was high class enough to make up for the box im sure my girlfriend will love this it will go great with her tattoo	17
1	this necklace is well made very lovely i am very pleased with the quality	17
1	this is a great watch for a woman ! i ca n't see it fitting a man and the watch face is too small for a man i ordered it for my sister who has a large wrist and it is perfect for her	17
1	my watch band was wider than the tool allowed so i used a milling machine to let it accept 1 8 more ad should have stated how wide a band would work in this device otherwise worked well	17
1	tool works pretty well product slightly different than picture not quite as good of quality as pictured worked on several brands of watch bands seller was prompt	17
1	good product for a good price this is an item u ca n't do without would buy from vendor again	17
1	i got it since two month ago and it looks cool i like it	17
1	it is good and nice design but it is little bit heavy	17
1	my husband had seen this watch advertised in a magazine and fell in love with it and had to have it i searched at tommy stores large department stores and was not able to find it anywhere except amazon com the watch arrived as promised and my husband loves the watch	17
1	i need this bracelet for someone heading for the military she would love it very much	17
1	this quote became my all time favorite the first time i read it i was so delighted to find it on a piece of jewelry ! i had it on my quot wish list quot for over a year this year my husband finally took the hint and bought it for me ! it 's a beautiful piece is very comfortable and is made of quality silver i highly recommend it for anyone who finds herself needing a boost of self reliance throughout the day	17
1	i have a disabled child and i got this as a gift from my husband and children i look at it and i feel so greatful for the family i have	17
1	these were slightly smaller than i had hoped but they 're pretty and they do the job	17
1	excellent quality the post is smooth and does not abrade the ear as some inexpensive earrings do the ball is smooth and shiny with no ripples pits or other defects i am very happy with this purchase	17
1	the item has arrived in perfect timing the earrings are good quality but not the best one	17
1	i purchased these at 16 in december 2006 they are currently running for 15 which is so worth it for 14k white gold earrings at this price you should be thinking about next year 's christmas presents otherwise if you are looking for a treat for yourself you will not be disappointed the reason they lose a star with me is that for the 7mm size the earring backs should be larger they are on the small side	17
1	gave these to my wife as part of a birthday gidt and she loves them she says they feel more comfortable than most stud type and they look great	17
1	these earrings are great they are the perfect size i would recommend these to anyone who likes a classic look	17
1	these earrings were a great value for the price ! they 're small and delicate enough to wear out but also look very polished for work i would recommend them to any and everyone	17
1	this is a great looking watch and i like that it is lightweight i took it to the jeweler to have a few links removed it 's just techie enough for a geek like me \( updates via satellite days of the week in several languages etc \) enjoy	17
1	this watch is a high quality item for low money you might think at first the color of the face is a little loud but you grow to like it and as most of you know if you have to grow to like something you like it for a longer time than something that just grabs you quickly it keeps perfect time at all times as it is updated with a signal from fort collins colorado every night i would definately reccommend this item brand for anyone looking for a watch	17
1	this is a great watch for my husband mike he has wanted a watch that he did n't have to worry about changing the time on all the time he travels often in his work i also has a nice lighted face which is easy for him to read getting older posses some vision problems so being able to read the time on your watch is a wonderful advantage he also likes that it is on atomic time and energy	17
1	product matches expectations no problems some other customers complained about how lightweight it is to me it seems like what you should expect from titanium \( after all that 's why they use it to make aircraft \) the predictions of it getting sprung \( losing its spring tension \) were more of a legitimate concern to me but i 've had it for a month or two and it seems fine it seems no more likely to do that than any other money clip which is to say maybe it eventually will or maybe it wo n't them 's the risks of life go for it	17
1	i purchased these earrings for my infant daughter since most earrings are too large in my opinion for a 3 month old 's ears this was the perfect solution as my daughter likes to lie on me when taking a short nap the first earrings she had poked into me and it was uncomfortable for me these are small enough not to bother me the prongs do cover a bit more of the diamond than is shown in the pictures but they are still very cute i also like the backs as they screw on to the posts and are nice and safe for baby 's head	17
1	i needed something to express how i felt in a way that few words would say exactly that and the yin yang necklace did it for me	17
1	i purchased this item as a present for my friend and i the piece is beautiful and is a great gift for anyone i myself have the yin half of the duo the only problem is that the black paint in the yin half is easily washed away now i do n't mean that it all washes away but it does erode the yin looks a lot better with a little silver shining through the paint however but i do worry about all of the paint eventually going away other than that minor defect the necklaces are wonderfull i 'll definately be buying from this seller again	17
1	it 's a beautiful necklace and it was worth the cost it 's not filmsy or cheap it 's durable and great	17
1	the necklace arrived quickly especially considering that it came from thailand good quality for a good price thanks for good service will be buying jewelry from this seller again	17
1	this is a very pretty omega that goes well with many different pendants and looks great all by itself	17
1	this was an inexpensive ring for a great price it was a good buy for a hs niece who loves her celtic heritage and the color blue	17
1	it was just what i wanted i wear this ring on my pinky finger and it looks perfect color clarity and triquetra pattern are striking	17
1	i did n't realize how picky my taste is with rings until i scoured amazon for hours looking for something that would interest me this ring is one of the few i found and i am far from a fan of having stones in my rings it has a nice low profile i 've yet to have it catch on anything i'm also not a fan of open knot work on rings but this again managed to sidestep that distaste the stone has no backing so it gets an interesting red tinge in the middle tinted by my finger	17
1	i read the reviews of the other buyers while i was purchasing ing this ring the first review makes it sound mediocre while the other made it sound perfect i promised myself i 'd write a true review of the ring once i recieved my own the stone is neither large nor gawdy the silver pattern is slighty thick for my tastes however not noticably thick the stone is not high nor fake looking the picture gives an acurate display of the product all in all it 's a beautiful ring and a lovely buy for the price asked	17
1	i was concerned the stone would stick up too high on my finger instead it 's the perfect height i was concerned about ordering off the internet but i'm very pleased with the speed of service and the quality of the topaz is very good	17
1	i'm quite happy with these and writing to say so because other users' comments were very helpful to me especially the person who said that the earrings were substantial i e though diminutive they have bulk so are visible with nice warm glow	17
1	i bought these earrings for my 10 year old grandaughter for christmas i think she has worn them everyday since she loves them they are not large hoops if fact they are a bit small but perfect for her for an adult i think a little bit larger size would be better all in all i was very pleased with the earrings the quality is very good	17
1	when i first ordered these i wasnt expecting anything of high quality since their price was so low it was more of a side gift for my girlfriend but upon recieving i was taken back at how nice they really look you cant pass these up for the price shipping was very fast too	17
1	this cute little watch comes with a real eye patch my son loved it because he also wears an eye patch for his crossed eye	17
1	this was a stocking stuffer for christmas my grandson loved it and it is performing well	17
1	this is so cute and if you are a pig collector you need to add him to your collection the blue eyes and rhinestone ears are what make it nice pink color not too bright or too dull and so small it 's cute the little compartment can fit a few rings or earrings in it very very nice	17
1	do n't let the price of this cat necklace make you think it is tiny and almost invisible ! ! it is a very good size and the carving is great ! it was so inexpensive that i bought two of them i'm thinking i might give one to my fellow cat lover friend ! great item with a great price !	17
1	i bought this item for my grandaughter whose birthday is in august i think she will like it a lot i know i did	17
1	i was impressed with the quality and detail of the ring the person i bought it for loves it and as a jeweler herself that says alot i was afraid of the metals when i bought it but she has had no problems overall the ring is a gorgeous imitation of history and i would highly recommend it and the company i bought it from	17
1	it is what he wanted and you provided it for him thanks i made points as a good grandmother	17
1	this is a very grown up looking watch and my son who is seven loved it but it bothered him that it did n't fit very well the velcro part did n't go very far so it was too big and we ended up putting this one away for maybe next year and buying another timex that was easier to adjust which worked pretty well by the way	17
1	we bought this watch for my 8 year old who loves it we deliberately wanted him to develop his time telling skills \( i e no digital watches please ! \) and have a cool watch too the velcro strap the second hand water resistant qualities \( i can wear it in the shower mom ! \) and the indiglo face \( very cool in movie theaters \) made this a great buy	17
1	very well satisfied it 's great for a kid to learn to tell time and the design with velcro strap makes it very adjustable	17
1	i bought this as a holiday gift they 're a nice size clear stones with good purple color i'm very pleased with my purchase particularly considering the price if i were to change one thing i 'd have preferred larger backs and a sturdier post	17
1	my friend loved the watch and helped to bring her out of a bad mood	17
1	the watch is very colorful it is even safe to wear in the shower however the watch cannot be read in the dark and the hands are even hard to see in daylight it takes an extra few seconds to figure out wear the hands are but adults who ca n't get enough of harry should consider this watch	17
1	it 's a good value for money too rough on the edges	17
1	i have no problem with the watch i actually bought it for my son in law he seems happy with it it updates the time and date almost every night he says even though it keeps very good time without an up date	17
1	my husband likes watches and is a bit of a geek so this was the perfect christmas gift for him i was a little bit apprehensive when i recieved it but it works just like it should it is not apparent from the discription but this watch does have the date feature i could n't have gotten him a better gift for the price he wears it every day	17
1	works like advertised syncs well with atomic time from colorado \( i am in california \) looks nice	17
1	\( \) the watch has a nice weight beautiful face and is generously sized i need to have several links removed before i can wear it it comes nicely packaged although at first i did n't think that instructions and warranty paperwork were included they were hidden inside the top of the watch box it was difficult at first to pull out the pin in order to set the time but once i got the pin out it was a snap to adjust the date and time all in all an excellent watch for a great price !	17
1	i 've only had this watch for about a week so ca n't really comment about the long term durability however it is ultra cool watch although i 've not got a scale handy at the moment but it seems to be lighter than my ipod nano really a featherweight watch and therefore very comfortable to wear the dial color really ca n't be adaquately captured in a picture it is very attractive much more striking than the image indicates several people have asked where i purchased it i'm very happy with this choice	17
1	this skagen watch is full of class yet it 's perfect for casual wear too very thin so it 's not clunky like a lot of other watches titanium black and the band is black metal as well had to bend the clasp a bit to get it to hold but now it 's perfect and because it 's not an expansion braclet it 's very easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist i hope to have this for years to come because i 've not seen anything like it and the price is right too	17
1	this watch is so light and thin but so good looking that even my husband who does n't like watches weighing him down wears it every day after three months i do n't see any wearing away of the band and the face seems to really resist scratching because it still looks perfect	17
1	the watch is everything i hoped for except i wish the blue dial was a little brighter blue handsome as is just not impressive or eye catching other than that minor complaint it is very slim and very comfortable to wear you do n't even feel it on your arm	17
1	do n't buy this watch unless you want it \( and your good taste \) to be admired it 's just beautiful sort of like man jewelry for guys that do n't wear jewelry but i plan to wear it only when i wear certain clothing to certain events i have other watches for other situations	17
1	i loved this watch the moment i put it on at macy 's i get home to see if i could maybe get a better deal than 135 as always amazon comes through yet again with a price of 69 plus i do n't pay sales tax on it sold ! if you 've not seen this watch in person the pictures definitely do not do it justice	17
1	this watch is for occasions only you wear this one to weddings dance parties and or formal occassions 1 you do n't bring this to a fishing camp or use it climbing a rock face 2 it 's not a chonographic face so not for military so its not roughed enough to take out into the wilderness to go romping through with your m2a1 rifles its sole perpuse is to get stares and look pretty on occasions like birthday events let your girlfriends buy it for you guys i bought it because it was titanium mesh not because of it 's latching method again its almost 18th century it 's 21 century material used in place of a 18th century design	17
1	great looking watch looks just like the photo if not better very pleased with the quality and for a very affordable price	17
1	i had been looking at the skagen watches for six months and could not find any sales they are priced around 110 when i saw this particular model for 69 i was excited i read some other reviews on other watches and was cautious when some said that they purchased watches that were not in boxes and had no instructions this watch arrived three days after i ordered it and was in a beautiful box just like i had bought at the store it was brand new and i love it i especially love it when i get something new on sale and a great deal amazon is a great place to order i get merchandise very quickly and at a great price	17
1	this necklace turned out to be a fantastic gift she wears it everyday with every outfit it looks great with jeans and a t shirt and with an extravagent dress	17
1	this is a perfect anytime gift i bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it we have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top perfect for any occasion she 'll love it this will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anythingplus it 's under 100 ca n't beat the price thanks amazon	17
1	i wore the phoenix necklace at my first trip to the magic castle where i got compliments from the waiter and some of the magician	17
1	i came across this looking for angel pendants i bought this one and the matching earrings i absolutely love this pendant ! wear it all the time and always get compliments on it you can wear it year round ! one of the earrings fell out of my ear the first time i wore it ! would n't recommend those ! but this winged pendants is beautiful	17
1	i was pleased with this item my only criticism is that it is smaller than it appears in the pictures so i was decieved i was hoping for a larger pendant however my wife really likes it and it came with a nice little velvetine bag in which to store it	17
1	i love this pendant every time i wear it people want to know where i got it back in the 70 's we bought items that reminded us of the eagles and lynn skynn 's free bird so when i wear it it reminds me of the good old days yeah i know it 's a pheonix but whn i bought it was called an eagle \( ebay	17
1	i had the pendant in 3 days insted of 3 weeks ! and that from the us to the netherlands many thanks for that the pendant itself is perfect very detaild and it looks great	17
1	my girls love them the face of the watch is clear and easy to see they also like that it lights up	17
1	these watches are just as cute as they look in the ad this is 1 of 3 i bought for christmas all 3 girls really like them no one has had any trouble with them	17
1	i had an issue with my ring not being delivered in a timely matter i got in touch with the company and they had a new one delivered to me the next day the person i dealt with was very professional and i would definitely buy from this company again	17
1	i bought this for my wife for valentines day and she was elated she said they were the perfect size and weight when she 's happy i'm happy	17
1	these earrings are perfect ! perfect in size color and weight they 're not much bigger then a quater and very light in a beautiful white gold shine yes the post are thicker then most but after a few days you get use to them i had a pair like these that were given to me as a gift and i lost one when i found these on amazon i was n't sure how much they would be like my other they are a perfect match and my old pair was at least 7 8 years old if you want a perfect hoop that is good for day or night these are the ones	17
1	i was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick however i think it 's a decent buy for only 30 00 i bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend it comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch very clean presentation when you open it up the white gold really shines the free shipping was fast and i do mean quick i ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day i 've never had a quicker shipment for free before if your looking for a great deal on white gold earings i think you 've found it	17
1	the picture for this pendant is deceiving it is a lot smaller than it appears i know the dimensions were given but the picture gives one the impression that it is bigger than it really is nevertheless my wife likes it very much and that 's good enough for me the price was right at 18 00 so overall i think it was a good buy	17
1	being part irish and born 3 days after st patricks day hence my name i was lucky enough to find this item at amazon com and it is a top class item with a good finish the ring seems to keep it 's shine with no maintanence required as usual the service and delivery at amazon com is second to none as an american living in australia there are so many things i ca n't get in this country which is why i get things like jewelry from them could n't be happier with this ring	17
1	my cousin is pleased with this gift and began wearing as soon as she got it	17
1	i bought these for my sister for christmas and she absolutlely loved them	17
1	i was pleased when i received my earrings however they 're smaller in reality than what 's pictured on the website but they 're still pretty	17
1	very lovely for a good price and came less then a week after i ordered it with standard mail was very impresse	17
1	jewelry watcheslive well you 'll be always in a high spirit if you purchase this bracelet it 's a really good gift for your friends	17
1	the bracelet looks more expensive than it is i like wearing it	17
1	although i 've only had it a few weeks i have had many compliments and questions on where i got it it is detailed and solid with a great message would recommend it	17
1	loving the look of the rolex daytona i spotted this watch on amazon and just had to have one \( at the price \) arrived in a well padded display box with all parts of the watch and strap covered in a protective plastic so no scratches taking out a few links for that custom fit just took a couple of minutes the watch looks great better than the images on the web and it works as described other posters that have had issues should read the manual ! it does all of the chrono functions and has full adjustments for hand alignment etc fantastic	17
1	the watch looks and feels great i did a lot of looking around before i decided on this watch and i'm very happy with my choice ! i would recommend this watch to anyone who is in the market for a very good watch at an even better price well done invicta and amazon on a great product	17
1	i sent this watch to my five year old grandson as his birthday gift he was very proud wearing it because the second hand had a soccer ball on it and the strap did not need adjusting besides he started playing soccer at that time	17
1	i am not much for this watch but it is exactly what i paid for i knew it was n't going to excite me becasue it 's a kids watch it 's ok for a kids watch	17
1	i am the type of person who has to have a watch on i feel lost without it therefore my watch has to be something that i can wear every day but i also wanted something that can go with a dressier outfit and this watch is wonderful i 've heard that skagen is a good brand and it 's true it 's very lightweight beautiful \( i love the little crystals at each number \) and durable great buy	17
1	price point was excellent product quality is really good shipped on time was priced 50 compared to dillard 's locally and no taxes no shipping fees	17
1	i bought this for almost 50 less than it sells in the local department store and am happy with my purchase the only trouble i have had is with the clasp it is a little tricky and you have to make sure that is catches correctly i found my watch on the floor recently because the clasp came open	17
1	it 's not the most expensive watch but it does n't have to be it 's a looker of a watch classy clean and sharp looking mesh band on the wrist \( any i have a skagen also \) is most comfortable and easy to use and sure locking terrific buy price	17
1	this watch is great looks great and feels great the hands clicking sound is almost none ! overall nice watch very happy with it	17
1	i 've purchased this watch from mid watch company as you can see it 's a fab casual watch and is worth the price the service was great and on time and i am very pleased with this purchase thank you	17
1	my son loves his new timex watch it has an elastic band that is easy for him to slip on and off he wears it every day and he is getting so much better at telling time ! if you push a button the face lights up my son enjoys using this to tell time in the dark	17
1	i bought this for my boyfriend he absolutely loves this product it holds his money in the clipper and his credit cards on the opposite side it 's beautiful silver and looks very professional	17
1	i bought this watch for my bf on v day i ordered it on 2 10 and the order was here online fast shipping and item was in good shape will do business again in the future	17
1	the fossil watch bentley gunmetal it is an excellent purchase because it is a watch of high quality and to a good price if they want to have a quality watch and that it likes the people who know they do not doubt in buying it	17
1	apart of great look and seem durability it is strange feature in such kind of dial you have chronograph but you do not have idea where it stops 23 or 26 seconds \? difficult to find out with such a dial	17
1	i really like this watch looks nice and has all the features i wanted	17
1	i received this watch from santa and boy did he do a good job i love it ! it is a very nice watch and it has handle the russle and tussle of a single mom 's life without much marks ca n't beat the price	17
1	even if you are not buy this watch i am a nurse much like many of the other reviewers in fact i bought it due to their reviews it is a fantastic watch easy to read has an illumination option and a handy date feature the only trouble i have is the size of the band \( too long \) i will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out however the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy \( it 's not \) do n't even bother looking for another watch this one is a steal	17
1	the wife has a hard time with watches and this one has made her very happy	17
1	i was a little surprised at the size and weight of this watch its almost 0 5in thick and the bezel is a full 1 5in across so the case is a bit bigger than that the mineral glass crystal seems substantial and durable but the clarity is just average in addition to having glow in the dark markings \( which do n't work too well \) on the hands and dial markers it also has an indiglo style back light \( which does work well \) the bezel only rotates counter clockwise and it seems very tight at first overall it 's a decent everyday watch	17
1	the styling on this watch is very nice the silver and the grey colors look really good the lightweight titanium is great and the size is just right now for what i do n't like about it first after purchasing online i took it to a jewelry store to have a couple of links taken out i'm out 15 for that the the clasp pin has broken twice another 20 for repair and the watch is loud when i'm driving to work or am sitting in the office and everything is quiet i can hear the ticking i do n't guess that should bother me but it does	17
1	the watch is very lightwieght and is scratch resistant so far ! i wear it at work everyday and its holding up great ! enjoy the watch and always buy from amazon	17
1	i bought this watch because i wanted something inexpensive but still professional looking i like the lightness of the watch the thin size and the simple design it does make an audible ticking sound that is louder than i would like but still not very noticeable if you have n't seen other comments about getting the watch sized pay attention i took it to a professional jewelry repair shop and they still could n't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches i would recommend having any size adjustments done by a professional jeweler who has been selling this brand of watch for a while the jeweler i went to has a good reputation but does not sell skagen	17
1	exceptional value in a classy and understated design keeps time in a superior fashion highly recommended	17
1	as other people have pointed out this is a very solid watch i really am not afraid of it breaking if it falls or anything like that however this is partly due to its enormous thickness it 's not that the diameter of the watch is surprisingly large it 's how thick it is if you have a small wrist this watch is probably not for you as it will be very noticeable it 's also not especially light obviously but it feels comfortable enough it keeps excellent time and i 've had no problems with the automatic signal searching	17
1	this is a very nice affordable watch i like not having to replace batteries and knowing that it will always be accurate people who own 1000 watches ask me about it a lot when i tell them that it is solar powered and automatically synchronizes with an atomic clock every night and that i only paid 60 for it while on sale from amazon they immediately tell me that they paid too much for their expensive inferior watches	17
1	it 's a very stylish watch and i get compliments on it all the time but the display for the functions like stopwatch alarm and date display are small and hard to see also the date is off and i have n't been able to properly set it	17
1	i bought this watch as a gift for a friend who requested this exact one he loves it personally the lights that come on and off far too frequently for no reason would be a little too much for me it is certainly the largest wrist watch i have come across but if this is what you 're looking for and knowing that it is a g shock which makes it a great watch this is the one for you	17
1	this watch does a lot in a large light case i was impressed when it set itself during the recent time change very nice	17
1	bought this beautiful necklace for my daughters b day she loves it and now other family members want me to get one for them	17
1	this is a lovely necklace but the pendant part is smaller than it looks in the picture very pretty overall	17
1	i 've seen very inconsistant reviews for silver insanity items i received this necklace for christmas last year and it 's pretty nice generally i always receive a compliment when i wear it for the price it 's worth it if you 're looking for something nicer you 're simply going to have to pay more	17
1	i own many watches including some very expensive ones such quality looks for 1 10 of the price ! this watch is classy and the quality is second to none awesome !	17
1	i bought this watch for my husband and he absolutely loves it he has received many compliments it is high quality and arrived in perfect condition it is great as an everyday watch and still nice enough to wear for dressier occasions as well almost bought the watch at a dept store but saved 25 using amazon great product !	17
1	i recieved this watch for christmas and i'm still blown away looking at it had to take it to a jewelry shop to remove a link \( my wrists are small \) because the links are difficult to do themselves but that 's probably just for emphasis on quality it came in a fossil christmas tin very well packaged i'm very satisfied and recommend it for someone looking for a nice dress watch for their collection	17
1	baeutiful watch offered at a great price delivered very quickly a	17
1	im 14 and i go to school i bought this watch because i got a nice allowence and wow the people at school thinks im rich and cool ! ! ! ! !	17
1	it 's a great watch for the price i think i paid 130 for it it runs great keeps good time and is probably one of the best watches you can get for the money high quality work very close in look feel weight to a r lex we 'll have to see how the gold plating wears over time but other than that it 's a great watch	17
1	has the effect of thousends watch i love it one of the best deals i`ve had from amazon this last years	17
1	believe it this is a stunningly beautiful watch and no one will guess the price unless you tell them it gets more attention than my gold rolex ! as for the weight it is normal for stainless which means a solid feel and you know it 's there if someone wants a flyweight watch why would they buy stainless steel \? it reliably functions exactly as described you 'll love this watch buy the 5 year extended warranty for 25 and enjoy it p s if you need to remove links just put a smoothed paperclip in a vice to push the pins out no big deal	17
1	the watch was even more attractive than it appeared i had none of the noise problems that were described in other reviews the mesh bracelet is not as comfortable as the leather bands i am used to in low light it is sometimes difficult to see \( my eyesight is good \) but basically i am very satisfied	17
1	received this watch in timely manner very pleasantlysurprised at feeling of weight solid constructionand ruggedness had about given up at getting a watchwith digital dial that was not a casio plastic watch have recently bought the soloman stainless version anda gold vestal model will let my relatives choose whichwatch suits them as a gift gene setchell	17
1	it broke the first time i tried to put it on i 's very beautiful and the others did just fine thank you sincerely gai	17
1	i read the reviews on this diamond just before christmas when it was on sale for 99 00 the diamonds are better then expected and i consider them to be a fine purchase for 99 bucks no visible flaws i am sure if i used a loop i could find some but no visible yellow on these and the clarity is fair their great for 99 00 diamonds	17
1	this one is excellent for the price good build and accurate i wish it had alert function	17
1	very handsome easy to read face and date window especially like the day date display most watches in this price range feature date only excellent value	17
1	i got this set as a party gift for a sleep over for my kids they loved it and the price was really hard to beat	17
1	the dial is big for some people but being it 's a diving watch i would expect nothing less this is a beautiful piece of machinery and i wear it everyday	17
1	i'm a pretty big guy so it does n't look out of place but this is really an extra large watch that is also quite heavy it runs well keeps good time and the movement has a very good reputation for reliability if you 're an extra large person and do n't mind a heavy watch you may be interested in this if you 're average size or smaller i would n't recommend it personally this is my weekend watch because it comes across as being pretty bullet proof in normal use	17
1	i like this watch it 's good price and also cool look \) hey guys you will not lose anythings if you have one like it	17
1	i presented it to my sister 's daughter and she loved it very much she loved cell phone watch and even box i felt very happy and i would suggest any one to buy this item	17
1	the ring is better in real life than the picture but you still get what you pay for	17
1	this pendant is really nice i bought it as a gift it is just the pendant so you do have to get a chain	17
1	they are comfy and i am able to wear them for long periods of time where with some other metals i can not the thing is i have smaller ears than some people so the stones are a little big for my ears i think but other than that they are just fine	17
1	i just recently had my ears pierced and needed something small that i could wear continually on a daily casual basis without the earrings looking too dressy these earrings are just perfect for that purpose they are simple elegance with genuine pearls and sterling silver findings they are even confortable enough to wear while sleeping i am wearing the white pearl set right now love them !	17
1	i love these ! they are such a good deal for the price and come in a nice box they are much better than what i was expecting \) colours are a nice pastel and would go with lots of different things pearls are large but not too large just right	17
1	we happened across these as a gold box item and decided they were the perfect size and color for our daughter as an easter present they came nicely packaged and are some of her favorites my wife now wants the same in different colors	17
1	all right so these earrings are absolutely adorable ! they are fun and go with anything ! good size good quality i would buy for someone as a gift	17
1	these earrings are really pretty there are not real great variations in the color between each set \( they are all pastel after all ! \) but each has a beautiful sheen and color they are also set very firmly on the backs i was worried that for the price they would n't hold up but they are very nicely made the packaging was okay but not deluxe what i appreciated was that there was a little flyer enclosed telling how to take care of pearls which i found informative all in all a good purchase and well worth the money	17
1	i am very pleased with the pretty shades of the pearls and the size was even bigger than i expected the only thing that would have them even better was bigger flat backings i have very small ear lobes so they flopped forward i remedied that by changing the backings i am wearing them with so many things and really enjoying them	17
1	as with all natural pearls the shapes are not perfect only cultured pearls are perfect because man controls them the dye is uniform and the size is perfect big enough that they can be seen easily the colors pink white gold and lavender are clear even the green is a clear green just not my favorite green	17
1	i was skeptical about this watch because of the very low price but i was very pleasantly surprised it has a quality finish and band is comfortable and works great here on the east coast it reliably synchs with the colorado time signal so it 's always accurate great watch for the money i highly recommend this yellow dial watch and its black and blue dial siblings	17
1	i purchased one of the casio men 's atomic waveceptor yellow dial watch vq200hda 9bvcf from amazon this watch is great it updates the time automatically \( just switched to daylight savings and i did n't have to touch a thing \) instructions say to position watch in a window or where it has view to the sky for updates my watch was in a drawer under a marble top and it updated just fine i saw in other reviews complaints about the plastic back this is a must to allow the auto updates again cool looking great watch ! ! ! !	17
1	it is a nice watch for the dollar spent on this item the catch is that it will work with the concept of wave ceptor and it adjusts time according to the place you are in so good watch !	17
1	i gave this necklace to my daughter who was becoming a new big sister and she just loved it the necklace was very symbolic because the big heart represented big sister and the little heart represented little sister holding on i just loved it	17
1	the quality of this piece is really surprising ! i purchased this as a gift for a 16 year old when i received it i immediately loved the styling and the chain i was very pleased to have found such an appropriate lovely gift at such a great price	17
1	i used this necklace as a matching piece to my fiance 's marquise heavy engagment ring it is a beautiful contemporary piece of jewelry it 's symmetry and simplicity are hard to find in sea of gawdy overly embellished jewelry pieces it 's a great buy and my fiance loves it	17
1	the photo of the necklace looked pretty but i did n't realize it would be so nice ! my daughter loved it and i will probably purchase one for myself	17
1	this is my first silver necklace i have had it on since i purchased it and i have received a lot of complements it is also comfortable to wear	17
1	this pendant is much prettier in person it 's got a nice polished finish not satin matte like in the image it hangs nicely on the sturdy snake chain i 've already received several compliments on it	17
1	my wife has a problem with earrings because she needs a small prong i ordered her other earrings but i had to return them because they hurt her ears these were a nice change because she can wear them without the pain plus she loves them	17

1	this is an excelllent watch and it does what it promises to be	17
1	i love this watch i 've had it for almost a year its absolutely beautiful but simple it keeps time very well for the work i do i do n't wear this watch to work so i can go sometimes a full week without wearing it the hands stop after sitting still for 24 hours but as soon as i pick it back up and give it a shake the hands spin around and sets itself its not to dressy for casual wear but it also fits perfectly with a suit and tie i highly recommend it !	17
1	i bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend and he was pleasantly surprised to say the least the human powered kinetic movement of the watch really appeals to the gadget lover in any guy and the sapphire crystal face of the watch will not scratch although i bought the black faced kinetic coutoura seiko the gold silver version of this watch is lovely also great quality gorgeous appearance reasonable price definitely consider this watch	17

1	i received a lovely pendant necklace several years ago and wear it everywhere but my long hair always tangles in the chain and trying to get the hair out usually breaks the chain i average buying about 4 new chains a year since purchasing this chain my hair is not tangled nor ripped out by the links clothing fiber does n't catch on it my pendant does not get stuck on the clasp in short this is the worlds most perfect chain ! i cannot tell you how happy i am with this purchase	17
1	this thing is a rock ! ! its heavy indeed i like that it definetelly feels when i have it on its been taking hits since last year with no scratches what soever everyone that see it loves it the picture dont do any good you have to see it and feel it in your han	17
1	the watch was shipped in a timely manner actually i receive the watch a few days sooner than the expected delivery date i purchased this product as a gift for my son when i opened the package it was everything the site said it would be and more my son and i am very pleased with the watch i do agree with a previous review stating that this watch is not for a small frame man although this is not a problem for me because my son likes the larger watches i took it to have it resized for him and it fits perfect	17
1	this is a great and stylish watch i always get compliments it is heavy sturdy and looks much more expensive than what the actual price was it looks great with any suit and looks really good with a nice blue shirt highly recommended the stainless steel is much shinnier than what the picture shows ignore the comment below you will be happy with this watch !	17
1	this is a great watch ! ! ! ! it feels heavy it 's big it looks awesome with a blue shirt and it will distinguish you in any crowd ! you can wear it as a dress watch or with a sports shirt it just looks great ! the best fossil i 've ever bough	17

1	i first came across the silver insanity line of celtic jewelry last year when i was looking for christmas presents jackpot ! i confess i spent a good hour and a half looking over their featured items both on amazon and on the silver insanity website the teardrop earrings i picked out were quite a success so much so that i recently went back and got this lovely pair of silver celtic knot earrings for myself i 've been very happy with my selection and i just went to pick out some silver starburst earrings as a wedding gift for a friend i highly recommend the items from silver insanity and plan to order from them again	17
1	i really like my earrings that i bought and they came in time	17
1	having only owned fossil watches prior to this one i must say that i was a little jaded my latest fossil bit the dust after many long good years of use i happened to find this just browsing one day and was hooked by the color and overall design i have to say i was highly impressed with what i received it is an absolutely beautiful watch	17
1	great product for the price espeacially for a starter set fear not you cant go wrong here	17
1	i bought this set for part of my fiancee 's christmas and she loves it ! the pearls are a very nice size they really are heavy and shine beautifully they are definitely worth the price	17
1	very nice size almost perfect shape beautiful luster and color great to wear with almost anything they are very chic and classy i'm very happy i bought them ! !	17
1	lovely jewelry great price but the clasp is pretty tough to work this is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers i'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert key type clasp it 's probably a great choice for very occassional use though with the quality and price it really is a regular use type of necklace i think it 's best suited for the nimble fingered traditional fashion person	17
1	i had always assumed that freshwater pearls were oddly shaped and not as attractive as their saltwater cousins this set put my assumptions to rest it is a beautiful set of pearls at a very competetive price	17
1	if you are trying to buy a decent set of pearls and do n't really have a good frame of referance these are for you my wife was a jewler and she likes pearls i bought these and got positive feedback i was nervous but when they showed they were heavy and looked great you will be ok if you go with these	17
1	cute earrings exactly what i expected to be and the shipping was super fast as well	17
1	beautiful detailed and very high quality for the price am very very pleased with the prompt shipping as well highly recomended	17
1	this watch comes in a cute box which shows what 's inside the contents are nicely spread out and the presentation is certainly appealling to the eyes of a little girl excellent product	17
1	these are beautiful earrings they are a bit small but the stones are vibrant and rich looking my only complaint is that the post part of the earring is not very substantial and i feel as though i need to handle them very carefully they are extremely comfortable and have just the right amount of movement to them	17
1	i received these earrings today and am delighted with them i read the reviews carefully so i knew the actual size of this item and the only surprise was how exquisite these little earrings are the presentation \( bag and box \) is beautiful looks like materials you would be given in a traditional jewelry store i 've posted a couple photos in customer images so you can better visualize the size and see what the earrings are housed in	17
1	paid 45 for these and worth every penny they are delicate the color is brilliant the stones are very clear i wore them to work as soon as i got them and received more than a few compliments on them they would make a wonderful gift for someone and even better for yourself	17
1	they are beautiful and delicate i just love the way they sparkle thanks amazon	17
1	i ordered a pair for myself and liked them stones are pretty clear n cute but earrings are smaller than shown in the picture	17
1	i got these earrings for my wedding in june they are beautiful and look better than pictured they arrived well ahead of the scheduled ship date and i am very happy with them	17
1	another nice inexpensive tool that makes tedious work go much faster and easier	17
1	the bracelet did n't look as i expected from looking at the picture but is very pretty i did n't realize it would be so delicate looking because there is nothing to compare it to in the image it is very nice though it is small thin the kind of thing you might wear with a dress yet seems strong the metalwork seems done well and i think it 's a bracelet that would be right for wearing someplace special	17
1	the watch is just as discribed it is heavy and large the person i bought it for had to get several links removed it would be great for a larger man	17
1	it 's a fantastic watch a little heavy and bit of work is required to adjust the band overall the nice blue background stands out quite nicely it 's on the money with keeping time too	17
1	she loves the cross i thought it was a little bigger than it was but she loved it as it was	17
1	i ordered this as a gift for my niece 's birthday and after receiving it wanted to keep it for myself ! it 's very delicate and dainty however the chain and the cross actually looked like they were very sturdy	17
1	my daughter loved it the chain needs to be 2 inches longer	17
1	i bought this for my sister for christmas i have a similar one that is bigger that i bought while in charleston sc she fell in love with mine and since driving 4 hours just to buy a necklace was out of the question i decided on this one at first when it arrived i thought it would be too small but my sister does not wear large neclaces earrings etc turns out she loved it it was just perfect for her especially since her neck is thin and her complexion is olive	17
1	the 18 description is for the necklace on it 's longest extended setting without using the extended part of the chain it is really closer to being child sized it is pretty and will end up being a gift for my daughter rather than the friend i had intended to give it to	17
1	i bought this for a 2006 christmas gift and i am very pleased i know my daughter will be too it comes in a pretty purple velvet bag a nice box with cotton and includes instructions on how to keep it nice i got it at a great discount at one of the friday sales	17
1	i am 89 years old and i love this necklace ! whoever said old ladies can not wear fashion things are nuts ! i wear this with everything from my fridayy night bingo nights to clubing in l a with lindsey and pari	17
1	i received this pair of hoop earrings as a christmas gift from my boyfriend when i first open the box i thought they were earrings for an infant the earrings are very very small however they are cute as i started wearing the earrings i began to really like them they are the smallest pair of earrings in my possession if you really like dainty jewelry i highly recommend this item	17
1	nice watch that keeps super accurate time however it is very basic showing only the time and date it would be nice if it had backlighting but the hands do glow in the dark for some period of time it is a little tricky to pick up the time signal so i would recommend finding a place in your home where the signal is strong and leave it there every night	17
1	this is so very handy you can adjust your own instead of dropping it off at a jeweler and waiting for it	17
1	i ordered these earrings a little over two months ago and i am very happy with them they are very light weight and they do not pull on your ears the size is perfect very in right now you do have to pull on the stem pretty hard to get them off because the clasp is very tight however so far so good they have not broken and the clasp has not become loose or anything i even accidentally left them in a pocket once and they were put through the washing machine they were completely fine afterward i do wish the earrings had been about 20 less expensive but overall i love my earrings	17
1	the first watch had a broken crown the date could not be changed to amazons credit they sent me a new one right away this watch is fine i needed a rubber band because i am in water a great deal of the time at workand i live near the ocean i am always in the water with my children so far the watch is great and has held up to expectations no problems except when the first one was shipped broken i would buy it again	17
1	i wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son and came upon this ring when it arrived i really was in awe of just how beautiful it is ! it is a larger more bold ring definitely more masculine this is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love it 's too bad that the ring will eventually be outgrown because my boy is only 12 hopefully i can have it resized later or find another one that is this nice	17
1	i love these earrings ! they are simple yet elegant what 's really great about them is that for a change i can wear long earrings without feeling that my ear is being pulled to the ground ! !	17
1	this pendant makes for a really nice accessory it does n't however come with a chain so plan on buying one or using an old one	17
1	just as my title states this item was purchased as a gift my friend loves the pendant but upon arrival it had a small scratch on the body of the horse	17
1	fast and easy ordering received frequent order status updates received order as expected \( fast	17
1	my fiance is a horse finatic i bought pendant as a present for her when i received it i was impressed with the detail it is lovely and shines as only silver does and i know i 'll get big time brownie points when she opens it on x mas also a great stocking stuffer	17
1	this was a great watch excellent service the order arrived on time and i love the watch	17
1	i bought this as a gift for my husband he absolutely loves it ! this is a great watch at a great price	17
1	i had an old ironman that died after 4 years this one is even better d	17
1	it is heavy duty and it is easy to read with big lettering and it will fit people with a large wrist such as mine	17
1	my boyfriend found this watch at a retail store put it on his christmas list i purchased it at amazon at a much better price this was a replacement watch for an old timex watch my boyfriend says he loves this watch no complaints at all he says the buttons are easier to push than those on his old watch he especially likes the large easy to read display	17
1	great watch bigger numbers and easier to see has all the features	17
1	excellent watch at a great price the teal color is absolutely beautiful and i love the style i have several fossil watches and no complaints they are easily adjustable water resisant and polish up nicely to look like new again	17
1	these are just darling they are tiny and perfect for my 7 year olds little ears they are shiny and nicely detailed you wo n't be disappointed	17
1	i ordered these for my 18 month old daughter and was a little nervous i had never bought earrings on line before i wanted something with the safety backs but i had expereince with some backs that screw themselves off i loved the butterflies and wanted to try them ! my daughter has had them in her ears for a few weeks now and we have n't had any problems ! i keep checking the backs and they are on nice and tight i wanted a good quality earring so she did n't have problems with infections and we havent ! i will definately order from here again	17
1	i had purchased similar earrings elsewhere but had a problem because they were n't hypoallergenic when i saw these i got them immediately have had no problems since	17
1	i think know that this watch looks and feels good it is also very reliable and tough	17
1	sometimes you realize you need a watch but do n't want to spend a fortune something that 'll last long is solid yet fashionable and easy to use this watch has it all many times girls have stopped me to see this watch it is sophisticated stylish and only 85 no matter where you go the metal stays shiny the glass virtually scratch proof days of the week military time day of month \( problem with this is it does not know if month is 30 days or 31 so u have to set it yourself sometimes but rarely and worth the effort \) i highly reccomend this watch to everyone	17
1	i bought this at a fossil store for 85 and its worth every cent it has the time day of week date and military time its waterproof up to 100 meters it has a double lock to stay on your arm it is glow in the dark it has a spinning number thing it looks good and is always shinny its only 85 bucks its perfect ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	17
1	i bought this set over a year ago and i love it they are great for trips and everyday use the silver is so good and the posts never bend what a great value	17
1	i bought this set for my wife as a valentine 's day gift she really liked them ! they are a good size and color so they give a striking impression from a distance the earrings come in little plastic ziplock bags all packed inside a not too special velvety bag if you purchase this as a gift go the extra step and get something to make a better presentation i went to wally world and bought a 3 wooden jewelry box which conveniently enough had a heart shaped decorative glass in the top it was well received	17
1	great value quality and craftsmanship back up with excellent service ! the stones are clear and brilliant thanks ! r caspers5 out of 5 stars jewelry	17
1	i actually bought these two years ago then again for my mother this past christmas we both love the sets they 're great for someone looking to start or expand their collection the colors of the stones were very nice and equally matched nice size not too small not too big	17
1	this is not the first tool i'ld add to my work bench but it has some pieces i'm glad to have i re sized my watch band in just a few minutes and only had one little incident with doing something the wrong way did i mention that the instructions are somewhat lacking \? in hind sight i should have figured it out before i made the mistake but that 's hind sight for you if your good with working with tools and you have a need to adjust a watchband at least every christmas then this is a good deal	17
1	i do n't know for whom watchebands are sized perhaps the incredible hulk in his green phase \? all i know is i'm constantly resizing my watchband based on the band the climate my activities this procedure can be somewhat difficult with some bands this complete kit does the trick a couple of minutes and a clear spot on my desk and i'm done could n't get much simpler i finally got this kit after wrestling with a new fossil band that would not cooperate used this kit and the bugger was vanquished in a trice wish i had it years ago	17
1	this is a great tool set the first day i had it we used it to take out a link from my new watch it worked great i'm glad i bought it it will be a very handytool kit	17
1	great kit for working with watches the tools were quite good quality and not flimsy and cheap the case was also good and thankfully was n't just the typical throw away plastic crap the inside of the case is firm foam that keeps the tools nicely in place the case itself is firm black leather like material and snaps closed the kit contains a hammer band holding base and several different sized pin drivers for removing band pins also includes the clamp type pin remover \( the blue thing \) a set of screwdrivers and a thin but sturdy wedge for removing watch backs all in all i'm quite pleased with the product it was just what i wanted and was n't very expensive	17
1	atomic watches are highly accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive u s atomic clock in ft collins colorado thus all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches casio makes and amazon sells a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes but all are equally accurate the casio g shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models such as this never require battery replacement atomic accurary solar power and g shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price	17
1	keeps time very well \( obviously \) no problems getting signal to sync with atomic clock chrono second time zone all other functions work well love the light function better than any indiglo i have owned only quibble is that the alarm needs to be louder	17
1	this is the best g shock i have owned it looks sleek as well as casual i had no trouble receiving the nightly signal \( i live in northern new jersey \) the solar power is an added bonus a really good deal for the money	17
1	i just received this watch and i have to say it 's very sharp looking not to mention has some weight to it this is not a flimsy watch by any means it 's all stainless steel and the clasp is the easiest i have ever had to negotiate of all the watches i have gone through over the years it 's very secure lock yet simple to unclasp i would recommend this watch to anyone also it 's dressy and casual all purpose watch	17
1	i got this for christmas and it is beautiful ! i got compliments from all of my friends the chain is very sturdy also you should buy this for yourself or anyone it 's a great gift	17

1	i got this for my mother at christmas and she loved it you ca n't help but notice the pendant when she has it on very beautiful design sleek and stylish she gets compliments everytime she wears it even though this was just an extra gift i think it turned out to be one of her favorite things	17
1	i love this pendant very shiny and substantial the back looks as good as the front i also wear this on a black leather cord \( 16 \) and it gives it a whole new look great buy	17
1	the service was prompt and the product was in great condition thanks ! r caspers5 out of 5 stars	17
1	will be given away as a gift i am pleased i hope the receiver will be i like the chain which i believe can worn separately or with another item	17
1	an absolutely beautiful medallion and for the price a no brainer ! my wife loved it	17
1	this item arrived in a timely manner extremely well packaged and exactly as advertised a	17
1	i ordered this watch for my husband he absolutely loved it ! thewatch band is designed narrower at the point where it connects with the watch my husband especially like that design because he says he can wear it for extended periods without the band pinching or rubbing his wrist i was unsure what the quality would be because of the low price however the watch was an excellent quality product tmccann f	17
1	silver insanity does it again bringing high quality unique jewellery to the masses at affordable prices this necklace is so gorgeous one has to see it up close to fully appreciate it it is so detailed even the tiny thorns are so delicate and perfectly placed this is such a beautiful piece of jewellery that no woman should be without this valentine 's day \( or anniversary or birthday \) instead of buying your woman chocolates that she does n't need or flowers that will die after a few days buy her a gorgeous unique rose that will last forever	17
1	i think the necklace is beautiful it 's exactly what i expected i really love it !	17
1	the charm is gorgeous any mother would love it from their husband or children but okay if you are buying this necklace for a mother under the age of 30 they will be okay with the length of the chain if you are buying the chain especially for a woman who is over the age of 40 they might be bothered by the short chain or if they have a large neck not saying my mother has a large neck she just has three surgery scars that the short rubbing chain bothers	17
1	i was pleasantly surprised with the high 0quality of the merchandise my mother in law loved it	17
1	its a nice necklace for your mom no matter the age im sure she 'll appreciate it i was not quite sure what to expect but i was unexpectedly surprised that it is really pretty and lustrous i guarantee that you will be pleased and your mom will love it	17
1	i bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift and had it engraved at things remembered it looks really nice and very chic with the engraving he loves it and it has come in a lot of use the only bad things are 1 the rectangular hole on one side \( the side not shown \) and 2 the shiny side will obviously get some scratches on i	17
1	these watches are just what my little boy was looking for since his identical watch broke he was so happy i not only found 1 but 6 for the price of one these are nice for a child who is just learning to tell time	17
1	they 're cool some break to easily but others dont it does not feel like you are wearing a watch and they are very small its just like i said they break easily but i would give it 4	17
1	the earrings are lovely especially given the bargain price they came in a nice box too so if you want to give them as a gift they make a nice presentation overall could n't beat this deal	17
1	great quality well made and best results with amazon thanks and five stars brav	17
1	these earrings are beautiful they are big so they look best if worn by themselves very light so they are very comfortable	17
1	my 3 year old son loves this watch you can change all of the pieces of the band to different colors and different sizes it clicks on easily and does n't come off even on a child 's arm i am very happy with this watch	17
1	if your little guy or gal is struggling with telling time and is a lego fan this is the best deal money can buy under 20 and is expandable etc probably not the most durable diver type watch you 'll ever buy but it is really good looking easy to assemble \( it 's a lego \) and all the kids think it 's neat to boot	17
1	original concept it generates imagination through the different colors and designs the child can create and is a reliable watch too ! all that for an afordable price	17
1	his wrist was too small for mens too masculine for a womans watch but way too grown up for those babyish kiddie watches this is the perfect accessory for all of your lego maniacs ! fun to re design as well	17
1	i purchased this watch for my 7 year old son it is a eye catching and because it 's lego it was an instant hit it has numbers on the face \( not roman numerals or lines \) which is important when they are beginning to tell time the price is fair the only complaint he has is that it is very difficult to put on and because the band is plastic it gets a bit sweaty all in all it 's a fun cool ! watch	17
1	the keyring is very nice i had no idea just how light titanium is the caps screw on and while the engineering and tolerances are quite tight it 's easy to see the caps coming unscrewed making the ring kinda useless definately advised to crank the caps on very tightly after putting your keys on it additinally the metal is quite plyable and i 've had to stop myself many times from bending the ring while fidgiting with my keys	17
1	i must say i was hesitant to buy after reading the reviews but they are for my two year old so i figured they really could n't be too small and they are not i also purchased other earring from some other vender for a lot more and guess what the quality of theese is soooo much better all in all yes they are tiny but very cute and do n't lack detail ! will buy again	17
1	the shape of this pendant is very flattering \( elongated draws the eye downward \) it looks great with the windows hoops i purchased at the same time the chain is nice and as with all zina sterling the silver is very polished and beautiful	17
1	i wear it almost everyday and it 's a lot of fun to change out the wrist band	17
1	i bought this watch for my 5 yr old and though it works just fine the watchband is way too big for him fortunately i am handy with a sewing machine and was able to take a pinch in the band but it makes it bulky and uncomfortable therefore he only wears it in bed so that he can play with the indiglo feature in the dark as soon as he gets up in the morning though he takes it off	17
1	i just bought this ring it is really beautiful it is a litttle bigger than i thought it would be but it fits good and was shipped quickly it was a really good buy	17
1	pretty pendant for the price the chain is very light but the pendant itself is nice and hangs well	17
1	this is the second item i have ordered from this company and i am extremely pleased with the quality and value for my money i would recommend them to anyone	17
1	these earrings are quite nice yes they do look brown up to the light but they are a definite red when backed with any type of shadow they can be worn to accent an elegant look or add style to a friday casual look they may not be heirloom quality but could last quite a long time in the modern costume jewelry category	17
1	fast and easy ordering received frequent order status updates received order as expected \( fast \) i love these earrings i have worn at least one day a week since i receive	17
1	i love puzzle rings in england it 's real difficult to find themi love the jewellery on amazo	17
1	i bought this as a present for my daughter i was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring \( if anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together check wikipedia i believe there is even a video \) i highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver symbolism and something just a little bit different	17
1	nice ring fast delivery i still need to check it out because my daughter says it does n't completely break down the way my old puzzle ring did	17
1	this watch is a delightful present amazon did a great job in delivering it on time and in excellent condition and as stated in the previous review it does look better than even on the picture ! keep up the fantastic work amazon you guys are a great realiable trustworthy source to send out gifts to loved ones in the us ordered from outside the us	17
1	this is a very nice watch the pink mother of pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft the date is a little small but the watch is so nice that i did n't even care the only complaint i have is that amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside i had to get a new battery on my own but as soon as i told amazon they credited me the 10 that was great but they should have sent me a watch in working condition otherwise the watch is highly recommended even nicer than in the photo	17
1	i like the stop watch functions that this watch has i also like the seperate dials for the different timekeeping functions unfortunately this watch is hard to read in bright light such as sunlight and well lit spaces overall though i like this watch because it looks good well it looks good on me anyway	17
1	it 's great looking the crystal positively gleams folks comment on it all the time i love this watch so much that i 've bought it twice \( lost it and simply had to replace it \)	17
1	great value looks and performes great ! ! ! ! ! ! has a lot of class and goes great with any type of apparel only down fall occurs when placing the alarm it 's kind off complex	17
1	i ordered 2 watches one for each grandaughter one arrived with dead battery had it replaced and both are working well they where well received by the granddaughter	17
1	got this today and ca n't stop looking at it it 's beautiful all who have seen it want one i cant wait to try more of their jewelry	17
1	i actually bought 2 different pair of diamond ear rings the 14k gold ones were the keepers ! they are pretty and big enough to use as a second pair in my ears ! thanks to amazon for this offering	17
1	i bought these for my wife and she really likes them they 're small enough that she can wear them day to day but they 're nice enough for formal occasions as well this is a very versatile set of earrings at a great price	17
1	i could n't belive my eyes when i saw diamond earrings with such an affordable price ! i definitely think that selecting white gold is the way to go because it wo n't distract from the mesmerizing glamour of the diamonds all my friends were wowed and shared that they will also consdier buying a pair i am so happy	17
1	these earrings are very small maybe somewhere between 3 and 4mm each they do appear white \( i do n't see any yellow tinting \) with a slight slight bit of grey which i prefer over a super white look \( as you might sometimes find in a cz \) these earrings catch the light nicely showing a bit of rainbow effect they are n't super super sparkly or faceted but they do possess shine and detail i am very happy with these earrings as they are just what i wanted something petite and real set in yellow gold and with a nice clean and believably sparkly look ! i also like the fit of the earrings backs very tight and secure	17
1	i really like it it 's an excellent watch and also a very elegant one	17
1	i bought these for my wife and she liked them very much 7mm is not as small as you may think i certainly would n't buy anything larger in this style i got them on sale for 15 00 ca n't go wrong with that price for 14k gold	17
1	i bought these earrings as a christmas gift for my wife and they look great my wife has long dark hair and the 7mm size really stands out they came in a dark blue velvet jewel ring box which comes in another dark blue box my wife really loves them so that 's a bonus for me they are a nice little something for yourself or as a gift	17

1	these earrings just arrived and for 10 \( friday sale \) you cannot beat this value luckily i bought two pair one as a gift and one for me on the off chance i liked them otherwise i thought i could hold the second pair for one of my granddaughters no way the second pair is mine	17

1	i am not the type of person that wears jewelry but when i went shoping for a watch because i needed one one brand caught my eye fossil everyone knows fossil so everyone knows that they make good watches i like this watch because of the color and because it has the day on the face it is like your everyday watch but with that bling look very cool and very james bond if you know what i mean i plan to wear this watch everywhere i go you should get this one not only because it looks cool but because of the price you know that makes up your mind for you	17
1	i bought this along with the butterfly pendant and 18 chain for a christmas gift \( 06 \) for my god daughter and she loves them both i loved the price ! the earrings are a perfect fit with the necklace she says she only wears them to church and special occasions a great gift for teenage girls	17
1	i'm very pleased with these earrings they are a good weight they are n't so heavy that they drag at the ear but they are substantial and a perfect size i 'd recommend these to earring lovers	17
1	these earrings are beautifully made look great when put on and come at a great price all these ingredients make a stunning value i am a very pleased customer	17
1	i had these on my wish list and decided to order them for myself after christmas after looking in stores and not finding anything that looked quite the same ! they just arrived and all i can say is wow ! nice look substantial size and plenty of statement picture does not do them justice all i can say is do n't hesitate you will be dissappointed if they sell out	17

1	i bought this as a christmas gift \( 06 \) for my god daughter michelle she absolutely adored it she told me she only wears it to church and special occasions i loved the price	17
1	this is a great choice for a business casual style watch with it 's crystal clear face and smooth shape it complements most business attire nicely the adjustment button does n't get pulled easily so there is less chance of accidental time loss after several weeks of wear still no scratches on the watchface and the metal remains untarnished i still get questions about it definitely an eye catcher	17
1	this watch was a very good buy for 45 looks like a nice 85 90 fossil watch the dial looks very elegant with those numbers overall i am very happy with this buy	17
1	great watch looks very similar to a movado but worth the price sharp look and perfect for any occasion	17
1	the watch i purchased was great and a lifesaver because i could n't find it in any stores and needed it as a gift for the best man at my wedding it got to me quickly and was perfect thanks	17
1	the watch itself looks preety elegant however the bracelet is a bit too rigid and it cand be very unconfortable until you get used to it i do n't regret buying it it 's worth the money	17
1	is a nice clock some people tall to me about the clock the people say is nice the clock	17
1	got this watch for my one son for christmas but ended up going to the other son since his arm is on the small size and this is a pretty good size watch it is beautiful and well described arrived in perfect condition and had no problem requesting extra links using the fossil toll free and then the local store that sells fossils put the links in for me i went with a small dress watch for the other son everyone was happy	17
1	greetings exelente product and magnifies attention from the store thanks kindly domenico pascarell	17
1	got this ring last christmas for my wife it still looks very nice and looks more expensive than it is she gets lots of compliments on it when she wears it	17
1	i am very impressed with the detail work on this ring it is really eye catching and quite lovely the shipment arrived very quickly the stone is a true emerald shade of green and the cut is nice but the clarity of the stone could be a little better however for the price it is an excellent ring and i would gladly give it as a gift	17
1	this was a gift and i was very pleased with both the quality and extremely fast shipping i will definitely purchased from this seller again	17
1	this ring is beauriful and eye catching i unfortunatey wore it in a hot tub that had too much clorine in it so the shinyness of the metal faded and despite that the ring remains beautiful	17
1	i was searching the web for weeks i saw thousands of watches and i did n't like them when i saw this watch that was it one of the most beautiful watches in the world i think design of this watch is superb very simple but astonishingly beautiful and original but there is one problem with this watch it can be purchased only in north america being from europe i had difficulties to get it	17
1	i have thoroughly enjoyed these earrings very nice size and great quality they are light weight and have a great hinge i have a baby who sometimes grabs them but they have yet to be bent out of shape i sometimes keep them in for days at a time and my sensitive ears do n't ever develope a reaction	17
1	this necklace turned out to be a fantastic gift she wears it everyday with every outfit it looks great with jeans and a t shirt and with an extravagent dress	17
1	outstanding service product was as described and the price was fair mailing in a timely manner was acceptable will continue to shop for similar items via amazon	17
1	the necklace is great it looks great and my wife loved it one of the diamonds was a little gray \( something stuck behind it \) but after having it cleaned at a jewelers it looks fantastic great price for a great item	17
1	this is a perfect anytime gift i bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it we have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top perfect for any occasion she 'll love it this will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anythingplus it 's under 100 ca n't beat the price thanks amazon	17
1	i really love these earrings and wear them quite a bit to spice up work clothes	17
1	i really like them they look elegent on me one of the most favorite parts besides the looks that i especially like is that they are the french loop kind that are easy and fast to put on and that they are heavy enough that they stay in place this reduces the risk of losing them but they are also light enough that i don t feel bogged down with them on my ears	17
1	not much else o say they look and wear awesome the price is very good as well recommend these for anyone with pierced ears	17
1	excellent quality beautifully packaged they were exactly as described and just what i was looking for	17
1	exactly the size i was looking for i knew i could do better than the baby hoop earrings looks great	17
1	these are delicate classic gold hoops that go with anything i like the fact that they are unadorned and simple and small enough to be understatated but large enough to give you an elegant look the price ca n't be beat either	17
1	i am very small featured and these are the perfect size light weight and very well made	17
1	these are beautiful small earrings just what i was looking for they 're exactly as described 11mm inside diameter i used the super saving shipping and was surprised at how quickly they arrived i'm very pleased with the entire transaction	17
1	the watch was delivered on time it came with the little box everything was in great like new condition	17
1	wonderful watch easy transaction given as a birthday present recipient loved that it came in a can	17
1	i have owned both the black monster with bracelet \( my daily work watch \) and the orange with the rubber strap \( which i sold to an envious friend \) besides all of the compliments that i have received from those who cant help but to notice the robust build of this model it has also paid dividends in durability under rough service on the job i have not been diving in many years however this is the watch that i would be most confident to wear at depth as usual seiko does not disappoint	17
1	purchased this for my niece and she loved it it 's a great price and bright and colorful	17
1	great value for the price better than expected in person quality watch for the price love this undersea face better than the other models out there was happy to find out that even though the band is kid sized it also fits adult women 's wrist highly recommend will probably buy one or 2 more	17
1	this was a gift for my 17 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it and wears all the time ! ! ! ! i am seriously thinking of getting myself one	17
1	very cute price efficiant only problem is if the band gets wet and you have sunscreen on your arm will get tinted blue	17
1	our granddaughter loves her horse necklace ! she wears it all the time and is so proud of it ! this necklace made her very happy	17
1	this is the most beautiful bracelet the piece is awesome the sentiment is so true i love this bracelet and decided to keep it even though i 'd bought it as a gift the workmanship is superb the bracelet arrived 2 days after i placed my order in a well packaged box the bracelet was in a white box with a gold ribbon around it	17
1	i bought two of these faux amber necklaces and they are quite well made the pendant is almost 2 inches in length it does look larger in the photograph but by being smaller it looks more realistic it is actually a good weight not to heavy not to light it looks as if some effort has been put into the making of it i think it is a good purchase for the price because it does not look cheap or tacky	17
1	i like the unique style of this necklace and received compliments on it when i wore it to work the price is reasonable for the type of necklace having such unique beads	17
1	these lovely little gems are perfect for those women who like me have a second or third ear piercing small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious these would make a great gift for a little girl as well i particularly liked the price point where they were being offered as i suffer from a nickel allergy and always wear gold posts in my ear having recently transitioned from yellow to white gold these were lovely additions to my collection at the price of under 10 dollars i was able to give them to a few others as a little hi there how are you	17
1	simple and elegant earrings my wife loves them however the backs are a trifle small to work with ba	17
1	i got these for 9 on the friday sale they are well made and the perfect size you absolutely will not find a better pair for the price wait for the friday sale if you can	17
1	this is a gift that has yet to be given i am confident that she will love them though	17
1	these are basic simple earrings of exceptional quality given the price you would likely pay far more for comparable items elsewhere	17
1	i am really happy with this purchase ! the earrings came together in an attractive box \( perfect as a gift but i do n't want to give them away \) they are nice and large on my earlobe and look great they are really soft to the touch and i like the colors too	17
1	i got these to give to my mother in law they are really lovely not too dressy so you can wear them everyday i'm glad i jumped on them while they were on sale they 'll be perfect for mother 's day	17
1	get this earring set i got both sets this one and the pastel set to give as gifts the pearls are lovely the colors are brilliant nice set to have or to give	17
1	this earrings were much larger than they seemed they sparkle and catch the light like prisms they made a fabulous present	17
1	i bought thes earrings \( and pendant \) for myself they are absolutely beautiful they have so much shine and sparkle to them everyone keeps asking me where i got them i'm reluctant to tell but i do	17
1	i bought these as a gift for my beautiful fiance for christmas at first she was n't overly impressed but when she put them on \( to humour me \) she found them very pretty and unusual the crystals really reflect the light and she was extremely pleased with them	17
1	i bought two pairs one as a gift for a sister in law and the other pair for myself \( otherwise i would regret it ! \) now my sister keeps complementing how beautuiful the earrings are i bought another pair as a gift for her ! the earrings are absolutely beautiful the colors that reflect in the light are truly gorgeous i recommend these for anyone that loves swarovski crystal	17
1	the necklace is lovely it arrived soon after purchase in a handsome velvet case quite a bargain	17
1	the service was prompt and the product was in great condition thanks ! r caspers5 out of 5 stars	17
1	got several silver peices but this is the one she loves ! th	17
1	i love this piece ! ! it is a beautiful quality and design it is lightweight and will look good with anything you wear	17
1	just received the necklace today and i am more than happy with it it arrived quickly and the packaging is fantastic ! it came in a little blue box and in a blue velvet bag very nicethe necklace is good quaility and has a great shine to it i might just have to order one for myself after xmas this one is a present	17
1	equal to my swiss watches fit and finish is very nice only two seconds off per day the luminessence is incredable reason not giving five starsbecause of not having saphire crystal	17
1	an excellent watch stylish accurate and takes a beating ! seiko has always had a success with this one and at 150 i paid half the retail price	17
1	the watch looks great prominent yet not overly large the orange really sets off the look the large luminescent indexes are easy to see long after dark i also like having both day and date complications and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than 300 \( way less on amazon \) is really a find you will need a pro to adjust the bracelet though as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler 's tools another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day overall i really like it it 's become my daily wear watch	17
1	the bracelet is a very bright and shiny quite nice it 's alot lighter than i was expecting i almost mistook it for plastic at first it would make a nice gift for a young teen girl	17
1	i bought three of these for friends for christmas and i have to say that i loved them and most of all they loved them they are gorgeous ! just enough sparkle without being too much i highly recommend this if you are looking for something classy and slightly understated	17
1	my granddaughter loves this bracelet i sent it as a surprise and she wore it to school the next day	17
1	i was a little worried that the bracelet would be too large for a 5 year old but i got this for my daughter 's birthday and it fits her perfectly i was also a little concerned that it might be cheap looking like other things i 've bought from amazon lately but it 's actually a very cute well made cheap bracelet	17
1	made a little girl very happy order processed shipped and delivered in a timely manner just as expected	17
1	good looking stylish smart and clean design handsome once i was specifically looking for animated watches this was one of the results although given amazon description is really lacking details i bought it and did n't really know what are the features in general and also specifically concerning the animation so now i know it has a button aside that is switching between two animation schemes one seconds numeric value rotates clockwise on the display two seconds drop down in two halfs on the display thats all for animation and features in general no light no more animations no stoppers timers nothing else just plain watch for me the good looks somewhat compensates the thing i was originally looking for	17
1	good tool it does what is it meant to do open the back of watches with ease man this is so much better than scratching watchbacks with pliers so far its been able to open all my watches with no issue	17
1	this garinin autowinder does exactly what it is supposed to do keeps both my autos running and ready for use it is quiet smooth and looks pretty good sitting atop my computer desk it has a variety of settings that will meet the needs of almost any auto watch on the market it is well built and works as described	17
1	i have had this winder for about a month now and i am very happy with it the major convenience is the well engineered slots and iserts holding watches that are of a very good quality the inserts are holding watches steadily which contributes to proper winding all previous more expensive winders with cushion type inserts were falling out \( with watches ! \) and eventually were rendered useless highly recommended unit	17
1	i have seen many other winders in the market with the same features but with much higher prices this winder is so quiet that i have no problem sleeping even with it on i highly recommend it	17
1	it exceeded my expectation it looks great and seems quite sturdy i bought for casual days when i am either skiing or just hanging out on a weekend i like it	17
1	i purchased these watches for my daughters birthday party and they were a big hit all the kids just loved them ! !	17
1	once i got the hang of it it worked like a charm i needed to mount a magnifying glass to the table so i could see for perfect alignment if not perfectly aligned you break pins now that i got the hang of it i have one pin left i keep e maling seller to buy more pins but seller wo n't answer does anyone know where to get more pins \? i would buy another unit but seller went to the bank on shipping charges	17
1	i have several fossil watches and every time i needed to adjust the band it cost me around 10 15 i found this tool and figured it was worth a try i was able to remove links from 2 of my fossil watches though my newest fossil watch band was too wide to easily fit in the tool i even used it to adjust watches for 2 of my friends it worked well made the adjustments and they were very happy with it ! they plan to buy it for themselves ! you do have to make sure the pin lines up correctly with the pin but beyond that it works like a dream	17
1	wind the pin in ever so slowly and watch if you are n't going into the hole the smallest inaccuracy can cause the pin to bend i straighted mine out and go the pin hole next try and it worked a dream also good lighting is a must	17
1	use care when you use it as it can be easy to break pins but it works just like it should and it 's easier and cheaper than going to a watch store	17
1	small illustrated manual makes it easy to figure out how to use with a steady hand and some patience i was able to re size a couple of my watches it was really handy	17
1	i got this yesterday from my boyfriend and i love it it 's very pretty and i was extremely happy to unwrap it	17
1	i was expecting this watch to be a little more chunky than it is it is a little smaller than i pictured but it is a nice non flashy watch i have n't received any compliments on it after wearing it for a few weeks so if you are looking for a subtle but cute watch this is for you but if you want a watch that makes a statment and that people will notice i 'd look elsewhere	17
1	i love the jewel jet because it is exactly what my jeweler uses except now i can clean my diamond at home when i want it is easy to use just follow the directions	17
1	this is a great product if you have lots of jewelry this cleans everything perfectly no more harsh chemicals very fast and sufficient certainly worth the money	17
1	the steamer works very very well sure beats paying for or even just the hassle of taking your stuff to the jeweler and wondering if you got back what you took in great gadget	17
1	these are very comfortable earrings i even sleep in them the hoops go with everything and i very seldom wear other earrings now	17
1	these earrings are a good size but still very light it is a little tricky to learn how to fasten them but once hooked they stay safely closed all day the clasp sytem does not show once the earrings are on so this is a very clean and classic look i have long hair and the clasp does not tangle in my hair	17
1	i loved the earrings but unfortunatly one of them was faulty and had to send it back the package was lost in the transition but amazon gave me a full refund and was very helpful the earrings were beautiful and of good quality	17
1	a quality earring good size and very bright the are also very secure	17
1	i got this as agift in she likesd it very much	17
1	i had no trouble with and delay and the pendant looks great which was a gift for my sister and she loved it	17
1	this is a very nice piece i 've been looking for a key pendant for a while now but all the ones i 've seen have been very feminine and this one while slightly satanic fits nicely to the meaning i wanted without making me feel like a fairy princess shipping even got here early ! my only problem with it is having to pull out the pliers to get it to fit on a different neck piece from the same seller 4 5	17
1	i came in a timely manner and was exactly what i expected the person that received it loved it	17
1	i bought this to save for a christmas gift it is a very nice looking piece of jewelry	17
1	as other reviewers have stated this watch is large and it 's heavy i think it would look best on a larger person with big wrists or arms the night light is cool and effective	17
1	perfect watch just as i expected lokks great both casual and semi formal	17
1	happy with the purchase the watch was what i expected casual enough to wear to work or for a night ou on the town	17
1	i wanted a basic watch that would be for everyday use and liked this timex design i was very pleased that it looked even nicer in person clear face leather band with slightly heavier stitching than some good weight \( not too heavy \) i have received a few compliments at work co workers were surprised at the value for the cost overall a solid timex offering that you will enjoy if you 're drawn to the style image that appears here in the product details	17
1	i really love this watch it looks so nice and elegant shipping is supper fast only 2 days ! great deal many thanks	17
1	i 've had this watch for about nine months now i wear it every day it keeps great time and looks great as well many people have complimented me on the design of this watch and asked me who made it the mesh band is the most comfortable and lightest band you will ever wear	17
1	love the earrings i have small earlobes and use these earrings in my second holes they are just perfect	17
1	the pliers do the job seem to be well made my only problem was the awkwardness in trying to align the link i guess if you remove the band from the watch it would make it easier in that case i recommend one of the pin removers that sit flat on a horizontal surface but this did do the job \( even leaving the band on the watch \) it comes with a smaller sized push pin that is a breeze to swap out	17
1	this item far exceeds what i thought it would be i am very please	17
1	i first purchased this watch in 1994 when i entered the selection coarse to be an air force cct i lost the watch years later but i would occasionally try to find a replacement with no luck i now work for us doj and will be deployed to baghdad for a while and i need a watch i will be able to absolutely depend on in extreme conditions this is the only watch i will ever own i cannot say enough about it maybe i'm sentimental but i love this watch	17
1	i was so happy in receiving the watch so fast they do good business	17
1	my husband bought this for the 2nd time after losing the first it is nice for dressy or casual highly recommended	17
1	overall the watch is awesome i do actually use it when diving though it is only rated as water resistant and not waterproof i can say it holds up to at least 90 feet the dial is very readable at depth the digital display however is not the multifunction display has no backlight and at times can be hard to make out even on land the display does have luminescent hands and numbers that can be make out with no problem very comfortable and functional	17
1	after nearly two months my two automatic watches are ticking happily away the mechanism is very quiet and the winder looks tidy the only critisism i have is lack of instructions to mount the watches maybe all winders work the same way but this was my first experience with wone and it took a while to work out the watch mounts are spring loaded to accept teh watch band once i sorted that out no problem	17
1	the product as i recalled cost about 36 for a double winder the product works quite well and is reasonably quiet if one reads one of the watch magazines on the market one will quickly find out there are many watch winders out there and most cost a lot of money in the hundreds to thousands of dollars this product is in the tens of dollars and works very well i am very happy with the product as well as amazon \( dot \) com	17
1	owned a different brand that was noisy and only worked for about a month this winder i can not hear it run and have had it a couple of months it is still running like clock work would recommend to anyone that doesnt want to pay an arm and leg for one	17
1	i recently received the item and i love it it is whisper quiet works in both directions and is automatic i have seen other winders at 5x this price that do n't do the same any of the winder would be a waste of money unless they sell a single winde	17
1	could not have gotten a better deal it has been working for the last 2 months very quite i leave it in the bedroom ca n't beat the price recommended for those automatic watch lovers you can buy 4 of these for the price of an others model	17
1	the pendant was a little smaller than i expected but lovely nonetheless	17
1	although glass they do look like opals and have a lovely irridescent qualit	17
1	this is the second pair of earrings i got from silver insanity and i can tell you you wo n't be dissapointed they may be synthetic but no one will ever guess while you 're wearing them ! they catch the light beautifully and the delicate silver design compliments the gems perfectly i always get compliments when i wear these and you ca n't beat the price	17
1	fossil watches are beautiful and have a lot of style many people have pointed out at how different and nice my watch is it looks great with almost all of my casual clothes this is a beautiful high quality not so expensive watch	17
1	i bought this for my wife as christmas present she loves it	17
1	i bought one for my girl friend and she is very satisfied with it it is really beautiful	17
1	this is a must have watch for serious runners i have had mine for over a month and i love mine i am a professional track and field athlete and i train very hard to win races this watch helps me train better than any other watch i 've ever had it gives you up to 50 lap splits which are great for any workout that is over 800 meters on a track not only that but it has 5 interval timers which you can set your appropriate rest time on if you are a serious runner like myself i highly suggest you get this watch it is definately something that you will need	17
1	i bought these earrings for my stepmother in seattle so i never actually saw them now she is a refined person with classy taste so you ca n't just get her any piece of junk she said they were perfect and she loved them that 's a great recommendation !	17
1	i have longed for gold hoop earrings for years these seemed liked they were the ones ! but i waited a while still debating finally 'went for it' and got a pair i have n't regretted it at all i find these earrings comfortable and i like the way they look on me i am very happy with these and recommend these beauties ! now if they would make them in white gold	17
1	nice watch for the price case is a little bigger than some but a nice watch with easy to read face	17
1	zina makes wonderful jewelry and that is why i am frustrated that they use such a cheap chain for this pendant the pendant itself is beautiful and the silver shines but the garnet is very small it is a nice red color though i purchased this on sale and that is why it gets four stars and not three	17
1	i like guess watches spicily gold candy rock and white gold one is look like really gold	17
1	if you want a subtle piece of jewelry that will get attention this is it ! i have gotten more compliments and questions from strangers when i wear these \( earrings and pendant \) than i have from all the swarovski jewelry i have created and worn this is a very different color than i have ever worked with it appears as if two sides only are 2x ab and the other two are n't quite unusual which makes it fun	17
1	it was even more beautiful than what was shown in the display picture my friend absolutely loved it	17
1	absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry i bought it for a young man as a birthday gift and he has worn it every day since ! unique and eye catching	17
1	i bought two of these \( one for each daughter 3 6 \) it is very hard to find sterling chains in the length needed for children thank you	17
1	this necklace is just as advertised i like it a lot i was looking for an almost choker necklace i would really like a wider one but this one will do	17
1	its beautiful but the heart look large in the picture but in realty it 's small but i think it 's better	17
1	i got this watch to help me with running walking and yoga it was a little difficult to figure out all of the set up but i am thrilled with the end result i recommend this product to any woman looking for a watch to use for multiple workout programs	17
1	thanks for the prompt delivery great packaging a beautiful watch sleek and chic perfect size for everyday wear and more active wear great features easy to use	17
1	great features on this watch i especially like the linked timers and the three alarms my wrist is tiny and the selection of holes is great \( i use the tightest \) this does leave a gap because the band is still bigger than my wrist and the extra band wraps all the way around but it does n't slip and it feels very comfortable the alarm sound is pleasant the color is great too	17
1	this pair of earrings is a great deal for the money you ca n't go wrong with a price like this	17
1	its tough to beat the price of these 1 2 ct diamonds for 199 they looked really good and the wife loved them the only reason i gave 4 stars is because they only have non screw backs and they did n't come with a diamond spec sheet to verify what you got but for the price a minor quibble you wo n't be disappointed with your purchase	17
1	these are beautiful at a total 50 carat for the pair each 25 carat stud is well matched for color and clarity if you like white gold and diamonds you wo n't be disappointed	17
1	the watch is super thin you barely know you are wearing it in two weeks i have had over 10 compliments	17
1	this is my third skagen watch the design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light the design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear they have proven to be reliable timekeepers and i liked this one so much i bought two more for my sons at less than 80 00 each they are a real bargin	17
1	i 've had two skagen watches and have to say they are my favorite i love the large face and the titanium bracelet \( you do n't have to remove the watch in order to shower ! \) a lot of people have complimented me on the watch too given the price and quality you ca n't go wrong if you ever need a part replaced you just send it to skagen the work is completed in a couple of weeks ! in summary an elegant watch at a reasonable price	17
1	everyone loves this watch i wear it for work and it 's sleek enough to look sharp women constantly compliment me on how it looks	17
1	my roommate got this for his girlfriend and after examining his girlfriend 's ears i have decided that these earrings are great for the price not something you want to give your wife but an excellent gift for a young boyfriend trying to impress his young \( or old \) girlfriend with an entry level nice gift they are a decent size and no faults are noticeable at a normal distance recommended	17
1	the stones are a beautiful color and they 're very pretty earrings packaged in a nice box i recommend these	17
1	i bought this pair to wear in my second ear piercing with a larger set of peridots in my first but i would also wear these alone the pair i received are a lovely color very recommended	17
1	i bought one as a gift it looks great on him but it ran out of battery after half a year and my friend need get it fixed this should not happend for a new watch as the watch was already started when i received it there was a possibility that it was n't brand new when i bought them other than that it is a good buy	17
1	because i teach i wear a man 's watch so i can keep my eye on the clock without seeming to look at my watch all the time this beauty has a very easy to read dial and it looks very cool and retro i 've gotten many compliments i should probably have the bracelet made smaller it 's one of the bigger sized men 's watches i 've ever worn so i think it would be a great choice for big guys i am quite pleased with my purchase the price was nice too	17
1	i 've found that i receive quite a few compliments whenever i wear this necklace great color combo not too heavy the price is right	17
1	this watch is generally a good watch but there are some flaws in ours not a surprise considering the price one there is a white haze under the crystal when viewed in the sunlight perhaps the result of careless manufacturing and cleaning two my son has had the band come apart twice in one month the later probably a design issue relative to all the spring loaded retainers and such and the general range of movement of the clasp	17
1	this watch looks great although i was afraid that it was going to be bulky it has worked great for my husband the only problem we have had with it is setting the date on it no matter what time of day we set the date it is always the wrong date by the next day	17
1	this watch looks like business the movement is what i really like you get about 5 ticks per second instead of 1 so it looks more sweeping \( though i would n't call it sweeping \) i give it a 5 based on looks and cost i have n't had it long and it took a couple days of wearing it for it to keep time correctly \( it was losing a few hours at night \) i guess it just needed to get charged up it 's no rolex but it 's no casio either	17
1	the watch arrived in great condition it is a very stylish and affordable watch the only thing is that it is a tad too big and my boyfriends had to take some links out he has a big wrist so it was a little unusual nice watch though ! no regrets	17
1	pleased with this purchase surprised how nice the watch actually looks	17
1	this ring is just about what i expected it 's fun and puzzling and it looks nice i figured it out after about 20 minutes of messing with it \( i 've always been good with puzzles so it might take someone else longer \)	17
1	this ring is absolutely gorgeous and i havent taken it off since recieving it but when buying this ring be careful not to take the string off of the bands this string protects you from well insanity i unfortunately took off the string and my ring separated into the 4 separate bands luckily i found a website that gave me instructions on how to reassemble it my dad put it back together and it was fine but i have to admit i'm a little distraut about how there is no indication or warning telling people not to take it off if this does happen to you google puzzle ring solutions and there are many websites to guide you in restoring your ring to normal	17
1	i love this ring ! it 's interesting to look at and i like the design i have n't taken the string off for fear of not being able to figure out the puzzle maybe one day i might try it but i like it so much i do n't want to chance it now shipped fast	17
1	this is a fun item to own i spent 2 days trying to get it solid again and had to look up the solutionon the internet i think a solution should be included with the item	17
1	i loved the wiccan protection knot pendant i purchased it for my daughter for christmas and she has n't taked it off since she had wanted a celtic tricetta necklace but absolutely adored this one just as much thank you	17
1	i was very pleased when i recieved this i love that it does n't look like every single other pendant on the market and although it looks like it in the picture it 's not enormously huge just the right size and very pretty	17
1	i have been looking for a bracelet for what seems to be years never found the right style size design combination to fit until now this bracelet looks great on the wrist it is well constructed and very comfortable to wear with no pinching i'm giving it the full 5 stars without any hesitation	17
1	this bracelet looks better than the picture it looks beautiful on my wrist the fifty bucks that i paid for it was a real bargain i love it there 's only one drawback it 's 8 inches long and that 's too long for my wrist if it fit perfectly i 'd give it ten stars i 'll pay to make it smaller it 's made of titanium and maybe it 's too tough to alter i want it to fit over that knot on my wrist if i can get it altered i 'll wear it until the day i die which i hope will be 100 years from now	17
1	i got this bracelet for my boyfriend initially i was looking at two different designs but i'm really interested with this one i made up my mind to buy this bracelet when i received it i'm vary satisfied with it it 's really nice and the good thing is my boyfriend really like it it 's a worth buy	17
1	as a gift this bracelet will not disappoint it appears just \( or better \) as it does in the picture the only downside is that for a gentlemen with a thicker bone structure there will not be any give nor do they provide extra links to make it a bit more comfortable otherwise one cannot go wrong with selecting it	17
1	i always wanted a titanium braclet and i found this on of all places amazon com i thought why not \? i was very surprised when i got it this bracelet looks better in person ! very high quality the pic dont do it justice its a elegant design very contemporary and classy it does not look gawdy or bling bling tacky treat yourself and pick this one up	17
1	it is like a rolex daytona a very nice watch but with some difficulty to read because of it dial color	17
1	beautiful watch ! ! i was already familiar with invicta and know that they 're worth three times the price and that in the future they will be had it in just a few days do n't let the picture fool you it does not do this piece justice and you would be better off going to another site to view what this watch actually looks like looks like it cost a whole lot more i 've been watching invicta 's for about a year now and if you find a better price than this it 's stolen ! ! !	17
1	this color was on a price special and i liked the look in the picture so i chose this model i found that the silver on silver makes it a bit more difficult to read than i would have liked but it 's adequate good accurate movement as the other invicta timepieces i 've owned or known of have also been this one is quite heavy and has a feel of a more pricey timepiece mine is running about 3 seconds slow per week which does n't seem bad but former invictas i 've had were a bit better than this update to prior review now that the watch has limbered up the accuracy has improved and i 've hardly needed to touch it	17
1	i had one exactly like this one for over 20 years but finally the crown fell off i am keeping it for a backup as it is still running just fine i expect the same quality of my new seiko i highly recommend this model easy to read dial \( especially the white face \) and also a fine looking piece of jewelry	17
1	extremely reliable easy to read looks like the rolex style only it is very lightweight good for everyday use because you can wear either gold or silver jewelry with this watch i would have given it 5 stars if it were one of those models which does not need a battery	17
1	this item was very nice the chain was longer than i expected and hangs really low on my neck but it only looks like the real one you can tell that it is a knock off but you get what you pay for for 5 i think that it was worth it but it does look different than the real one good service and delivery	17
1	this was a gift for my brother and he really enjoyed it it was shipped quickly which is always a plus	17
1	this invicta is a really nice watch but with some problems all metal surfaces are polished on this watch so they scratch very easily and quickly and the clock face is a bit too shiny in my opinion \( hard to read in direct light \) also who needs a 24h dial on a chronograph \( instead of a 1 10s dial \) \? but overall for this price a good deal and good looking	17
1	this watch is very attractive and keeps great time it seems to be very high quality and i like all the engraving	17
1	this watch is attractive fairly heavy and well made \( esp for the price \) one small complaint is that the glow in the dark hands barely show up 4 1 2 stars	17
1	seller was delivering immediately the watch itself is sporty but elegant suited for active men	17
1	this is a beautiful piece of solid silver jewelry well constructed and spins without burrs or sticking points it is very pretty and a wonderful addition to my wardrobe a lovely pendant that i will treasure always	17
1	it was a gift and i was pleased with the good quality and workmanship	17
1	great color and very well made while small for a primary pierce in the lobe they are the perfect size for my second pierce this company also makes beautiful 1 2 hoop earrings set with amethyst that i'm very happy with	17
1	the earrings arrived in a jewelery box so they would make a nice gift the earrings seem to be well made the post has a notch to prevent loss of the back the ameythyst stone is so pretty i 've gotten a number of compliments on these earrings	17
1	the watch arrived promptly and was exactly what i expected a very nice everyday watch for a good price	17
1	i have been wearing this watch for last 6 months no complaints loved the adjust o matic bracelet great buy	17
1	i bought 2 necklaces for each daughter for christmas the girls wear them all the time they are very pretty and love opening up the lockets to look at the pictures we put them	17
1	the bracelets were as advertised shipping was reasonably prompt the only thing that i am slightly worried about is whether the elastic band which holds the pearls is strong enough to last for some time these were not intended for me i bought them as a gift for my mother and i can only comment on its longevity only after she 's used them for some time	17
1	obviously the pearls are flawed but because of their size you ca n't tell even from a short distance away they 're super cute but i suggest getting them 2 or 3 at a time as they look a bit awkward on their own	17
1	i ordered one each for my 5 year old daughter and her 2 friends for valentine 's day nice pearl color and oval like shapes slightly too big for a 5 year old but would be good for older children or a small wristed adult very dainty a great buy for the price	17
1	i will buy more items from you guys i got them quikl	17
1	i bought these pearls for my granddaughter when she was born in june i bought my 2 year old granddaughter pearls and wanted my 2nd one to have pearls too the pearls i purchased were exactly what i wanted	17
1	i have n't worn pierced earrings in years i thought they were sealed when i discovered that they were indeed open i sought some simple gold post types to wear when i saw my march birthstone set in a simple gold setting i could n't resist it the actual earring is so elegant ! 'tis exactly as described and more ! wearing such graceful simplicity in my beauty starved lobes makes me feel like royalty ! and for such a small price with the security of amazon ! what a joy ! sincerely miss agnes crosb	17
1	inexpensive aquamarine is usually a washed out blue color not these babies ! you 'll fool your friends into thinking you 've spent double	17
1	this watch is definitely something that i will keep with me for a while it is simple elegant and came to me for relatively cheap the free shipping is always a bonus and i also came across it in the gold box deals and when i saw it i knew i had to have it it is pink and is lighter pink in the center the bracelet was large with the extra links so i removed them and took it to the store to make it smaller i think its a great watch for both casual and more formal settings	17
1	great watch bought through amzon usa 10 days from order to receipt with shipping tracking along the way if you get nervous aussie price au 890 amazon price au 510 do yourself a deal buy wht you ca n't afford in aussie through amazon	17
1	watch is the best on the market i've had it a month now and love it the compliments keep coming in and amazon's price was the lowest i could find anywhere both on the net and at the discount stores if you want to cath the ladies eyes this is the watch for you	17
1	my husband loves this watch he was so excited that it looks even better in person than the picture as soon as he shook it the watch did exactly what it was suppose to and set itself to the right time date and month he 's absolutely thrilled with it and i was thrilled with the price from this company thanks all around	17
1	this watch is beautiful the picture do n't make any justice the quality from amazon is flawless highly recommended	17
1	i have enjoyed the oregon series watch it is good looking the band is comfortable and is holding up nicely the display is easy to read and the light is quite good my one complaint is that the chronograph is often difficult to clear i run a good bit and i was doing a workout the other day i had to keep holding down the clear button to get the old time off other than that i have enjoyed the watch immensely i thought the price was extremely reasonable as well	17
1	everything was ok i actually recommend	17
1	it 's got an alarm stop watch timer lap timer 5 alarms actually a water break alarm water resistant although do n't go aggressive swimming with it because water leaked inside mine and when it gets hot outside water vapor rises to the glass dial and it blurs out the time but other than that it 's a great watch finest i 've owned in terms of digital watch i highly recommend it	17
1	i bought this watch for my son a marine serving in iraq because he requested a sturdy digital with an alarm this one had a large face which he says is extremely easy to read in any light especially at night it is comfortable and sits close to the wrist with very little profile he loves it and asked me to order a second one because he wants a back up !	17
1	if you are looking for an inexpensive yet reliable accurate stylish analog \( rather than digital \) timepiece this is the watch for you easy to set up comfortable to wear no backlight so hard to read in low light a good buy	17
1	i like this watch as it was pretty cheap and it keeps good time right with wwv time clock for the last couple of months since i got it i am extremely hard on watches the crystal is not hard so it is scratched already the time is very accurate with the colorado wwv time station for 30 bucks or so except for the scratched face is the only issue worth the mone	17
1	this was a pleasant surprise for the money and the craftsmanship is quite good only criticism is the adjustment of the band is a bit tedious it is certainly worth while and a durable product i would certainly buy this product again	17
1	i am completely satisfied with this product correct time is kept and it has been a great watch i have had many atomic wrist watches and this is the best one ever	17
1	this watch is totally accurate and with glow in the dark hands and numerals and an oversized date window it is the perfect watch it makes it a pleasure to look at my wrist	17
1	my last ironman lasted 12 years of very hard usage in the restaurant business lots of heat grease and water ! my new timex combo dual tech watch has all the same features especially the timers which i can set at different intervals you ca n't beat the price for this rugged but sleak looking watch a plus it has both digital time and good old watch hands	17
1	this watch met all my requirements and it well suited for my hand i liked the feature of turning the digital display on off the strap is also smooth doest hurt ur skin the only negative remark i found with this watch is the indiglo night light is not that bright as i expected or was not equivalent to my previous watch	17
1	i 've had the watch for about 3 weeks and i really like it better than i expected	17
1	this watch is great it has full iron man functionality and actually looks nicer than a geeky casio unlike prior iron man watches i probably should have gone with the steel band as it could be worn out as well it has solid construction and easy functionality the indiglo could be a little brighter but i am sure that would cost battery life	17
1	the quality of the product is great and was just as advertised the delivery time was excellent as it was promised for a week delivery but arrived the next day ! great company to do business with	17
1	my daughter loves this earring 'tree' it looks great and is very practical as it holds multiple earrings	17
1	this is a big watch for the price ! \( 44mm i believe \) you have to buy a vintage dive watch to find one this large i agree with the other reviewer about the strap i lost a casio just like this before the beach i now have a waterborne dive strap on my new one a one directional bezel a screw down crown would be nice on future models also be ready to be asked what time is it \? a lot when you wear it to the beach \)	17
1	this model has been out for a long time i like the look of the black more then the white or gold the reason the watch loses one star is because the band it looks great but the rubber will wear out and break in about a year the replacement band that casio offers looks close the orginal but not exactly the same i lost one of these and another was stolen so the fact that i am on my third is a statement to how much i love this watch i have been wearing it since about 1993	17
1	when i received this item i could not believe how beautiful it was the price was insane for the quality and workmanship i will order more for my sisters	17
1	i bought this necklace for my 5 year old granddaughter the piece is beautiful and has some weight to it its very well made and no one would guess the price i paid more than worth the price	17
1	these are so pretty i 'd like to have a whole box of them just to look at originally coolstyles mis shipped my order but acted quickly to make sure that i got my shipment by christmas i was very pleased with that	17
1	these earrings are very pretty not too big not too small just right for the price you ca n't go wrong the gift box they arrived in was sort of cheesy but they were for me so i did n't mind if i were giving them as a gift i 'd put them in a prettier box before giving them to the recipient overall very pretty earrings good value no complaints	17
1	i bought these and made a set with a necklace for my girl they look gorgeous on her really really worth the effort and unique i highly recommend this seller the reward i got for the gift well let 's just say i'm buying stuff from them in the future for sure !	17
1	the earrings are gorgeous kind of a hematite color but they look darker nearly black against fair skin beautiful ! and this company ! the earrings went on sale after i ordered \( and paid for \) them and they automatically credited my card account for the difference wow ! i am very happy with this purchase and will definitely buy from securehoop again	17
1	i got this because it was a simple design but still looked good without costing too much my only complaint is that my wrists are super small and i had to get links removed but that was no big deal i only wear it when i need to dress up so it 's still in good shape	17
1	these small earrings are great ! i can sleep in them and because they are platinum i do not have any allergic reaction to the metal ! i'm so glad i found them	17
1	i received these earrings as a christmas gift from my sister they are perfect their size is about the circumference of a dime platinum adds elegance and yet they are perfect for simple everyday wear you know they will never tarnish nor will they irritate your ears they are also perfect for young lady 's first introduction to platinum jewelry	17
1	this is a really nice little pendant necklace the stones are not too small not too big the pendant is about 1 long the bail is large enough to accommodate a nice chain \( it comes with an 18 fine chain but you might want to replace it with something a bit more substantial \) for the price i was expecting something a lot cheaper looking i was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this	17
1	i had a previous expedition watch that lasted many years and served me well i purchased this new version and so far have n't been disappointed if you 're looking for a basic watch that tells time and has a backlight i do n't think you can go wrong for the money	17
1	i purchased this item to show my work to potential buyers i found that it is effective to show many of my pieces and the materials used to make this folder is exceptional very professional looking and easy to carry around if you have a ton of items then they tend to get tangled but i do n't believe it is intended for that purpose	17
1	i gave this watch to my fiance as a gift and she loved it ca n't lose with this one	17
1	love my new watch ! it is very thin and comfortable i get compliments every time i wear it	17
1	beautiful clean simple lightweight lovely watch great price and look perfect size and really durable got it for christmas and have n't taken it off since	17
1	i love this watch ! it matches everything ! ! and i love the little diamonds that mark the numbers that circle the watch ! ! so nice	17
1	the item ordered was shipped promptly and was exactly as described no problems whatsoever	17
1	this is a beautiful classic piece my husband got mucho brownie points for this one a good choice for anyone you want to show your love to	17
1	the pendant is gorgeous and feels substantial quick delivery and the product was delivered as promised the chain is a little long \( for me \) so the pendant hangs at about breastbone level but it 's so lovely i have n't bothered to find a new chain	17
1	i love this watch it was my christmas present to myself the ribbons are easy to interchange and i wear them with the silver bracelet as well it comes in a cute and durable box that i now use to store all of my watches a perfect gift and good quality i especially like the little heart on the minute sweep	17
1	this is the first time i settled for byzantine style of jewelry but i like it it is a big and shining bracelet that perfectly matches with dark or black clothes it would make an excellent gift for a man especially if the guy is not skinny	17
1	i went onto ebay and found the same product for slightly less but the shipping was outrageous ! great product clockwise or counter clockwise rotation i have it in my office on the back of my desk and i can barely hear it working if i pay attention to it nice design and looks good	17
1	i purchased this watch winder as part of my husband 's christmas gifts this year to pair with his new tag heuer carrera i compared this winder to many others out there in all price ranges and this one is actually the same winder many luxury stores \( ie neiman marcus \) carry sans branding it 's very quiet and the interval winding keeps his watches running without risking over winding you can save a lot of money by forgoing the leather wrapping or wood veneer packaging on the more expensive winders and just get this one	17
1	this dual watch winder is awesome not only is it ultra stylish but it works great although i have expensive tastes when it comes to watches i cannot justify paying more than 100 for a watch winder that no one will ever see this dual watch winder works great with my tag heuer link and my movado it 's truly a great buy no reason to spend more money	17
1	i purchased this with a gift certificate for myself for the price you can not complain too much this necklace is a nice addition to my jewlery box i suppose the more expensive ones may sparkle a bit more but this is a nice piece	17
1	i purchased this necklace as a christmas gift for my sister the pendant is very nice indeed but the chain is poor quality and seems like it will break easily with a replacement chain the necklace turned out very beautiful though	17
1	i love the watch expecially with the black white color looks the casio of the old with a modern twist the watch is very basic in design a dual digital fully funtional chronograpgh watch one other thing it is very easy to set the only problem is it is not back lit so the digital part of the watch is useless at night \( if incase you happen to be doing something in the dark at night \) this is the only disappointing fact about the wrist watch you might think a watch that cost 60 will have a self supplied light but it does not sad shame on casio apart from that i love the watch	17
1	i have bought this watch for him every 6 years he has owned three so far after replacing the battery it is not as water resistant also the band has broken on two out of the three of the watches i gave it 4 stars because of the degradable band no other watch has movable bezel analog and digital time with an alarm for under 100 00	17
1	my wife brought me this watch as a christmas gift i could not be more pleased nice big face and rugged decent quality i may just get the gold or black version next	17
1	this is a nice watch and give accurate time i gave only 4 stars because it took me a hard time to pull the crown to adjust the time	17
1	lightweight great price self adjustable this was the perfect gold toned watch for me ! i shopped around and amazon had the best price for this watch	17
1	it 's a beautiful simple elegant watch been eyeing it for a year never have seen it at such a fantastic price job well done	17
1	your service products and suppliers are the best ! ! excellent service excellent products and peace of mind when ordering thank you amazon you 're the best !	17
1	this is a great looking watch it is handsome and elegant the face is large and easily viewed the style is easily those you see in 1000 watches but obviously does not have the engineering of the more upscale models a real bargain for such a handsome watch	17
1	i am very pleased with this product and have had numerous positive comments about how sharp the timepiece looks the dial is much larger than most watches but i have big wrists so it was perfect the size also gives an updated look the only negative comment i have is that the watch is pretty thick and binds on shirt cuffs but that is a minimal problem great reproduction watch	17
1	this pendant is small about the size of a dime and very light it is one sided the opposite side is hollow it appears exactly as shown the chain it comes with is 18 which is pretty standard and has a circular clasp with the knob you have to pull on	17
1	shpping items like these to an african country will always be scary but it arrived in very good condition nothing was damaged and the chain and little black pouch was well picked it was a surprise pendant for my girlfriend she expected just one item but this moon was well priced so i bought it with another pendant you are lucky to get such beautifully crafted art at this price it is strong so no need to worry about breakage during shiping i like it and wish i could keep it but it was a gift	17
1	i was surprised at the quality the bracelet and necklace matched perfectly it was a great gift for my 23 year old daughter she loved them	17
1	my wife was surely surprised when she rec 'd this gift now that she is in a retail lsdies shop to dress up and add pearls looks fantastic thanks well worth the price	17
1	very beautiful pearls there are visible blemishes which makes them appropriate to wear at work without me feeling overdressed the uniformity is very good all pearls are more or less same size beautiful clasps too however i have to agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to handle without help especially the bracelet took me about 10 minutes to put it on my wrist the color is slightly yellowish the shape is good kinda semiround rather than potato they 'll make great gifts	17
1	the set is absolutely gorgeous in person and i'm sure that it will only get better over time as the pearls gain in luster the clasp is also very beautiful with an intricate design and it 's incredibly secure when fastened however it 's difficult to maneuver and i ca n't imagine ever being able to put the necklace on or get it off without assistance that 's the only reason i would n't give this five stars the quality and the value of this set are otherwise great	17
1	my husband loved it great watch for a great price does everything he wanted	17
1	i needed a basic watch for time and running and this fits both well	17
1	i purchased this watch expecting an inexpesive one which i got but i recieved more than that it was cheap in price but definately not cheap in quality my watch has held up to drenching rains and with stood the water resistant up to 50 00 meters label with ease very comfortable easy to reset and has all the bells and whistles i love it ! !	17
1	i love this item ! i bought one for each of my bridesmaids as their gift from me these jewelry rolls are beautiful and appear to be very useful in holding jewelry there 's even a place to hold your rings \)	17
1	i ordered for my grand daughters xmas present and she loves them mission accomplished ! ! !	17
1	i have recently bought this pair of earing and the matching bracelet for my son 's care giver when it arrived my sisters and i were tempted to keep them for ourselves they were lovely i particularly like the make and the feel of the bracelet they are what i would term fun pieces but not in the least suggesting that they are for younger persons only i am in my 40s and would enjoy wearing these pieces it was a good buy at the sale price oddly enough i also liked the packaging the items came in a regular protective brown cardboard box that protected the little gift boxes on the inside	17
1	i was very pleased with the service of this seller the earrings came within a few days and i love them i have been asked more than once where i got them thanks	17
1	i like everything about this watch except the hands are hard to read in dim light because of the yellow background	17
1	my husband is very picky he loves this watch he has gone through a lot of them and loves that it 's dressy yet casual and can wear it anywhere he loves that it 's a substantial weight and the bracelet came extra long he 's 6'2 and large boned had a watch repair shop take a couple links out for only 5 great investment	17
1	i was honestly expecting some cheap necklace that felt like plastic considering the price i was so very wrong ! the necklace is gorgeous ! the clasp is sturdy and not easy broke package it was mailed in was also very good i am able to christmas wrap it in the package provided excellent service thank you ! !	17
1	this is my second one of these winders so obviously i'm a fan winds my rolexes and a few other eta autos perfectly but it does n't seem to keep my seiko kinetic diver or panerais wound sufficiently still as far as i'm concerned it spreads the lubrication enough to keep the watches in good health for the price point this winder cannot be beat and i will purchase more in the future the auto timer keeps the winder running cool fairly silent rotation depending on the watch while the gear rotations themselves are completely silent sometimes there 's a slight shift of the watch as it goes around which makes a repetitive sound nothing i ca n't live with highly recommended	17
1	i bought this watch and it is cute but the face is smaller than the picture makes it look luckily it was for my teenage daughter and not for me cute though	17
1	this watch is a great looking watch and the indigo light gives it all it needs to meet your everyday use because of its gold tone and silver tone band you do n't have to worry about what color jewelry you wear with it because it matches it all well worth the price	17
1	hasta este momento ha sido una experiencia muy favorable pues el reloj ha funcionado perfectamente y el tiempo de entrega estuvo dentro de mis expectativas	17
1	i wanted a watch with a metal band and a large analog dial i was n't quite sure that i would like this watch when it arrived it was a women 's style but it was larger than i thought it would be i had to first take it to have some of the links removed but i was amazed at how light it was when i had it on i love the easy to read face and the indigo feature is a must for any watch you own i wear it everyday and i love it it arrived with a brand new battery and the stem was pulled out so you knew the battery was new i recommend this watch	17
1	i am delighted to get my new timex watch it is even prettier than its picture ! it is easy to set too i bought this watch for its looks and the larger dial so i am very satisfied it will need links removed but one size just does n't ever fit all	17
1	i really like my new timex it is very classy looking and the face is very easy to read i like the date feature and the lighted face in the dark the only drawback was i had to take it to my jeweler to have some links removed but the charge was minimal all in all good value for the price	17
1	i work in construction and am constantly having to replace my watches because of damage this watch is great because it is sturdy and can be clipped out of the way to prevent breakage	17
1	this is a really nice looking watch keeps accurate time would recommend to anyone considering did a lot of research and amazon had the best price with free shipping	17
1	my trusty seiko of 21 years gave out recently \( i should really remember to take it off when doing strenuous labor \) and i went in search of a similar style i received this replacement about a week ago and i love it already it 's light weight and easy to read in the light or dark	17
1	thanks ! i don't have any problem ! i ll continue make deal with you	17
1	great price super nice watch	17
1	the diamonds are real sparklers they are simple for daytime wear and sophisticated enough for a night on the town a good value !	17

1	this is a very good looking watch it goes with dressy or casual and it makes you feel well dressed	17
1	this watch was purchased as a gift and i was pleasantly surprised when i received it the quality is excellent i had read in another review that the watch was a little bulky but i found it to be in line with watches of the same type this watch works well with casual and work attire and i was tempted to keep the watch for myself in fact i regret not purchasing one for me to keep buy with confidence	17
1	i got a really good deal for this watch and it looks great too very classy	17
1	no complaints it 's a nice change from a more feminine type of watch i usually prefer very nicely priced at amazon	17
1	i received this off my wish list from a dear friend and i must say it 's stunning it 's both delicate and sturdy the craftsman 's shift is beautiful in what you would expect a piece to cost four times this amount the stone is beautiful and large without being gaudy it 's a stunning piece of work all you lads out there should buy this for you lass and make her very happy ! wonderful piece i highly recommend for quality and price	17
1	there isnt much i can say about this item just that the picuture doesnt do the item justice and the seller was great to deal with easy transaction and no problems	17
1	this is a very nice ring i bought one for a gift and decided to keep it myself and ordered anothe	17
1	very nice quality and reasonable pricing this is a great place to see a variety of jewelry my college age daughter fell in love with the bracelets instantly	17
1	just recieved mine today ! its very beautiful it is a weighty ring though and the moonstone is a but smaller than i thought it would be but all in all it is a great buy	17
1	i bought these earrings as a birthday present they are very pretty i am pleased with the quality and the price	17
1	it 's hard to tell the size of these earrings from the pictures however they were about 2x the size that i expected i could n't have found a better gift than these	17
1	i bought these earrings for my niece and after they arrived i immediately ordered another pair for myself i find them actually nicer in reality than in the picture the size is perfect and the amethysts although very small add just a little color accent i bought them on sale for 15 instead of the usual 50 and i am very very pleased with what i got for the price	17
1	nice watch very simple hands are very luminous like the magnified date window	17
1	there 's nothing bad i can say about this item it is by far the lowest price i 've seen for something of this quality and hey she loved it	17
1	they are small but sparkly and look very cute my 15 year old loves it and wear it every day	17
1	prompt delivery good quality well worth the price actually just the right size for all occasions many complements on them thank you kathi abbot	17
1	she 's out of state taking care of her cranky parents \( mom damaged a hip dad is helpless when these things happen \) and needed something to boost her spirits she loved it she prefers small jewelry so it was perfect for her	17
1	i use this watch both as a daily timepiece and for timing my runs the ability to turn off the digital display gives it a refined look even for an ironman series i like the catch incorporated into the watch band so it does n't pull out of the guide \( something that used to drive me crazy with my other watches \) if you 're looking for a sports watch that you can wear out on the town this fits the bill	17
1	timex ironman has been my kind of watch for long time now great watch to wear anytime	17
1	i found this pair of studs to be nice for everyday wear they look much better than the ones found in macy 's fine jewelry and they cost less personally i would not go over 1 3 ctw with this quality because the flaws would become obvious i am very satisfied with my purchase	17
1	i love it very nice watch ! a little bit heavy but this is the way i like watches and the price is not that bad	17
1	this is one of the best watches available and i have no regrets whatsoever with my purchase at a real bargain price from amazon	17
1	tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis the times change and we change with them this is a perfect watch and probably you wo n't change your time machine for a long time simple and beautifu	17
1	it is a good watch under 200 price range if you buy it you will love it forever one thing i hate is little bit heavy but not a big deal \)	17
1	my husband has really liked this watch so far the price was great for such a elegant looking watch he wears it when he dresses up he really likes that it is kinetic we do n't have to worry about replacing the battery the last watch i bought him was a fossil and we had to send it to their servicing center when the battery died and had to wait 4 6 weeks the kinetic seems to be working out great	17
1	this is a sleek sharp quality watch and the lowest priced model that i 've seen in the arctura series if you can catch it on sale i think its a great buy however be prepared for the weight this is the heaviest watch i 've ever worn and probably the largest if you 're used to wearing stainless watches it will probably be fine for you i'm used to leather bands and the weight difference is quite noticeable wish i could find this watch in titanium that would be perfect overall if you 're not bothered by the large size or weight it looks great and i'm sure the quality is also	17
1	i really like the watch it looks good feels good on my wrist and keeps extremely accurate time \( gains about 4 sec per month \) the price of at amazon com was very good compared to others i found in local stores or on the web	17
1	the picture does not do this watch justice it is a very sturdy watch with a nice looking all silver body and band it does not look cheap at all !	17
1	my husband just loves this watch and ca n't get over the great quality for the price	17
1	item came to me fast it is very confortable and very reliable i do n't have to worry a regular chain sticking in my neck or pulling my hair when the necklace moves i highly recommend this necklace for sensitive skins or active people	17
1	i like it beacuse you can hang almost anything from it and it looks good the only downside is that the clasp is too big to get more delicate items on to it	17
1	i love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective i contacted sabrina and they were great about sending me a new one asap with a label for returning the other one that was impressive and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued still the clasp is a product defect and i'm sure one of these days i will probably loose the bracelet b c it comes undone unknowingly	17
1	great set of earrings at a very nice price thanks	17
1	these earrings are so cute ! they are a great size for a toddler but probably a little large for a small infant it is so hard to find safety back earrings that are cute these are a beautiful rose pink color very sweet	17
1	my son needs a watch and this is ideal for him its cheap and it non breakable	17
1	i rounded up from a 4 5 the shipping was on time it was within the specification advertised but one of the diamonds is much more yellow than the others even without a hand lense it is visible other than that i am very happy with the service and product thank you jason bett	17
1	great value and excellent quality better than anything that i 've seen locally highly recommend	17
1	we love the watch it 's totally adjustable press the button for glow in the dark feature the two lizards chase each other around the watch too cute	17
1	i bought this watch for my husband for his bday it was a great bargain very stylish and he loves it the only problem we encountered was w the so called smart link band it was supposedly designed for the customer to resize the band at home but after numerous failed attempts we gave up we googled it and found several people who encountered similar problems solving the smart link mystery but no one offered a solution even the fossil website was no help we ended up paying a jeweler who sells fossil watches 10 to resize the band other than that my husband is very satisfied with this watch	17
1	i bought this for my husband he likes the large easy to read numbers and says the expandable band is comfortable a very nice watch at a reasonable price	17
1	bought this watch as a gift i was not disapointed another great vaule from amazo	17
1	i am pleased with this watch it is inexpensive yet has a lot of features the only negative is that the band is a cloth material and not as easy to keep clean as it would with a leather band	17
1	i read the reviews for these earrings and i am very pleased with the results i purchased my own pair and get plenty of compliments too	17
1	really great quality for the price the hinges are well made so i do n't worry about them falling apart when i wear them they are not white gold and diamonds they are what they claim to be silver and cz i like them !	17
1	as i said in my review of the bracelet \( which i bought together \) i thought from the pictures that they might be bigger however my wife was pleasantly surprised they look much more expensive than they are this is my first experience with cz but not my last \( we 're remodling a house \) i recommend this seller for their shipping quality of merchandise	17
1	i bought this pair of earrings for myself over a year ago when they were new to amazon \( no reviews \) i wanted something that looked pretty but did n't cost me a lot i loved them loved them so much that when i lost one down my sink drain i wanted to buy another pair i am currently waiting to receive my second pair for the price and the beauty why not ! no one will know they are n't real diamonds	17
1	i got this as a present after putting it on my wish list i love it it is really delicate and pretty it 's a little smaller than i thought it would be but still one of my favorite pieces of jewelry	17
1	saw the exact same watch in several jewelry case around town for 125 more very satisfied with my purchase	17
1	i purchased this watch on amazon after looking at the same watch in jc penny and dillards for almost 200 00 more it 's a nice casual watch i wear mine to work as a nurse and its very durable and attractive the mother of pearl face is a pale pink so it does n't clash when wearing other colors for the price seiko watches are great mine usually last about 10 years of frequent wear getting wet regularly	17
1	after a good deal of shopping both online and in retail stores we are delighted with the product price and service through amazon com i recomend this watch highly	17
1	received the watch on saturday dec 23 which was ordered thursday dec 21 in the late evening the watch is beautiful thank you for the great service	17
1	i love this watch it keeps wonderful time i have a bigger wrist so i am glad it has a latch so it wo n't fall off	17
1	for the price it is well made and solid perfect for my kids	17
1	i m very happy to buy in amazon shipping was perfect and on time	17
1	this watch is exactly what i was looking for it is a small pretty functional watch that is quite durable it has plenty of features but is not extremely complicated the color is slightly lighter and more purpley then it is in the pictures	17
1	the watch arrived in timely fashion and was already set up this watch is super however it lacks a timer i left the timex ironman for this watch timex 's quality is horrid \( a watch per year \) and i changed to the casion g shock based on a recommendation of a friend i am glad i did if they ever get a timer in this watch i 'd buy another	17
1	this watch arrived very quickly and it is a very fine watch i had an earlier casio ceptor watch and the battery died i could n't find anyone to replace it so i needed a new watch by the time i had ordered this watch i actually replaced the battery myself in the old one so now i have two atomic watches but the g shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge a great deal	17
1	i purchased this watch as a christmas gift for my husband he was quite surprised and pleased by the atomic solar features and replaceable watch band the watch is a little bulky and fits a bit tight under his sleeves on his dress work shirts overall very pleased and a great value	17
1	i bought this as a gift for a friend and it was the perfect combination of brown leather for casual dress as well as the beautiful simplicity of silver to match classier wear whether you 're looking for something casual or more formal this bracelet wraps it all into one	17
1	i never had a problem with mine i'm a marine and the fact that i went trough combat with mine and held up made it worth the few bucks i paid for it i go trough watches like they are made of paper had this one for 2 5 yrs and other than a lot of scratches it works fine	17
1	i'm logged in on my wife 's accont i never had problems with the band i liked the first one so much that after i ran over it with my car i ordered another if you think of it as a throw away watch and keep it for two years you 'll love it it has a very intuitive design is lightweight and just works	17
1	i bought this watch to replace an older similar model it is simple and functional perfect for being both a timepiece and a running watch the functions are easy to use and the indiglo feature is crucial for nighttime training	17
1	this is my second sleek 50 the first was fine until the battery died then i tried to put in a new battery \( bad idea \) and managed to mess up some of the inner workings highly recommended \( the watch not changing the battery !	17
1	i have three holes in each ear and i really needed some tiny diamond earrings for the top holes these are wonderful ! they are small but exactly what i wanted such a great buy for this price	17
1	i went out on a limb and decided to surprise my wife with these for valentine 's day i purchased the white gold version for her and to my great astonishment my wife was pleased by my jewelry choice a first ! they come in a smallish box with a smaller felt bag that holds the tiny earings \( the picture in amazon must be under a micron microscope ! \) they are tasteful and understated	17
1	i love love these earrings i bought them because i wanted a pair of earrings to wear all of the time unless there is something special then i will change for a special occasion but these earrings i wear in the shower they are always shinning and they never rust because they are real gold i received these earrings before the scheduled delivery date	17
1	the earrings delivered were as described and will certainly work for me i was a bit disappointed in the strength and flexibility of the gold wire these earrings were much more flexible that the 25 year old pair i was replacing i doubt that the new ones are as strong and will hold up as well however they do what i need them to do and can be worn around the clock without irritation	17
1	excellent watch \( eco drive \) i would spend the extra hundred and purchase the titanium	17
1	this is my fourth \( a fifth limited edition is on order \) eco drive i collect a lot of watches but these are some of my favs to actually wear and use they are the most accurate watches i 've ever owned bar none the nighthawk is solid well made and a delight to wear there are few watches on which i 'd change nothing but this is one i also got an excellent price and great service many thanks	17
1	threaders are in and these are about the most elegant looking threaders i 've seen the stones are a nice size and it is obvious that it is a butterfly it is nice to have such a refined option for such a hip style	17
1	i bought these for a friend for christmas as she is a butterfly lover they ar beautiful dainty yet elegant she loved them it was hard for me to give them up	17
1	the earings look much better than pictured online i received this as a gift and love them	17
1	it is small and beautifull be sure you want a small one	17
1	this watch is gorgeus it 's a very big watch \( it does n't look so big on the picture \) the screen can be set to black or red looks good either way very confortable	17
1	this watch changes the background color from red to black is great and the leather belt is soft but resisitance	17
1	this is a gorgeous and delicate looking watch i can read it without my glasses and so far it works i 've had trouble with timex in the past so i hope this holds up well it is very pretty and can go with casual or a nice dress in the evening	17
1	classic style and leather too ! the perfect little black watch at the perfect price	17
1	i always wear timex and never have a problem	17
1	this watch looks so sleek it wears well with day evening wear in addition it makes a great travel watch i love the feel of the nice soft leather band	17
1	i chose this watch because of the stunning and currently very fashionable 'rolex green' colour and because the price was right so how does it stack up \? nice bright yellow display box to keep it safe during shipping and storage watch was well protected as well with clear plastic wrap over all surfaces the quality and finish are excellent and the watch is easy to set for day and date it has a clear back so you can see the motion spring mechanism at work pretty cool clasp and strap are well finished and work well rotating bezel lines up perfectly at 12 o'clock nice sweeping hand movement great look and great value	17
1	i love this watch and i love the price it looks good both casual and dressy it goes with just about anything the people at invicta are really right in that you should try to match your watch with your belt and such the material is high quality i have large wrists so it 's tricky to get on and off initially because the leather is quite stiff but it 's been loosening and so it 's much easier now	17
1	i very much like these earrings my only reason for not giving them a 5 star rating is that the topaz is quite small you really have to look closely to see it but they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful i recommend them just be aware that the stones are tiny	17
1	my boyfriend got me this watch for valentine 's day and it is gorgeous ! the face is very small as other reviewers have indicated so if the recipient likes smaller face watches \( as i do \) this is a great gift it looks more like a bracelet than a watch good for small wrists elegant looking classy i love it !	17
1	this is a tiny compact watch with elegant design it is fit for the women attending the formal parties plus it works great this price deserves its value	17
1	this is a very nice watch it is smaller than it looks in the picture but i actually like it better that way it is delicate and lady like the pink face is subdued and the steel band is polished it makes a nice dressy or everyday watch i have seen similar seikos in the stores for much more money	17
1	bought these as a christmas gift and think think they are adorable ! great for a second or third hole to add a splash of color possibly perfect for a young daughter 's first hole the stones have a very nice sparkle was n't sure if 3mm would be too small but i think these will do just fine this set came individually boxed but in a clear plastic holder so that you can easily give as a set or break them up for individual wrapping for 49 i'm very satisfied	17
1	i am very pleased with the locket it is a nice size but not too big definitely large enough to be engraved the chain is pretty and appears to be strong it arrives in a lovely black velvet pouch and box my daughter was delighted with it	17
1	someone near and dear to me loved it and the price was right ! valentine 's day is coming it makes a great gift	17
1	i bought this necklace after reading reviews about different types breaking easily this one is very good so far and my wife loves it for the price i paid it is a great product	17
1	this necklace is beautiful the chain is not skimpy and the heart locket itself is really pretty a great alternative to an expensive locket at a fine jeweler a true steal at a sale price of under 30 00	17
1	i thought this was a very pretty lil keepsake i think simple is very nice and it 's simple in design and what not plus it 's not too expensive and as a thoughtful gift it will win lots of points	17
1	i bought this locket and got it engraved with my sons name on it \( caden \) it looked great you could fit 5 or 6 letters on it it was a good locket	17
1	i believe the heart shaped locket is a one of a kind thing it is appropriately sized to allow for sufficient size pictures while not being too large the silver is clean and smooth looking just like the pictures due to the size of the locket a dainty smaller chain is sturdy but does not detract from the locket therefore while i was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews i took a risk and am happy with this purchase the pictures were easy to insert and there is a plastic film to put over the pictures for finger prints and some protection good gift sincerely the guy who usually blows it on the valentine 's day gift	17
1	a really beautiful watch with very very nice casing adjustable strap which fix easily on my 4 and 8 year old children they love it	17
1	the facets make the chain quite sparkly i found it perfect for all my pendants not flimsy but not too heavy and not twisty like some other type chains	17
1	this is a nice chain with a durable lobster claw clasp the diameter is somewhat small but i will probably order another chain with a larger diameter	17
1	i am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase the earrings were more beautiful than i expected i will definitely purchase jewelry from amazon in the future ! !	17
1	these came in great condition and with a nice box to store them in ! they are very pretty but if you do n't like heavy earrings these wo n't be for you	17
1	the product arrived quickly and without a hitch i really liked the earrings when i saw them they were better than expected i'm very pleased thank you	17
1	i had seen the gold orange face version of this casio watch for years but did n't know it came in black \( and white \) until i found it on amazon i really like the classic good looks of this watch nice rugged case smooth clicking rotating bezel sturdy band etc for lt 60 this watch truly delivers awesome quality and value the digital features are great too i 've received a few compliments from co workers on this watch already overall an awesome watch for the money and i could n't be happier with it	17
1	i 've owned this model for about seven years and i think i 'll buy another to keep on standby in case i break the original \( i'm not gentle with my watches while working playing \) tough pretty easy to set good features and classic diver style at a great price what 's not to like \? would n't mind having a light on the lcd otherwise it is proven a great investment battery lasts 2 years with the alarm going off every day and watch band life is about the same \( cracks develop after a while \) no corrosion \( duh stainless steel \) and good resistance to scratches on the crystal so far	17
1	a great item i received the watch box storage chest very quickly and was very happy overall with the purchase it was as described in perfect condtion and a great buy too	17
1	this is a beautiful watch storage box great value my husband is a watch collector plenty of room for the large invicta and croton watches nice design and color a must have for anyone with a extensive watch collection	17
1	my husband has become an avid watch collector so i gave him this box for christmas the design of the box is as attractive as its contents my husband says that it is easy to use too from the looks of things i will have to get another box for his ever increasing collection	17
1	beautiful box to hold most of my watches have two other watch boxes that hold 11 watches ea and some rings this box holds those watches in less space ! having no place for the rings is not a minus in my opinion nice being able to see 10 of my most worn watches at a glance ! another 10 in the drawer below if you have several watches that you want to put in a nice looking good quality box you will not go wrong buying this item	17
1	this is a real nice looking box i'm expecting great leaps in organization for all my wrist wear tech swiss also receives an a for getting this out to me so swiftly	17
1	this is an outstanding purchase at a great price and quick service and deliverythanks amazo	17
1	i love all of the bracelets that i 've purchased from this vendor they are cute and inexpensive also i 've recieved so many compliments on this bracelet i'm very pleased with this jewelry vendor	17
1	i have bought several of their bracelets but this one has a special quality to it it looks so expensive and is so pretty matches everything what can i say i guesss the lord was good to me finding this at a price i can afford the first time i wore it i got a compliment everyone wants to know where i got it i love this bracelet	17
1	i love this watch i thought by looking at the pictures and reading other comments that it was going to be big and bulky i was immediately surprised at how light it was it is easy to read and keeps good time it is also a very handsome watch the rotating bezel is a quick and easy way to time anything \( lasting less than a hour \) highly recommended !	17
1	i received the product early and was just what i expected nice packaging and great product i would buy again thanks amazon	17
1	this watch is a classic i have no issues with it losing minutes i am very tough on watches i never take them off and this watch has been a real tank i was needlessly worried that the red and blue dial would chip or be scratched off i am amazed that it has not b c i have accidentally scraped smashed it into doors walls etc same for the dial tough as diamonds it is a big watch so it may not be for everyone but if you like the styling it is a steal and the seals will never weaken b c it will never be opened to change a battery i am very impressed	17
1	i love the look of my seiko it 's the best for the money i will buy more seikos in the future it 's a great product	17
1	i had my order within 48 hours ! product was great as well ! ! ! !	17
1	i will purchase again from pugster the only negative is it took a while to get here once i ordered but the quality is great	17
1	this necklace came exactly as pictured with a nice big blue box to store it in i feel it was a great value for the money i would recommend purchasing if you like topaz jewelry	17
1	these are very well crafted little earrings i love how they look and the price just ca n't be beat ! these have made me want to buy many more things from silver insanity ! the only problem i did experience with these earrings is that the post is rather long and it pokes the side of my head when i sleep otherwise i could n't love them more !	17
1	as a tarantula keeper \( i have 5 at home \) i always try to look for unique items such as these caution they are really tiny ! i 've already lost one of them \( guess it scurried away \) it 's nice to see that they actually look like tarantulas and not true spiders	17
1	pros the blue topaz stone is beautiful with great quality and great cut the white gold is a perfect choice to combine with the blue of the stone and the diamonds cons the chain is kind small and thin the diamonds are tiny with less than good quality overall i am a pleased customer i bought it as a gift for the topaz stone not for the diamonds or the chain by the way she looks stunning with this necklace	17
1	i was kind of worried when i read some of the other reviews for this but i'm so glad i ordered it ! it is sooooo much more beautiful in person than in the picture it 's wonderfully sparkly and just the right size it did take a bit long to ship but it was worth the wait	17
1	this is such a gorgeous bracelet ! i'm glad i ordered it for myself	17
1	very pleased with this bracelet the crystals are gorgeous it is a wow bracelet	17
1	when i received this bracelet i was absolutely knocked off my feet ! ! it is larger than it looks in the picture and is absolutely stunning	17
1	needed a gift for my mother in law who has everything including great taste she collecgts the swarovski figures but didnt have any of their jewelry i came upon this accidentaly and took a chance on ordering it it arrived promptly in time for christmas and it is very stunning not gaudy at all just classic style beauty could probably be worn to her office each day \( upscale casual \) or if she is dressed up the price absolutely could not be beaten for what you are getting i liked it so much i wanted to get one for myself and i am not a huge jewelry fan	17
1	service was great ring is beautiful and of good quality it was set promptly	17
1	this product has helprd me to easily open the back of my watch and replace the battery i am sure it will satisfy me when i want to change the battery on my more expensive watch that has the back that screws on but also since i have n scale model trains the tweezers and small tools have been most helpful i e pliers hammer etc	17
1	this is a good collection of tools that you should have if you want to do minor watch repairs at home i had 5 6 watches lying around and i could not use them coz they ran out of battery was able to open all of them with tools in this kit it doesnt have any user guide but if you have used tools then you will be able to figure out where to use what and how the quality of products is pretty good too at least nothing broke during fixing 5 6 watches yet i am very happy with the purchase the hammer was missing from the kit and when i called the customer service they immediately sent me the hammer	17
1	this is an excellent tool set for beginners the quality of the tools is not professional grade but more than adequate for the hobbyists for the price you pay this is an excellent deal a little more money than some of the other kits being sold on amazon com but well worth it as you get a complete set	17
1	i love the workmanship in this piece nicely done and silver insanity has awesome customer service	17
1	i bought this necklace because it was very on sale and i was surprised by how much i loved it when it arrived the beads are actually somewhat darker than they appear in the picture which looks nicer and is easier to match to an outfit it 's a bold necklace but it can dress down quite a bit with the right blouse	17
1	i was browsing through amazon when i came upon nvie jewelry and i absolutely love it ! i bought this necklace for my mom for her birthday but had a hard time not keeping it for myself the necklace was really nice well constructed and it was shipped quickly it looked just like the picture but i have a feeling that each piece of jewelry is truly one of a kind i would recommend nvie designs to anyone for buying really lovely affordably priced jewelry	17
1	i have had many compliments on this watch i have the satisifcation that it cost much less than a jewelery store ps it 's also my dive watch	17
1	what a great buy ! beautiful and high quality watch for a great price it is probably an older version of the seiko coutura watch but it really does not matter	17
1	this watch is very rich looking the price was phenomenal ! i saw this for sale at other retailers for 300 00 plus ! i have received numerous compliments	17
1	the watch is very pretty sturdy enough for everyday wear and elegant enough for dressy occasions excellent price and fast delivery i like the dual tone watch band because i wear both white and yellow gold the gold is n't as brassy as what shows in the picture excellent value	17
1	i purchased this as a gift for mu niece and she thought it was so pretty she liked to weight and she says it is staying nice	17
1	very nice piece just beware of the size it 's much bigger than it appears in this picture it does hang nice on the silver cord however the clasp is backwards and with the cord it does not flex to the correct position	17
1	i bought this gift for my sister in law and it was beautiful it is high quality and looks great	17
1	i just received this today somehow i completely missed that the pendant is on a silver wrapped wire and not a chain had i noticed that i probably would not have ordered this piece and i would have missed out it is very nice it has a nice weight to it not too heavy but substantial the wire lays on my neckline just right and the pendant looks beautiful i'm very pleased with it	17
1	this is a beautiful piece very substantial and unusual ! the only thing that would have made it better is if it had been made with a bigger bail so it could accommodate larger chains than the neckwire it comes on regardless it was well worth the price	17
1	i was impressed with the quality of this pendant including the packaging ! i 've received several complements on the quality and unique design for me it signifies john 15 5 i am the vine and you are the branches i am very pleased with this fine piece of jewelry thank you	17
1	this is an excelent machine pricsie timing and wondeful design i will recommend it to any lover of good watche	17
1	this invicta is a great watch if you are looking for a giant size timepiece with a touch of elegance it is well designed and the fit and finish is good the citizen automatic movement is a workhorse and very reliable when you open the box this watch will impress you and everytime you wear it it will be noticed it is not for the timid comments and more information can be obtained through the www invictawatchforum com see what others think and general watch information	17
1	my sister loved her necklace she was very pleased with it and so am i	17
1	it 's a beautiful pendant the stone is genuine and very beautiful i love it	17

1	never off time never wind never re set the true lazy person 's watch	17
1	exceptional value for the money ! the watch is beautiful and the recipient was particularly impressed that it had the correct time and date upon his opening the present no more watches that say the 31st on the 1st of the month	17
1	watch is a very sturdy and water resistant time piece however the resin band is very uncomfortable at times	17
1	the charm itself was slightly smaller then expected but for the price it was fine shipping time was good	17
1	i received these earrings as a gift and i do n't know what they are made of but i get an awful lot of compliments on them they seem to change color in response to what i am wearing i would definitely order other silver insanity items	17
1	the earrings were a gift and were most warmly received ! they were a real hit !	17
1	i have two pairs of earrings from this company and they look amazing i ca n't tell if they 're plastic or glass but they really do look as beautiful as in the picture and i always get compliments when i wear them sometimes people ask me what stone they are they ca n't even tell it 's synthetic ! ! no bubbles or anything like the bad review here says	17

1	this is my second casio watch of this type the watch is maintenance free adjusts itself every night and takes care of daylight savings time	17
1	i am pleased with the watch it is flashy and keeps good time however i am still trying to figure out why it stops from time to time i think i inadvertantly push a button that stops it it is a small annoyance but has happened 4 5 times in the last month	17
1	i 've been through generations of digital watches with plastic bands my wife thinks they look nerdy but i like the alarm and other gadgets i'm tired of wearing these things out though and wanted something that looked nicer this is a very nice looking sturdy watch which was what i wanted it also has the window with the digital time date alarm etc my only complaint is that that window is tiny and not easy to see also the light for night viewing is wimpy the watch works fine and is very nice looking but i wish the window were a bit larger one year later the digital window keeps setting it self back to jan 1 and 12 00 noon poor quality look elsewher	17
1	i totally love this necklace it goes with many things i own and really enhances a low neckline i get compliments each time i wear it	17
1	it 's a good value for anyone with no time and a small budget ! five stars for value	17
1	i purchased this as a gift for my secret santa and she wore it a week strait	17
1	i bought this watch on amazon for my husband who is an avid runner and he loves it ! ! he sometimes has difficulty with the heart rate while running because of sweat \( so he says \) but otherwise no complaints \( and he can be a tough critic \)	17
1	my husband loves the big face on the watch that 's tilted for easy viewing while running he never takes it off even in the shower the heart rate monitor reads clearly and easily	17
1	but no calories count i love this watch despite that it 's well designed the chest strap also links to the machines in the gym \( most that say polar ready \) so that was a great surprisethe chest strap has a battery that is user serviceable as well as the watch so you do n't have to send it to the manufacturer \( like the polar hr \) overall i think is a good buy but the is missing the calories count that would be my only upgrade	17
1	i purchased this for my wife on christmas she loves it looks wonderful though it is smaller than it appears in the picture	17
1	i bought this for my boyfriend as his valentine 's day gift he loved it ! it 's a great price for this watch as well	17
1	are you tired of replacing watch batteries \? do you bump into things with your watch \? if so buy this one it 's a beautiful practical watch that 's available at a very good price it winds itself mechanically as you move your wrist about no batteries it 's shock and water resistant bang it around swim with it wash dishes with it shower with it no problem it 's gold plated stainless steel with a gold plated stainless steel band it 's beautiful it 's big so if you have small wrists buy the ladies version if not buy the men 's version	17
1	this dainty heart looks absolutely beautiful on it picks up the colors of your clothing it is an amazing price for such a beautiful pendant	17
1	for the price this is a great buy ! colors are good has a nice weightto it ! would buy more from this merchant	17
1	i purchased three of these hearts bracelets for my three daughters for christmas they are very pretty and they loved them the quality is good for price	17
1	great item do n't go looking for huge diamonds but it looked good over all and my girlfriend loved it so i guess that 's the most important thing	17
1	lovely little apple charm just what i wanted picture a little deceptive though i thought the charm would be larger than it actually was otherwise great item i'm happy	17
1	the 30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description about the watch i 'll just say it fits very well on my relatively small wrist if you like the watch but think it wo n't fit well because you have small wrist do n't worry it fits just fine enjoy after wearing this watch for few weeks i realized i am just like many others wearing the calibre 2100 exclusively now	17
1	great looking watch and i shopped around for the best price for about three weeks before i ordered from amazon shipped lightning quick also	17
1	overall the product is great i have had the watch for nearly three months now and have had no problems with it the quartz movement is very accurate the chronograph works very well and i use the alarm every day the only drawback is that you have to reset the date on months that are less than 31 days otherwise this watch is fantastic and with the eco drive you never have to worry about repacing the battery and the titanium version is so lightweight that you hardly notice that you are wearing a watch	17
1	very high quality watch i recommend these to all luxury fans works without any problems my old citizen chronograph are working for over than 12 years by now daily used	17
1	i have banged my watch against all kinds of hard surfaces and am pleased to say that this thing is built tough everytime i 've accidentally hit it against a counter top or wall i worry that i might 've scratched it but everytime \( knock on wood \) it 's come out clean another good thing about this watch is that it 's light for a big watch it does n't weigh me down like a stainless steel model i 've gotten many compliments on it i love it	17
1	this watch is beautiful i cannot say enough good things about this watchs design its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy it keeps perfect time and is very light weight i bought the calibre 8700 before this one and i love both of them but i would give this one a slight edge my two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the calibre 8700 does have and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not saphire i am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as saphire crystal would be	17
1	this item is exactly as advertised well designed well made and heavy my only complaint \( and the reason for the 4 stars \) is that the chain is way to short i knew this when i ordered it so i had other arrangements made but a 26 or 28 chain would be much better in my opinion than a 20 great value for the money however	17
1	this was a gift and was lovely and beautiful not too big not to small delivery time was great strongly advice to buy this	17
1	i am very pleased with my purchase the item came to me in 3 days via dhl in a new condition well packed and safe recomended for reasonable prices	17
1	i absolutely love these earrings very well made beautiful design and a lot of silver	17
1	bought 14 fossil watches for christmas gifts all arrived in fine shape from watch zone of the group this was one of the nicest perhaps a little heavier than one would expect recommended	17
1	this was my first fossil watch i usually buy burberry or d g but i was so hard for me to tell time on the watches so my friend told me to buy a fossil so i did and i love it is so stylish and cute i love the way it changes color from different angles	17
1	this is a really fun and fashionable watch it has a bangle style band and can be worn slightly loose or snug i like the pink dial that changes color depending on the angle and lighting the dial looks pink yellow or purple i also like how fossil made the band adjustable remove or add as many links as necessary there is no need to have the watch adjusted at the jewelry counter	17
1	this watch is automatic has a sapphire crystal and is invicta what more can u ask \? and all this for just 200 the piece is heavy u can taste the quality by holding it the movement can be seen in the front and back one of the better looking movs iv ever seen i own 7 automatic watches 3 of them are invictas but this have the coolest movement inside it holds the charge up to 3 days and mine only losses 3 minutes in a week buy this watch is very very reliable	17
1	light intricate and very cute ! they came very quickly and the price was very fair ! i have a second piercing in my left ear and i like to wear one there so along with my other jewelry i always have a fairy whispering in my ear	17
1	this chain was exactly what i was looking for ! it is so cheap but really good quality ! i am really happy with this product	17
1	a nice moderately priced chain that is very pretty it is fine delicate chain and the serpentine pattern has a spiral look to it the are reflective areas that shimmer every 1 4 inch or so i am using with a large cubic zirconia pendant and it is quite stunning the chain feels strong and less likely to tangle great purchase for the price	17
1	i was looking for a cheap but nice chain this is perfect arrived in two days beautiful chain nice strong and polished great buy for five dollars or a little more	17
1	very delicate very pretty chain it does n't kink up when i wear it and it 's the perfect length i have worn this every day since i received it	17
1	beautiful detailed and accurate time piece i have a few watches and this is one i place ahead of all the others i have large face and can be read at a glance	17
1	as a field engineer i have to work with tools inside machinery more often than not i keep my watch and i have had several scratched watches in the past so i was somewhat skeptical to wear a nice watch like this but the price seemed right to give it a try after 9 months of using it daily this watch has still not a single scratch the quality is very good and it really looks better than on the picture	17
1	the watch is actually better than it appeared from the photo one of the few times when i can actually state that something is an even better value than it appeared	17
1	i am studying pilot for now i order this watch and i think it is useful to me as the flight computer with me all the time and i do n't just use it when i am in flight but also in the normal life because it look too luxury watch and i like it too much	17
1	i 've had the watch for a week now and i'm very happy with it both digital and analog time are exact to the second after a week \( checked against apple network time server \) the watch looks good and i ca n't say i 've had a problem with the digital display if it was brighter i think it would tend to be distracting the slide rule looks good but i doubt more than 1 of buyers will actually use it one small negative point i have noticed is that although the hands are luminous the hour markers are n't which makes things a little tricky in complete darkness a silly oversight hence 4 stars overall though well worth the money	17
1	you can pay hundreds more for the same product but why \? this watch has everything th emore expensive brands do but it costs much less it is not a cheapy either it still has the pulsar durability and usefulness great buy	17
1	first of all i recieved the item in a very timely fashion approx 3 days second the packaging was very nice the chain was a good quality snake chain and the pendent was a very good quality heavy and prettier in person	17
1	my grand son calls my wife nana so i had to get it for her for mothers day great product	17
1	we do n't call our nana grandmother so this necklace is perfect	17
1	i purchased this watch for three reasons 2 time zones backlighting constant display of day of week month day did not disappoint looks cool i bought this watch on the basis of the other earlier reviews very accurate account of the features and performance i wear it for everyday use	17
1	this is probably one of the lightest smallest watches with an interval timer feature which is why i got it it 's also pretty cheap it has a decent number of other options as well this particular seller had the cheapest price with the most recent model very quality	17
1	this watch has a large display and easy to use functions i get a lot of compliments on the unique band it 's small enough to look feminine yet still sporty i ca n't think of anything i would like to change about it	17
1	this pin is n't as pretty in person as it is in the picture online it is nice but not spectacular	17
1	i ordered these earrings knowing they would be small if my ear holes had been a bit more toward the edge of my earlobe they might have fit these earrings are really tiny and do not fit me i need the next higher up size these are like 3 8 inch way small for me and also way difficult to even bend manipulate to open the hoop	17
1	the earrings were exactly what i wanted the delivery date was as promised	17
1	these are very nice light weight earrings the look silver and black even though they are not so keep that in mind when you purchase them as to what the will go with i wear lots of black so it was a pleasant surprise for me very antique look to them	17
1	these earrings are a substantial weight even though they are hollow and the filigree detailing is superb ! i fell in love with these when i saw them on the site while shopping for xmas presents for friends and just had to order a pair for myself	17
1	these are my favorite earrings i wear them constantly they are unique and jazz up even the most utilitarian outfit they are a bit larger than you might anticipate and it is a size i really like but which might overpower some the picture at least on my monitor is about life sized	17
1	these are gorgeous earrings that just happened to match a pendant i already had i 've had many compliments on them	17
1	for the price this watch ca n't be beat very thin very light and it gets quite a few comments i am anxious to see how the crystal holds up as apparently skagen is notorious for fragile crystals at 75 however i wo n't be that upset if it has to be replaced overall an excellent buy for the price and no pulling of the arm hair	17
1	very slick easy to read watch with the contrast of silver hands on a dark blue face appreciate the smooth comfortable mesh watchband which easily adjusts to your wrist size	17
1	this is a nice looking watch overall if you like this style in black look for the t233xltmn it is a very very nice watch and popular in europe	17
1	the band and face are both so much darker than they look in the picture also amazon neglected to send the owners manual and warranty information \( i had to contact skagen for this \) the watch is very attractive though	17
1	i really like the face and style of the watch i like the mesh band but the wire may snag clothing or fabric	17
1	i have skin allergies and was not able to find a watch that i could have on my skin until i found this watch the price of the watch could not be beat for the chance that i could not have it on thank you for suppling a great watch	17
1	i'm a picky person when it comes to watches and i'm very rough with them this watch has far exceeded my expectations on all accounts its so light i often forget i'm even wearing a watch i 've gotten several comments on it as well the only negative thing i can say about this watch is that the mesh material of the band is difficult to get water out of i useally take mine off to wash my hands overall its a good looking well made tough time piece	17
1	my girlfriend bought me this watch its design is great and what 's better it 's super light \( titanium hooray ! ! \) i think no country other than japan can produce this kind of watch citizen you rock	17
1	very nice watch ! keeps good time and it 's extremely light weight looks great	17
1	very light weight appropriately sized not too gaudy or flashy accurate so far reasonably priced pretty much everything i was after in a watch	17
1	these earrings are of very nice quality and were what i expected i am pleased with these	17
1	well this is the watch band that i originally had on my seiko watch i searched the internet to find a replacement amazon had it for a good price i ordered it and got it in the mail three days later	17
1	we got these earrings for our daughter on her 6th birthday she loves jewelry and especially earrings the color is a little pale the actual earrings are n't quite as pink as they look in the picture but they are good quality and look great my daughter wears them all the time this was a good buy these earrings are great for anyday wearing or with evening wear they look very stylish	17
1	big numbers easy to use all the functions i use it for flying and timing my instrument approache	17
1	we finally have a stopwatch that fufills our every need the display was so large all i had to do was merely glance down i 've gone through several stopwatches but this one is the most durable	17
1	it look very nice will be an excellente gift for any friend i just have a complaint they just carry this item in zise 7 but still looking very fanc	17
1	i was more than pleased when i received this pendant ! it has a nice feel and you actually know it 's there instead of it feeling like a good wind would carry it away you have to look extremely close to see the peridot in the setting but that is all i have to complain about ! definitely worth your money	17
1	i ordered this watch initially as a gift for someone and when i received it i loved the look and feel of it so much that i quickly ordered another just for myself it 's a very sleek looking watch very lightweight on your wrist and the price on amazon here is at lear 40 below what i have seen it go for regular retail price in the more upscale stores in the malls i intend to use this watch for special occasions as i believe it will complement dressier attire	17
1	i really liked this watch before i bought it and then i liked it some more for another 2 3 weeks but after that it started to seem plain to me i want something more fanc	17
1	this watch looks incredible the case is solid titanium and the mesh band is tiny stainless steel links infused with titanium it really can go with anything you could wear it with khakis jeans a suit pretty much anything because the color is so versatile if you 're looking for a quality watch that looks good and for a really good price well look no further	17
1	they were quite a bit larger than i expected i do n't recall if they listed a size on the page but i am 100 pleased with the many other purchases i 've made with silver insanity	17
1	i'm wearing it at the moment it 's lasted this long i do n't know why people complaining about if people wanted a nightvision face for a peice of 18th century tech they should just buy a seiko its great for it 's sole funtionality which is to look pretty in dance halls you buy it to get stares guys or dare i let you do this but let your girlfriends buy it for you	17
1	this watch was a gift for my husband he loves it ! he wanted a slim watch he could wear around and this is it	17
1	this watch looks classy wears comfortably and is very light my only complaint so far is that it seems to scratch rather easily	17
1	this is a great watch the clasp is easy to adjust and takes only 10 minutes to adjust it was shipped well before the estimated time and is in perfect condition well made and light it 's extremely slim so if you really like heavy watches this may not be your choice otherwise it is perfect for everyone	17
1	this is the best watch if you consider following things 1 looks the color of dial and the feeling of dial on hands is really beautiful 2 size and thickness if you search for slim watches skagen will be your first and final choice 3 mesh band this type of band is the speciality of skagen its un comparable 4 price considering the price for overall quality this watch is really affordable bottom line everyone will notice and appreciate about it	17
1	another quality item and very pleased looks superb with the matching bracelet will buy more and more from this company as the prices are so reasonable and the quality is awesome ! o	17
1	the watch is very nice and it came in an excellent condition ! it is very beautiful and it has many operations	17
1	i bought this watch a month bak an i am really happy wit it ita sightly complicated to learn but overall its absolutely amazing its a steal at that price only pwoblem is that the temperature indicator takes time to adjust	17
1	i was searching for a watch for weeks saw a picture of this watch and paused intrigued i began to read the specs alarm chronograph thermometer light stopwatch world time zones and more what 's the catch \? 55usd c'mon seriously with all those features is that all \? i was still skeptical but when i got the watch put it on my wrist i was sold solid well crafted unique sporty elegant combination my only gripe is that slight increase in body temperature can give an innacurate room temperature we ca n't have the world but casio has come close with this price i can honestly say go for it	17
1	this watch has it all at a nice price the display is kind of dark and the band sacrifices some of your hand hair if u have and i doubt that u do n't have else is a masterpiece all stainless steel even base thermomener and a smart cronograph plus 3 yrs battery this is my favourite no other watch has this price quality proportion try it and u will be satisfied sporty but looks elegant too	17
1	the craftsmanship on this watch it absolutely top rate very nice band not flimsy or cheap the world time is very cool	17
1	i love the look but was a little unhappy with the quality of the small melee diamonds used around the dial of the watch they are very milky and personally i think the watch would look better without them at all if that 's the only quality they had great looking and i'm glad i finally bought it for myself	17
1	just got my watch today it is the perfect watch i have been shopping around and i was thrilled to find it on amazon for more than 100 less than retail stores ! ilove it	17
1	i had been looking at this particular watch for over a year and simply did not want to spend the money on it i found it at amazon com for half the price i had seen in department stores so i decided to buy it it is a fabulous watch i look forward to wearing it each day it looks great with really dressy suits or jeans and a top it is a great piece	17
1	these earrings are very pretty i'm very pleased ! nice faceting and sparkle the stones are a medium bright green with a little yellow and brown mixed in which only seem to make the stones more intriguing and beautiful the peridot stones in these earrings are the prettiest i 've owned so far highly recommend	17
1	i am very please with this purchase the earrings are a very good quality !	17
1	they sparkle well and look as good as anything else i have seen at the mall stores i like the non cup style studs as i think they allow more light to flow through the stone save your cash and get these she will be very happy and you can spend the extra money on fishing lures or something \) do not go to jared 's jewelers if they are near you they are evil people	17
1	i am very pleased with these earrings they are a great quality at this price i would also recommend the matching pendant great set !	17
1	the earrings were such a hit that another daughter wants to buy a pair	17
1	let me just say my girlfriend loved them and then loved m	17
1	as soon as i saw this watch i had to get it i loved it because it had really nice details and the butterflies are beautiful it 's a really nice looking and good quality watch the only problem i do have with it is that the face is quite big if you have a small wrist it is very large i still love it and would never return it but feel like it could be a lot smaller	17
1	i just got this watch as a christmas present it is gorgeous the only thing is it 's a little bigger than i would like it to be the face is so femanine but the size makes it a little masculine the face is about an inch and a half in diameter and the band is a little over a half inch wide because it is so pretty i am keeping it however if you prefer a small dainty watch maybe this one is n't for you my friends are telling me bigger watches are in now so maybe they 're right \? \?	17
1	beautiful wear them all the time sincerely gai	17
1	i was very pleased with this purchase these earrings are very simple yet elegant they could be worn with jeans or to a more dressed up occasion a good choice for the price	17
1	the pendant is striking shiny and great to look at the diameter of the pendant is the size that i expected and the necklace itself is adjustable so you can choose how high or low you want to wear it great purchase would buy it again	17
1	this is my second skagen watch my first one which was almost identical to my new one lasted ten years of daily use i love the two tone combination of gold and stainless steel my only disappointment is that at a glance it is difficult to tell the minute hand from the second hand i think the hour and minute hands should be slightly more heavier than the second hand otherwise i love the profile design of this watch including where the comfortable mesh band meets the watch face	17
1	a very nice watch for the price very low profile and nice flexible band would like smaller face but otherwise a great watch	17
1	i'm delighted with my skagen watch as i was with the previous one i lost i find the clean modern design makes me feel elegantly turned out the analog dial is easy to read the mesh band is easy to adjust to my wrist size the silver color coordinates with my silver jewelry	17
1	i love this bracelet it 's very pretty looks just like it was shown looks expensive tasteful i have bigger wrists so i 'd like it better if it came in larger sizes but it goes great with my watch	17
1	i ordered three pair of these earrings for christmas gifts for the preteen set and am absolutely delighted very nice quality and beautifully presented boxed in a small velvet pouch absolute perfection	17
1	we sent this necklace to our daughter it arrived actually earlier than anticipated and she just loves it what a great company to deal wit	17
1	actually i ordered this necklace for my best friend 's birthday and she loved she is a very stylish woman so i am so thankful for this product it is worth every cent i paid and i am thinking to buy one for myself too	17
1	i ordered it and it came very quickly \( earlier than expected \) i love this pearl necklace	17
1	works great fits well and has a nice design definitely recommend i	17
1	finally a phoenix that does n't look like a dragon ! just the right size and beautiful detail i love it	17
1	the order arrived on time packaged very nicely they are quality earrings which was one of my concerns buying on line and not able to handle them the price was fair i would recommend and would myself purchase again	17
1	i received the necklace and realized that the color was a little more orange than red i bought it for a friend and i think she will like it regardless the pendant is very large	17
1	i bought this as a memento of a brilliant but modest necklace i had seen at the smithsonian institute i love the grand central stone as well as the modern multi strands of this design this combination truly illuminates my evening wear by far the intricate detail present reminds me of the jewelery owned by ladies of the royal court with so much class it is still affordable this necklace is an exceptional gem	17
1	the th watch was a dream watch to the person it was gifted to it was bought for a friend and he just loved it	17
1	an awesome watch i absolutely love it incredible value at this price	17
1	i am pleased with the watch it syncs with the big clock in colorado every morning at midnight we also have a wall clock at home which does the same thing and the difference between the 2 is no more the 1 second at worst for 40 you ca n't go wrong only complaint is my wrist is in between removing 1 or 2 links from the watch band so i chose 1 it rides a tad lose on my wrist but 2 links would make it too tight guess i need to lose a couple more pounds so i can take another link out !	17
1	this is probably one of casio 's least expensive wave ceptors it synchs every day indoors in a watch case that 's not by a window the digital display shows the day date and other info such as which time zone what time it synched i'm just concerned that the analog digital display and receiving every day will make it a battery eater it 's available in different dials but the blue seems to be the most common i give it 4 stars because the luminous paint is not very bright and the crystal is acrylic scratches easily but that 's not really an issue because i have about 15 watches and this one gets very little wrist time	17
1	i was pleased with this item it was just like i expected	17
1	these earrings looked better than i expected they sparkle on my daughter 's ears very pretty	17
1	in real earrings look much better than on the picture substantial presence of a nice quality jewellery	17
1	nice quality it is a shame that they do not have the same in longer cords as well	17
1	good watch for a firts one ! ! ! ! ! ! simple to handled and very easy to use thanks a lot ! !	17
1	overall this watch is good large numbersfairly standard set of basic features \( date alarm stop watch \) crown seems fairly resistant to scratchingindiglo lighting is greatcontrary to the description however the chronograph does not have a lap capability it only has a split function \( 2 way \) as a reminder it does not have a countdown timer which seems to be a common theme for many timex watches	17
1	great errings i got these for my 12 y o neice but decided they were too long for her but loved them for myself very cute	17
1	swarovski has been making crystal jewelry since 1892 and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires these excellent earrings are made of sterling silver and swarovski crystals and are quite attractive if you are looking for some nice crystal and silver earrings then these are the ones to get by the way they look great when combined with the heart star and starburst crystal tattoos which i also highly recommend !	17
1	and my wife liked it it 's shiny what more can be said \) i wish the smaller heart was a little larger you can barely tell what it is	17
1	let 's face it it 's hard to find a watch that has it all a nice band a decent color scheme an elegant but not overbearing look this has it i'm sure some will say that the animation is too much but it 's very subtle and it can be stopped at the tough of a button the crystal is not too large and not too small and the band is tough	17
1	bought this to use at work since i had to send in the one i usually wear for repairs lumi is extremely bright when charged the monster has gained 1 minute in 2 days which is not bad for an inexpensive seiko swapped the band with a nato fits a little bit better on my wrist overall a good purchase	17
1	see all over for double the price works great get lots of compliments more the my more expensive watches	17
1	bought this as a gift for my brother he was impressed by the quality and feel of the watch he wears it so i think i did pretty good considering he 's a tough person to buy something for	17
1	this is a rugged no frills watch that uses old school technology to do the job so they wo n't be around for long	17
1	these earrings are the beautiful deep blue of genuine sapphires and the 1 0 carat size is just the right size \( anything larger might tend to look fake i 've purchased from this merchant many many times and always find myself typing in sabrina silver whenever i need or want a new and inexpensive piece of jewelry they 're the best and i 've never been disappointed	17
1	beautiful deep blue round crystal post earrings i love them	17

1	este es un lindo producto hermoso y elegante pero se raya muy facil igual me gusta y lo uso todos los dias pero no creo que sea algo de muy larga duracion	17
1	you know how usual it is to see people wearing the tiffany love charmbracelet \? this looks exactly like one of those with a twist it look more like tiffany bracelet with follie follie charms and its a watch at a price like that it 's a steal ! however the bracelet is a little too long for my wrist what 's more interesting is that the box of the watch works as a clock itself how practical can that be if you are looking for a chrambracelet this it is	17
1	best item i bought for a great price i would like to see more like thi	17
1	when i recevied my watch i was so excited ! it looked so cool in the picture and ever so when i got it the harry face on it was neat and the case that comes wit it was so detailed ! ca n't wait 2 sport it when the movie and the last final book arrives ! ! !	17
1	love the watch it looks even better than it did in the picture it was supposed to be a gift for my nephew but i kept it \( i know i'm terrible \) but i ordered him another one	17
1	these earrings are very pretty they are a nice size and they are n't heavy at all very lightweight i have had them for a week or so now and have gotten nothing but compliments on them they are great and so is the price ! the vendor sent them very promptly and there were no problems	17
1	my boss asked me to get this so that he check out the latin portion of it what a waste ! the only latin on this cd is latin american spanish the interface was underwhelming i needed to guess at what did what because the controls are mostly icons what 's worse there is no menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program apparently though the manufacturer did throw in an extra not listed on the back if you are learning the differences between us and uk english its there ! i gave this one star only because i could n't give it no stars	4
1	i found this title messing around adding things to my wish list i only read the blurb on amazon enough to see haitian creaole listed as one of the languages today updating my wish list i took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more ! how unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake i almost made buying this in hopes of it having haitian creole ! very disappointing ! ! ! ! the makers should be ashamed	4
1	they have the hebrew backwards ! ! you are supposed to read hebrew right to left the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right i find it extremely confusing i know how to read hebrew and i wanted to learn how to speak it what a poor effort !	4
1	i just bought and installed this cd with the hopes of learning some haitian creole and i too could n't find it there is absolutely nothing on the installation cd that mentions either haiti or creole except the jewel case which insists it 's there i'm so dissapointed i have n't actually tested anything else out i consider this a very bad start	4
1	imagine that you know so little about a computer that you would n't even be here reading this review these discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded dial yellow wall phone if you are a recent \( one hour ago \) immigrant from a sixth world country and you need to forward the burger king christmas song well then you 're already ahead of these learning cds \( my apologies to grandmothers with corded dial yellow wall phones \) \( actually i kinda wish i had one ! \) regards older but no smarter	4
1	when i first installed the program i was able to access the images but since that first time i have n't my operating system is xp and i do n't know if that is the problem with the software i have since then uninstalled it i did not think this product was very easy to use	4
1	i installed a perfectly legal upgrade of photoshop cs2 it worked fine for a handful of months and then it quit technical support was of no help i had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine i am so frustrated about this i probably spent 100 hours with the data backup moving data reformatting and reinstalling if i were a small business i would be out of business all because this piece of crap program which i purchased legally decided to quit totally unacceptable	4
1	this is the worst version of adobe illustrator to be released since version 9 opens files that i 've been using for years and then writes scribbled unopenable 'saved' versions crashes ca n't save for mysterious reasons writes version 10 files with text split into pieces such a fine product ! really glad i paid money for it ! ! i downgraded back to irritator 10	4
1	this product could put user customer 's life at risk the mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off road this is the worst product that i have used in my life	4
1	there 's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted this is definitely one of the worst products i have ever bought i did not do much research i think the data may be in there but i could not learn how to make it work the interface is horrific unusable do n't do it	4
1	i was expecting a lot more from these two cd 's it teaches you a few items of food basic words like hello please and airplane and even teaches you to ask where are the suitcases but then that is about it i was really hoping for more much more	4
1	this software did n't quite do what i expected i was somewhat disappointed when i discovered that it would n't convert itunes m4p music files to mp3 files to run on a real player	4
1	did not work with my apple computer requested help but did not get results i wanted which was to return idem get credi	4
1	the computer i have now \( about 500 mhz \) is faster than my last one and the earlier version of plus ! worked well with my older model however my current model ca n't process most of the programs available so i just deleted the whole package i intend to get a faster computer in the near future and will use superpack at that time the features look pretty cool but i ca n't give it a favorable rating at this time however when i see how it would work with a faster processor i may re rate my review	4
1	warning ! i resized my partition and when it restarted my computed could not boot it destroyed my system and i had to format my whole drive read all the reviews from this program carefully i read them but did not believe them	4
1	attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003 bad move none of my access 97 programs work now in fact i i brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions nope the upgrade just did n't work had to purchase a full version to set things right save your money on this product	4
1	why are the newer products getting slower by the version i still love version 5 it does not forever to open up in a web browser update i have been using version 7 now for several months i am glad to say that i am now a lot happier granted it still uses a lot of memory however the new features that it has compared to version 5 makes the upgrade worthwhile however watch out there are several features that adobe took out from the standard version and only has on the pro version	4
1	i am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4 0 is a downgrade from 3 0 performance is very poor especially the organizer it 's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are such as mac iphoto and even the canon software that came with my camera compared to elements recently i 've been getting lots of crashes though everything else on my system is completely stable the only reason i gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality when it works correctly	4
1	junk ! i am a professional photographer and have used 2 0 for years for quick fixes and easy additions thinking they might have made some improvements to make life easier i was wrong this program is a step back i was a refund ! i do n't know who is writing they like this new version but buyer beware ! laur	4
1	crashed the system every time i tried to use it gave me such a headache i tossed it in the trash	4
1	if you use microsoft office \( word excel \) do n't buy it ! links to your previous pdf simply do n't work adobe knows about it but have no viable work around stick with prevous versions	4
1	obviously bogus reviews version 6 was slow as a dog so any improvement will make this more interesting of course rasing the price to 300 and 450 is less interesting what about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5 \? how bout tossing us all a bone	4
1	first of all the many samples i viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles there are far fewer images than the number touted this is a scam in my opinion but a situation i could live with but the major issue is that most of the photo images i have searched for my actual use have very poor actually totally unusable resolution they have corrupted clarity poor pixel quality are distorted and unsuitable except for perhaps a third grader 's school project it was a complete waste of money it is headed for the first garage sale i hold and i will offer it for 50 cents with a non return policy	4
1	this product is very nice when it works however i'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me when i attempt to export the image either by saving draging or copying hemera places a transparency over the object making the product worthless i gave it two stars because for the two months it worked it worked well however now it wo n't work at all and as the other reviewer stated support is nearly non existant	4
1	i bought this product after reading the other on line reviews saying how easy it was to use i am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy ! it was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke ! i would n't recommend this product to anyone unless you 're a professional architect computer genius	4
1	this program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details i'm only using it for a simple garage and i expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions not so you might as well pick up a copy of the sims so you could at least have some fun with it if you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it forget it very disappointing waste of money	4
1	1 you ca n't print on anything over 8 5x14 paper useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale 2 i bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3 0 of broderbund 3d home architect it turns out that this is exactly the same software ! i strongly recommend looking for something better	4
1	i was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool but ended up disappointed they definately oversell it as an interior design tool looking at the brochure online i really think they must have touched up the images because i do n't see any way that they could have created them with this product as a matter of fact the website punch interior design software package implies that they did just that the reason i do n't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great i wish all software had that	4
1	this computer system although almost universally accepted can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free such as the fedora project \( a distribution of linux a os which can be changed by anyone for free \) or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around 50 \( 90 \) or less	4
1	the mac os 129 list often cheaper does n't get viruses worms malware etc and probably runs all the software you do on a pc with the exception of some games go to a mac store and try it for yourself	4
1	sorry to disappoint the believers but this os is way overpriced for what it does and it will dominate you instead of the converse	4
1	this is microsoft 's most stable os yet but ridiculously over priced i 'll admit i'm no fan of microsoft but i 've very few problems with my desktop once i upgraded from windows me	4
1	they sent me a product that was n't legit and would n't take it back horrible service i do n't recommend anyone buy from this particular vendor ! just a horrible waste of time money	4
1	i received the package and read the instructions in retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well it did not my installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless i had to take it to a professional to get it going even so i have had problems with internet explorer stopping suddenly bsod 's this is not a job for the average computer user	4
1	the title of this product is a joke it should be called not easy cd burning roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is it is way too complicated for burning simple cds	4
1	first of all this software performs like someones term project why havent these guys been sued yet \? pros nice retail packagingcons not testeddoesnt burn all your filesno supportoverall a waste of moner	4
1	i recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive \( hl dt st rw dvd gcc 4482b \( 1 00 \) i have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times no response i did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to roxio needless to say i am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software i have a new gateway desktop that came with the above drive	4
1	i found this program simple easy to operate however when creating a dvd project i used a narration for my audio the narration matched each picture perfectly when i decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off do not count on any tech support they offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all you have the option of forking over 35 per incident in order to get a real live person on the phone but it still does not guarantee it will help and now i'm not even able to burn it ! ! ! ! i hate this program	4
1	i used easy creator 4 for years bought new computers so bought easy creator 6 it will not work on 2 e machines with xp it wipes out cd rom drive so that it is unusable i requested tech support 6 12 06 it 's 7 15 06 and i am still waiting i uninstalled it i found easy creator 5 platinum on amazon and ordered it it works	4
1	this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever first it does n't work second i cannot obtain any support from roxio to find out why they wo n't give support until you register the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software and it takes you to a website that either does n't exist or is always down thus it turns out to be a complete waste of money not to mention several hours of time run do n't walk away from this software and this company	4
1	this product does nothing i put in 30 dvds and vcds and none were able to be copied easy dvd burner if u can actually find a dvd that is able to burn everything is copy protected and i hear that over and over again there is a reason why this product is so cheap because it does nothing at all ! u cant burn dvds you can only take a few files you might already have and burn them on a disk that does not play on a dvd player thats it dont waste you money on this its worthless	4
1	i am very disappointed with this product using the features of it are very difficult \( red eye sizing etc \) in addition digital photos downloaded into photo album 6 are of poor quality clarity on the computer screen i expected more from it but have found i have less i will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features	4
1	i used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album when trial time expired i purchase the full package i could not open the existing album with the new software the new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000 's of templates can not be found use something else ! ! ! i even e mailed corel about this its been 4 days i have not had a response do not buy ! ! ! i rate this produce as a 2 stars	4
1	i do not like software it always hang no matter what i did maybe this is becasue it has not finished the index process \? i had many many photos in my computer	4
1	i spent the last 3 hours trying to get support for this product although the site did not reject me it sent me through loops to get an update that when run errored out as soon as it began	4
1	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4
1	in the last year i have tried this program pc cillin four sharewares from cnet and f za the only one that does n't cause more problems than it solves the others prevent me from doing wireless printing slowdown the computer generate false alarms	4
1	i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security now i regret buying one since ive installed it it slowed my computer its very very hard to close window and worse when i disconnected from the internet i have a hard time logging off everytime im on the internet i get mad and upset its not worth all the stress i definitely dont recommend this product now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to norton	4
1	everything has been said about this product when it 's working you 're happy with my 8 version almost everything was fine with the 10 version it 's a bloody nightmare i'm giving up throwing my dazzle dvc150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my vhs to dvd never pinnacle again	4
1	crashes on every thing i try to do i 've never seen such a poor excuse for a program i paid 70 dollars for it and am now throwing it in the trash	4
1	i used version 8 and 9 and never experienced a problem version 10 latest version is terrible crash and burn do n't take their advice and re install your operating system its their software and not the os amazon and pinnacle \( avid \) continue to sell this product even though its terrible i read it was re written for version 10 and they can't get it right nonetheless they still charge full price and for support calls the upgrade should have been free there are several good products now so pinnacle is n't your only choice i changed to sony vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve for super simple try ulead or one of the others	4
1	i 've been a user of pinnacle version 8 \( which i loved \) and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer dvds what a disappointment this upgrade has been crash after crash what is most disappointing is that pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could help them develop a better product this means to me that they knowingly released bad code and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a 100 guess what i do n't want to help pinnacle build a better product i want a product that works when i purchase it lesson learned next time i read a bad review on a product i'm staying away	4
1	i was very disappointed with this program but i was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases even so the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating i learned more icelandic \( along with correct pronounciations \) while in iceland than i did with this program and besides anyone under the age of 50 in iceland speaks english	4
1	i was charged the full price of 49 95 with no 20 coupon inserted	4
1	i would not buy it ! hard to use my machine runs slower since the install	4
1	an internet search found complaints about not receiving rebates why would they give you something for nothing \? i have had several rebate problems and most of them involved free items or insanely cheap items this free software could cost you 30 if the company decides they do n't want to pay	4
1	i was using vcom systemsuite pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction but after i reconfigured my pc to standard pc the software rejected my serial number claiming i was using the software on another pc i only own one pc technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc 's well that is totally incorrect because like i said i only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house they have a bug in their serial number checking process anyway they would not help me restore the software serial number because i could not furnish proof of purchase they think i am a crook i'm not i only want what i paid for to work	4
1	i agree with others who said it crashes the system overall i found ss6 pro had more problems than it was worth even if it were free it 's not worth all the time and effort besides all the crashes downloading the virus spyware updates via dialup takes forever ! each download runs 1 to 1 1 2 hours be forewarned in the end i returned my copy to vcom though to date i have not yet received a refund	4
1	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word in addtion the micro does n't work well with ms word	4
1	this is the worst thing i have ever bought i bought it because i am having some trouble in spanish in school i bought it thinking that if i gave a english word it would give you the spanish word or vise versa but all it does is give you the definition and does not give you the english word so save your self 20 dollars and do n't buy thi	4
1	although this dictionary 's contents are extensive the screen functions are relics from the dos era they are laborious and clumsy to find a word for difinition it has to be spelled perfectly there 's no list of proximations to the word entered changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor does n't show up in the entry slot if someone knows of a better software i 'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks ! ! maria mcgowan	4
1	the definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good the user interface is quite honestly shameful software companies got away with this years ago but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces \( e g keyboard short cuts are missing \) integration with word 2003 is weak numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow	4
1	i received this item today and was surprised1 \) it was shipped from overseas \( uk \) 2 \) it came with only one cd instead of two like a previous reviewer thought3 \) no paperwork it came in a clear case with no artwork info etc4 \) sonic foundry sold acid to sony in 2003 \( according to sonic foundry 's website \) and sf no longer provides support5 \) i ca n't get this to register online which seems a little dodgy but other than that it seems functional no huge library of loops either ca n't really say i got what i expected	4
1	i 've used cad programs written in the 80 's that are better than this i 'll go back to drawing board 1 0 over this thing not user friendly i can hardly draw a few walls without it crashing jun	4
1	3d home architect is a complete crock i have attempted to use it many times after hours of reading and playing with it i am still unable to perform the most simple task i own v1 3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years i also spent lots of time trading emails with broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and i got nothing so henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned sorry	4
1	talk about junk ! no search capability mislabeled cds some cds wo n't run in short yuk !	4
1	800 000 images without keywords the only useful parts of this collection are the classic and traditional tif 's that you can take into illustrator and turn into vector the high res images are n't the clipart is less than microsoft office online quality and i 've gotten far more use out of a 50 000 image collection b c they took the time to keyword and catagorize the collection if you like to look thru a book and put in one of the 32 disks and then find the image then this collection is for you if you want to have any sort of search capabilites look elsewhere	4
1	i'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product there is no 800 number for tech support so it 's a long distance call i have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person they offer only email support but do n't write back if you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you but it never happens	4
1	this game was a little too hard for my tastes despite the fact that i played at the junior level i managed to get killed shortly after starting out i also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once i left the room i could n't find my way back \( all the corridors look alike \) so far i 've fallen down an elevator shaft gotten caught breaking and entering been crushed by an elevator frozen to death and been hit over the head i 've got to ask is this really appropriate for children	4
1	this software did n't quite do what i expected i was somewhat disappointed when i discovered that it would n't convert itunes m4p music files to mp3 files to run on a real player	4

1	i received the package and read the instructions in retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well it did not my installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless i had to take it to a professional to get it going even so i have had problems with internet explorer stopping suddenly bsod 's this is not a job for the average computer user	4
1	the title of this product is a joke it should be called not easy cd burning roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is it is way too complicated for burning simple cds	4
1	first of all this software performs like someones term project why havent these guys been sued yet \? pros nice retail packagingcons not testeddoesnt burn all your filesno supportoverall a waste of moner	4
1	i recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive \( hl dt st rw dvd gcc 4482b \( 1 00 \) i have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times no response i did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to roxio needless to say i am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software i have a new gateway desktop that came with the above drive	4
1	i found this program simple easy to operate however when creating a dvd project i used a narration for my audio the narration matched each picture perfectly when i decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off do not count on any tech support they offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all you have the option of forking over 35 per incident in order to get a real live person on the phone but it still does not guarantee it will help and now i'm not even able to burn it ! ! ! ! i hate this program	4
1	i used easy creator 4 for years bought new computers so bought easy creator 6 it will not work on 2 e machines with xp it wipes out cd rom drive so that it is unusable i requested tech support 6 12 06 it 's 7 15 06 and i am still waiting i uninstalled it i found easy creator 5 platinum on amazon and ordered it it works	4
1	this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever first it does n't work second i cannot obtain any support from roxio to find out why they wo n't give support until you register the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software and it takes you to a website that either does n't exist or is always down thus it turns out to be a complete waste of money not to mention several hours of time run do n't walk away from this software and this company	4
1	this product does nothing i put in 30 dvds and vcds and none were able to be copied easy dvd burner if u can actually find a dvd that is able to burn everything is copy protected and i hear that over and over again there is a reason why this product is so cheap because it does nothing at all ! u cant burn dvds you can only take a few files you might already have and burn them on a disk that does not play on a dvd player thats it dont waste you money on this its worthless	4
1	i am very disappointed with this product using the features of it are very difficult \( red eye sizing etc \) in addition digital photos downloaded into photo album 6 are of poor quality clarity on the computer screen i expected more from it but have found i have less i will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features	4
1	i used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album when trial time expired i purchase the full package i could not open the existing album with the new software the new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000 's of templates can not be found use something else ! ! ! i even e mailed corel about this its been 4 days i have not had a response do not buy ! ! ! i rate this produce as a 2 stars	4
1	i do not like software it always hang no matter what i did maybe this is becasue it has not finished the index process \? i had many many photos in my computer	4
1	i spent the last 3 hours trying to get support for this product although the site did not reject me it sent me through loops to get an update that when run errored out as soon as it began	4
1	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4
1	my boss asked me to get this so that he check out the latin portion of it what a waste ! the only latin on this cd is latin american spanish the interface was underwhelming i needed to guess at what did what because the controls are mostly icons what 's worse there is no menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program apparently though the manufacturer did throw in an extra not listed on the back if you are learning the differences between us and uk english its there ! i gave this one star only because i could n't give it no stars	4
1	i found this title messing around adding things to my wish list i only read the blurb on amazon enough to see haitian creaole listed as one of the languages today updating my wish list i took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more ! how unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake i almost made buying this in hopes of it having haitian creole ! very disappointing ! ! ! ! the makers should be ashamed	4
1	they have the hebrew backwards ! ! you are supposed to read hebrew right to left the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right i find it extremely confusing i know how to read hebrew and i wanted to learn how to speak it what a poor effort !	4
1	i just bought and installed this cd with the hopes of learning some haitian creole and i too could n't find it there is absolutely nothing on the installation cd that mentions either haiti or creole except the jewel case which insists it 's there i'm so dissapointed i have n't actually tested anything else out i consider this a very bad start	4
1	in the last year i have tried this program pc cillin four sharewares from cnet and f za the only one that does n't cause more problems than it solves the others prevent me from doing wireless printing slowdown the computer generate false alarms	4
1	i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security now i regret buying one since ive installed it it slowed my computer its very very hard to close window and worse when i disconnected from the internet i have a hard time logging off everytime im on the internet i get mad and upset its not worth all the stress i definitely dont recommend this product now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to norton	4
1	everything has been said about this product when it 's working you 're happy with my 8 version almost everything was fine with the 10 version it 's a bloody nightmare i'm giving up throwing my dazzle dvc150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my vhs to dvd never pinnacle again	4
1	crashes on every thing i try to do i 've never seen such a poor excuse for a program i paid 70 dollars for it and am now throwing it in the trash	4
1	i used version 8 and 9 and never experienced a problem version 10 latest version is terrible crash and burn do n't take their advice and re install your operating system its their software and not the os amazon and pinnacle \( avid \) continue to sell this product even though its terrible i read it was re written for version 10 and they can't get it right nonetheless they still charge full price and for support calls the upgrade should have been free there are several good products now so pinnacle is n't your only choice i changed to sony vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve for super simple try ulead or one of the others	4
1	i 've been a user of pinnacle version 8 \( which i loved \) and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer dvds what a disappointment this upgrade has been crash after crash what is most disappointing is that pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could help them develop a better product this means to me that they knowingly released bad code and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a 100 guess what i do n't want to help pinnacle build a better product i want a product that works when i purchase it lesson learned next time i read a bad review on a product i'm staying away	4
1	i was very disappointed with this program but i was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases even so the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating i learned more icelandic \( along with correct pronounciations \) while in iceland than i did with this program and besides anyone under the age of 50 in iceland speaks english	4
1	i was charged the full price of 49 95 with no 20 coupon inserted	4
1	i would not buy it ! hard to use my machine runs slower since the install	4
1	an internet search found complaints about not receiving rebates why would they give you something for nothing \? i have had several rebate problems and most of them involved free items or insanely cheap items this free software could cost you 30 if the company decides they do n't want to pay	4
1	i was using vcom systemsuite pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction but after i reconfigured my pc to standard pc the software rejected my serial number claiming i was using the software on another pc i only own one pc technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc 's well that is totally incorrect because like i said i only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house they have a bug in their serial number checking process anyway they would not help me restore the software serial number because i could not furnish proof of purchase they think i am a crook i'm not i only want what i paid for to work	4
1	i agree with others who said it crashes the system overall i found ss6 pro had more problems than it was worth even if it were free it 's not worth all the time and effort besides all the crashes downloading the virus spyware updates via dialup takes forever ! each download runs 1 to 1 1 2 hours be forewarned in the end i returned my copy to vcom though to date i have not yet received a refund	4
1	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word in addtion the micro does n't work well with ms word	4
1	this is the worst thing i have ever bought i bought it because i am having some trouble in spanish in school i bought it thinking that if i gave a english word it would give you the spanish word or vise versa but all it does is give you the definition and does not give you the english word so save your self 20 dollars and do n't buy thi	4
1	although this dictionary 's contents are extensive the screen functions are relics from the dos era they are laborious and clumsy to find a word for difinition it has to be spelled perfectly there 's no list of proximations to the word entered changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor does n't show up in the entry slot if someone knows of a better software i 'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks ! ! maria mcgowan	4
1	the definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good the user interface is quite honestly shameful software companies got away with this years ago but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces \( e g keyboard short cuts are missing \) integration with word 2003 is weak numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow	4
1	this product could put user customer 's life at risk the mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off road this is the worst product that i have used in my life	4
1	there 's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted this is definitely one of the worst products i have ever bought i did not do much research i think the data may be in there but i could not learn how to make it work the interface is horrific unusable do n't do it	4
1	i was expecting a lot more from these two cd 's it teaches you a few items of food basic words like hello please and airplane and even teaches you to ask where are the suitcases but then that is about it i was really hoping for more much more	4
1	i received this item today and was surprised1 \) it was shipped from overseas \( uk \) 2 \) it came with only one cd instead of two like a previous reviewer thought3 \) no paperwork it came in a clear case with no artwork info etc4 \) sonic foundry sold acid to sony in 2003 \( according to sonic foundry 's website \) and sf no longer provides support5 \) i ca n't get this to register online which seems a little dodgy but other than that it seems functional no huge library of loops either ca n't really say i got what i expected	4
1	i 've used cad programs written in the 80 's that are better than this i 'll go back to drawing board 1 0 over this thing not user friendly i can hardly draw a few walls without it crashing jun	4
1	3d home architect is a complete crock i have attempted to use it many times after hours of reading and playing with it i am still unable to perform the most simple task i own v1 3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years i also spent lots of time trading emails with broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and i got nothing so henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned sorry	4
1	talk about junk ! no search capability mislabeled cds some cds wo n't run in short yuk !	4
1	800 000 images without keywords the only useful parts of this collection are the classic and traditional tif 's that you can take into illustrator and turn into vector the high res images are n't the clipart is less than microsoft office online quality and i 've gotten far more use out of a 50 000 image collection b c they took the time to keyword and catagorize the collection if you like to look thru a book and put in one of the 32 disks and then find the image then this collection is for you if you want to have any sort of search capabilites look elsewhere	4
1	i'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product there is no 800 number for tech support so it 's a long distance call i have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person they offer only email support but do n't write back if you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you but it never happens	4
1	this game was a little too hard for my tastes despite the fact that i played at the junior level i managed to get killed shortly after starting out i also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once i left the room i could n't find my way back \( all the corridors look alike \) so far i 've fallen down an elevator shaft gotten caught breaking and entering been crushed by an elevator frozen to death and been hit over the head i 've got to ask is this really appropriate for children	4
1	my desktop cd rom refused to recognize that the cd was in the tray it did recognize other cds my desktop is a hp pavilion 2000 with windows xp homeversion my laptop did accept the cd so i know that it is not the cd i purchased the product for use on my desktop not the laptop i would appreciate instructions on fixing the problem	4
1	this software is useless it is a slow and a system resource hog you can download dozens of free apps that do a better job than this for free	4
1	i wanted a simple product with a good red eye removal tool this program does not do well with fixing red eye software did not come with a manual i am computer literate yet i found this software not easy to navigate i found hp essentials which is a free download from the hp website to be a better program	4
1	i tried unsuccessfully several times to install it i contact their alleged support they sent me what they deemed a fix the fix was awful it caused my computer to crash and print shop would never work broderbund used to be a good company but i 've had nothing but problems with their software of late they need to rethink their products their support and their company focus they are lousy at this point they obviously do n't give a dang about quality support or their customers	4
1	do not order this tech support from broderbund is basically non existant one sorry product	4
1	on the front of the box it says it can be used for professional photo editing and has 20 000 professionally designed projects when i received the box it had a disclaimer that the photos cannot be used for products for re sale i purchased this product to do a work at home video and spent all morning evaluating the different software 's and now i find out it is totally worthless to me i went to there website and it says allow 4 6 weeks for a refund ! i am going to turn them into the ftc for false advertisement	4
1	if you own a newer dvd camcorder that is manufactured by panasonic hitachi and others that records your movies in a vro format you can not use this product you will have to buy an additional program that will cost about 40 to convert the vro format to a avi wav or mpeg format if you own a camcorder that records in vro do some research before you waste 80 on this program	4
1	this is a very capable program that has too many nuances for just a simple dvd burn it is far to complex definitely for the advanced user i am sorry that i spent the money	4
1	i really thought that office was better proir to the whole xp upgrade but that i will leave to other discussions this product is your standard microsoft office products i am fairly sure that most have experienced their products there are no surprises and the added bells and whistles are n't worth the upgrade unless your are a vba programmer now having gone through all of this i do not rcommend that you purchase this product but purchase the student version same product hugely different price	4
1	font manager is not user friendly there is no logical indexing or grouping of fonts user is forced to hunt and peck	4
1	tough to upgrade if you have an earlier version on your machine also poor layout of controls make clicking on wrong button really easy they still have not gotten it right	4
1	nsw 2007 \( or 2006 \) premiere is useless when it comes to vista and considering it comes pre packaged with every pc known to man \( desktop or laptop \) this is unforgiveable norton av has an update but that is a far cry from the 100 price of systemworks that must be uninstalled according to ms vista maybe with the 2008 versiontruth be known system works has saved my azz a number of time since the 2003 version but now it is useless	4
1	systemworks continues to grow taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer and i'm likely to buy an alternative next time i update note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer a new hard drive motherboard or processor and symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy i like the basic functions but there 's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore	4
1	this is a terrible suite read the fine print very carefully it will not work on raid configurations of any kind it will tell you that in the install \( thanks a lot kinda late \? \) i found its support on recovery disc of usb hardware unstable this is a very unstable even errant set of programs it also tries to take over a lot of system elements	4
1	i 've a norton user for many years i 'upgraded \? ' from nav 2005 this product was a pain to install i had to uninstall zone alarm which is n't noted anywhere i 've never had to do that before the installation process required rebooting multiple times in the past it had been an easy process not anymore ! i will not buy norton in the future	4
1	while installing norton antivirus 2007 xp a norton message flashed that i must delete webroot for msn i did it and it resulted in crashing the session tried first the paying phone support and gave up after 2 hrs wait then ried the online chat the wait went on for 9hrs started 245 in the queue and by now in lline at 59 i realized this was not the norton i 'd used for so many years i ordered kapersky anti virus	4
1	i tried to like this product as previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations if you only need a 2d floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less the object libraries that come with the tool furniture fabrics etc are really lame this limits it 's value as an interior design tool i did not attempt to return it so i cannot comment on their return policy	4
1	this lame program is completely limiting you can not even type in your own text you are supposed to use the few quotes they want you to use it is not at all user friendly either i am so sorry i purchased this	4
1	this is a good product except it keeps shutting down when i have my outlook or when i have a web page open my main goal for an antivirus would be to run when i search the web or get in new emails ! what good is it if it shuts down when these are open ! it did find a trojan on my first scan this was one that norton missed i will be getting nod32 soon sorry this product did not work for me ! it was very easy to use	4
1	this software does not provide even the basic red eye fix it turns them a light shade of grey maybe it is horrible this to me renders it useless it is for the most basic of users there are no real manual functions to speak of and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it it has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly i would say do not buy seller was great product is poor	4
1	it is n't very user friendly i have other software that is much easier \( adobe photo shop \) this one will take some time and effort to get used to and work with	4
1	on install the 1st problem encountered was that it replaced my pictures folder with another containing only sample picture yep it took out a folder on install with no request or user action to do so regardless of how it works as an image editor such behaviour precludes its further use this program seems to be unsupported by microsoft least their support site wo n't let you mail them on it so when it does hack up your file structure so program cost me 15 recovery effort on pictures over 50 just wonderful	4
1	after using this product for mac for over 10 years i'm done the price keeps going up the tax help within in the program keeps diminishing and the customer service is almost non existent the server meltdown this year was the last straw their servers were n't too busy to let me pay to efile but apparently they were surprised by the number of people that they allowed to pay for their service baloney i 'll use a pencil and paper next year before i give intuit another 100	4
1	turbo tax is less than impressive in handling stock and option transactions it seems to view short sales as errors reporting that the date acquired is later than the date sold it does not appear to have a provision for tagging a short sale it does not appear to have a provision for properly dealing with dividends on stock held for more than 12 months but covered by disqualifying call options its screens for schedule d and d1 are awkward it would be much better to have one large table screen for all transactions with tags to set short term and long term tax application from which d and d1 could be formatted for filing	4
1	both versions of scansoft cause my installer to have problems mainly it tries to re install softscan every time i start up softscan also it has started to try and reinstall softscan if i try to right click on a jpg there is very little to no chance of getting any help from scansoft \( nuance \) to debug this problem save your money and buy some thing else	4
1	omnipage is a buggy piece of software which is prone to throwing errors and mysterious crashes \( often occuring at the end of a lengthy process \) nuance provides no support and when you attempt to contact them they want 9 95 for an email question or 19 95 for a phone question you might expect this from an inexpensive piece of software but for the cost of omnipage you would expect some support i recommend finding something more reliable from a company that provides some measure of support	4
1	the real headache began when i attempted to activate the program i spent hours trying to activate it to no avail i got messages saying that the serial number was invalid and a host of other problems now i would just like to get my money back i have used scansoft 's stuff in the past and have been pleased with it but for whatever reason omnipage 15 has become for me an expensive nightmare after having spent many hours trying to activate it i still have not succeeded their support leaves a lot to be desired for one thing they keep bankers hours so do n't expect to get any help on the weekend or after hours	4
1	i 've been using a mac for the last 10 years and i had assumed that windows had gotten better since win 94 boy was i wrong it amazes me that the entire world runs on this awful excuse for an os	4
1	i brought microsoft windows xp home ed sp2 to use on my mac bookpro as a guest o s the software works fine on my mac bookpro the only downside was as soon as it was installed i had to update the software with 98 security updates for the software to be new right out of the box it took up a lot of space on my harddrive with the security updates and the updates on my mac bookpro have only been 6 since the day i brought my computer compare the difference in updates to see which software has a lot of problems	4
1	i had to work with a pc and windows because of my profession architect my firms have always used architectural desktop unfortunately it only is compatible with a pc now ! ! finally i purchased an exquisite imac and when need be i can run architectural desktop on it in windows to get a few things done apple vs pc \? no comparison and my imac is so sexy it makes me smile so kill me	4
1	other than the substandard security the endless hours you will spend trying to clean out spyware protecting against viruses etc and the fact that microsoft has built in it 's own spyware to notify them when you are connected to the internet it 's pretty good it is a good evolution of their graphical interface and quite intuitive if you are concerned about your ability or willingness to protect yourself against malicious attack from internet scumbags buy a mac as you face the upgrade to ms vista you 're going to need to upgrade your cpu so you are essentially at a crossroads good luck	4
1	rip off rip off rip off rip off rip off rip offmicrosoft windows is a joke we are all out to steel them bland we pay 200 for what \? to be belittle when we have to reinstall it i have 5 comp and i have 5 boxes of microsoft windows xp home edition full version with sp2 one for each pc over 1000 \)	4
1	while i am sure the product does what it offers this is the second version of elemeents that i have not been able to load on my computer that 's where the fun begins adobe 's support is dreadful their website is unusuable other than constantly trying to sell you additional products and services and they have no human support on weekends	4
1	i have usedphotoshop 7 and likedit i beleive adobe has made the photoshopelements 5 unnecessarily cumbersome in termsof downloading saving etc	4
1	i bought adobe elements 5 0 because i thought it had more features than microsoft digital image suite and it probably does getting the adobe software to work is the trick i even bought two books to help me learn how to use adobe and i still ca n't get it to work right i should have stuck with microsoft it is much easier to use	4
1	it 's just too complex compared to print shop 21 and as far as i can tell it has very few added features ray gawronsk	4
1	we purchased this to make sure we did n't miss anything re stock options the program kept including a ghost set of options of a different type though they were not entered twice it took me quite sometime to get them deleted it also said we had to pay estimated tax next year which is n't true since we overpaid \( as we have always done \) too many errors for a tax program	4
1	this is among the most disappointing symantec products ! ! ! when one tries to log in to the infovault the login box is often empty ! there is no way to submit the information it is also impossible to get a straight answer from customer service bring back the old product please ! ! ! ! have been a norton customer for years this one is just not great ! !	4
1	norton old password manager worked much better it is a pain to use especially if you use the same password for serveral different websites after using it for a couple of weeks most of the time not working properly the final straw was that it suddenly stopped recognizing my infovault password several emails to norton and nothing but worthless repsonses hours wasted trying to get help from their website ! even when i just wanted to know if i unstalled the product would password manager still work no response	4
1	this is a terrible product i could not even load the program onto my machine i had the same 2006 version and had no trouble loading that one i sent the product back and requested a refund to my credit card i cannot recommend this product and if you take a chance and order it i hope that you have better luck then i did	4
1	this product caused my ie 7 browser to hang just about every time i used it it causes internet pages to load very slow this product scans every internet page before it will load the page many of the features that this product boasts come standard and free with the new ie 7 \( such as phishing protection \) this product is not compatible if you use norton system works	4
1	i purchased this updated version 1 5 07 it does not print correctly and technical support assured me that the developer is working on the problem and a fix is soon to come this is march 1 and no update is available yet this program is un usable and i am very unhappy and would not recommend as is to anyone i have the 2005 edition and was very pleased with it this is a large embarrassment to the hallmark company	4
1	i hate to be rude but i have been building with frontpage 2002 for years it has so many templates and features but i thought it was time for an upgrade i am thankful that the original frontpage is still running on my laptop or i do n't think my latest sites would be up yet sorry i do n't mean to be mean it may be like other programs that you can get training or have to take a class to do the things that frontpages just does automatically i'm sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade i do n't know	4
1	there is no excuse for norton not advising of the incompatibility of this antivirus software with popular firewalls such as zonealarm before installing the software especially since previous versions have been compatible once opened returning the product can be a problem perhaps that it what norton is counting on	4
1	i 've been a loyal norton anti virus utilities software customer since the stone age but like several other reviewers i'm deeply disappointed that norton internet security 2007 is incompatible with zonealarm pro sunbelt counterspy and microsoft antispyware and even more deeply disappointed that i had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out once upon a time norton was the epitome of well designed thoughtful customer centric software but they 've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well established name i 'll be returning symantec 's software if i can and buying zonealarm 's a v package instead	4
1	when i tried to upgrade from 2004 to 2005 i ran into a problem because i did n't have flash 7 0 installed actually i had a later version of flash \( 9 04 \) but of course quickbooks could n't handle that here 's the fix go to the adobe site and download the uninstall program from them uninstall your flash player and then quickbooks will then proceed good luck jo	4
1	i bought this software at the recommendation of my accountant well after trying to use it for two years now i'm ready to burn it it 's a great software for people who do their business by the projects but it 's not good for retail sales everything has been a hassel especially trying to set up the daily sales so i can record detailed inventory of my daily sales yes i noticed they did come out w a new version for specifically for retail sales after i already invested in 300 in software and 100 in books just trying to learn this system what a waste !	4
1	what a bunch of money grabbing idiots ! if you are considering buying quickbooks don't ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i have never had such a horrible experience with a product they take features away especially with payroll if you do not buy their products then when you call to ask what is going on they tell you that you have not purchased their support program and that they cannot help you ! ! i hate quick books their is nothing quick about it and the so called support staff are a bunch of liars ! !	4
1	i have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money every other page is a sales page and after paying 300 plus for the application and another 200 for the payroll now i have to pay if i want their help it is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money no longer has anything to do with their customers and this customer will not be one next year	4
1	purchased this software because i got a deal with a special price break i have a very small business so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly the set up took a lot longer than i had anticipated the customer service was no help could n't answer my questions i ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right another day wasted i 've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since i 've spent the money but i'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime if this is quick books i need to find lightning fast books somewhere	4
1	i'm still waiting amazon says this item usually ships within 24 hours i ordered on oct 27 its now nov 8 and it still has n't shipped where is it	4
1	no technical support that's worth anything ! program does not work properly ! very user unfriendly ! otherwise i wish i would not have purchased it ! need something the average computer nut can use effectively	4
1	what a terrible upgrade i'm going to uninstall it and go back to 6 even though i specifically told it to leave my file associations alone it changed every one of them it 's a nightmare i'm still trying to get nero disassociated with certain file types to no avail the backup program is awful slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into 6 overall ultra 6 is a much better product i'm going to uninstall 7 and send it back to nero with instructions on where they can associate it	4
1	great software ! until you have a question or a problem that is then you get the run around big time ! zonealarm says they did n't sell it to me so they ca n't help me they send me to broderbund for help broderbund then sends me to encore for help and they wo n't help me either zonealarm states if i did n't buy it right from zonealarm then they do n't give any support it comes in a zonealarm box says zonealarm on the cd but apparently it is n't zonealarm \? \? \? \( according to zonealarm that is \) ! ! buy it elsewhere or end up helpless ! ! !	4
1	i have used the zonlabs firewall for several years it works fine i can not say the same for the security suite the antispam function does not update definitions and zonelabs tech support know they have a problem they are working on it but no date for a fix do not buy this software until all the bugs are fixed	4
1	i do not have any recolection of purchasing this product nor can i find it on my computer or in any of my hard non computer files i have always ordered a hard disk back up of all purchases from zone alarm there is no hard disk no computer file i am about to raise you know what about this charge on my credit card i will challenge it if i do not receive for what i am being charged i will also ask my credit card co for a new number to prevent future charges from these folks in the future i will use a third party encryted method for purchases on the internet rehadik netscape	4
1	i was reading the high reviews of zonealarm so i went to their web site to get more information and only about 2 pages of their entire web site would even show up makes me wonder how hard it will be to get tech support from them going back to panda	4
1	it 's been 10 days since i registered with zone alarm and i still have n't received the license key i wrote many emails and called customer service and i got no help or solution think twice before purchasing this product	4
1	i really like the rosetta stone product \( although it is over priced \) warning rosetta stone \( fairfield language technologies \) will not replace a cd if it is lost stolen or damaged unless you bought the product directly from them \( and then they charge you 30 for a replacement cd \) i had the misfortune of purchasing from a local bookstore and someone had stolen the disk from inside the package in this case i can get my money back from the store i bought it from but since you ca n't backup the disks you had better be very careful to not lose one	4
1	i 've used the past few versions of acrobat and this one is a disappointment navigation is a pain instead of the familiar window and arrows at the bottom of a page adobe 's engineers have moved navigation to the top of the page and have only a single arrow the whole look and feel is most unmac like more like a windows application i suppose if i wanted to take the time and energy to study the user manual i would find the application friendlier but i do n't expect to have to re learn to use an application when i upgrade if you 're thinking of upgrading my advice is do n't	4
1	i upgraded from wordperfect office 12 to x3 but have returned the upgrade to wordperfect the much touted ability to import pdf files is so poorly implemented that it is all but unusable in addition the wordperfect mail component will not load data files while my antivirus \( zonealarm \) is running in the background corel technical support takes no responsibility for the incompatability do not upgrade unless these issues are addressed	4
1	generally like the program hoped it came with a cd to practice in the car but was wrong it is totally pc based i 'll let you know in about three months if i can actually conduct business in deutsch	4
1	i have many \( too many \) rosetta stone softwares for language learning however after purchasing tell me more software i will never go back to rosetta stone it is true that you can learn a lot of vocabulary with rosetta 's program but that is about it ! rosetta 's software is very illogical ! honestly do not waste your time and money with this program check tell me more and you will be amazed	4
1	quickbooks sunsetted my previous version forcing me to buy this horriblle buggy software it lacks many of the features that i liked from my previous version \( 2003 \) runs much slower uses 10 times as much memory and is full of bugs i regularly need to run windows system restore when all of my company data disappears avoid this product at all costs time that i used to spend on more important business functions is now spent trying to get this crappy software to work i have used quickbooks for 12 years and 4 editions but this will be my last intuit product i wish i could give it 0 stars	4
1	this is a great programme with windows xp but be aware that it conflicts with vista the latest version of windows an upgrade is recommended by nuance the manufacturer to omnipage at double the cost of textbridge	4
1	i purchased this program with the intention of entering a bunch of typewritten pages into my computer the document that this program produced from newly typed material was so full of errors that i simply had to re type it would have taken longer to correct than to re type when i talked to textbridge about these problems all they would tell me is that the program was not meant for such use and that i should buy one of their other programs which had good optical character recognition capabilities in other words they know the product is not any good and they are not willing to stand behind it the program is useless for optical character recognition work or anything else	4
1	this product simply does not produce accurate results it skips entire lines words on the same line and misreads even the most legible characters it came bundled with my scanner so at least i did not waste my money on it do n't waste yours	4
1	i have been a faithful mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids this game is a big disappointment the language game is virtually unplayable in french i am fluent in french and went to a french language university for nine years i could barely understand what the characters were saying if this program is intended to teach kids a second language it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead this game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of french	4
1	after over a year and a half including renewing for updates i 've now discarded norton sw 2006 it was problamatic and a waste of money it conflicts with partition magic another symantec product and will not work with many ms updates my system is now operating trouble free since i 've uninstalled nsw previously my computer was eratic and crashed frquently	4
1	picassa part of the google suite of programs is both better than this program and free ! what more do i need to add \? the user interface of picassa is easier to use and more responsive	4
1	despite generally good experiences with microsoft products windows live onecare seems to have resulted in very poor performance on a brand new lenovo pc running windows xp i removed it and performance has improved back to where it was now running mcafee for virus scanning etc	4
1	this is a simple drawing program much like paint do n't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover it only does black and white and it has no help in drawing manga figures and it is a stripped down program at that the documentation is for the full program so you ca n't do much of what you read in the manual and help files save your money this program is n't worth buying	4
1	before using colorvision spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free adobe gamma program installed as part of adobe photoshop my monitor looked great and the photos i printed looked great too the colors were spot on after using spyder2 express my monitor looks worse my monitor appears dim the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull if i had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor i would n't have wasted my time my hope was that it would make my monitor look better not worse i am not at all satisfied with this product would n't recommend buying it instead try adobe gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online	4
1	i had some difficulty with the product loading the default profile then the product asked later for a re input of the serial number which i no longer had no big deal contact customer service right \? contacted customer service via email once got no response sent a second email and got a response asking a follow up question since then nothing no response nada all follow ups ignored perhaps this product will work for you but for me it ultimately went into the trash because of colorvision 's refusal to respond do n't support this product they wo n't support you	4
1	the product is so so there are others that do the same thing for a bit less but colorvision thinks it owns the worlds so when it comes o support you are screwed between putting you on hold for ever not calling back etc	4
1	worked okay until i installed xp service pack 2 now i can no longer scan using my brother mfc 9700 and paperport 9 it has been a long time since service pack 2 was released and scansoft has left everyone who bought paperport 9 in the cold i could not care less if they now come up with software that is compatible with sp2 this kind of treatment of customers makes it clear that they do not deserve our business do n't take my word for it google the issue and you 'll find out that there are a lot of dissatisfied customers from now on i 'll avoid scansoft	4
1	this is the stupidest game i ever saw for sale my kids laughed at how poorly the graphics and story were what a complete waste	4
1	i agree with reviewer mr dietz i was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on amazon for 24 99 put it in and loaded it in this game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all no help menu either we wasted at least 2 hours on it before i ejected it and apologized to her there is nothing here to learn chess from	4
1	i was looking for an intructional cd to help my daughter to learn chess i read the reviews and endorsements and thought that this was what i was looking for wrong ! first of all the cd comes with no instruction book and you 're left to try and figure out what you 're supposed to do by yourself \( good luck \) i 've spent over 2 hours on this thing so far and i still have n't seen one thing that would help my daughter to learn to play chess i 've emailed their 'help line' hoping to get some answers and never heard back from them save your money and your sanity and do n't buy this cd	4
1	the product was easy to install but there was a trick i noticed a day after installing the software i ran full scan to try the sincerity of the software i downloaded same free trial to my chagrin i was told my computer has about 420 problems and could only fix about 15 my question now is are all these gimmicks	4
1	i am a software tech i first free trial v6 online 1 finds 131 errors but will only fix 4 \( must buy full version ! \) sheesh ! 2 buy full version with 20 off coupon \( 3 computer lic for only 9 95 more their web site \) 3 does not remove left overs from old uninstalled pgms \( fix it utilities 6 safely did read my review \) 4 then they only support updates for 1 year auto renew ! rip off ! i got a refund and will never use them again	4
1	be warned this product does not support all advertised features on all phones right out of the box i found it did not support 2 of our 4 cell phones of the phones that it did support the only sync features available were photo downloading and calendar sync the ability to transfer other data such as movies contacts and ring tones were not available for my particular phone without all of the advertised features are available i consider this a complete waste of money	4
1	it will not work in my windows xp i have repeatedly asked for help no one answers finally i was told to look it up on a databank if you have nothing but time on your hands maybe this is for you but if you work for a living you 've been had by this company encoreusa	4
1	we were big fans of taxcut especially after turbo added spyware this year's tax cut has irreguarities that are costing \( \) me for example you file your college student 's return and check the box that she he will be an exemption on the head of household return then comes the surprise head of household ca n't file their return with that college student as an exemption despite checking the proper boxes ! for example it ca n't caluculate railroad retirement benefits for example it tells you that your return is a okay you pay 15 then it tells you afterward that of the glitches and wants another 15 to refile ! good bye tax cut !	4
1	two weeks ago i attempted to do my taxes on this software however it could n't complete the hybrid car tax credit portion so i could file i had two weeks until the update was available i downloaded it just now and entered the new questions regarding the hybrid and was told i had a credit of 3 100 however it never added this number to my total tax credits all customer support could come up with was start over from scratch do n't even import your information from last year 's taxcut never again	4
1	i have thought well of every operating system since dos 3 1 this is without a doubt the worst system i have ever seen not only is it not graphicaly intuitive it is incompatible with most all of my 32 bit software trying to use quicken will crash the computer it is going to cost a bundle to upgrade all of a person 's softwarein order to use vista the only thing you will get out of running vista is a lot of headaches	4
1	i had a problem at the end of the process in that the program indicated no errors but when you went to print the return the message stated that there were errors on the return i contacted turbo tax directly but they had no explanation they simply said that they had received a couple of calls about this problem that was it	4
1	turbo tax is fine the linking into quickbooks pro \( qbp \) is limited to only the most recent 2 versions of qbp so if you have an older version \( older than 2005 \) you have to buy the new qbp to have turbo tax lift the data out of qb now intuit will only sell a new version of 2007 no more ungrades for the consumer they will tell you bs i will be changing accounting platforms as soon as i can find a replacement this is the problem with software oligolopies ! an open source replacement is much needed for both tax prep and accounting	4
1	this might be the greatest mapping program in existance but i would never know very user unfriendly there is no instruction book provided with it \( or available that i can find \) the help function is very poor and does n't provide adequate instructions if you just need basic mapping functions save your money and use one of the free online websites	4
1	the benefits may be great but the exercises are so boring that it is way too much effort to do them on a regular basis	4
1	comment made by the user after about 30 minutes begged me never to make him use it again	4
1	although it says that this works for all versions of photoshop it does not upgrade from photoshop elements i spoke with customer service and they would not give me the code to unlock it	4
1	turbotax is okay if you only have a 1040a to file but anything beyond that it quickly becomes a real pain in the nether region not only that but if you have complications with trying to file good luck it looks as though i will have to pay to have my estate taxes filed ttax is worthless	4
1	you can bet those people gaving vista a good rating here work for the company it 's a piece of junk if you have a good working xp or anything else please do n't buy vista i bought it a month ago already installed on a good hp computer i 've worked on it from sun up to sun down for a month and still all i 've got is a pile of junk and it 's so slow that you have to take a coffee break while it 's gathering up a program to run do n't buy their one care either i 've owned windows since 98 i'm considering re installing my old hp xp it 's still here in the closet	4
1	this was horrible i installed this and within a 24 hour period i was slammed with pop ups and spam and good luck trying to remove it very dissatisfied customer	4
1	i just bought this yesterday and though the product description here on amazon says it 's compatible with windows 98 and windows me the packaging says taxcut usb drive is compatible with windows 2000 and windows xp all our taxes for several years have been done on a windows me computer with a usb port now what \? help !	4
1	the system requirements for this product on their packaging says nothing about mac support and requires windows h r block did n't support mac 's last year and they 've only given half hearted support this year if you own a mac then turbotax is your best bet	4
1	i worked hard on a vcd project for work using photo explosion i did n't think it was that easy to use but it was okay until i got ready to burn got a little error message that said something along the lines of you do n't have nero burners ! no kidding but there are four other burn programs on my computer nothing but nero would do nowhere on the box are you informed of this it says and i quote burn cd slideshows you can watch on tv ! needing more software is never mentioned as far as i'm concerned this product makes fraudulent claims i will never buy another one of their products	4
1	very limited photo touch up when it comes time to burn you might as well have customer service on the phone pretty much a total piece of crap ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4
1	this is the worst company i have ever dealt with they offer 30 day trial on this product i was n't happy and mailed it back to them in 5 days of purchase and i'm still waiting for the refund i have called them 3 times it has been almost 4 months now without a refund i would never buy a nova product from this company again and i would recomend everyone going somewhere else to get good customer service	4
1	this software messed up my computer big time it does something first of all to microsoft word word does not work properly after installation of photo explosion it then went into different areas of my computer and screwed it up at first i only suspected it to be photo explosion i had to have my computer sent back to hp when i got it back i reinstalled photo explosion and the same thing happenend be careful product has big problems which will give you bigger problems i guarantee it	4
1	the editing portion of the software is completly separate from the cd portion of the software and does not store in the same file cd 's can hold upto approx 500 photos but the softwware will not accept more and allow you to discard down to burn 500 i was told by nova development that the merging of photo shows was not being supported by the company since the cd writer was a free add on to the program the box and program info did not indicate that i offered to purchase the full program but it is not available anywhere	4
1	lacks transitions between slides of digital pictures makes the slideshow somewhat flat one good thing can put music and also is quite fast in creating a vc	4
1	having just paid for this product i expected the word processing component to have at least the basics wrong to me the ability to easily format a business or legal document with page x of y at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental well works 8 5 unlike other microsoft word processor versions or programs does not provide that choice without this basic a feature you might as well simply use wordpad i cannot comment on other abilities this program has or does n't have or on the spreadsheet or database modules because i simply do n't want to spend any more time on this recommendation go to openoffice org and get open office for free	4
1	after installing this software in to my pc some functions of my keyboard stopped working even some multimedia buttons disappeared after that i had to concatct hp to download drivers again even after installing the drivers it did not start working as beore till i uninstalled this third rate software from my pc after uninstalling every thing got fine i will not recommand this soft ware to any one	4
1	the program crashed during setup when i finally got it installed it crashed my machine every night until i uninstalled it	4
1	found the registration number difficult to read had to have customer service tell me that they run into this all the time ! the i 's look like 1 's tried it again ! i got it to load my computer slowed down significantly ! certain sites i could not access anymore without re configuring the software i have used norton mcaffee or whatever and other suite type security software this one was the worst i would not recommend it i got a well deserved refund	4
1	i was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free the manufacturer computer associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too as for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl after a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed	4
1	i purchased this program for my personal and home business tax return but it did not include all the forms needed so i had to buy another version from them h r taxcut included all i needed and was 1 2 the price	4
1	this was the most user unfriendly turbotax i have ever used the schedule c imported misinformation had to keep forcing in the correct info and i just found out my state taxes were received showing i owed a completely different amount than what i had electronically filed i have used this program for years but after this never again ! ! ! let this be a warning to others	4
1	i had the exact same experience as another reviewer loved it for years changed formats no confidence at the last minute i had to use an accountant the accountant cost me 650 00 50 more than what i was over paying in taxes using this software a disaster it does n't look like it was importing data correctly state navigation really was painful i buy this software to try different senerios \( joint or single \) but this year it would n't do that probably because they worry too much about getting paid for every user and not enough to assist people who bought the software to my mind the software is crippled	4
1	if i could give less than 1 star for any trend micro product i would it gives too many false positives when you do n't even have a virus you are going nuts trying to find where the virus is and there is not even one there as trend told you there was avoid this like the plague and save your hard earned money it 's a piece of crap	4
1	my subscription is expiring in a few days and this suite is impossible to renew they are trying to force you into 2006 security suite for the big bucks and buggy software 2005 works fine until i have been thru the runaround 3 times with e mail customer support i wo n't pay for their telephone customer support trend micro will force me to buy another brand because of this shame on you pcillin	4
1	when i click the update components i'm continually told that the feature is still initializing please try again later this will happen even if i 've had the program open for hours i 've contacted trend micro followed their instructions for a workaround but that still did n't help	4
1	so far we have been unable to use this product in the way we want to use it we contacted tech support but after one call we will be charged 19 95 for each call i have been disappointed in the product and the company	4
1	very awesome program for adults and chidren lots of information on the kids encarta my son is in first grade and he needed to find some information on money from around the world he did it all himself	4
1	i 'd be happy to write a review if i could ever get a working copy of this program three different computers and not one would the disc install on	4
1	this software only got one star because i couldnt give it a zero it never worked on my windows xp computer i couldnt open the program couldnt close it couldnt get the sytem to shut down after a hard shutdown windows would not start tech support couldnt figure out the problem i uninstalled panda reinstalled norton and system is working fine i would not recommend	4
1	this is the worst thing since the office assistant animated paper clip forcing the ribbon on the user assumes that the user likes icons \( i do n't what 's wrong with words \? \? \) and fills too much of the screen real estate nothing is where it should be and what arrogance on the part of microsoft to provide no alternate views no classic view just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons another oppressive giant waste of my time and money at the hands of microsoft	4
1	i bought the software some months ago noticed some problems with my pc in subsequent weeks did n't put 2 and 2 together last week however i 'd come home no icons on screen no ability to ctrl alt del each day this would happen the machine had to be powered on and off to reboot pulled recent software off machine yes you 've guessed without spy sweeper i have no problems ok it might be a conflict with other software a quick google confirmed my suspicions that others have problems i was never impressed that it was picking up anything of substance either but then maybe my machine is clean	4
1	i made the mistake of buying a two year subscription every upgrade slows the product down a scan that used to take 14 minutes now takes over one hour stay away from this junk there are much better free products available	4
1	i work at best buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time for one its a huge system hog and two it does n't catch much of the pesky spyware also when computers come in to be cleaned up no one uses this program \( even though we 're supposed to recommend it \) i would recommend xoft pest patrol or ms antispyware much much more	4
1	the bottom line of what makes a company viable is great customer service after the sale when things do n't go as planned customer service exists but their reps claim they ca n't do anything about your problem their manners are less than acceptable rude seems to be the in thing at this company as consumers we have options one of which is to ge elsewhere i am writing them off as a lost cause and taking my monetary loss as a lesson learned it 's too bad	4
1	do n't buy zone alarm if you use aol they are not compatable the pop ups will drive you crazy and aol wo n't work properly also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed i bought it from amazon and had to throw it away in a month no refund money lost norton is far better with aol	4
1	this screensaver is terrible it pauses and jerks around very annoying i emailed the company and never heard from them i dont use it and i dont recommend it to anybody thank yo	4
1	it seems that all previous quickbook versions will not run on windows vista and i had upgraded my system so i bought simple start as the least expensive way to get a quickbook product to run on vista turns out simple start runs fine on vista but you cannot load a company file from earlier versions thus simple start was simply useless to me when i called intuit customer service they said that for another 100 they 'd give me a license number that would unlock that feature by that time i was committed and had no choice talk about getting ripped off ! !	4
1	i read the review saying simple start did n't have enough features and would lead to upgrading to get a usable version despite the warning i thought i could get away with simple start because i was buying the program for bookkeeping at a tiny church and would be putting few demands on the program even for my simple needs it was a bust i had to upgrade to pro for an additional 100 if quicken is n't enough for your needs get pro	4
1	if you are buying this product because it is the cheapest one intuit offers excpect to get what you pay for if your needs are really so simple that this product will work for you then you would be just as well off using a spreadsheet or downloading the free version from microsoft or even using their home version with business added by the time you figure out that you need better capabilities it will be too late to return it bottom line if you want a good quickbooks bump up to the pro version so you can get real customer and vendor management and a decent overview summary and multiple category levels	4
1	great product but shame on amazon for selling it without telling people that it is old software kudos to acronis for giving me a free upgrade to 10 acronis 10 is absolutely wonderful	4
1	this item has not been received in 25 days ! no help from vendo	4
1	this is not the most recent version for this software do an online search check the manufacturer 's web site and you 'll find it cheaper for the latest version	4
1	it 's not working with my toshiba tecra m2 laptop it keeps wanting an update to my video driver that does n't exist	4
1	i 've had dazzle products in the past usually a very good product this dvd recorder is just not very reliable i would recommmend spending a little more and getting one of the higher end dazzle products	4
1	i found this software very difficult to use it does not have any stop or go back button the only way to exit an activity is to hit esc button to exit the program and then start all over when starting over there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and i could not find a way to skip it	4
1	i bought two of the mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed class i bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother \( caregiver \) passed away the storyline of the game is that mia has to save her gravely ill grandmother then she gets mugged by a rat ! i feel this is a little to noir for small children the math game \( which i am returning unopened \) is about her house burning down and if she could prevent it by going back through time i feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects i am returning both games	4
1	the creators of mia 's reading adventure would be better engaged creating movies and not children 's games there is just way too much expository and not enough interaction to make this worth your child 's effort if you 're looking to teach your pre k k child reading skills i 'd recommend the blue 's clues games instead any older children would probably get as frustrated as mine did	4
1	aquazone is good but i 've found that serene scene is a better product aquazone is not as realistic as serene scene and that is what i was looking for the realism of fish in an aquarium if i could go back i would buy serene scene instead	4
1	i had to return this product i have a newer g5 imac with all os x updates and as a program it worked but if you buying this for a sreensaver like i did the product did n't work i tried emailing and posted a question on allume forum got no response	4
1	i purchased this item for 10 from comp usa there was a problem with some of the files so when i finished installing it my computer was a mess i lost all my desk top icons and my computer was extremely slow to respond to anything else it took me a while to get the program removed and i eventually ended up doing a system restore when the screensaver came up it did look awesome i wish i could have used it but i am not going to try and install it again	4
1	in wandering around the web i find i am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing \( from photoshop elements 5 \) when importing lightroom thinks for a long time \( that 's fine and they do warn you it can be slow \) but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import about the rest of the program \? i do n't know too frustrated just trying to get it up and running	4
1	i am rating this program just one star because i found out after ordering that it is not compatible with digital voice recorders i did go to the nuance website before ordering they did n't have a little chart to tell what the difference was between preferred and standard anyway if you want naturally speaking to do transcribing you need the preferred version not this one	4
1	i'm having a hard time understanding who would pay money for this downgrade \? you 'll wish you had the xp upgrade as soon as you do it it 's just baffling that they would charge this much for such an awful product	4
1	not unless you are comfortable editing your registry to get your dvd cd drive to work	4
1	i have a 3 2 ghz 2 gb pc clearly ready for vista after running the compatibility wizard and uninstalling all the software that would conflict \( even the optional conflicts the second time around \) they told me it would install yet it did n't after an hour of installing it tells me the installation fails and restores xp i realise that mine is an isolated case but it 's typical microsoft if you want something that works buy a mac	4
1	i ca n't get the software to scan past 30 the software locks up when i try to end the scan after being stuck at 30 scan	4
1	in the instruction pamphlet under scan tools there is a list of what the program scans one of the functions is a registry scanner this is a fast scanner that analyzes the windows registry for traces of known malware the bottom line i have an infected registry which was discovered by my antivirus program and the spyware doctor does n't know it 's there i do keep spyware doctor up to date i'm still looking for an effective spyware application	4
1	there 's a fundamental flaw in the software it wo n't print a greeting card properly unless you have a borderless capable printer if you print on a printer that ca n't do borderless printing the front cover image on the card will be off center check the faq section of the hallmarksoftware web site and they even admit as much it 's a known bug and a 'fix' has been promised since december according to the hallmarksoftware on line forums until the fix is released if ever avoid this program	4
1	card studio 2007 has repeated many cards from card studio 2006 i bought this new program to have more of a selection but was very disappointed also is is very difficult to see the cards when they are bunched you have to pick a card in order to read the front very time consuming	4
1	i contacted the program 's customer service department when the cards in this program printed off center no matter what i did i received an email saying that this was a known problem with the program and a fix would be available by the end of january mid february i asked again about it as there had been no fix that time they said it would be fixed by the end of february i 've used their previous programs w out problems just wanted more variety so added this one apparently not a good idea	4
1	i bought this for my child who uses it at school and loves it i have a mac pro running the latest version of mac os i installed it and it needs to run on 800x600 resolution which is kind of silly in this day and age but that works ok what does not work is that it crashes about every 5 minutes pretty unworkable do n't bother buying this for a mac	4
1	no support or response to questions only 1 2 of the functions work not a bad design but it was obviously released full of bugs try cosmic blobs	4
1	downloaded the new mcafee software my computer is now slowed over 90 of the speed of a snail both with aol and internet explorer mcafee customer service is of no value whatever mcafee faq describes a very dangerous fix which involves editing the registry file but even those instructions do n't seem to work as described what a mistake	4
1	the software was installed on three computers and slowed two down so much i had to remove it on 2 and have not put it back on it worked fine on one of the thre	4
1	until '07 if you had a mcafee suite but only wanted to use some of its components and use other programs for other aspects of protection that worked fine for instance i use zone alarm pro for firewall and spyware doctor for spyware and mcafee '06 just for virus this combination has worked fine but mcafee '07 wo n't install any of itself unless all other programs are removed and that 's a no go for me since some components of mcafee \( esp spyware \) were n't rated all that well by reviewers	4
1	contrary to the other review they did ship the proper 3 user version however since installing it yesterday it is consuming 100 of my systems resources and i can not find any setting to have it stop evidently it does continuous deep virus scans so you might as well toss your computer in the garbage what a mess of a product	4
1	this has caused serious technical errors on my systems all new laptops desktops it will cause ms word 2007 to crash and also cause a number of errors on your file system possibly requiring you to re install your vista os worked well in windows xp and office 2003 environment and they claim this is vista compatible along with paperport 11 the company will not offer me a refund i will pursue	4
1	freezes ie 7 and you have to close out and restart besides that the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the print as image selection for anything that is scanned overall it is ok and with the vast price difference with adobe i can live with it but make no mistake this program is far inferior to the adobe product	4
1	i deinstall the product after two weeks of use it did not allow me to select adobe reader as my default program and was not able to open many pdf documents if a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing also the feature to allow editing of the documents in word or excel was most often non functional	4
1	i tried to use this program to file a very simple return and it calculated that i owed the state 550 for underpayment as well as a 230 penalty for late payment i tried working through the program several times to find the error i found that the program was automatically checking boxes that i had n't checked ! i have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem which i was not able to resolve in frustration i went to and filed my return easily within an hour with a 140 return from the state rather than a 780 penalty	4
1	ok the maps are good but its very very combersome to use with a laptop in your car it is very disracting and can easily cause an accident does not work aroung lincoln tunnel area also would not find my home street and i have been there for 2 years either the one i got was defected or its not what other make it out to be i had to return mine	4
1	does n't tell you how to get anywhere when used with a gps simply shows you where you are nothing more than a glorified paper map a complete embarassment	4
1	this product is nothing like the desktop version of the software so limited in functions you might as well have a paper map	4
1	this is simply awful ! i would expect this type of performance from some no name brand software purchased at a flea market not from microsoft ! i think they must of contracted this off to some really low bidder i had more satisfaction tossing the software into the trash than trying to auction it off on some internet site i think i 'll go with the tomtom navigator software instead	4
1	i guess i'm to dumb to purchase an item like this i followed the instructions to the letter and it 's not working i guess i should have read the small print sent an e mail to xitel for help and waiting for response will re rate later	4
1	while there are many benefits to learning vocabulary with this tool i found it did not help with conversation	4
1	i 've been a user of quicken for at least ten years i 've liked the product historically but this version is garbage like other users i too have fallen victim to the 'out of memory' error guess what \? there 's nothing i can do i ca n't go back to a previous version of quicken because my data file is n't compatable honestly i blame myself for not reading the feedback others had left first i was brand loyal to intuit but now i'm paying the price the software is garbage stay away	4
1	this is an extremely flawed software program i have used quicken for more than a decade and this product is not worthy of the name runtime errors keep me from evening getting the program going it contains 6 bank accounts which i cannot currently print checks from i have reinstalled the software at least 15 times with no success i have used every suggestion from tech support and the quicken forums without any success i guess i 'll have to move to ms money	4
1	it 's definitely an awful piece of software it 's totally unstable under winxp sp2 and ie7 follow other peoples advice and get quicken '06	4
1	looks nice but beware ! installed norton 360 on the 6 workstations in our small office as soon as i did that our accounting system \( peachtree \) started to lock up a few times a day even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up i 've now uninstalled norton 360 on the server pc and that seems to have solved the problem i wish now that i had just upgraded from norton internet security 2005 to 2007 never again	4
1	installed great looked good day 3 it started blocking me from websites 'as their security certificate had been revoked' amazon even \? after a week of back and forth 'support' they could n't fix it and left me with a partially working pc to drown the pc support is partially automated as they did n't read my responses and their advice went in circles plus trying to fully uninstall it is a nightmare it might work on xp but do n't get it if you have vista	4
1	the video editing part of this software is completely useless it did n't come with a manual and i ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it it has n't made a difference the software is completely uncooperative my computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program if you bought this software for the video editing i recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else	4
1	the features of the program are great but it crashes way too much my computer system is fully adequate for video editing so that is not the problem i 've gotten to the point where i save my work literally every minute for fear that it will crash	4
1	the video editing component of this package video wave worked great for me for about a year but it has recently turned into a nightmare ! the audio is anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds out of sync with the video and after trying everything i'm convinced that its a problem with the code a quick product search will show others who have had similar problems i would stay away	4
1	the video editing capability is tough to deal with and not impressive when you figure it out the tools are not explained and there is n't as much to do with it as they imply may be nice for birthday party editing i do n't know i did n't like it it 's not worth 100 the other capabilities might be nice but from what i 've dealt with that 's not the case	4
1	once i figured this software out i was able to do a slideshow of my pictures integrate video and produce a decent dvd only problem is it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4 3 whereas my dvd camcorder shoots in 16 9 this sucks i have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16 9 roxio support did e mail me back with the blanket statement that it does n't support 16 9 at this time even in the new 7 5 version roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen	4
1	i foolishly purchased 7 0 it worked ok for a few months then just kept hanging up my system funny it started hanging up when 7 5 was released i tried to get customer support but that 's a joke do yourself a favor do not buy anything from roxio i 'd given this software negative stars if i could spend your money elsewhere	4
1	this is an item that i purchased from amazon com that i am not satisfied with i cannot install the game on my computer to play it i had a relative try to install it on her computer and she also could not install it to play she believes that it could be a damaged disk and that i should pursue getting a refund or replacing it with another copy i hope you can help me with this thank you for your support sharon moseley	4
1	i am extremely unhappy with this product it is defective i gave it as a christmas gift to my daughter and was very disappointed to learn that it does not work	4
1	i read previous reviews about not being able to run the program because the computer recognized it as a copied disk i thought this could n't possibly happen on my high tech computer i was wrong even though i purchased a legitamate copy the program still would not let me run it buyer beware ! ! ! ! !	4
1	i changed from quicken to quickbooks and regret it yes quick books does some wonderful reports and invoiceing but i have found it difficut to use and especially to download crdit card transactions from my business credit cards i have also found it difficut to match transactions to get a better handle on my expenses i am going back to quicken or try another program online help and tutorials dummies guide not helpful either you would think see they make quicken they would allow import of qif files dissapointed	4
1	i have had to un install and reinstall three times and it still wo n't update on a very current windows xp version i hate how hard it is to download from my bank and it never recognizes the stuff anyway so i have to go through line by line and create aliases i like quicken better but the accountant ca n't figure out how to import quicken into his quickbooks pro so here it is hate it hard as ever not easier the whole thing takes way too long to work with reports are a bit easier which is good or i would have tossed it out the window and bought microsoft money	4
1	the product is great calling tech support is a task though intuit outsources thier call centers overseas and it is difficult to communicate with thier support people by telephone if this product was n't preffered by my cpa i would never buy it ever again boycott companies that outsource to other countries keep our jobs at home !	4
1	i was very happy with my quickbooks basics but for whatever corporate reason they no longer support the basics version so i was forced to upgrade to pro 2007 it is much slower than basics it 's more complicated to back up \( it asks so many questions \) also it takes longer to print a simple check \( again too many clicks before it prints	4
1	i installed quickbooks pro 2003 on my new computer running vista and had a small problem so i bought an upgrade to 2007 since intuit says it works with vista it does not the software crashes at odd times it also crashes when attempting to call up invoices from the accounts receivable report it reports out of memory errors and closes two to six times each day i have set up my old computer which runs xp so i can use the new software until they fix all of the glitches in the 2007 version i recommend not buying this version if you are running vista os	4
1	no support you have to pay 9 95 to send an email support question still cannot print annotations in pdf files that you create there is a workaround nuance should change their name to nuisance i hope that someone comes up with an alternative	4
1	i used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it boy are they right this thing is terrible after installing on windows xp sp2 as soon as i started the program it crashed now every time i try to scan using my canon scanner it crashes every time product is useless wish i had of never bought it ! do not buy !	4
1	after having used this product since version 4 each version had its problems the latest version 11 has improved document indexing and searching a little bit over version 10 it does not scan both sides of pages as it did in version 10 the capture assistant crashes the program if you need support due to bugs in the program you have to pay and pay and pay	4
1	i am a little disappointed in the upgrade to microsoft office as it is not user friendly nor is it as accommodating as the earlier version	4
1	i should have read these comments before ordering got an oem cd and a generic jewel box	4
1	i was expecting the nero 6 ultimate all in one instead i received nero oem suite the mpeg 4 encoder they claim is not included instead there is a thirty day trial better business bureau should be notified	4
1	as another reviewer says but the final tax forms i needed to file with were not included on the cd rom package turbotax instructed me to get them by using one click update well after i update and attempt to restart the software turbotax refuses to come up at all exactly i 've re installed it over and over and the same thing happens i 've used turbotax in previous years and never had a problem like this after spending hours entering in my data there is apparently no way to get to the final filing stage with four days before the due date this is disasterous their support site offers no hint of a fix mac users stay away	4
1	this was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes turbotax sounded easy enough and it was pretty easy at first the software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information but the final tax forms i needed to file with were not included on the cd rom package turbotax instructed me to get them by using one click update well after i update and attempt to restart the software turbotax refuses to come up at all i ca n't speak for this software on windows machines but if you are using mac os x i suggest you explore other options first	4
1	the program does a great job in figuring my taxes but now intuit is charging for filing and the state program also i was unable to download the updates over my dial up connection i called to have a cd version mailed to me but so far i have n't received it i'm trying tax act this year it is a free program and has free filing if i can complete the turbotax version i will see if i can duplicate my return using tax act if so then good bye turbotax	4
1	i bought this product because of positive member reviews and and outstanding review in cnet however i just bought a new dell inspiron e1505 that shipped with windows vista home premium and zonealarm 6 5 is flat out incompatible with the new os i downloaded zonealarm 7 0 and that is flat out incompatible as well i'm sure this is a great security suite for windows xp but beware if you have vista there seems to be no update on their website when zonelabs will release a vista compatible zonealarm \( they mention something about after january 2007 but it 's march for crying out loud ! \) so there 's my purchase price of a good product down the drain	4
1	i bought the vista upgrade with my dell computer i tried to install and half way through the set up after it had uninstalled my old programs i got a message to abort the abort left me with a damaged media program and thus far i have spent over 400 trying to re connect damaged files and programs my best advice is to wait until microsoft gets the kinks out of the vista program and then buy the upgrade	4
1	i am very disappointed in vista it took about 12 hours to install and now my computer is extremely slow i would absolutely not recommend it	4
1	the vista set up is nice but is buggy and incompatible with a lot of games and upgrades	4
1	as everyone else has said this product is not at all what it should be it slows down the internet browsing to a crawl \( my laptop that has crashed several times is several years older and runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer with mcafee \) you ca n't close it as others have said other than uninstalling the funniest part i 've found however is that it warns you the first time it tries to access being amused i refused the program permission to update itself other than removing the program it was the best thing i did using mcafee	4
1	buyer beware this program will critically impair your system ! internet loading will be drastically crippled expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes there is no way to close mcafee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall i am going to return this first thing next week i gave them a few weeks to improve performance with patches and upgrades but nothing has changed if only i had read the reviews ahead of time bottomline if you do n't mind these side effects by all means purchase this program mcafee has solid protection but there are easier ways to get that protection	4
1	i installed this on my laptop and it slowed it down to a crawl i deinstalled it installed norton 2005 bought the subscription renewal and my laptop is back up to speed you have been warne	4
1	do not use this product it is very hard to remove from your computer it is harder to install than norton and is an inferior product i will never buy their product again	4
1	this software is one time use ! if you have a notebook and laptop you wo n't be able to install for both ! it sucks	4
1	like some of the other reviews i loved cool edit pro then adobe got a hold of it and royally screwed it up with 2 0 i use this program often and tried to give it a chance no way around it it sucks now i am going to use sonar a much better product the only thing i like about 2 0 is that you can burn to a disc from audition that is the only reason why i gave it one star this is not a user friendly program	4
1	i am not a bookkeeper without bookkeeping software i would be lost ! i own a small business and help keep books for a friend 's business i have quickbooks from 1996 and love it so i convinced my friend to get this newer version i am very disappointed with the format and see very little similarity between them aarrrgh !	4
1	i'm sure it 's a good product for beginners but i already had an older version of quickbooks \( from 1995 \) and the only way i could export import the old data into a newer version of quickbooks was with qb pro simple start does n't allow you to import data from older versions	4
1	i bought this product based on consumer reports review i 've had norton and mcafee in the past which slowed down my system my computer is slower to start up with zonealarm but faster than mcafee while on however most of the time i need to shut off zonealarm in order to access the internet just like another reviewer defeats the purpose do n't you think \? it also recognized my offices 's software as a virus and although i allowed access it keeps showing it as a virus i'm going to have to go to another product	4
1	the idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good but in practice zonealarm is too intrusive for most home computer users it seems to have bugs too starting with an installation that initially would n't work on one of the computers on my home lan zonealarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered i have n't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall zonealarm yet but i'm close	4
1	i 've been using a win 98 version of this software for years and the opportunity to upgrade to the xp version was tempting however it does not work at all in my portuguese xp after searching for the misterious error code through the manufacturer 's database i was informed that it does not work in non english win xp all the previous versions worked fine in my pcs but this one was totally disappointing living in brazil i had to give up my money since the shipping costs were about the same value i would recover shame on them	4
1	you 've got to be kidding me the fry 's salesperson told me microsoft word could n't print business cards and that i should buy this product to make high quality business cards what an incredible lie this is such a piece of junk it has almost nothing the cards look terrible a total embarassment it 's hard to use it 's easier to make it in word lies lies lies junk garbage lies lies lies	4
1	i have used lots of printmaster versions i had some trouble with version 16 with the address book so i was happy to find that a new version was out and called to order they told me i would n't have a problem with the new one this new version is junk all the projects have to be downloaded so if you do n't have a high speed connection forget it ! i do n't like the fact that you have to go on line every time you want to create a card etc i sent a note to customer service and just received a generic response so looks like i have to find new software	4
1	never recueved the product waiting for refund for over 6 weeks	4
1	this item puts more spyware on the pc then it takes away do not bu	4
1	the product was fine but i received an older version and as a result i could n't properly update it even after registering it as a result i purchased the newest version available directly from lavasoft and it works fine and i have had no trouble updating it why did n't you specify what version it was on your website then i could have made an informed decision \?	4
1	ordered version 1 06 but was sent v 1 05 lavasoft website will upgrade the old version if i send them my order number however they will not accept an amazon number amazon customer support said sorry that they would accept a return and provide a refund i will be more careful where i buy software in the future	4
1	slowed a new system down too much when running in backgroud went back to free verison	4
1	the updates are frequent and expensive good program but it 's not worth the trouble and expense of upgrading	4
1	way to many problems with this version if you want to replace all your printers scanners sound cards and so on go for it otherwise stay away	4
1	the software requires a patch not a big deal once i got the thing up and running my attention span was about 5 minutes the goofiness is a detriment and the aspect of trying to learn is hindered by the balance of trying to figure out how to use the software it has a tutorial but that is a waste of time as well if you are serious about trying to learn some basic conversational spanish try something else do n't waste your time or money on this one	4
1	great product for what it does ! however my experience with quicken products such as will maker is that there are no updates you 'll have to buy the next year 's version to stay up to date for changes in your state at the end of 2007 the software is obsolete	4
1	this program causes my computers to blue screen trend micro has been contacted twice but have not responded	4
1	i bought pc cillin because it has 4 stars in amazon rating which is much better than mcafee and norton but i am wrong before installed pc cillin everything is fine but after installed i can not access my yahoo email after calling customer service two times even uninstalled pc cillin i still can not access yahoo email now i have to re install windows xp it will cost me a lot of time anyone knows what wrong is	4
1	the major flaw with this product is that it 's not clear which version of office you can upgrade from note it does not work with office sbe ! ! various sources say various things even the microsoft site is n't helpful	4
1	i discovered a bug in the program which seriously affects its integrity have been on the phone with quicken techs numerous times and they finally acknowledged that there is a problem with the program and a patch \( fix \) needs to be developed so far though they have not done it	4
1	if you have not bought this yet do n't if you have but have n't installed it yet do n't i 've used quicken for years and this is the worst implentation yet the major problem an issue known to the company is that reports will not print properly on many printers wait until they issue a fix before you use this product	4
1	well you certainly will be able to recognize words and answer the questions correctly but if you 're expecting to understand what the words actually mean i would n't recommend this i was able to answer the first seven chapters easily and get all questions right but i have no idea what any words in the sentence caption actually mean i 've used it for a month know and i have no greater knowledge of chinese than when i started	4
1	you 've got to be kidding me there is no english translation just pictures and mandarin phrases how are people suppose to figure it out without a straight forward english definitions or explanation for each phrase \? they 're suppose to be teaching mandarin to an english speaker not some boy raised by wolves who never knew any language this is retarded worst product ever	4
1	their approach might work for other languages but for chinese it 's critically important to understand the grammar of the language which rosetta stone never explains it simply displays four pictures at you with some incomprehensible \( to a beginner \) chinese near them and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures i 've taken chinese for two years and i still found it impossible to learn anything from it i either knew the words already or i could n't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach i would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a mandarin college course but i ca n't find anything like this for sale or free online	4
1	mutual fund basis calculations are broken updates fail on the mac not to mention no state in this edition it 's absurd how many different versions of turbotax there are this year it almost takes longer to try to figure out which one to buy than it does to do your taxes i'm done with turbotax switching to taxcu	4
1	i have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed norton anti virus programs i purchased the 3 pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired i then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer when i contacted norton they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full when the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers i will never purchase another norton product	4
1	extremely difficult to unistall endless loop do not buy this product or if you do then be prepared for an exremely fustrating experience i will never use nav again	4
1	this program is causing many people difficulties i had to make two seperate calls to customer service	4
1	i have a recently purchased acrobat 8 0 professional it installed fine on my new vista machine although it cites only office 2003 products but i have ms office 2007 after installation \( and reinstallation \) no acrobat conversion options show on ms word and when trying to use acrobat directly for an ms word file conversion it first reinstalls itself and then reports that the word file \( i have tried several \) is corrupt i now have to ask colleagues with older software to do my pdf conversion i could not find out if or when adobe plans to be compatible with vista and office 2007	4
1	the first order i received for italian 1 and 2 had defective disks which were not replaced by the manufacturer when i called their customer service when i re submitted my complaint to amazon they immediately sent me a replacement of the whole set however these disks also are very slow to load on my new macpro laptop and quit at times i am not able to recommend rosetta stone	4
1	i bought this as christmas present for my daughter who will be traveling to italy this spring as part of a college course she is taking and she will be spending a semister there next year as well she just called me for school to help her resolve an error in the installation the install reaches 100 then states it has encountered an error and quits it remains uninstalled and is thus far unusable an awefully expensive piece of plastic that does nothing as a senior software engineer i 'd have been fired for less the rosettastone website knowledgebase offers no information on this	4
1	this software is very hard to use the help video goes too fast the manual does n't cover everything and nothing is intuitive i have used a lot of software and this is just not worth the money	4
1	i work for a software company so i know a little about the user interface concept this is one of the worst packages i have ever used i just spent an hour trying to draw my house and get the dimensions right the automatic dimension builder did not work i had to draw it and redraw it to get the dimensions right then i added a few windows and doors and 2 porches then i tried to use the camera to get a vertical view the whole file blew up ca n't find it anywhere the manual is useless and the tutorial cd is just an overview of each topic what a waste of moeny	4
1	do not waste your money ! i consider myself pretty computer savvy but this software is not easy to use you 'd have an easier time just drawing out your ideas by hand	4
1	this is the worst software i have ever worked with everything is difficult and some things are impossible to create	4
1	i have moderate knowledge of computers etc and i found this overly complicated this is not intended for the novice however even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money i wish i had not bought it at all perhaps it has secrets and treasures i am not aware of but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them save your money this was a waste	4
1	this product is an absolute piece of junk do not buy this product will not even load properly onto computer have wasted several hours trying to install product on windows xp platform with no success i have wasted a whole day trying to install this piece of junk on my computer now i will probably waste another day trying to return this bunch of garbage to the vendor	4
1	this game can get very boring it 's very confusing and hard to control it is sooooo frustrating ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the instruction booklet does n't come in handy either like some other people i only got rabbits too i bought this game because i wanted to heal cats and horses but only rabbits came buying this game was a big mistake it is reallly no fun do n't waste your money on this game i gave up about a month ago i 've left it on the shelf and have n't touched it since	4
1	when i got this game i was very excited to play it but when i played it i was very dissapointed the game was very confusing and hard to control sometimes i could n't get my person to go where i wanted it to go learn from my mistake do n't waste your money on this game	4
1	i got this game because i thought it would be fun i was totally wrong ! every customer that i got brought only rabbits rabbits rabbits rabbits ! ! ! this game confused me a lot also it gets very boring and it 's very hard to control do n't waste your money on this game ! it will be a total waste of your money believe me	4
1	after being greeted with much excitement this program would n't properly install on my not so fussy computer the web assistance was of little help at all and we had to send it back very disappointing	4
1	i made the unfortunate mistake of reading fantastic reviews for this product and trying it out myself i went online and purchased the program downloaded and installed on my pc installation worked perfectly i ran a scan and it even found viruses that mcafee missed however any program that used the internet now freezes or takes forever to load after closing web browsers i have to restart before my pc recovers i unistalled the program and now everything works great i'm shopping somewhere else for my antivirus needs	4
1	i 'd give this no stars but it wo n't let me why would anyone buy this \? i was in compusa today as they are closing down on long island thought about buying this i put it down said i will researh this more at home as i suspected you can go to do the same thing that this software does the software does n't allow you to print stamps at home so what 's the point \? the only plus is that you get a sheet of free stamps so it 's like buying a coupon that 's a one time use i do n't get it	4
1	i brought the software beleiving that it would help me with my scrapbooking it has very limited graphics and templates to workwith i would not recomend this software package also the journaling sucks as well even when you start a product from scratch the software is n't user friendly with very little guidence as stated before 1 star is to much	4
1	complete waste of money i purchased my copy at wal mart but wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake i did the graphics and templates they use on the package to lure you in are nice and tasteful the actaul program is so not like that the graphics are down right cheesy and low budget having only paid 9 for this program i feel like i was completely ripped off i 'll for sure be calling the company and asking for a refund 1 star seems like too many to give this awful item	4
1	this software is a waste of money to say the least the templates on this software are terrible and ugly you are lucky if you have five good templates to choose from if you are looking for something quick and easy to use this is not it you have to format everything please do n't make the same mistake i made do not buy this product	4
1	if you read the license you find that you probably give away rights to anything you use in a comic book it also looks like you ca n't give away copies of comics you print certainly ca n't sell them and ca n't let others copy them unless you want your child 's face on a cereal box without your permission you probably do n't want this software	4
1	this program is limited to a few word bubbles and sound effect fonts it is difficult for a novice to understand how to get his or her own pictures into the comic the word bubble sdo not rotate so they could be pointing anywhere except where you want them to it looks really great on the cover of the cd and that 's what sold me it was a disapointing christmas	4
1	this is very bad doesnot work and really interfers with other programs almost impossible to remove it	4
1	i could be home in bed but i'm fing around trying to undo the install of the biggest mistake i 've made to date purchasing tossing money in the toilet for nero7 the damage and the time it 's taken to recover is about 20 times it 's cost useless i ca n't copy a disk i ca n't burn and image what 's the deal \? \? \? all the negative stuff i 've read true unfortunately after i paid for nero7 before reading what others have to say what really puzzles me is who all the folks are that are writing all the wonderful reviews \? employees of ahead \? keep your distance or you 'll be sorry	4
1	nero 7 wants to prevent you from generating iso files and instead wants you to use its nrg cd backup file system then it does n't want you to burn wav onto cd but forces you to invest in mp3 encryption so that you can burn mp3 to cd the software is full of these horrible twists that nero has gone from the best burning rom to the worst burning rom by simply making it harder for you to do what you want i rolled back to nero 5 5 and had a fully functional and top of the line burning rom again	4
1	this software suite promises to do everything on earth but does n't tell us how there is no useful help file there are no tutorials or instructions on the website and nero 's support is a joke \( just try to get a message through \) i do n't understand how a company that started out with the best burn program in the game has sunk to this	4
1	this product is worse than useless right off the bat the tutorials do not behave as depicted what is left does not run properly i spent hours and hours trying to make a cd from an lp all to no avail to make matters worse this bug infested monstrosity has very poor support there is no 800 number the version that i had came with 10 days of tecnical assistance that was useless ! after the 10 days technical assistance costs 1 29 a minute plus the cost of the long distance call ! i repeat ! do not buy this product !	4
1	ever since adobe bought out this small operation customer service has been severely lacking software will not work on excel 2007 the promise for additional powerlooks has become dead granted that the program makes presentation more interesting the powerlooks that was in production are no longer on the website this is highly disappointing as i purchased this program in anticipation for further development on the powerlook templates	4
1	i use powerpoint a great deal as a teacher and thought this would upgrade my presentations unfortunately every one of my computers had insufficient video memory to allow the software to work for now it sits on my shelf until i can purchase more powerful equipment certainly not for the casual user it is n't the magic black box that will make you a star	4
1	you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have do n't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it many changes are literally imposed on you like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars missing menus and the auto double space setting every time you hit return there are new features which can be helpful to some but microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining the arrogance of microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible you upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual	4
1	i am an experienced office user i recently updgraded from office 2003 \( which worked great \) to office 2007 and now i am much less productive office 2007 is pretty but if you actually have to get something done at work don't buy this product	4
1	we are very disappointed in this product because it provides almost no options to customize the spreadsheet we cannot rename catagories that are not applicable to us \( i e child care \) and we cannot create new categories that are specific to our needs what 's even more limiting and disppointing is that you cannot create a different tab for each month to use for comparison which makes us wonder what value we gain from having a single month of finances captured finally the bar graphs for summary comparisons are shaded the same color of the background which makes it very difficult to read	4
1	i have always used norton antivirus and had no problems with it at all i have recently had to migrate to outlook 2003 and norton is 2005 and have non stop system crashes i have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of norton professional and hey presto everything is working again and not talking two hours to load	4
1	quicken software continues to contain prominent advertising for intuit products and services in my opinion it is fine to offer additional services to customers but give the customer the opportunity to say no thanks and then leave them alone so they can be productive with the software forever pestering a paid customer with advertising for the same products and services is not a good idea advertising takes up space in the user interface and is a distraction that reduces productivity	4
1	from my experience just about all support calls are routed off shore most of the tech support staff just take your question and type it into their work station they say may i put you on hold while i check my resources then they read answers off their screen several times i had to say to the tech i ca n't understand your english if you buy the package i 'd find a local qb certified accountant and pay him her for their time	4
1	the res on the artwork here is less than miserable the interface is high tech circa 1996 i'm dissappointed in this purchase i would have thought it was fantastic when i bought my first pc in 1993	4
1	i 've installed and tested this for several clients whether backing up to a local hd or over the network the system has worked i install and come back a week later to do a test verify and restore and it 's always worked i did have trouble once windows froze up this was probably due to poor programming combined with insufficient ram it worked the second time i do n't get why a product with mostly single star ratings like this still gets 2 5 stars annoying amazon 'feature' ! since 60 of windows pcs are malware infected i'm figuring most windows pc support issues are malware induced	4
1	it 's a piece of junk so save your money and some headaches even dell technicians ca n't fix it my new dell computer had norton ghost pre installed with a back up hard drive just for cloning it sounded like a perfect setup except my norton ghost would n't work contacted dell three times and they supposedly coordinated with norton to no avail now i'm stuck with saturated backup hard drive that is useless to me	4
1	i bought this product to assist in recovery but i tried to recover a program and it would not work does real well on a complete recovery but do not expect a partial works well on recovery of my stuff	4
1	i got norton ghost with my new dell pc so i thought i would use it for backups to an external usb drive after about 6 months of 'trying' to use it i finally gave up and uninstalled it reason most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it twice i removed all the partial backups and started from scratch but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup now the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups	4
1	this cd should be priced at 5 00 the graphics will not keep your child 's attention and it 's pretty lame it was a wasted purchase i have to bribe my child to use it because it so boring	4
1	i bought this for my two sons ages 6 and 8 to help them develop speed with their memory math skills what a disappointment even when they do know the answer quickly it can take them a good minute to find the actual answer in the game each playtime you must start from the beginning a work back up to where you left off good for review but it takes so long to get to the levels where practice is really needed i wish i 'd purchased a different product	4
1	this concept is good but the user interface and playability is terrible my 7 year old was frustrated with being forced to use the keyboard and no mouse and we could n't figure out a way to go back to the main menu without exiting the game and playing a later level requires you to go through all the earlier levels and did they actually test this thing on humans \? what a waste of potential it is a good concept	4
1	my son had an earlier version of math blaster it was wonderful i saw this new version and expected more of the same wrong ! ! after 10 minutes of loud sounds and pulsing video he was complaining it was impossible to focus on what he should do with all the distracting background stuff never could get to a point where learning might take place wish i could get my money back after this disaster we purchased mia 's math adventure this was more in tune with the first math blaster	4
1	i just got a 2006 version of math blasters i played it for a while and i thought that it was really frustrating and it didnt help me at math at all ! i think that anyone who plays it will probably fall right to sleep when they start playing ! the box it came in said it was for age 6 12 but i think it is for 6 or 7 year old kids i really dont think this is a good game to play	4
1	this is the best selling bible in america for good reason ! ease of comprehension lovely modern english pleasing packaging and the best conservative scholarhip for both textual reconstruction and language translation read i was a teenage jehovah's witness and jehovah unmasked for two of the wildest rides ever !	4
1	if i could give it 0 star i would my humble opinion is that kaspersky is not better than norton at slowing down your computer one brand new computer plenty of space and memory one old computer but with plenty of space and memory as well each time kaspersky updates i ca n't open outlook express nor explorer well the programs do open actually but i have time to vacuum and dust before they 're launched i used the repair fonction and uninstalled and reinstalled without any improvement samwis	4
1	based on lots of great reviews i decided to buy kaspersky after two months i got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted i sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key this did not work i had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply this time no one ever replied i sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still weeks later have not replied i emphatically advise against buying this product if you ever have a problem you will not get help	4
1	at first i thought the idea of offering a set of the most popular applications at an affordable price was great recently however many computer makers have started using ms works as the standard pre loaded suite on new machines users who need more than very very basic features will need to buy more dependable software packages \( e g ms office \) the word processor in works for instance does not have many macrons that are commonly used in dutch scandinavian turkish romanized russian japanese etc in the end the low price of ms works is a way to save money to computer makers and to squeeze out extra money from buyers who will need to upgrade to better products anyway	4
1	i had to upgrade to ms works 7 0 due to y2k issues i am not nearly as satisfied with ms wortks 7 0 as i was with ms works 4 5 i am now searching for a replacement	4
1	unfortunately i had to return the product because it was defective the first disk failed to load to my computer i contacted punch technical staff and they were unable to help me with the problem i tried on another computer in the house and the same thing happened i therefore returned the product	4
1	my daughter and another second grade friend both got bored of this game after 20 minutes of staring at a horse standing in a stall and listening to a cat meow the controls are not very logical and there is no animation to speak of	4
1	the new systemworks has a horrible interface you ca n't see what your options are easily you ca n't see the status of your components you ca n't see what version you have when you load it after loading norton personal firewall 2006 the firewall will not load program rules \( you have to uninstall the firewall and then reinstall it \) i'm not sure how the protection works but the software redesign was done by an ergonomic moron	4
1	i have used system works on my computer since 2000 the 2007 version is nowhere as good as the older ones they have deleted many of the real diagnostic features \( registry optomizer \) dummed down the rest and added \( rather forced \) an auto load norton protection center that takes over the windows security center and cannot be easily unloaded software should be made to be user friendly this version is nothing like the previous ones	4
1	the software installation is buggy it try 's to download the entire installation from the snapstream web site even though there is a installation disk included if your web connection fails the installation trashes your system and you will need to reinstall windows i have windows xp sp2 with a flakey internet connection although i am computer literate after two attempts to install this product i have chucked the whole thing out the window p s snapstream has no tech service department to speak of	4
1	after 25 years of building pc and installing software beta testing software i am unable even with adobe 's technical support staff to install acrobat version 8 software gets to the end of the install process and stalls no combination of repair uninstall reinstall registry cleaning advice from three technical support staff after hours on the telephone can solve the problem using xp with all the latest upgrades defragging the drives with 2 mb ram and a adobe tech support clean registry still fails to properly install the software	4
1	the bad serial number routine as the first reviewer i 'll try adobe customer service when i stop fuming	4
1	i have been unable to get the software to work on my dell computer with windows xp although i have been in contact with the technical team at sbt on many occasions my initial problem has never been resolved i am unable to use the test improve your memory software	4
1	sorry i liked the idea but this product did not meet my expectations it did not engage the users the interface was 20th century the technologies used were outdated my advice is to look elsewhere	4
1	i cannot believe that taxcut can no longer import capital gains info from fidelity which is has been able to do for several years i was a happy customer now i'm a mad customer	4
1	after spending over an hour waiting on their help line and trying all of their non functioning suggestions i was still unable to install this on either of my pcs they do n't want to admit it but their ad for deduction pro kills the software install at 21 \( or 26 for the standard version \) and no their font patch killing all startup services upgrading the flash player nor starting in safe mode did not resolve the problem i'm out the money on this and am switching to turbotax h r block has lost this customer	4
1	i just input all the information for my return and this software has me owing over 8000 by my calculations i'm owed a refund of 150 200 it is not taking federal income tax already paid from annuities into account back to the calculator for me	4
1	i just purchased the software and successfully installed it on my computer when i got to the point of entering dividends and capital gains i could n't figure out how to import the data from fidelity that i 've done for the last few years looking around on the fidelity website i can across the following statement for the 2005 tax year fidelity information will not be able to be imported directly into h r block 's taxcut programs h r block expects that these products will have this functionality restored for the 2006 tax year unfortunately this is the reason i'm using a software tax prep program looks like it 's back to turbotax	4
1	you can get mac os x for 129 bucks and it has everything as opposed to the microsoft 's 227 dollar home premium which is the low end buy mac and get all the functionality in one os when spec'ed out the system are comparable in price except apple does n't offer low end hardware options which is why they seem more expensive	4
1	the upgrade is 75 cheaper and you don't need to have a previous install of windows to get it to work simply do the following 1 boot with the windows vista upgrade dvd 2 click install now 3 do not enter a product key when prompted 4 when prompted select the vista product edition that you do have 6 install vista normally 7 once the install is complete restart the dvd based setup from within windows vista perform an in place upgrade 8 enter your product key when prompted this is according to microsoft 's internal documentation and reported by paul thurrott at windows it pro	4
1	i was a private beta tester for the new os i tested the software for a whole year and i am not pleased with it if you depend on stability for your existing software you are out of luck the hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use windows vista you are better off upgrading to a mac after all microsoft did steal many ideas from apple computers	4
1	i hate this product since i'm used to office 2003 \( at work \) opening this program and having to look at the childish looking menu bar was a shock the layout is irritating poorly designed and does not provide sufficient features to make things worse this sorry program does not allow you to save files directly to cd the one star rating was too generous	4
1	you do n't need to be a student or to own your home to get the home and student version any one can get that version microsoft does n't enforce the student part and by home they mean where you live	4
1	my best rating for microsoft money deluxe is it is pure junk do n't was your money if it works at all trust it is not with microsoft vista a class action law suit sounds in order for this garbage	4
1	i have been using this program for five years now and i'm finally going to switch to quicken the 'invoice designer' is a total waste of time it just has n't worked for years and microsoft will do nothing to get it to work this is the unwanted step child of microsoft so please do n't waist your time	4
1	terrible product confusing not easy to use like mcafee not meant for a basic computer user	4
1	buyer beware if you encounter a technical issue with this product and require a refund you 're out of luck they will send you in endless circles attempting to get a product refund there are many other good products out there that do the same thing it 's really easy to purchase but impossible to get a refund	4
1	unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments this is not always practical the tripod mount fits too loose on spyder and easily falls off i think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product but not yet ready for prime time	4
1	do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20 30 days of the shipping date \( the receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days \) you do n't have much time to return an item and the company does not give any leeway for christmas orders i am stuck with the item my son did not want for his dorm room and i ca n't exchange it for another item because he did n't like any of their products	4
1	i purchased a package for window xp in may this year and just got a computer on which i wanted to use it on thursday nov 25 we wanted install it but the boot disk 4 was observed to be problematic and thus the whole installation was not successful please advice me thanksrev ndorle	4
1	i bought this product on the strength of the norton name and a positive review in business week i uninstalled zonelabs ad aware and all norton anti virus there were still nav files after the uninstall i had to download their norton software removal tool which also could not remove some nav files everytime i re boot those problematic nav files want to re launch nav the nis 2007 install was still difficult after all of that effort and once installed nis 2007 either freezes up my computer or makes my internet connection so slow that it is un usable so now i 've uninstalled nis 2007 still have issues with the corrupt nav files and will being go back to zonelabs and ad aware	4
1	i have always used norton products and upgraded to is 2007 when mysubscription came up for renewal what a mistake my computerfreezes up all the time and the software is difficult to use it isnot at all straightforward like previous versions of internet security do not buy this product	4
1	i bought this product because i thought norton was a quality product man did i make a mistake buying this product i only had it on my computer for 1 month and it made my computer crawl almost to where it would not hardly work i deleted it then my computer starting working just fine this happened to me 2 times before i got tired of it and trashed it	4
1	just terrible software often does not work if that would be the only thing it would be enough but it is worse than that bogs down your computer big time makes it run super slow horrible whoever has written good reviews must be shills for norton avoid repeat avoid	4
1	bought system mechanic 6 pro online it repairs but reports problems but you cannot get information at all none of the modules report what is being done if you need assistance forget it all you get from iolo is go see the faq 's i do n't think humans work there just a computer that generates emails stay away from this company ! !	4
1	after installing in sony vgc ra810 system crashed unable to find c have been waiting two days for a legitimate answer from i0l0 and now have two case phone attempts are met with automated replys the same as the internet the amazon seller has been very helpfull so i can not blame him if i ever get my computer running i plan on visiting all sites that support reviews with a word of advice about lack of human product support by iolo as for now i wanted to get this out to amazon customers so i am using my neighbors computer	4
1	why buy iolo system mechanic when you can get malware for free \? i installed pro 7 and it gave many many problems iolo did not respond to my emails so i uninstalled their uninstaller did not work either	4
1	my daughter \( 13 \) and i tried the number devil together she has add and has difficulty with math we found the intro to be too long and the games boring this game did not keep her attention at all we also tried math blaster and would recommend that game instead i am glad others have found this game helpful unfortunately it didnt for us	4
1	i bought this software two days ago installed it on my laptop and all of a sudden my network connection was messed up i could not figure how to connect to the wireless or wired network my other computers were still able to connect so it was a problem with the computer with fix it installed after much work i finally uninstalled the software and right away was able to get back on the network i am not sure if there is some kind of firewall setting with the software or if it was just the software itself anyway i am unsure whether to reinstall this software or not	4
1	i installed the product hoping it would help me with all the errors i was getting \( i have windows xp \) well 2 weeks and 200 it 's what it took for me to have my computer repaired it would not let me log on to windows i got errors i 've never seen and it completely messed all my files big waste of money i had to re format my hard drive and my computer is only 1 month old ! !	4
1	purchased fix it utilities 6 a few weeks back and installed it on my desk top running windows xp immediately after installation i ran the program and repaired only the minimum errors as recommended however many programs on my computer would not run and could not access many files called vcom for help but their solution did not work i was even unable to get system restore to correct the problem i had to re format my hard drive and re install all my programs and files i cannot recommend this registry repair	4
1	do n't buy this software even if you get it free after rebates it corrupts your windows registry and makes things worse for you you will feel your computer is far better after uninstalling this software instead just follow these steps to keep your pc fast 1 run disk cleanup \( provided by xp \) 2 defrag your hard disk regularly3 clean the registry \( there are lot of free software available to clean your registry \) that 's all that you need to keep your computer fit no need to use softwares such as fix i	4
1	i'm not a tech guy but from a simple user 's standpoint there is no reason whatsoever to change unless you just have to have a small change in appearance about 1 2 the software you might have purchased that worked with xp wo n't work with vista i was thinking that vista would be an improvement but there is nothing there just some minor superficial changes as far as i can tell maybe for it people there might be some big difference but for your average user there is no improvement at all save your money do n't buy it	4
1	you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have 15 years of outlook and you ca n't print a single address label or an envelope with one click \( or 10 clicks for that matter \) there is no function to easily print out mailing labels either lets remember outlook is a contact manager next to many other things maybe outlook 2010 will be the answer	4
1	i have 7 and 9 year old boys that play chess they are also both very computer savy i bought this program to buff up their chess playing skills and stategy but they say they find it boring and do n't think it has anything to do with playing chess because the game pieces and boards look nothing like the traditional game pieces the characters are very difficult to identify and confusing they are cartoon renditions dressed up in costumes i 'd save your money and look for a better chess program or get your child involved in an actual chess club	4
1	after i installed this software my windows xp system shut down with the dreaded blue screen of death i'm still trying to return my system to its former useable state ! beware	4
1	does n't work on mac like it says that it does louses up your machine not worth i	4
1	the problem with this game starts with the introductury movie it develops slowly goes on forever suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play once game play finally does start my child found the games boring and the transitions between the games tediously slow cute characters zero edutainment it was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day	4
1	i guess i'm spoiled by the i spy games i 've purchased for my children this game has an enormous amount of story it 's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television interaction is confusing and frustrating i 'd rate this lower but it 's clear that a lot of work went into the animation which is top notch i just would n't classify this as a learning game	4
1	the retail price is totally wrong i could get it for cheaper from another vendor	4
1	cakewalk s advertisement saying something like no experience needed to operate this software is in my mind mis leading at least and a down right lie at most i 've had it now for about three weeks work on it most days usually in the middle of the night so i can really concentrate on it and still cant get anything out of it all i wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work blues pop country so far nothing and i am thinking about giving up i can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk i have ever seen beware unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed	4
1	this is the slowest operating system i have ever used the first time i installed xp home i did n't see what was so bad about it but when we tried installing it on our new gateway machine it imedettly slowed all system operations down to a crawl even my brother 's laptop which is a very fast machine has xp pro and it randomly slows down do n't get this operating system it 's slow buggy and expensive	4
1	i am not at all happy with this product the instructions are terrible and the program is not at all intuitive it was a total waste of my money and time	4
1	i was able to install most of ms office but am having printer conpatability problems i was n't able to install vitural pc properly and get error messages when i boot up i'm going to have to the mac store genius bar to get the problems straightened out all in all i think that every thing will work ok but i'm going to have yto travel over 50 miles to get it fixed maybe it 's best to stick with mac software for macs i 've never has a problem installing them	4
1	this product arrived with 2 number 2 installation disks for the virtual pc and no number 1 as a result i was not able to install vpc which was one of the reasons i purchased this overly expensive product the office part does not seem that signicant an upgrade to the office x that i had so it is both an aggravation and a rip off	4
1	i purchased the upgrade since i 'd already bought both office v x and virtual pc 6 1 last year the biggest letdown is that microsoft 's promised support for the g5 is nearly non existent i have a dual processor g5 with an ati radeon 9800 card \( apple \) and after trying to install virtual pc 7 three times i cannot get a vm to work it did install \( and work \) flawlessly on my g4 powerbook googling for reviews finds it 's very hit or miss but if \( when \) it misses you 'll regret investing the extra in an immature product	4
1	this product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs the tech support emailed that any cd or dvd copy software had to be removed i guess that sort of makes a dvd or cd r w drive rather pointless i removed the copy software and still have bad results about 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it maybe it does n't like my corporate virus protection i find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky i rate this product as totally useless	4
1	we may never know if we like this product as the amazon box was empty when it arrived we have had no help from amazon compusa nor the maker of this software after numerous emails and phone calls this was my son 's christmas present and he 's still waiting at this rate we 'll end up with the opinion that we should n't order software online	4
1	darkbasic is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games to make a commercial quality game in this language would be lunacy basic just is n't quite flexible enough to do that with ease and the darkbasic renderer looks very very ugly however basic remains very easy to learn and darkbasic has some commands that are fun to toy with if you 're trying to get into serious game development learn c and either learn how to use libraries like opengl or directx or start modding a popular engine like the unreal engine or source and make sure you 've learned a good deal of physics and math	4
1	this program is good if you want to mold the matrix bit by bit but if you want to make games in a snap spring for the professional and get a level editor on a darkbasic website	4
1	i got this as a present about two years ago and i have had mixed feelings i like it but i get really frustrated because the program is buggy i cannot create a standalone executable and the program has random bugs also it is very hard to create proffesional type games be aware that the machine you run standalone programs on has to have a video card regardless of whether you use it or not in conclusion good idea but very buggy	4
1	thought the cards would be like broderbund 's american gretings creatacard platinum 8 software but it was not and i did not like what i got	4
1	save your money does'nt bill already have enough of it \? i wish bill had to pay us for all the wasted time and headaches don't worry for a few dollars more you can fix it what a racket	4
1	i have used turbo tax for as long as i can remember i have always purchased their business and their personal tax products generally i had been satisfied however this year after spending much time over many months working on a complicated return turbo tax dumped all the data including that which was saved many times over several months it corrupted all but 2kb of data and ca n't even open that of course you ca n't get a person via telephone or email i would give them o stars if that was an option so long intuit	4
1	if you have used the online version in the past stick with it buying it on disk does not allow you to import data from previous returns if done on line and you can not upload to myturbotax almost as if two separate companies ! plus the user interface on this software stinks bigtime very hard to navigate back and forth online version is actually better \( though i did n't try it this year \) does intuit actually employ programmers or watch real users \? they spend far too much money on useless features like videos and not enough on simple ui issues	4
1	since tax cut decided not to produce a mac version this year i got stuck with turbo tax their website promises that one may import data from the previous year 's tax cut return then you buy the thing and you find out that it requires you to load the turbo tax program and your 2004 tax cut data onto a windows machine transfer there then load it back onto the mac for this to work so like a chump i borrowed a friend 's windows machine and did all this but it does n't work not at all and it takes a lot of time to find that out tried every workaround i could think of nope it does n't work	4
1	after purchasing this product i found there were several problems with scanning i contacted nuance \( who purchased scansoft \) to ask for assistance from technical support however i then learned they want 9 95 for each incident when a request is made by email not by phone by email after putting out a great deal of money for this product i should not have to pay 9 95 for assistance with each issue that is a problem with their product save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product i regret that amazon does not allow me to give this product 0 stars	4
1	i was a real fan of omnipage until this version the scanning speed is slug like the proof reading function has is less functional the version 14 and it tends to forget the scanner settings no noticable new features where added from version 14 and this seems to be a new version for the sake of milking the client base	4
1	if you spend a good deal of your time doing ocr on books skip this program it is even slower than the previous version \( which was tortoise like \) still screws up the order of columns is very bad at reading mixed numbers and letters takes forever to move through long documents and just genreally makes you feel like you are back to using a 486 when you are working on a pentium 4 oh and do n't be fooled by the claim that it can actually create fillable forms it will take you less time to create it from scratch in word than to scan it in and then fix all the errors i'm switching to kurzweil	4
1	i purchased this item from amazon the disc had scratches and was unable to either use it or get my money back these items can not be returned	4
1	be careful if you buy this version of symantec antivirus for handhelds it will not work with microsoft mobile 2005 supposedly symantec antivirus for handhelds version 3 5 will work with mobile 2005	4
1	this software never worked after installation using the cd i bought it ask me to extend my preview your preview using this feature has expired to continue using purchase the full version today i have tried to contact the seller in vain this is very unfortunite for such people to continue hacking customers money with under rated product	4
1	this software is fine for altering digital pictures if you do not have any other programs but if you want to make exciting slideshows this software is very basic and not user friendly i had technical problems from the start you are better off using ms powerpoint than this software	4
1	this product is extremely difficult to learn i recently purchased two more expensive manuals ro learn the process and also the tutorials the company has are beyond the average users learning	4
1	i received the bundle but there is no installation key for shade le i noticed the someone else 's review stating this same problem is no longer visible so i figured i 'd post it again	4
1	buy it here and save s ! shipping cost from the uk added 46 95 to the price and a foreign debit card transaction fee of 2 51 for a waste of 49 46 that could have been spent getting additional models or get the download version and save even more as like someone else pointed out the included manual is near useless and has not improved since version 4 practical poser 6 is still the best book to get if you are serious about doing poser 6 development	4
1	taxcut did not warn me that i needed to fill out additional forms required for taking the exemption for a qualified child nor did it lead me through the schedule c like turbotax does turbotax may be more expensive but it 's well worth it to save the headaches that this program caused if you have complicated tax forms or unusual tax situations \( or prefer an intuitive program rather than something that makes you say what am i supposed to do next \? \? \? \) stick with turbotax	4
1	this program has a bug in processing 1099 r data that makes the whole software package useless to me after filling in the data from my 2005 1099 r form the program informed me that these monies were taxable in 2003 not 2005 and that these data would not be included in my 2005 return i could not find a way overide this problem also there was no apparent way to directly contact h r block to find out how to fix it after wasting a couple of hours i now have to trash the taxcut software and spend more money to purchase turbo tax which from prior years experience is relatively bug free	4
1	unfortunately this application includes only a mac os 9 \( not the mac os x as advertised \) version i cannot review the cds in general as i cannot run them why did they re publish the 1998 software in 2006 again in mac os 9 \? frustrating	4
1	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word in addtion the micro does n't work well with ms word	4
1	this is the worst thing i have ever bought i bought it because i am having some trouble in spanish in school i bought it thinking that if i gave a english word it would give you the spanish word or vise versa but all it does is give you the definition and does not give you the english word so save your self 20 dollars and do n't buy thi	4
1	although this dictionary 's contents are extensive the screen functions are relics from the dos era they are laborious and clumsy to find a word for difinition it has to be spelled perfectly there 's no list of proximations to the word entered changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor does n't show up in the entry slot if someone knows of a better software i 'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks ! ! maria mcgowan	4
1	i have been using frontpage since 1997 i am webmaster for three websites and have alway really thought this was a great program ! but ! i have only upgraded to frontpage 2000 and find that with my xp computer win xp does not support frontpage now if i want to continue with my family genealogy site and a community genealogical society site i will need to purchase and learn another program at age 70 i really do n't feel like doing that ! does anyone know if fp 2003 will work on win xp \? or how can i get my fp 2000 to work on my win xp computer \?	4
1	have tried about six times to install it i 've followed all of the online troubleshooting advice all to no avail it says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings it tells you to check the log well there are over 85k entries and even if i found the errors i do n't see any way to correct the errors when i try to run it i get starter mfc application has encountered a problem and needs to close i 'll be returning this puppy to amazon for a replacement	4
1	i am underwhelmed with the dvd rom from britannica it ia a waste of timeand money their main object is to sell britannica with snatches to createinterest these dvd roms should be sent free to arouse interest i now owntwo dvds and both are unsatisfactory	4
1	eb own words unfortunately at this time the britannica software is not compatible with windows vista we are working on developing another version of the 2007 software that will work on windows vista and we are planning to release this version in the upcoming months please check back with us in another month or so and we should have some more information about the vista compatible software but it is entirely possible that we will not have windows vista compatible version of the 2007 product available and that we will wait until the development of the 2008 software they do not offer a reasonable on line subscription	4
1	intuit charges banks extra to support mac users and many banks do n't pay so the convenience of automated transaction downloads is impossible for me on quicken mac several other features are lagging behind the windows version and for some inexplicable reason transferring data between quicken for windows and quicken for mac is n't complete or straightfoward i have n't used competing products but for mac users i recommend either running the windows quicken version \( using boot camp or parallels \) or buying another product and by all means let intuit know that their pricing practices are costing them customers	4
0	i am amazed what this program can do it is a big difference from ps 5 5 it is a new learning curve but well worth it what used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes amazon had the best price for me from a source i trust ordering from it is worth it	4
0	simply the best software out there for digital photographers graphic designers and anything having to do with digital image creation and manipulation packed with features for novices to professional advanced users the only limits are your imagination	4
0	adobe photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business it 's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user there is however a plethora of texts tutorials learning guides and even video 's to help abate the learning curve	4
0	i was afraid at first not to order directly from adobe but decided to take the cheaper route it was obviously worth it everything arrived perfectly wrapped up original cd set etc shipped in record time as well eyal	4
0	the product is easy to use like how it intergrates with ms office applications it 's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients	4
0	this is a good inexpensive gps system it does a good job of tracking your location the map is excellent the labeling is not as good as the previous version poi finder is top notch	4
0	its a great gps once its starts and detects the satellites \( sometimes it can take up to 5 mins \) i used it with iguidance and that software is the whole world of difference i can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the gps unit \( robotic sounds need to subtitle that for me please ! \)	4
0	this is my first experience with gps this product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions viewing the screen on a laptop as opposed to most of the portable gps units is a definite advantage to the user i would purchase another immediately if the need arose	4
0	it does everything i hoped for and more ! ! as a new user of acrobate i am very definitely impressed in part by the ease with which i am able to learn the program as well as its functionality !	4
0	i bought this cd for my two grandchildren for christmas they have all the other nancy drew cd 's that are out and really enjoy playing them they are a good interactive game to challenge their minds i am sure this one will too	4
0	this new nancy drew game was fun to play ! it was shipped on time and arrived in good condition	4
0	these are a favorite in the home even though we have all of them they are each different and provide hours of entertainment skills are learned while solving puzzles some include spatial manipulation of puzzle pieces and roman numerals great source of fun and learning also a desire to read the actual book and see what is different and the same between book and game	4
0	i really enjoy the nancy drew games they can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done the check list continues to update as you move through the game i look forward to each new game as it comes out and ca n't leave the computer until they are done	4
0	previously i owned colorvision 's spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it it did not include however a program for correcting the printer 's color rendition the new spyder2pro includes printfix plus this along with the monitor correction spyder2pro works very effectively i am very happy with the program for the price it is a great addition to photoshop editing the spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera i have not found any particular negatives about the program in the past i have used their tech service for fine tuning the program they were very responsive and helpful	4
0	i have read several reviews and decided the spyder2pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me i have a samsung 970p monitor with all adjustments via software the calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process i like the spyder2pro and would recommend it highly	4
0	i am very happy with it but it does n't live up to my expectations i also have the reg plus for xp and i really do n't think the extra money is worth it if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc if i did n't have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine	4
0	the product has very good themes and screen savers some the other functions are not useful to me but hopefully i will use them in the future	4
0	product came in a timely manner and i love it easy to use and fun too	4
0	extremely helpful and superior graphics and choices to change your computers them	4
0	this is an easy product to use it saves you when a disk drive fills up and you want to use the same partiction but need more space it will grab it from another hard drive it is also useful in setting up a d drive for documents and and e drive for programs it is useful to have windows on c alone there are fewer crashes michael common	4
0	it 's a useful tool combined with another norton 's products ghost you can easily perform pc maintanence using these tools	4
0	it has some nice upgrades from version 6 it is quicker than the previous version highlighting text is a bit easier it caused a few problems with my officejet 5510xi and its ports but i found a patch for the officejet and all is well it is a product that is helpful in my work	4
0	the new adobe acrobat has a cleaner look and feel and is more user friendly i especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any microsoft application which allow you to create a pdf in one click rather than having to go to file and print some functionality as before with some new organization and better look feel	4
0	after using 7 0 for a few weeks i find that this is the best yet the speed of opening attachments and the compression when making them is fabulous i highly recommend anyone to upgrade to 7 0	4
0	version 7 installed without a hitch and has increased the productivity of my business because it also works much better than version 5	4
0	i upgraded from version 5 i do n't use very many of the features but the big difference i see is files sizes seem to be greatly reduced something i would scan and be 10mb now might be 2mb this is just opinion nothing scientific the interface takes some getting used to a bit different overall for the price \( 99 less 20 rebate \) a great deal	4
0	i find that the new version 7 of adobe acrobat loads faster than version 5 both stand alone and within my internet browser also the new version is better integrated with the browser and with microsoft office i believe adobe heard and responded to the complaints about version 6 there are many other features which i have yet to try but certainly look worthwhile kudos for what i see as a substantial improvement i recommend	4
0	i have tried a few other photo editing products but i always come back to adobe easy to use and excellent results	4
0	the software does a lot of great things you can start basic and work your way up to the more difficult tasks the system does run a bit slow and takes a long time to shut off but other than that it is great software	4
0	i started with elements 3 and thought it worked great i have elements 4 and can see it got better	4
0	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school i used it because its what is being used at my office i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note \( which i really have n't been able to find a use for \) otherwise it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past	4
0	works fine like several other office packages lacks database program access	4
0	my daughter likes it because it uses the same format her high school teachers use also she likes the research tools that it provides and it 's easy to use it 's very practical she uses it a lot	4
0	this program does what it says it does limit you to only 3 loadings of the product on your computer so if you have more than 3 computers you have to buy another program	4
0	ms office student and teacher edition 2003 is a versatile tool you can use for different purposes office documents and presentations school work and projects correspondences scrapbooks pictures etc truly a great addition to your computer software	4
0	i bought this for my 3 children who are already taking computer classes in middle school the license allows you to install it on 3 computers so for 130 its a great deal considering that a single license of a full version of office is couple hundred	4
0	i have been running windows xp sp2 and would never want to go back to windows me or windows 98 with the xp i rarely need to re boot my system and my pc no longer freezes up there is a built in windows firewall plus a pop up blocker which are both awesome the system is much safer and i have never had a virus worm or trojan horse while running the windows xp home with a good internet security virus program one thing make sure you have at least 256 mb of space available in your pc before starting to download as this does require at least that get it ! you wo n't be disappointed	4
0	absolutely the easiest upgrade of a microsoft os that i 've ever done as a retired hardware engineer i 've done a lot in the past it 's one sweet os	4
0	worked as expected a few hardware glitches but that was to be expected	4
0	this was used to upgrade my operating system at work it went fairly well actually much better than i had hoped	4
0	simple it loads like a blaze sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat but the speed of 7 0 alone makes it worth every dime especially if your current acrobat is the half baked clunky 6 0 x that burst through the gates before it had legs	4
0	i have been using v 7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it it loads very fast \( unlike all other adobe versions \) the conversion to pdf from doc or ppt files also is much quicker i have not encountered any problems yet but its only been 7 days since i am using it definitely worth the upgrade	4
0	version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become more than anything version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely providing complete control over your document who can open print or even comment on it but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade as it cures many of the ills of the previous version best of all adobe has kept the price the same very nice	4
0	great sw easy to learn and good graphics really helps visualize the space when you can see it 3d could be improved if numerous similar objects could be selected and changed simultaneously \( e g windows doors cabinets to get all with the same materials colors hardware rather than one at a time very labor intensive \) should warn users to select create a style and then copy paste them where needed also difficult \( maybe impossible because i have n't figured out how to do it \) to change a room 's house 's overall style once you start a given design	4
0	this package is very complete and easy to use took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts et a lot of the tools are intuitive and simple	4
0	there are complaints about win xp sp2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems it is too expensive but it is the standard at so many companies big and small around the world i just wanted to say that anyone who gives windows xp sp2 a one star rating really does n't understand much about the windows operating system and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general the price is a bit high but windows is what it is a dominant operating system	4
0	i do not why the others had these problems with windows xp i have run this program since it came out 2001 \? except for the danger of attack by viruses i have had no trouble as long as enough ram is installed a minimum of 500 750 is essential with the addition of antivirus software and service pack 2 i feel fairly secure	4
0	this is an all around awesome product i have had great experiences with the program and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school 's yearbook anyone one who says it does n't have the basics is pretty much lying to you it has anything you 'll ever need and more the people who review this product poorly do so because they do n't know how to use everything in it the only problem i 've ever had is learing everything you can do with it otherwise it is perfect	4
0	this product is so good i love it ! i can make my own mp3 's make disk copies and archive data files i'm curious to see how dvd movies are made with this product i'm very happy with this item the price is very pleasing as well	4
0	this is the easiest way i 've ever been able to make cd 's it realy makes photo cd 's easy and produces a great product a group of frinds and us just got back from mexico and i put all of everyones photos in separate files on a cd the automatic slide show goes through the differ n't files as if they were just one file with no seperation but the pictures are still separated in each person 's file for ease when printing and so forth it 's great wish i would have had this years ago	4
0	i have used this software from the very first as a paintshop product and it still delivers it has improved with this version i reckon i have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best for more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program what it claims to do it does well if only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones a simple histogram would make this a top ranking program	4
0	i liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times i always shoot with nikon raw format it has hung a couple of times and i had to kill it after waiting for 10 15 minutes	4
0	the service was good and it came undamaged and the product was easy to use and it has been very satisfactory for my needs the description of the product was accurate	4
0	although not perfect i 've used roxio cd dvd 6 platinum and nero 6 and returned to using this product this should also be called quot burning cd 's for dummies quot it is that easy to use i 've also used it to burn vcd 's without a hitch if all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler this is for you	4
0	this program does exactly as i expect i am very pleased	4
0	i had a very old version of hallmark studio do n't even remember how old wanted to update i installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features lots of cards to choose from very very pretty colors the event planner is great too ! the only thing i would change is the ability change font in the planner and move written info by tabbing otherwise it 's a wonderful program highly recommended ! ! satisfie	4
0	i buy a lot of cards and they are always hallmartk because i there quality is wonderful the kit is of the same high quality it also lets you personalize them with your own text and your own pictures it was one of the best things i ever bought and i know i well use it a lot	4
0	purchased for my mom to use and she loves it she says it is easy to use and she really enjoys making personalized cards for people if she 's happy with it so am i	4
0	i am enjoying this new card shop they have refreshing great cards others do not my friends and family that i have made cards for think they are the best also keep making more and more thank	4
0	this program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful installation is self explanatory this also goes for the prepararation of cards ect detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse pointer over various portions of the graphics if you are looking for an easy to use program with great results this is the one to get with the cost of cards being what it is this program will pay for itself very quickly relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized i recommend this program highly	4
0	i am teaching myself japanese i want to learn more languages i learned german french and korean i want to learn korean because i have a friend who speaks korean this software is very awesome ! ! ! this can really help students who are taking french or spanish to get a good review if you find a language you want to learn from this software good luck with your studies and have fun	4
0	this is a great item for any collector or new fans to the x men all the older along with the newer issues look great the cd includes all issues of the uncanny x men \( 1 461 \) along with giant sized and annual issues there is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the xaiver institute could it of had more content maybe but this will keep one busy for a long time with easy maneuverabiltity this is a highly addictive cd with virtually months of entertainment	4
0	nice collection of the complete issues though of course one knows going in that the later marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story which is somewhat frustrating and the earliest years are of course somewhat crude \( heretically even the kirby artwork in the first year is \) but very nice to have in an affordable edition regardless of the flaws \( though best viewed with a large monitor	4
0	this is a great collection to get if you would like to read the comic 's from the past at a great price	4
0	i could n't have found a better x men product every mag has its own pdf the readability is only limited by the size of your monitor	4
0	all i have to say is 485 comics for 40 dollars or about 40 years worth that 's like a dollar a year you do the math it 's an amazing deal also quality is great and you can print them if you want	4
0	i loved the x men cartoon in the 90s and fox and always liked reading the graphic novels in barnes and noble and the like however i just never had the time or money to get into it like i wanted this collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years reading the first 60 issues was a trip seeing how the characters were developed both the art and their literary personality if you 're interested in the x men whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart for 40 bucks you can know it all \( almost \)	4
0	while i love the content and the overall idea it seems they seriously skimped on the packaging all you get outside of the outer box is a cd in a paper envelope no jewel case book insert etc perhaps it 's on the cd	4
0	this new version of illustrator is great glad i upgraded ! the live trace feature is cool	4
0	i was waiting for cs2 after using the cs there are too many problems in cs and i am very happy with cs2 now the software is a lot easier to use less problems i have been using illustrator since illustrator 4 cs2 is definitly better than ever !	4
0	not bad however in version 10 was able to use cntrl to zoom in used the on the number pad now this function does n't work and the only that works is that in the top row of the keyboard the zoom out in the number pad still works but not the plus i say that 's not good why ruin things with an upgrade	4
0	as one who is not an accountant i found quickbooks premier non profit edition 2006 to be very easy to learn read the books that come with the software before you dive in	4
0	maybe i'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product to accomplish the reports that i need i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose so it gets the report done just not as nicely as i had hoped tracking work is made incredibly simple rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software	4
0	i 've been using studio for years and while i definitely had reliability problems with studio 10 0 10 6 has been very reliable and beta testing 10 7 shows me it is just getting better i tried premiere elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things and it was much slower burning a simple dvd image and it simply does n't do hd which i 've started playing with i'm sticking with studio and i make a dvd just about every week with my kids' videos i do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean	4
0	i have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product i have created numerous videos of my children 's escapades and sporting events i do have one warning however provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen the software is extremely intuitive and easy to use my wildest expectations were exceeded	4
0	i just upgraded my webster software to this version for winxp it 's ok and does the job it 's intended to perform but i liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels just a matter of display preference so it 's not that important to every user	4
0	this is a great productbecause once you install ityou need not use the cd agai	4
0	it is wondeful software simple easy to use user friendly and very accurate in the pronunciation buy this cd do n't waste your money on the subscription at merriam webster 's website also try the medical dictionary it is as equally superb	4
0	i have a question about this i'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it is that possible on this program \? cause my friend has acid pro 4 0 and that is really awesome but it 's like 400 and i dont have that kinda money wut i liked about acid pro 4 0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that so im wondering if you can do that on this program if u have an answer for me e mail me at peepilott aol com	4

0	excellent product for backup with the intelligence built into it highly recommended	4
0	i loved the experience especially with the smart picks smart templates smart search and smart rank i recommend it to any user very happy with the product ! thanks eisenworld thanks alohabob	4
0	i am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side this purchase has paid for itself over and over now that i do n't have to run to someone else for art it was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images i guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images i did and i love this product ! ! ! !	4
0	good for those looking for a vector collection not so good for those looking for photo clip art as photos are high res at 200 dpi i suppose the photos are useful to an extent but the usefulness is limited by size i was looking for vector art so i am satisfied	4
0	i 've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and i finally broke down and bought it very pleased with everything included lots of stuff to use and not just cheezy clip art lots of boarders symbols brush strokes etc the bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc \( disc 3 was actually disc 30 \) one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked	4
0	i run the after school program at the local jr high where i work we try to push the importance of computer skills on the children i just upgraded to the 800 000 clip art library we use these images for just about every project i have never wanted a certain type of image and not been able to find it ! ! !	4
0	this was a wonderful game ! hours of good solid game play an interesting mystery and intriguing characters a chance to interact with aquatic life i learned how to work a gps and a ham radio it was so much fun the puzzles were a good mix of ability levels and types word puzzles spatial puzzles problem solving ones i can completely recommend this game	4
0	i had a lot of fun playing this game and look foward to playing more nancy drew products it was interesting and i could n't wait to solve the mystery ! i enjoyed myself a lot !	4
0	a good choice for newbies that love adventure games nancy drew 's games are perfect fresh relaxing but also give you a lot of thinking some times	4
0	i am very happy with it but it does n't live up to my expectations i also have the reg plus for xp and i really do n't think the extra money is worth it if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc if i did n't have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine	4
0	the product has very good themes and screen savers some the other functions are not useful to me but hopefully i will use them in the future	4
0	product came in a timely manner and i love it easy to use and fun too	4
0	not a complicated application but it successfully repartitioned a 100g drive into 3rds on a new lenovo laptop with xp sp2 i would recommend using the dos version which you can get just by booting on the cd requires no install you can simply boot make the changes and it is done seems to be very straightforward and i would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with windows running	4
0	i installed a wd 320g usb drive to use as a backup drive i used the hd backup software to do auto backups unfortunatly the software took controll of the entire drive and i could not use it as you would a normal drive \( drag n drop \) or access a particular file i used partition magic to reclaim my usb drive and in the process i partitioned the drive the drive now works as i want it to i have control ! partition magic was very easy to use and didi a perfect job	4
0	i am amazed what this program can do it is a big difference from ps 5 5 it is a new learning curve but well worth it what used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes amazon had the best price for me from a source i trust ordering from it is worth it	4
0	photoshop is incredibly awesome ! ! ! and in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program it is a must have for them however the learning curve here is extremely steep this program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale there are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including photoshop elements	4
0	i still have a lot of learning to do but just what i 've been able to do with photos the last 2 weeks is amazing i do n't know why i waited so long to buy this thing	4
0	adobe photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business it 's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user there is however a plethora of texts tutorials learning guides and even video 's to help abate the learning curve	4
0	i have fireworks corel paint and now cs2 to choose from perhaps it 's my familiarity with photoshop that makes me so partial to it but i feel it 's the best imagery software on the market i upgraded to this from ps7 so i missed out on cs but from what i can tell this is the smoothest running version yet i 've not encountered any problems with system or support i guess everyone 's experience is different but this is great software and the vanishing point feature is just brilliant	4
0	the new adobe acrobat has a cleaner look and feel and is more user friendly i especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any microsoft application which allow you to create a pdf in one click rather than having to go to file and print some functionality as before with some new organization and better look feel	4
0	after using 7 0 for a few weeks i find that this is the best yet the speed of opening attachments and the compression when making them is fabulous i highly recommend anyone to upgrade to 7 0	4
0	i love this adobe product it works very well for me only a couple of minor glitches it keeps asking me to re register but that 's only a minor annoyance overall it is a very good product	4
0	version 7 installed without a hitch and has increased the productivity of my business because it also works much better than version 5	4
0	the software does a lot of great things you can start basic and work your way up to the more difficult tasks the system does run a bit slow and takes a long time to shut off but other than that it is great software	4
0	i started with elements 3 and thought it worked great i have elements 4 and can see it got better	4
0	even if one could afford the full photoshop cs or cs2 elements has it all for the photo enthusiast elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation quick fix and standard edit the browser is adequate though i 've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos many of the features of the full program can be found in elements like layers plug ins for effects and a variety of adjustmens with a little patience and experimenting as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you 'll be surprised how creative you can be this program does not have the learning curve of the full photoshop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer	4
0	with plenty of opportunity to be creative the only downfall is that there is no way to download more cards from the internet all in all though i would highly recommend this software	4
0	help ! this program will not let me print all of my address 's unto christmas labels when you go down to the arrow to check all address 's it will not move any help would be appreciated thank	4
0	this suite of applications is excellent they run much faster on my mac than even the equivalent mac programs i love them and use them quite happily every single day a great value for students and teachers	4
0	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school i used it because its what is being used at my office i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note \( which i really have n't been able to find a use for \) otherwise it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past	4
0	works fine like several other office packages lacks database program access	4
0	love this product i like having these microsoft programs without paying the price for the full versios	4
0	this program does what it says it does limit you to only 3 loadings of the product on your computer so if you have more than 3 computers you have to buy another program	4
0	ms office student and teacher edition 2003 is a versatile tool you can use for different purposes office documents and presentations school work and projects correspondences scrapbooks pictures etc truly a great addition to your computer software	4
0	absolutely the easiest upgrade of a microsoft os that i 've ever done as a retired hardware engineer i 've done a lot in the past it 's one sweet os	4
0	i followed all instructions before i attempted to do an upgrade from windows me to windows xp infact the more i read the more i was told to do a clean upgrade so i did a backup and removed programs that were not compatible and i got some instructions off the internet on how to do it and it went very smooth i love what it gave me clean upgrade means a clean start you remove everything and start with a new program	4
0	this was used to upgrade my operating system at work it went fairly well actually much better than i had hoped	4
0	i have been using v 7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it it loads very fast \( unlike all other adobe versions \) the conversion to pdf from doc or ppt files also is much quicker i have not encountered any problems yet but its only been 7 days since i am using it definitely worth the upgrade	4
0	version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become more than anything version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely providing complete control over your document who can open print or even comment on it but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade as it cures many of the ills of the previous version best of all adobe has kept the price the same very nice	4
0	i was afraid at first not to order directly from adobe but decided to take the cheaper route it was obviously worth it everything arrived perfectly wrapped up original cd set etc shipped in record time as well eyal	4
0	i feel home designer suite 6 is a good value for the price it obviously is not a full blown pro program which i think many people expect however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning it is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual or on the provided cd	4
0	this package is very complete and easy to use took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts et a lot of the tools are intuitive and simple	4
0	there are complaints about win xp sp2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems it is too expensive but it is the standard at so many companies big and small around the world i just wanted to say that anyone who gives windows xp sp2 a one star rating really does n't understand much about the windows operating system and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general the price is a bit high but windows is what it is a dominant operating system	4
0	the product is easy to use like how it intergrates with ms office applications it 's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients	4
0	i have viewed pdf files for years never made one before the installation was simple and converting word excel or other files to pdf is one click away only annoying thing is the software insisting that it install toolbars everywhere but that is easily remedied	4
0	i'm a longtime mac user and for re naming and archiving and cataloguing thousands of images iview media pro is the best i really like the feature that let 's you produce and publish on line galleries of your images without any code or html experience using only a very simpe interface and you 're ready to go for the full time photographer or amateur i highly recomend it	4
0	this is an all around awesome product i have had great experiences with the program and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school 's yearbook anyone one who says it does n't have the basics is pretty much lying to you it has anything you 'll ever need and more the people who review this product poorly do so because they do n't know how to use everything in it the only problem i 've ever had is learing everything you can do with it otherwise it is perfect	4
0	this product is so good i love it ! i can make my own mp3 's make disk copies and archive data files i'm curious to see how dvd movies are made with this product i'm very happy with this item the price is very pleasing as well	4
0	this is the easiest way i 've ever been able to make cd 's it realy makes photo cd 's easy and produces a great product a group of frinds and us just got back from mexico and i put all of everyones photos in separate files on a cd the automatic slide show goes through the differ n't files as if they were just one file with no seperation but the pictures are still separated in each person 's file for ease when printing and so forth it 's great wish i would have had this years ago	4
0	i have used this software from the very first as a paintshop product and it still delivers it has improved with this version i reckon i have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best for more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program what it claims to do it does well if only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones a simple histogram would make this a top ranking program	4
0	i liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times i always shoot with nikon raw format it has hung a couple of times and i had to kill it after waiting for 10 15 minutes	4
0	i bought this cd for my two grandchildren for christmas they have all the other nancy drew cd 's that are out and really enjoy playing them they are a good interactive game to challenge their minds i am sure this one will too	4
0	this new nancy drew game was fun to play ! it was shipped on time and arrived in good condition	4
0	i liked how you could go underwater and try to find things i also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for minette and yourself i did n't like how the tea was so hard though i could n't figure it out but finally i got it i liked that you had to fight minette too it was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face over all danger by design was a fun game	4
0	i really enjoy the nancy drew games they can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done the check list continues to update as you move through the game i look forward to each new game as it comes out and ca n't leave the computer until they are done	4
0	although not perfect i 've used roxio cd dvd 6 platinum and nero 6 and returned to using this product this should also be called quot burning cd 's for dummies quot it is that easy to use i 've also used it to burn vcd 's without a hitch if all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler this is for you	4
0	this program does exactly as i expect i am very pleased	4
0	i buy a lot of cards and they are always hallmartk because i there quality is wonderful the kit is of the same high quality it also lets you personalize them with your own text and your own pictures it was one of the best things i ever bought and i know i well use it a lot	4
0	purchased for my mom to use and she loves it she says it is easy to use and she really enjoys making personalized cards for people if she 's happy with it so am i	4
0	i am enjoying this new card shop they have refreshing great cards others do not my friends and family that i have made cards for think they are the best also keep making more and more thank	4
0	this program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful installation is self explanatory this also goes for the prepararation of cards ect detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse pointer over various portions of the graphics if you are looking for an easy to use program with great results this is the one to get with the cost of cards being what it is this program will pay for itself very quickly relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized i recommend this program highly	4
0	i rate this 5 stars based on my knowledge of the fantastic four and x men complete editions i'm writing this review to warn people about my receiving 2 defective copies of the spider man version from amazon i 'll have to try a 3rd time	4
0	this is a great item for any collector or new fans to the x men all the older along with the newer issues look great the cd includes all issues of the uncanny x men \( 1 461 \) along with giant sized and annual issues there is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the xaiver institute could it of had more content maybe but this will keep one busy for a long time with easy maneuverabiltity this is a highly addictive cd with virtually months of entertainment	4
0	nice collection of the complete issues though of course one knows going in that the later marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story which is somewhat frustrating and the earliest years are of course somewhat crude \( heretically even the kirby artwork in the first year is \) but very nice to have in an affordable edition regardless of the flaws \( though best viewed with a large monitor	4
0	i could n't have found a better x men product every mag has its own pdf the readability is only limited by the size of your monitor	4
0	all i have to say is 485 comics for 40 dollars or about 40 years worth that 's like a dollar a year you do the math it 's an amazing deal also quality is great and you can print them if you want	4
0	this new version of illustrator is great glad i upgraded ! the live trace feature is cool	4
0	i was waiting for cs2 after using the cs there are too many problems in cs and i am very happy with cs2 now the software is a lot easier to use less problems i have been using illustrator since illustrator 4 cs2 is definitly better than ever !	4
0	not bad however in version 10 was able to use cntrl to zoom in used the on the number pad now this function does n't work and the only that works is that in the top row of the keyboard the zoom out in the number pad still works but not the plus i say that 's not good why ruin things with an upgrade	4
0	as one who is not an accountant i found quickbooks premier non profit edition 2006 to be very easy to learn read the books that come with the software before you dive in	4
0	maybe i'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product to accomplish the reports that i need i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose so it gets the report done just not as nicely as i had hoped tracking work is made incredibly simple rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software	4
0	i have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product i have created numerous videos of my children 's escapades and sporting events i do have one warning however provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen the software is extremely intuitive and easy to use my wildest expectations were exceeded	4
0	previously i owned colorvision 's spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it it did not include however a program for correcting the printer 's color rendition the new spyder2pro includes printfix plus this along with the monitor correction spyder2pro works very effectively i am very happy with the program for the price it is a great addition to photoshop editing the spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera i have not found any particular negatives about the program in the past i have used their tech service for fine tuning the program they were very responsive and helpful	4
0	i have read several reviews and decided the spyder2pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me i have a samsung 970p monitor with all adjustments via software the calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process i like the spyder2pro and would recommend it highly	4
0	i installed it in my new computer with the easy to follow steps and i find that it gives me wonderful protection i would recommend this product to everyone i am very satisfied i feel my computer is very well protected	4
0	i just upgraded my webster software to this version for winxp it 's ok and does the job it 's intended to perform but i liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels just a matter of display preference so it 's not that important to every user	4
0	this is a great productbecause once you install ityou need not use the cd agai	4
0	it is wondeful software simple easy to use user friendly and very accurate in the pronunciation buy this cd do n't waste your money on the subscription at merriam webster 's website also try the medical dictionary it is as equally superb	4
0	this is my first experience with gps this product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions viewing the screen on a laptop as opposed to most of the portable gps units is a definite advantage to the user i would purchase another immediately if the need arose	4
0	i have a question about this i'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it is that possible on this program \? cause my friend has acid pro 4 0 and that is really awesome but it 's like 400 and i dont have that kinda money wut i liked about acid pro 4 0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that so im wondering if you can do that on this program if u have an answer for me e mail me at peepilott aol com	4
0	this one is definately the best out of all of the previous acid music programs it has a ton of loops a really cool looking skin and much more options than in acid 1 0 or 2 0 it comes with two cds one of them has the application on it with some loops and the other cd has nothing but loops and demo songs ! it has over 1 600 unique loops ! definately a good buy for those who really liked any of the previous acid musics	4
0	having trouble figuring out how to make a corner cabinet for sinks any help will be appreciated kroh	4
0	this is a good package for backing up your pc fairly intuitive although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so i could select the right stuff to backup it uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup the downside of that is you ca n't just select a file to restore you must go through the restore process you can select a single file but it takes a bit of time runs automatically and unobtrusively so it wo n't interfere with your current work	4
0	i am not a computer person but found this to be easy easy easy	4
0	excellent product for backup with the intelligence built into it highly recommended	4
0	i loved the experience especially with the smart picks smart templates smart search and smart rank i recommend it to any user very happy with the product ! thanks eisenworld thanks alohabob	4
0	this is unbelievable it can tell the importance of the stuff on my pc and i also can set a weekly backup task on my pc this is fantastic it is so straigh forward and easy to use i will definately recommend this product to everyone i know well done alohabob ! ! !	4
0	good for those looking for a vector collection not so good for those looking for photo clip art as photos are high res at 200 dpi i suppose the photos are useful to an extent but the usefulness is limited by size i was looking for vector art so i am satisfied	4
0	i 've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and i finally broke down and bought it very pleased with everything included lots of stuff to use and not just cheezy clip art lots of boarders symbols brush strokes etc the bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc \( disc 3 was actually disc 30 \) one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked	4
0	i am so pleased with this purchase ! ! under normal circumstances if i spend anything over 1 00 i get caught in a spiral of buyers regret this is a feeling that i have grown accustomed to when i received the 800 000 through the mail i shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images i could play with i was astonished ! then i realized something or rather a lack of something i felt no remorse for buying this ! i finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages labels calendars scrapbooks and everything else i wanted to do	4
0	great program but the fact that you ca n't lock the toolbar into place leads to major amounts of time wasted homesite kind of peaked at version 3 when it was run by alaire	4
0	this was a wonderful game ! hours of good solid game play an interesting mystery and intriguing characters a chance to interact with aquatic life i learned how to work a gps and a ham radio it was so much fun the puzzles were a good mix of ability levels and types word puzzles spatial puzzles problem solving ones i can completely recommend this game	4
0	i had a lot of fun playing this game and look foward to playing more nancy drew products it was interesting and i could n't wait to solve the mystery ! i enjoyed myself a lot !	4
0	a good choice for newbies that love adventure games nancy drew 's games are perfect fresh relaxing but also give you a lot of thinking some times	4
0	this has been a good purchase for us we are in northern italy for about 7 weeks and needed to navigate a number of cities for several business meetings and just to find our way around it has been an invaluable tool we have still used physical maps to a certain extent but in finding the shortest routes and other points of interest this has helped us never to be lost \( so far !	4
0	i'm planning a trip to europe \( of course \) and it help a lot with millageand since i plan on using my gps from my streets and trip then i figure that everything is gonna be a o	4
0	going to europe this spring and needed this software to plan stops etc on our three week trek this is excellant as is their usa software	4
0	i'm planning a motorcylce trip in italy this summer and the program gives me all the info i need on routes and sites of intertest along the way overall a great product	4
0	if you have used ms streets trips then you 'll know your way around autoroute we are using this to plan a trip to europe next may based on my knowledge of locations in britian the software appears to be pretty accurate if you want to use this with a gps that does not come bundled with the package expect some frustration i still have not figured out how to get it to talk to my usb based garmin unit i think it is possible just do not know how	4
0	easy to install and get started i purchased it to manage my digital photo 's and not to do sophisticated picture editing or enhancements for publishing it 's been easy to use for my purposes if you are planning on doing professional level editing or graphic manipulation do more homework on the robustness of this product i ca n't comment on it 's capabilities for that purpose	4
0	i love this product i had a sample version of it prior to that expired and i needed to have the full edition it came in a timely fashion as well i am very pleased	4
0	this is a very extensive volume of expert advice on how to use windows xp and so far i have found it helpful although a bit too technical that is not compatible with my xp	4
0	i have used the hallmark card studio software for 6 or 7 years and the 2006 version is superior to the 2004 version i like having fresh cards to choose from every year or two	4
0	i have the older version which was great but does n't seem to work on win xp both do a great job especially when you need an emergency card 2006 edition has a great added feature of being able to choose the size format for your card big plus the graphics are nice and there are many choices it 's a good deal at the price	4
0	i think this program is fantastic i have used it many times so far and have gotten many great compliments	4
0	very easy to use and provides a very wide range of cards and other items excellent product dav	4
0	i checked around before making this purchase and amazon had the best price for print shop i love it i 've used it for a couple of projects and i have no complaints it 's like a one stop shopping for all your publishing needs	4
0	i have been using various versions of print shop for years i am very impressed with the number of new inovations of this new versioon of print sho	4
0	learn catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base however i have taken about 5 years of spanish and found the cd to be fairly basic and while catalan differs in many ways many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope there are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist i definitely have benefitted from this cd because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it overall great for beginners and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge	4
0	av materials for catalan are very difficult to find but catalan is certainly worth investigating and this makes for a highly pleasant intro now if only eurotalk would come up with a second cd	4
0	remember this is a software program and may require you to purchase appropriate hardware to compliment ! pro 's easy to install somewhat intuitive to use up and running in no time imports digital video fairly simply speed of production is directly related to your equipped home computer stability of program is strong point does what it says it can do did n't make any coaster on first attempts to use finish product runs well on all dvd players con 's needs more style templates needs an imbedded sound translator for music track imports steeper then normal learning curve with less then optimum manual explanations	4
0	i 've only just begun using this software but have not found it to be so easy to use for a novice at film editing or to make a slideshow i would have liked to have seen better and more tutorials i find the tutorial confusing so far i have been able find most of the answers to my questions through the help section but it just is n't as straight forward as i would have liked i purchased this b c it was rated so high by pc magazine i'm sure in time i 'll learn the software better but it just seems more challenging and not as easy to learn as most sofware i have taught myself to use	4
0	simple and great video editing software considering it is for the normal and home user i would say it is the beginner to intermediate user tool i can really create fast movies very quickly pros easy to installeasy to split edit home videoscompatible with ilinksupport for high definition hdv camcorderscompetitive pricecons user interface can be confusing at the beginning to understand and placement of workspace windows rendering is slow	4
0	definitely worth the money for example excel is a great program it is pretty easy to use and not too hard to figure out you can add up figures in a snap this product provides a great service to companies because of the usefulness of this software	4
0	thanks for office i bought a new h p desktop that only had a 60 day office trial and literally had to pay the price thanks to you i'm glad i did n't have to pay full retail installed like a charm downloading sure has gotten a heck of a lot smoother bless your hearts	4

0	i received micrsoft office 2003 in excellant condition the box was sealed and in good condition the 2003 office software is easy to use if you have used any of the previous versions many new features make it worthwhile to upgrade	4
0	the price was the best i could find ordering was hassle free and delivery was fast	4
0	i have used synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them however do n't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until after your current subscription runs out because synmatec will not give you credit for the un used portion of your previous subscription i asked and they said no way that aspect of customer service is very disappointing	4
0	i used this to help plan kitchen and bathroom makeovers it helped me see just what we wanted	4
0	i love this product but i wish i could see all floors put together as completed home in 3d view	4
0	not for the professional but gets the job done for the most part	4
0	i have not spent tons of time working with the program yet but have done enough to know that the learning curve is reasonable if you are somewhat publishing program literate it has lots of potential for aiding in visualizing what your project will look like finished if you are willing to invest some time to learn the program features it performs as promised	4
0	was a fan of nortons till after reading reviews and going onsite to check out this anti virus package it just has more to offer and less of a resource hog	4
0	impressed with the way it clears out viruses spyware and trojans i can look at what it 's doing or just let it do it that all goes well what i do n't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign me in sites and i ca n't figure how to change this so the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful	4
0	i am not a computer geek or techie at all most software and hardware changes always make me hold my breath and cross my fingers i recently purchased the kaspersky anti virus based on the review of it in consumers reports it installed easily updates automatically and frequently very satisfied with it	4
0	i have got a virus that cause files comment htt appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus i tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective so i try kav and it works ! also kav does not slow my computer like some big named antivirus autoupdate feature is cool we do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable	4
0	i run two websites using this program easy learning curve i recommend it to all my newbie friends that need a simple workable program ignore the crittics this is a nice program only wish in batch editing i could do multiple web page saves	4
0	i like all the things you can do with this product glad i purchased it	4
0	i highly recommend microsoft digitial image suite 10 and the free gimp programs for all of your digital imaging needs ! ! ! \( \) dis 10 should be out now	4
0	i have been using pc cillin after dumping mcafee following some lousy customer support with no issues this new version i was very concerned after reading all of the reviews it does seem to slow things a little on my amd pc if i am running all of the options i can run but even with them it is tolerable i am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple	4
0	i was using ca but they dropped zone alarm and i was having issues pc cillin has my computer safe again i love that it is 3 user	4
0	no brainer easy to use good value	4
0	my feelings are if you have simple income not a lot of financial dealings this program will walk you thru your returns with no difficulty i 've only done fed state with 2 incomes 1 home with all the associated deductions and the program handled everything using the program is a snap and it saves me about 200 300 over using a tax preparer who asks me questions just like this program does you simply need to sort out all your receipts etc the same as you need to do for a live preparer	4
0	i read several reviews and was little hesitant to purchase this software i have a basic hp all in one printer and so far the software is wonderful and easy to use i have really saved some time with this software	4
0	produc in good condition easy to use best price comparing it whit other selling companies	4
0	i needed this for my new macbook laptop that will give me apple and windows on the same machine the laptop works fine the pocketbook is thinner you do what you have to do	4
0	bought this primarily for my tivo set so i could transfer and burn dvd 's from my tivo box once i hooked up my mac g5 to the tivo box toast worked perfectly easy interface fast transfer easy to burn it 's nice to know that tivo supports mac a great product ! !	4
0	i love toast and have had it since version 3 do n't have tivo so ca n't comment on usability but for everything else it works better than software that comes with mac ca n't wait to try double density and blu ray with which this is compatible even earlier versions could burn more different kinds of media than the burn software that came with the mac a friend of mine just switched from pc to mac and this was the first software that i suggested he buy as another reviewer said if you have toast you do n't need popcorn the best ! !	4
0	i was a little leary about purchasing this product having never tried anything like it before and being fairly new to the computer world i was delighted to find how easily the toast 8 system worked for me the owner 's manual is very specific and while i am still discovering all the capabilities of this software i have found it to be extremely useful i recommend this product very highly	4
0	i am very excited about the additions to toast 8 i am still learning how to use all of them the connection with tivo is one of the most exciting new items i have connected and reviewed tivo recordings through toast i have not had an opportunity to use toast for a dvd yet	4
0	the product works pretty much as advertised and i received it in a fairly timely manner	4
0	this product is great it is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording the addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner the only problem i have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd if you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need do n't wast time with anything else	4
0	this world renown editor is the best when it comes to editing and managing your digital photo	4
0	i purchased elements because frankly i could n't afford the whole big adobe enchilada i have found it to be pretty intuitive lots and lots of options as to organization photo tweaking and such i have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos i do have two other imaging programs and with the addition of elements i feel like i'm basically well set with zillions of options plus there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography and they supply free downloads of photoshop samples such as textures and so on very helpful get this if you ca n't spring for the complete photoshop program you will not be disappointed	4
0	i used adobe 3 0 for a long time and love it took the opportunity to upgrade and love the same things about 5 0 it 's easy to use easy to learn great to use for just basic printing easy to get more complicated if you want	4
0	i found turbotax easy to use it gave me the flexibility of filling in individual forms rather than using the interview process since i am an experienced tax preparer i found this feature welcome	4
0	i 've been manually doing my taxes for the last few years they were n't hard as much as time consuming turbo tax turned an all day project into just a couple of hour	4
0	good product however i do n't understand why it requires lengthy updatesevery time i open the program perhaps they should try to get it right the first time and it 's impossible to tell whether the updates do anything for me using it with quicken is a pita it is unclear to me how you get more than one state	4
0	this is a great program for your mac i 've used it in a film class the previous year and it took me a year to really get the hang of it because it has no tutorial i recomend you find someone who has used this and get them to give you a few lessons	4
0	i found wordperfect to be much more intuitive than microsoft office the reveal codes function has really eased many formating headaches and i love the automatic pdf maker	4
0	i like wordperfect much better than microsoft word as it is easier to use reviel codes solves a lot of problems when text wont behave not available in word i bought the x3 version because of some bad bugs in ver 12 like not being able to export my address book without errors and mail merge problems the price was right on amazon and it was easier that trying to fix 12 i do n't see a big difference between the two versions except that they fixed all the problems that i was having in 12 if an earlier version is working for you i see no good reason to upgrade b	4
0	i installed it on three of my computers with no problem i have used wordperfect before and it 's vey user friendly i'm not a power user but the basic things seen be easier to do i recomended the software came with and intructional dvd no how to used un like the microsoft counter part this software is more then what is needed for the average person it also comes with some free download for installing the software in your computer which you can install on all three computers it come with lots of template that you can used buy buy buy i say lol is worth it	4
0	i 've been using wordperfect for about 25 years and it keeps getting better it is the best word processor by far so many things are better than microsoft 's word processors importing graphics mail labels and especially reveal codes to name a few	4
0	the new edition of w p is simply the best the new features the little extras you 've come to expect from w p the user friendly tool bars all make this a good investment	4
0	i find ms 's expression web to be a huge step up for the professional web designer from frontpage frontpage 2003 was extremely nice and very usable by informal web developers but the code view really was n't much better than notepad \( not that i have a problem with notepad ! \) i highly recommend it for the professional web designer	4
0	a good product but like a lot of microsoft releases not everyone outside of microsoft is ready for it check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with expression web that is a problem i have run into in fact some hosting services that support front page have n't even come to full support of front page 2003 let alone expression web you could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features	4
0	great product ! i have had a little experience with frontpage but this product is definitely not frontpage with a new look this is an easy to use yet professionally powerful tool for web page development it goes way beyond my abilities if microsoft continues to develop this product the way it has started then watch out dreamweaver	4
0	compared to frontpage and its infamous bots expressions web is a refreshing piece of software from microsoft that out dreamweavers dreamweaver as a long time dreamweaver user the ability to easily stay in design mode in expressions web while building your user interface without the incredible futz factor that dreamweaver imposes is its greatest strength this is a very impressive stable product that i plan to use a great deal in my non net web development work it makes building and maintaining pure html web sites and newsletters much easier and more intuitive than ever	4
0	i have been using frontpage 2003 and decided that web expression web was the next stage in my website building hobby it was easy to install and i can still use frontpage 2003 on my existing websites no need for frontpage extensions which will be a plus on one of the server hosts i use also bought using microsoft expression web by jim cheshire an excellent book still have much to learn but looks like fun	4
0	i had the software in just a couple days and it was exactly as i ordered along with it came an information sheet on what to do and who to contact if there were any problems great job would order from them again	4
0	the only problem that i had was loading the actual program on the three computers that i have you had to delete your old norton antivirus 2006 before starting also i have one more problem that after i loaded the norton antivirus 2007 3 users on the last computer i still get a error that i need to down load the latest updates which i already did	4
0	the product did just what i wanted and that is to burn videos onto dvds from my camera i had an earlier version of nero but it would not do this	4
0	i previously had nero 6 and it had tons of bugs for me i upgraded to 7 ultra enhanced when i upgraded my computer to vista premium and i was pleasantly surprised everything i have tried so far has been flawless it seems that different systems have different results with nero for example some people say nero 6 works best for them but on my old system it was horrible \( running on win2k \) it 's complicated software though so people should give nero a break overall they do a great job just download the trial first and see how it runs on your system	4
0	great product has more features then just cd dvd burning system backup numerous audio recording editing features lightscribe and it 's also vista compatible the only downside is it 's learning curve some features and options are complex but once mastered you will be more then pleased with this product	4
0	i used this unit to calibrate my mitsubishi wd65732 dlp hd tv and was surprised at how good the picture looks after the adjustment i first went through the tv manual to make sure i understood all the various adjustments the tv makes and wrote them down on a spreadsheet so i could study them and make sure i knew how the language related to the spydertv adjustment language once i did that and marked down the adjustment ranges it was a breeze to run the software and make the adjustments it even creates a pdf file at the conclusion for record purposes and future comparisons some of the adjustments for color temperature were surprising but the bottom line is that the picture looks great	4
0	this thing is amazing my plasma is like a whole new tv my 60 sony sxrd paired with a ps3 is the best looking picture i have ever seen after using the stv100 this is a must have	4
0	i liked the older version better i hope to get use to the new version	4
0	you learn extremely fast using rosetta stone and you learn to think about what the word is not it 's translation probably the best language system available	4
0	between high school and college i have studied french for three years and i had been convinced that i would starve to death in paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood much of that has changed not that i am half way through the rosetta stone program my ear is now tuned to the language i have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses my vocabulary still needs to get stronger but now that i can distinguish individual words in a stream of french that is only a matter of practice with the language as advertised this program is painless and progress is rapid try the demo you 'll see	4
0	i discovered my ms office had a bug in it and came that way from the factroy i looked word over and it was clean then the program itself it does everything and well and it does it without the tracking bug on it	4
0	i purchased this program about 1 5 years ago i have been casually studying german through other programs for about 4 years the best basic words only is through unforgettable languages \( very basic but easy as heck to learn \) rosetta stone is the best for understanding gender verb usage and adapting to the german style of sentence structure i absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program it is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking the only negative is that the cd has to be used to run the program even with an accelerated cd rom the starting stopping of the cd is distracting if that feature were corrected it would be perfect	4
0	overall i was pleased with ease of installation this was an upgrade from office 2003 i backed up all files before upgrade and always do this but it was not necessary for this upgrade my overall disappointment is outlook 's inability or difficulty to use other mail servers \( yahoo gmail etc \) the shift appears to favor msn products only \( hotmail and msn \) no wonder thunderbird is slowly becoming a favored email application	4
0	i upgraded form office 2000 to office 2007 expecting to see major improvements i was disappointed office 2007 has some enhancements but it also has some glitches if i had been able to try it first i probably would have just stuck with my old version of office	4
0	i notice with gratitude that symantec has removed many glitches from nav installation is now faster and smoother the program is running well in the background updating itself and sending notifications of any attention it needs	4
0	this is a great product it easily performs all the functions a small business needs if it is to be taken seriously in the marketplace i'm impressed at how seamless it integrates all the accounting functions essentially you never enter information more than once and it always anticipates the most logical next step my clients are impressed at receiving e mailed estimates and invoices that are clear timely and professional this is a must	4

0	this game is great ! after buying mia reading i thought it was a great idea to get my 2 girls to start learning spanish since we live in a global village they game was easy to load easy to navigate and the level was perfect for beginners the high quality 3d animation will blow you away even my husband who learned 3d animation at the vancouver film school was blown away the best part is that they love playing it as they think it is a game they forget they 're learning numbers and vocab and how to put together simple sentences well recommended	4
0	i have been using nsw 2006 for a year and it 's never failed me i 've always used symantec products and have always been satisfied	4
0	i have had this only a couple of days and have learned it quickly thanks to the training cd that is included with the program very easy to learn great item 3 23 07 i have used this program every day and must say i love it i have used other photo editing software and did not like them much this is so easy to use the training cd gets you started and after compleing it \( 7 chapters \) you are ready to fix all the photos you like but are over or under exposed a powerful program you can look like a pro using this 10 stars if i could	4
0	an excellent item saved me lots of time and money	4
0	it is user friendly transparent and more robust than trendmicro 's or ca 's products both of which slowed my computer and prevented my music websites from working for windows oses onecare is best in my experience however i have not used onecare 's backup feature enough to make a judgement the 49 99 for 3 computers may be okay but it would be even better if microsoft offers it for one computer at 1 3 the rate say at 17 computer per year	4
0	silent and reliable protection at a bargain price simple interface not like those other fragmented bundles of freeware utilities	4
0	i am still under the free 3 month trial period and love it i will buy it because it does n't eat my memory and i feel safe with the people who designed the operating system i reccomend	4
0	wow this really made a difference in my ability to create professional looking comics i have a graphics tablet and the drawing feel is really good i think my favorite feature is the tool for making panels plus the tool for doing special effects lines which is pretty sweet i just draw comics for fun and for this price it is totally worth it manga studio is perfect for publishing a webcomic or adding effects to existing drawings i would definitely recommend this software if you like to draw comics or manga	4
0	this unit works well the software is a little hinky it does not explain when to attach the spyder but if you keep going back you can figure it out other than that i am satisfied	4
0	excellent for the novice i callibrated three monitors with the spider prior to calibration the images were completely different from each other after i was amazed how close the images were to each other the process is so simple that even a cave man could do it	4
0	i love this product it is easy to use and lots of designs to chosse from	4
0	creating keepsakes scrapbook designer version 2 deluxe this seems to be a nice program but i have not found much use for it as of yet my intention when buying it was to use it for scrapbooking but also greeting cards i am sure that i will use it in the future as the program has nice graphics and is easy to navigate broederbund products are usually very user friendly	4
0	for anybody who needs the full power of acrobat this is the way to go highly recommende	4
0	product was exactly as advertised and arrived in excellent condition	4
0	i 've been using acrobat pro since version 3 0 this is by far the best user interface of any version also like the new tool to combine multiple files into a single pdf no support for office 2007 docs yet but i understand from adobe there will be a free patch soon	4
0	works well most \( 95 \) of the time slight improvement over v8	4
0	i'm an old school comic book collectors and i bought this in order to see what the technology has done with the print page this is more about collecting the stories than it is about collecting the art and i still find there 's no substitute for the feel of those magical pages	4
0	it 's amazing having the entire history of a comic series at your disposal in print format it would be impossible for most people to own let alone store this much comic book history you have to adjust to looking at the comics on the screen rather than holding it in your hands \( a large monitor helps \) but other than that i highly recommend this entire series of digitized comics to be able to go back in time and see how the comics reflect the times whether they be in the 60 's 70 's or more recent years really shows you how closely comic books reflect pop culture	4
0	the content gives you 40 years of comic reading for a fraction of the price however some of the years ca n't be opened tried contacting the seller but to no avail	4
0	it is great to be able to read all the avenger comics again i read them as a kid but did n't get to read the very beginning i hope that they bring out more of the comic book characters on dvd i will buy more	4
0	we bought it 1 month ago to help my almost 6 year 's old sun to learn how to play because i did n't know how to play and i could n't teach him as a result of this purchase1 \) my sun fall in love with chess and become so good player that i could n't imagine2 \) i \( his mom \) learned how to play too it is so much fun to learn it that i would recommend it to anybody it worth it every penny i spent i like everything about this game kids will love it 100	4
0	i am a chess player myself so i can endorse this even more this software is well designed it can get a little difficult to get to some exercises inside it but kids can figure it out eventually my son has improved his play quite a bit even though he takes hints sometimes \) but this is a good software to get the kids started and teach them all the requisite skills to become a chess playe	4
0	seem's to work very wellcost was acceptablenot a resource ho	4
0	registry mechanic is a great registry tool it works better than the registry tools included with symantec system works if you purchase this version at 5 1 you can get a free upgrade to the latest version 6 0 once you register the product try the evaluation and you will see how many registry errors your machine may have that can effect its performance	4
0	okay for the time being but not enough needs to be combined with system mechanic for optimum capacit	4

0	i have been using tax cut for five years it is quite easy to use and generally well documented i would like to see a better ability to select individual forms for printing	4
0	the software is easy to install and easy to use the import prior year 's return feature saved time in completing multiple returns i completed one return in 10 mins because of this feature i also discovered the save as pdf feature that made it easier to send tax returns to family and friends whom i prepare returns i have used tax cut for the last 4 years and it gets better with each year the premium federal is great for multiple returns with all kinds of schedules	4
0	have used taxcut for years and this version does not disappoint the import of previous year data worked well and my tax return was quickly prepared	4
0	this study bible is absolutely wonderful if you are ready to dig deeper you could literally spend hours on a single chapte	4
0	notice you need at least 2gb ram not 1gb and vista it is for you !	4
0	this is a well done operating system i use the 64bit version and all but just a few of my software titles work without any problems all my hardware has 64bit drivers overall this is a good product and i would buy it again because i went from a 32bit o s to a 64bit o s i had to boot from the dvd to install it but i was able to install it using the key without any problems nor did i have to reinstall it afterwards as some website suggest you have to do	4
0	aside from the typical minor quarks this is overall a good product i 've been using turbo tax for many years and it seems to work for me	4
0	solid familiar and dependable although i wish there was an option to only update the specific income information from the prior year without going through the extensive interview	4
0	this is a pretty good product for the price ! i 've found a few errors on location of addresses but all in all pretty good ! just wish microsoft will offer a commercial vehicle version sometime in the near future so far we 've had no complaints	4
0	i use microsoft streets and trips 2007 in a laptop computer for navigational assistance anytime i'm traveling to a destination where i'm not absolutely certain how to get there in general i'm pleased with it 's performance it has saved me from wrong turns many times however the data seems to be as much as five years out of date on many street additions gps tracking on country roads is inaccurate enough to cause constant off route back on route messages as you navigate twists and turns i suspect in that case the map data is just not that accurate	4
0	i 've been using streets trips for years i'm a real estate broker and use it every day great product not as up to date as yahoo maps but easier and faster to use particularly the route planner gps live local links etc	4
0	this is still the best one out there but this new version \( been getting yearly updates since 1998 \) adds very little finally updated a couple streets in our area so that alone was worth it	4
0	do n't listen to the whinnier if you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills this helps you must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money it is worth the effort ! i noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work i also purchased the music cd 's produced by the same company they are helpful as well i use them at work at home and in the car the brain builder booklet mentions the cd 's if you want to stop looking stupid because you ca n't remember information or you 're tired of getting lost while driving this will help you	4
0	ca n't say enough for it there is so much good work items in it that you probably will never touch them all i 've had every updated issue from issue 5 on up they have been consistrantly excelant	4
0	i 've been a photoshop user since version 3 and this upgrade is worth every penny i upgraded from version 7 and cs2 is clearly a step up upgrading was a no brainer the only negative is adobe bridge i prefer the file browser that ps 7 had but i can live with it the floating image windows is also a nice touch you are no longer confined to the ps main window all of my add ons worked perfectly including fits liberator and the ptlens suite	4
0	this upgrade installed easily with my photoshop 5 5 no problems at all this is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my photoshop 5 5 this is a much less expensive way to upgrade to cs2 rather than purchasing cs2 outright be sure to get the updates after you install the program	4
0	i 've used adobe products for years and years and will continue to do so	4
0	i upgraded from photoshop 7 to cs2 and have never looked back no problems what so ever and many new features that really make it worth the purchase	4

0	this is a very good racing simulator ! but it 's no arcade game so if you want to jump into a car and race around with little or no practice this is not the game for you ! it will take you time to perfect the driving skills and learn the handling characteristics of the various cars you 're going to need a good wheel and pedal combo to get the most of this game graphics are very good but the race car physics and handling are exceptional highly recommended for racing sim fans not recommended for the casual race game player	4
0	this is the most technically excellent racing sim i have played the physics are perfect the graphics are pleasing and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars the learning curve can be very steep but you can adjust the ai to suit your needs you can also turn on traction control steering aids etc which will get you into the game faster after a couple months you 'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven there is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing if you want a realistic racer buy this game	4
0	bought this after thoroughly enjoying gt legends if you want to experience the best driving sim on the market buy gtr2 while i love rally sprints nascar and most other driving games this one sits on the pole complexity level and your own personal motivation to get better keeps it from getting mundane graphics rock get your system up to speed as all these other review suggest and that means a good wheel pedal combo as well how good is it \? i 've had it several months and i still say it is the best there is semper fi	4
0	this software is very easy to use i use a logitech nascar racing wheel together this game is great	4
0	this 'game' is awesome if you like sims do not buy this if your goal is to enjoy a leisurely drive once ina while 'playing' it is hard work and requires your full concentration great tutorials to teach you how to drive on a track \( it is very different from taking the family car for a spin \) i got it with my logitech g25 \( an awesome ffb wheel \) i think thesetwo were made for each other	4
0	i 've been using this product for awhile and i'm delighted with it i got my algebra i homework done in 1 5 the time it usually takes me ! in addition to this when i feel like learning i watch some of the discovery channel videos that are included with this even better is that this product comes with a reducing its overall price to today i'm going to use it to help me write a five paragraph essay i love microsoft student with encarta premium 2007 and you will too ! buy it ! trust me you won't be disappointed	4
0	i purchased this program simply for the encarta 2007 i was amazed at all of the wonderful features that microsoft put into the package i feel that anyone in school or not would find this program to be a useful tool in your daily life enjoy it	4
0	i wish the reviewer had stated whether ms office 2003 small business edition satisfies the requirement pending clarification i 'll stick with encarta 2006 despite its less \( than 2005 version \) user friendly search page encarta is an amazing product for kids of all ages and i'm more than willing to predict that 2007 is worthy of 5 stars	4
0	great product takes some thought but once you learn it its great	4
0	i would recommend premiere elements over any other video editing software i 've used it can do much more than other programs and it is fairly simple	4

0	h r block 2006 works well like it always has i 've used and liked h r since the turbotax activation debacle to the extent that i can like doing income tax ! what is great is the media the software comes on install the program and then have a nice flash drive to use elsewhere maybe flash drives will be like floppies someday with piles of used drives in a box but for now it 's a super handy way to store and move a few files 256 megs makes for a big floppy but a small flash drive no matter the price it right	4

0	i have always used norton products for antivirus for the previous 12 months i had problems getting the auto update feature to work and as a result had to download new definitions every time i turned on my computer \( a royal pain ! \) at renewal time i looked around and found pc cillin software was highly recommended i bought it and loaded it easily since i'm not very computer savy it took me a little extra time to figure out some of the settings it works well i miss a couple of norton features like adding an email sender to the blocked list with one click but updates load by themselves and i 've had no problems	4

0	this is a fantastic product it has endless applications i absolutly love it	4

0	i made the mistake of ordering this product and microsoft office 2007 which i did n't realize that it was also offered in office 2007 which i did n't need 2 of them so i gave the other one to my sister who just loves to keep all her records in the	4

0	i enjoy researching various subjects simply out of intellectual curiosity and find encarta a useful tool i'm somewhat overwhelmed by the multimedia offerings but like the chronological updates and appreciate this treatment of current events	4
0	i enjoy using encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information i use it in conjunction with britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information i do prefer the interface and ease to britannica 2007 but the quality of information on britannica is always to be trusted my advice you need to buy both	4
0	kudos microsoft my last go around with encare was with the 2004 version at that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface the various modules were n't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly the new interface is quite simple but very powerful it is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics if you have not tried encarta in a while check it out there is much to like	4
0	this is a wonderful and very useful program not only for school age kids but also for adults it is full of useful information it comes very handy when you want to learn about anything look for any topic you will find it there	4
0	encarta users will have no problem using and enjoying the newest version of encarta 2007it is just as informative as the last versions with a lot of extra kicks like the newest videos recommend at least 1 gb of ram and a pentium 4 processor with a newer video card \( 2 yrs or better \) for the best video viewingit will run on older system	4
0	this was by far a great program and never had a problem with it loading on our computer fast installation and very easy to work with plenty of available online over the phone or program tutorial help ! awesome program even comes with a tshirt and 2 transfers	4

0	i really liked this version of office it makes formatting and other tasks like making tables inserting bullets and the likes much easier i have not done any work on excel 07 yet so i ca n't give any feedback about it	4
0	the product came well packaged and unopened i really needed instructions on how to open the packaging but once i got it opened and installed the product works as well as promised the set up and ribbon menu is a lot more user friendly than 2003 i downloaded the trial version that microsoft had offered and i must say that this is the best office product offered by microsoft to date	4
0	if you do n't need outlook but do need powerpoint this is a great value before you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price \( full retail 150 now \) office 2003 standard even on ebay is still going for 175 plus this does not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn also do n't worry about file formats you can re set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of microsoft office	4
0	zonealarm by checkpoint is one the best programs for protecting yourself it is better than norton internet suite	4
0	all in all a fine product has gotten excellent reviews from pc mag norton slowed my machine to a crawl this has not suggest never paying full retail for it unless you absolutely have to i 've been using it for a few years now and always manage to find a free after rebate deal on it a few months before the one year subscription period is up it does require the user to provide authorizations the first time it sees a programs attempting to access the web for a non techie this may seem a bit intimidating because there will be a lot of queries from it in the first few days of usage	4
0	i have had all the anti virus programs and zone alarm works best e fiel	4
0	this is what you need if you want a suite of protection for you pc i 've used mcafee it drove me nuts i 've used norton also drove me nuts zonealarm worked nearly flawlessly \( as well as windows can \) it is a very stable and intuitive program that is what i have been looking for all i can is that you should buy this and get rid of whatever you 're using now especially if it 's mcafee or norton just a sidenote i run avg free antivirus alongside this and i also ran it alongside norton and mcafee avg would catch things that neither norton nor mcafee would never have had that problem with zonealarm	4
0	i got tiger to improve the working of my powerbook g4 1 5 my jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer before tiger my computer would hang when playing large dv files \( such as the ones i made in imovie \) but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same this tiger upgrade does n't include some of the apps \( games quicken etc \) that my wife has on her new macbook but it did include a 30 day trial verion of iworks which has come in handy	4
0	what can i say other than this is simply hands down the best operating system on the planet ! we were spoiled by how flawless it performed and sold our pc soon afterward	4
0	why not have the best possible operating system for the best possible computer while this os is not the top of the line today it was when i bought it if you buy the mac it pays to have the best operating system stay current the hardest jump was from os 8 to os 9 i was unable to bring any of my peripherals with me now it is seamless like they say just plug n play	4
0	everything was perfect until i used expos the animation was a little choppy but that probably has more to do with using an ibook g3 than with tiger	4
0	i found it hard to work with and was disappointed that it was n't more versatile my needs are not quite the same as a standard business however and i have friends with businesses who like this very much	4
0	it has made my bookkeeping for my small business soooo easy invoices in a flash keep track of your expenses so easily this program was the best investment and tax deductible ! very easy not complicated !	4
0	before buying quickbooks you should google quickbooks 2007 simple start free starter edition this free version never times out you can immediately download 400m or get the cd with no shipping charge the big limit in the free upgradeable version is you only get 20 total customers and vendors so it is ideal for students and those with limited needs	4
0	super simple to install and easy to use this program gives you a real perspective of how you use your money i created a personal account company it does n't have to be for small business only but will be handy if we decide to set up a small business in the future the price was just right for our purpose	4

0	great backup solution i install a second hard drive into someones computer and then let the software run and then forget about it never fails have not done a restore yet but i would imagine it would be easy since i have an image of the hard drive and then the data that is up to date also bought the software from a vendor that amazon recommends i do n't no why they do this but the software listed on amazon is 49 99 which is the right price i bought two from a vendor for 15 00 each wow what a savings and a great markup for me	4

0	this product is simple to use and does a good job converting my home vhs tapes onto dvd the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because i wish it supplied the connection cables with the product other than that i have no gripes worth the money in order to preserve your precious home videos	4
0	the quality is excellent ! use it to go out of the digital cable box strait into the computer pinnacle software is easy to use and edit with and if you have a dvd burner makes great menus i have bought and returned well over 5 rca capture devices and this is by far the best especially for 50 ! ! ! ! ! ! cant beat it	4

0	i did not think that introduction to the game was going to end i thought that i may be able to skip it but no luck once into the game i believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills lastly you have to hit the f keys and esc to save and exit the game not many program make you do that today overall i feel that this was a good purchase and i would have given 5 stars if functionally was better with program	4
0	the mia series are great for our family the kids always look forward to playing their mia games they have the math adventure and grandmas remedy the two disc thing is confusing but really does n't interrupt play the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because it can be a little glitchy sometimes mia will get stuck somewhere and not respond we just go back to a game saved in a similar spot and restart so it 's not too big a deal	4
0	excellent software for kids it keeps my 5 year old challenged and comes with 4 different difficulty levels to choose from	4

0	i 've been a corel user since ver 5 or so it 's always been a decent graphics application but ver 12 and now 3x are the best i 've ever seen this program is so intuitive compared to others in this category it s particularly easier than quarkxpress i know quark 's a page layout app but you can do the exact same stuff 95 of the time in corel much better pdf 's and a huge price advantage make this their best version yet indesign is also very good but pure useability gives corel an edge	4
0	i like this screensaver because you think the fish are really real and you can feed them and watch them and you tap on the glass your fish will sometimes react i'm going to keep it forever and ever the 2 expansion packs to complete my screensaver of fish is the arowana pack and the funstuff pack thank you for reading this cool review and my name is kris i really like aquazone	4
0	well its definetly improved version since the last one but they still have a lot of things to do the biggest problem is pages if text has specific symbols like greek letters and u try to export your file to doc forget it u 'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago either funky symbols or underline dashes keynote is much better but if u r a scientist and not a sales man both packages still have a lot of room for improvement however i'm still happy with this purchase because it 's apple soft and looks much nicer than any ms software will get in the future	4

0	i 've only been using lightroom for a day but i was pleasantly surprised with the photoshop integration just hit cmd e and lightroom creates a copy of the photo \( with our without the changes you applied in lightroom \) for editing in photoshop format and groups that copy in a stack with the original as you save your changes in photoshop the image is updated in lightroom i felt that the workflow was very smooth	4
0	this is a great software for photographers looking for a faster way to manager and edit images i gave it a four because i would hope that adobe would still find ways to improve this product the functionality is superb and for such a great program it does n't eat too much memory on your computer \( i have a 4 year old pc with 768 mb of ram \) and because of this i'm shooting more pictures in raw format and not worry about the time i spend in front of the computer i 'll definitely be buying the next upgrade	4
0	within a couple days after installing dragon it showed a high degree of accuracy the accuracy depends on how late at night you dictate it was installed on a 2 7 celeron with 512 of memory the program generally keeps up quite well the program works with comcast and aol free ride but seem to have a lot of glitches with aol com	4

0	i really like my new windows vista upgrade the graphics are stunning and it is extremely user friendly infact i liked vista business so much i upgraded to the ultimate version both versions are very easy to install many people seem to be waiting for 'all the bugs to be worked out' but honestly the bugs are n't a problem it is important to run the advisor about is your system ready for vista before you install to get rid of any conflicts your computer might have with vista other than that everything else is a breeze use my system about 6 hours a day and am using a xps 700 dell computer go for it you 'll have lots of fun !	4
0	product has a nice clean interface i was able to load most drivers and application software without incident note upgrade install requirements are not clear microsoft should state what is expected on your system prior to trying to install either as an upgrade or clean install microsoft sites keep pointing back to sites that do n't help very much	4
0	great product just one downfall check whether your printer and other software hardware is compatible first i've had windows vista since it came out and my printer driver is still not compatible which means i had to purchase another printer in order for it to work	4
0	pc doctor works great ! it removed spyware that other software did not it is a memory hog and slows your computer while scanning but it is worth the time i turn off the software when not using the internet	4

0	good product but it 's kind of too complicated and difficult to set up and fine tune to work the way we required	4
0	essential for microsoft office 2007 users running windows vista office 2007 already provides a pdf converter however it does not allow for security editing or markup pdf converter does and without the tech support hassles at adobe since my new hp computer came with adobe reader already installed in the vista environment i kept it as the default pdf reader and i use pdf converter professional for actual stand alone conversion or editing of pdf documents pdf converter had a very easy custom install feature i disabled all microft office internet explorer and outlook add ins and i installed the product it all works together extremely well	4
0	excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use product well packaged arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition scansoft responded with an email in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it 's progress but you know rebates they take forever ! pdf converter 4 is not my only scansoft product i also use paperport 10 and am extremely satisfied with that my buying experience has always been positive with amazon com vendors never a problem john mc laughlindaytona beach florid	4
0	i have not used this product for very long and was somewhat reluctant to purchase another brand besides adobe who seem to dominate in this softward category but i have so far been plaesantly surprised with the performance features the scansoft pdf converter pro 4 software seems to do all adobe can do \( and a little more \) at a fraction of the exhorbitant cost of adobe pro 8 ! i'm happy with my purchase thus far !	4
0	this is one of the best graphics suites that i have ever used it is very user friendly and all the my students that i have used it have really liked it the toolbars are easy to find and the entire program is filled with outstanding graphics tools this is a must have for anyone who is serious about graphics	4
0	i am average when it comes to design but the tutorial helped me in creating a logo and it 's cheaper and better for me to create one myself than pay someone to do it i like the tracing feature which allows you to remove parts of a photo to place in a new background to get the most out of this software you really need to be familiar with a lot of the features already and there 's a lot i am missing i will just have to take more time to keep practicing and learning from trial and error	4
0	i have been a corel user for years this latest version is a great improvement esp for raster to vector tracing i have always preferred to use corel over our illustrator even though i have both installed on my system corel just seems to be a much more user friendly program very powerful for anyone from novice to pro user	4
0	i think this software is excellent for biginning designers like me it gives a great range of choices to help you expand your imagination create new personal things each time you work the only problem faced me was that it does n't support other languages but it works with wordart	4

0	among the various offerings available this is perhaps the most complete each offerings has some unique capabilities that others do n't possess but if you want only one product this one gives you the closest match to a professional product that can be used by print shops	4
0	it 's exactly what i wanted to buy complete collection of ultimate x men i do n't mind scrolling up and down on my laptop in order to see the whole picture the ads were kind of annoying though i just hope marvel puts all the other x men series on cds like this	4
0	i had a hard time putting this one down i quickly read through the entire collection and it was over too quickly i would recommend this to any x men fan especially fans of the old comic books and it certainly takes up a lot less room than if i had the hardcopy versions my only complaint is that it ends at the beginning of a new story ah well	4
0	this works fairly well for me it easily downloads the capital gains from microsoft money the interviews are fairly straightforward however there are a few areas \( like foreign tax credit \) where it should be automated but is n't but on the whole it does a nice job they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item	4
0	worked fine for standard items did not handle partnership issues completely would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed \( maybe this is possible but i did not find this function \) in general an easy straightforward program that gets the job done	4
0	got this game for my 12 year old and he loves it ! you need to have a pretty new computer to use it and it took a few trys to get it downloaded once it was installed it was a really wonderful game ! if you have a child that likes puzzles and figuring things out they will love it too	4

0	purchased this to help navigate a trip from northern michigan to south west florida and back again we took a fair amount of side trips and having this on our laptop made it easy to get to where we wanted to go there were a couple of times that we went off route but were back on route in very little time it helped us decide where to stop for fuel eat and sleep up to date information is available with an internet connection and the larger map viewing area was greatly appreciated well worth the price highly recommended to others	4
0	i do a lot of work out of town and in other states so i am constantly in unfamiliar or different places this gps has saved me tons of time and within the next two months will probably have paid for its' self in saved mileage that i used to spend looking for places i have recommended it to everyone that i have talked to it 's great i will never have to mapquest or ask for directions again another great microsoft product	4
0	this always was a microsoft good program who needs know how be and for where this is a good choic	4
0	connecting the cables was so easy i was sure i must have missed something recording the music is equally easy removing the snap crackle and pop was a snap my only confusion resulted in recording from 45rpms i should have left them as stereo because it seems as though if you check off as mono you can not remove the crackle and pop	4
0	this product does a superb job at converting audio cassette recordings to mp3 format on your computer or mp3 player you can adjust the audio level and pause the recording and advance the audio cassette if you need to do those things there are other automatic features to shut off etc it also can remove noise from the recording and clean up the transients	4
0	i bought this to transfer lps to cd it is simple to connect to the computer and the software is easy to use just be sure when you download the mp3 encoding program to put it in the same directory as the lp ripper the lp recorder works well and is very easy to use the lp ripper makes it easy to trim the tracks and then encode them as mp3 files when saving them as mp3 's i can get approximately 20 lp 's on one cd i am very satisfied with the product	4
0	this product is very easy to install and use in couple of minutes i was able to set it up i used the phone jack to input the music from cassette player to the computer and it worked well the reason i give it four star out of five is that it records the music in wave format and there is no software in the package that converts wave file to dvd cd mp3 format	4
0	i received this product and have been using it for a couple of weeks it is exactly as advertised it is very easy to use and the software is extremely user friendly i am amazed at the quality of the recordings i would definately recommend this product	4
0	i ordered the wrong spanish language learning sucess kit for my husband for christmas although he had taken off the outside wrap rosetta stone graciously allowed us to return the set i had given him and in return they sent us the version he had originally wanted rosetta stone made the return very easy and fast	4
0	i 've only just started but so far i am very pleased with this language program my only regret is that i do n't have enough time to keep at it the various learning modalities are quite useful this is the only program \( aside from taking a class \) that i 've used which does this i recommend it	4

0	streets and trips has been a significant help in making our travel plans we use it in conjunction with our garmin 2720 gps system and they are very complementary the garmin system does n't use downloads from the laptop and streets and trips therefore allows us to do trip planning on a braosder scale at home this is a very good program for trip planning	4
0	although i did not purchase this product from amazon com \( \) i absolutely love it the gps locator provided is amazing and better than i thought it was it is not one of those gps that updates your position every 20 seconds or something but when i zoomed in i could see my current location constantly moving on the map \( so it is updating every second \) i have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the gps provided to them is n't even this good i recommend this software and gps to anyone	4
0	i am very satisfied with this product since it does every thing that microsoft describes in their product description i am also happy with the price at amazon com since i saved about 30 of the advertised retail price	4
0	i travel a lot this product saves me valuable time in unfamiliar surroundings i have my laptop open on the seat and plot my position and where i want to go it 's easy ! if i miss a turn the reroute from present position feature is great ! it takes a little getting used to but if you tend to be more visual or you do n't generally do well with maps or maybe you just want to know where you are in relation to where you 're going ms streets and trips is tops	4
0	used this for a trip from nw of chicago to houghton mi \( in the u p \) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections \( lost signal a few times \) this works best when you have two people \( driver and navigator \) as looking over at a laptop while driving is n't a good thing ! would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price i would n't expect it	4
0	this is a cool game in a lot of ways i was jazzed about it because of the era it represents but the complexity and inscrutability of the setup menus is somewhat offputting the huge disapointment however is this the online registration code is missing utterly missing and there is no resource available on the net to help the u s a help number is disconnected you will not be able to play online period the developer 's forums are full of posts about this problem no resolution beware demand more of the makers of the products you purchase this is extremely bad	4
0	simbin makes an excellent simulator this game has brought me back to days days of yesteryear in great delight the physics sounds and graphics are top notch the game is fun and the ranks seriously tough online capabilities are fine except you have to unlock cars and tracks through the game which could take weeks	4
0	this is no gtr but it should n't be either being a huge simbin fan i have to say the gtr series are still the best although there are times when gt legends historic cars can be quite the challenge and really a blast to drive and in the end thats what its all about	4
0	thats really my only complaint with this game every time you buy a racing game the cars all seem to be the same being in australia we had our own fast cars the falcon gtho phase 111 the hk monaro gts and who could forget the torana gtr xu1 ok this might mean nothing to someone over in the usa or england but they where supercars in their day that said its still a great game for all petrol heads old and young a lik	4
0	this is the best version of office yet the differences are numerous and very significant it is well worth the investment !	4
0	a great new interface including control layout easier than ever to use and complete there is no other product in this class it looks great in xp and even sharper in vista subject to some agreement with adbobe you 'll have to download the free pdf writer from microsoft \( the beta came with it \) but it works exactly the same and otherwise no suprises the product is pricey and you may want to purchase a smaller release \( less applications in the suite \) depending on your needs	4
0	i am a user of acronis backup and very satisfied with it and was hoping that the disk director would be the same however it is a little more complicated to use i partitioned a drive then wanted to convert back and have not yet be able to do so i know that you can but just have n't found out how yet it could have been made a little more simplier to use	4
0	the product does everything they claim save one it wo n't work inside windows xp \( service pack 2 \) but it will work when you boot from the disk that is n't a problem in my view therefore i have no complaints	4
0	excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives you can format partition split merge and a whole lot of other things if you purchase a large backup hard drive i recommend this software and the acronis true image software with both you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c drive in one partition and daily backups of my documents in another this way in case of a hd crash you have a bootable backup \( note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive \) thats why i recommend both acronis software packages	4

0	6 6 ultra is an extremely good cd dvd burning suite it even has an excellent schedule able backup restore utility that burns to disk do not use the oem version it 's like diet nero and do not for any reason get nero 7 0 you have less than a 50 chance that it will work at all \( i am speaking from experience here !	4

0	i bought finale songwriter to make lead sheets with chord symbols it worked well for my project i have no complaints	4
0	as a retired teacher i wanted the ability to compose a song and share it in a pristine form finale songwriter does that the lyrics find their way to the correct note the midi connection works and all the parts of a composition is enveloped in this software one of the attractions for me is the cost finale songwriter does not extract your final dollar from your stash try this program and you will find many facets hidden that makes finale songwriter a positive	4
0	word space for the other language is not work performed or designed for english ok ! work 's good	4
0	look notation software is notoriously expensive all musicians know that so when you see songwriter and its price it 's a relief everything you need is in this program i only have one complaint when adding an expressive dynamic \( p mp mf f ff etc \) you have to add one to each note to insure proper playback that is a concern of mine since i use songwriter to notate songs and export them in midi for recording purposes it leaves an ugly looking score other than that this is the best deal on the market for what it is	4

0	i have used mcafee antivirus for years and it is an excellent product i bought the suite this time and found it will not allow you to run a different firewall \( zonealarm \) in my case that is the only negative i have found so far the mcafee firewall seems sufficient so far	4

0	i'm a hobbyist musician and like to do home recordings this program fits all of my basic needs this is the first piece of audio software i 've ever owned but i know a lot of people who are more experienced are very unhappy with what i guess are unconventional layouts and commands so be warned if you 've used audition 1 5 or cooledit however as my introduction to music editing the control scheme seems very intuitive to me and i like the endless options adobe provides for organizing the workspace one tip if you are a student or teacher do n't spend 300 do a google search and find a site that sells this product for a little over 100	4
0	i like the features the same as i did with cool edit 2000 i have n't had the opportunty to explore all the new features but it looks promising	4

0	for the first time in several versions microsoft has changed the file format however it is for the better the new files are all compressed using the zip compression format so files are much smaller \( old files are 3 4 times larger than new files \) the new file formats are supposed to be compatible with a cross platform specification \( i e linux geeks can open office documents \) the new interface is radically different do not install this if you have a large project to complete the interface is so different you will not complete on time however after a month of so you will wonder how you ever got along without it	4

0	do n't get confused by the licensing mumbo jumbo that comes on the package it is the full version ready to be installed do n't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start so far i have not noticed a dime 's worth of difference from the pro version it is working great however the vista coupon shipped with my package expired on march 15 2007 additionally the coupon only applied to new systems purchased between october 26 2006 and march 15 2007 so do n't let the vista thing induce you	4
0	do n't listen to all that crap about how you should get linux or buy a mac instead of buying windows that will probably be the dumbest choice in your life this is the full version of windows oem software comes with activation code and vista upgrade coupon to either vista home basic or home premium bought from tiger direct through amazon	4

0	i am very pleased with the product i had trouble with my system and microsoft tech support was outstanding on helping me solve the issues	4
0	microsoft office pro 2003 edition is a good product it installed easily over office pro 1997 i have n't had any problems with it \( yet \) it relies heavily on online links you probably should have a fast dsl connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links update i am using windows xp with office pro 2003 and today was disappointed to find that the help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions	4
0	i was happy enough with the function of office xp and held off upgrading for a long time what pushed me over was when i switched to using outlook as my email client accessing quite a few pop3 email accounts for various websites getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty i spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working well office 2003 's outlook comes with it 's own spam filter it works it 's simple and it 's unobtrusive the other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles but the upgrades i appreciate most are in outlook	4
0	it would be nice if the contents were listed with all of microsoft 's versions it gets confusing	4
0	the layout of office 2003 is better than office 2003 which has improved my efficiency for those who spend all day working with the outlook package it 's worth the money to upgrade	4
0	i love this especially for it 's basic qualities i originally started with the version where it could be put on a 1 44 floppy that i got from my dentist went to version 2001 a few years later with version 2001 my bank no longer would support downloads for that it and i knew i would have to upgrade some time i was comfortable with 2001 so i was glad to find this 2007 was easy to adapt to just a bit sleeker but adding my ability to download from my bank once again for someone who does n't have the need for all the extras this is perfect	4
0	very easy to follow especially if you 've used quicken in the past reports are set up just a little bit different total at top of category instead of bottom so you need to get accustomed to that overall great produc	4
0	\( review written by my wife the user \) i 've happily used the quicken checkbook program for many years when we changed operating systems from windows xp to windows vista i was unable to get the quicken 2002 version to work in vista so i purchased quicken basic 2007 and am totally pleased with the program the only feature i use is the checkbook program and as far as i'm concerned it 's perfect i 've never used the download from bank option because i prefer to review all posted transactions when the bank statement arrives i use edit preferences feature to tailor the program to my liking and i could n't be happier the price is reasonable too	4
0	great for managing your basic accounts and finances easy to use worth the price interacts well with online banking services	4
0	for a basic money management software this product met my expectations no frills but very easy to use convenient calendar of payments and scheduled payments showing my balance after each transaction i set my account up in 20 minutes there is n't a manual but for the price and ease of use i do n't need one	4
0	when my last computer got zapped by lightning the one thing i missed the most was being able to balance my check book glad to be back on track i like the new look	4
0	i use this with a macbook laptop with 2gb ram without any performance issues it is a great product for when you have outgrown imovie but do n't need the full feature set of final cut i use it for both perosnal and work video production no problems connecting and moving video of a panasonic pv gs500 video camera via firewire there is a learning curve but the basics are pretty easy to master	4
0	this was given to my son who is going to be living in china this summer and presently knows no chinese he 's worked hard with this program and at least appears to be getting the tonal quality correct which is key in this language a microphone is a must with this program only wish it focused on certain key words other than phrases that would never be used like an old man driving a car	4
0	4 different methods to learn the language i am able to do 2 lessons an evening one to repeat and one new the only thing you have to do is sit in fron of the computer just listen and look and the key words will pop out at you and you just can not help but to learn the new language very user friendly	4
0	this map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike it no longer supports windows 98 which happens to be the newest op that my old lap top can use it also still lists some restaurants that have been closed for two years the street maps it produces are accurate except for a few minor glitches	4
0	the program is great sometimes the gps is slightly off though i 'll be travelling on a major highway and all of the sudden it will tell me that i'm off route for no reason not really a big deal just annoying other than that i recommend it as a cheaper version of a gps sysytem if you own a laptop	4
0	this is the second generation of this software i have owned it is a great navagation tool better than most online sites and can be used in the car i marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the lexington kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth with new streets and roads the software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map so you do n't have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night major points of interest are also on the map	4
0	i use my microsoft streets and trips software to plan my route intermediate stops and destination for any travel via automobile or truck i am especially pleased with the ability to see and print a detailed guide for locating street addresses for those destinations with which i may be unfamiliar this is especially helpful for delivery of items to a customer whose business may be on a relatively remote street in areas that are difficult to find i have tried a few other software systems that claim to do what streets and trips does and i found none of those sustems could equal or even compete with microsoft streets and trips 2007	4
0	i have used this product for the last three years and i am very satisfiedwith it and recommend it highly	4
0	i find turbo tax to be the original and best income tax preparation program i really saddened to hear people knock it on here because they felt cheated that this version does n't come with state tax features well if you are going to shop online you 'd better learn to read the specifications for products ! i came to amazon precisely because i knew i 'd be able to find what i needed for less texas has no state income tax so i make sure that i buy turbo tax for federal only thanks for letting me get that little rant off my chest	4
0	it was an excellent purchase fast ans efficient receipt of goods and fine quality	4
0	its a good software it works good and keep the computer safe from spam virus and some others malware try it	4
0	i bought adobe acrobat 8 0 professional for home use after having used an older version at work the software was very easy to install activate and register and i liked the orientation program that explained how to use the features since i am active with three community service organizations i welcome the addition to my home computer for the convenience it adds to assembling mixed media binders this program makes it easier to email formal reports create handbills and pamphlets and post them to my web page	4
0	at first i had some difficulty adjusting to the new interface once i got used to it though i find it a lot more useful and comfortable to operate it 's a great step forward in all senses for acrobat ! !	4
0	it 's quite a bit slower than version 7 but it looks really good and the form designer has been improved by leaps and bounds	4
0	we found the program to be easy to install and the lessons easy to retrieve the lessons are presented in a variety of ways to accomodate one 's learning style the accompanying text is not difficult to understand and is very helpful in explaining the basics of the program we appreciate the repetition and the spiraling effect used as one progresses through the lessons so far we are pleased with the materials and have felt quite successful in learning some basis phrases	4
0	drills are excellent vocabulary has good variety picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me but i guess that 's the way kids learn any language	4
0	i am fluent in spanish so the rosetta stone italian language software was perfect for me it is very easy to understand to follow and to learn if you study one hour per day in one week you are going to remember several words and phrases i do n't have any regret at all i think my investment was worthwhile	4
0	great product simple to use after short training from accountant it is in and running	4
0	i was a little diappointed when i found out that i would have to buy more versions to get continued training on this subject	4
0	i have been a word perfect user for years but found i could not open files that were received from professional organizations and attorneys that was the reason for purchasing microsoft works this has been a great asset for our business thank yo	4
0	works work what cam i say i have been using microsoft products for years quality easy to use products are the reason they are a software giant	4
0	understand i have a full ms new office suite that i got from work but choose to use this product for the many items included which ca n't be beat if you just want to use word and nothing else then get it alone this is fine but the other products are worth the discount and rebate also cost is the lowest i found if you have a reward ceriticate using amazon credit card that 25 more off the price so in the end it cost me 30 for it shop smart and use any break you could get right \?	4
0	i use ms office at work and at home but for my daughter 's computer this was perfect most people do n't need the full version of office and this package has so much for so little money the full version of word is reason enough to spend this amount of money note this is not the latest version but who cares i would say this is one of the best software deals out there unless you need 100 office compatiblity this is the package for you if you do buy the student and teacher version of ms office read the fine print it is for anyone not using it for business	4
0	it seems no longer possible to buy ms word as a stand alone program so to get it one buys microsoft works suite this way one gets word one version back from the most current version plus encarta streets and trips etc when purchasing be sure to distinguish between the cd version and the dvd version the latter comes on a single disk the former on about six also note this is not the same as microsoft works a suite of programs often preloaded on a new computer it has its own peculiar word processor spreadsheet etc for more than word look for the student and teacher edition of ms office suite	4
0	i am finding that it is not so diffucult to navigate my way around the new programs of excel word etc opening up files it tends to be a bit sluggish on the plus side i found word 2007 seems to do a much better job of lining up indents in word 2003 our indents were sometimes off by a half space which bothered us	4
0	office 2007 was a very nice improvement over previous versions the program was stable for me at least and the new interface was very nice it may take a few minutes to find where some commands have been moved to but the result was a much cleaner interface one thing that keeps in mind is that it uses a different file format from previous versions by default there is the option of changing the format to the previous version but the default option is n't compatible with earlier programs	4
0	wow ! i must say that the new office 2007 is way better than the 2003 it did take some time to get the hang of it because microsoft changed around the icons and buttons however i do like it because now in word excel and powerpoint 2007 you can creat charts and you can also preview how backgrounds look before appling to the slide in the end i think the 2007 is much more user friendly than 2003 i recomend to anyone to buy this product if they wish to upgrade to the new 2007 microsoft office	4
0	if you 're looking for a professional office suite ms office 2007 has no real competitors i 've worked extensively with corel office and some with open office they 're fine for the basics and they cost less but if you 're looking for effectiveness integration speedy productivity and an incredible array of tools you 'll want to buy ms office 2007 and as an added bonus the interface makes it a pleasure to work in	4
0	i have used other product of this kind and have never used any easier one the video tutorials are the greatest help of all the home plans they already have in the program are lacking but you can change them to what you want but that is not the easiest task i would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their dreams come true	4

0	installed quickly and with no problems does not slow the machine down as much as norton antivirus	4
0	the last reviewer did n't see any point to this software partially that 's true you do n't need it to create your photostamp you can do the same thing online however there is one big plus to the software product buying a single sheet of photostamps direct from their website costs 24 99 2 99 shipping at this writing in contrast amazon is selling this boxed version which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps for seven bucks less than that do the math	4

0	actually comic book creator lets you use your content in a million different ways including reselling of your work the only limitation is that you ca n't sell comics created around branded content like images from marvel paramount tokyopop etc because they do n't allow that it 's all in the user agreement check it out	4

0	this was my second purchase of a product like this and i loved it the first one i tried was difficult to use it was so easy to use my husband and i were unsure of our remodeling plans and with this we were able to get a vision together of how our home would look once completed it helped us pick everything from furniture location to color of carpet and flooring my favorite feature was the home estimator feature that tracked our materials useage	4
0	looked at them all and then bought this software it can do a lot of things so yes it might take a bit to learn and get fast with there is a reason it has been voted best for several years now it does a good job if you remember the very old computer saying garbage in garbage out 8 \) my wife loves the video tutorials that she can pop up anytime she needs to without stopping the software and what she 's working on anything this complete is worth the learning curve	4
0	amazing program ! definitely building my skills in the interior design field would recommend to anyone	4
0	this program is dependable and adequate within the limits that it is avertised to do for instance it wo n't keep track of inventory since it was not designed to do so	4

0	i use this program daily and it is awesome ! it has lots of great new features especially the new home page that has the customer vendor and employee centers where you can now see all of the information in one place the features and functionality of the program are everything any small to mid size business needs to run their company from a financial point of view great improvements over previous versions	4
0	i have been supporting quickbooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years this year 's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer 's invoices payments estimates all in the same window just by clicking on a customer in the list no more multiple clicks to create customer reports it is just plain easy and the information pops up on your screen immediately congratulations to intuit on a job well done	4
0	the fact that they call this premier is a little overdone the reality is that this is the pro version with a few bells and whistles which in most cases do not warrant the additional price	4
0	even though i do n't belong to the art profession and have only very limited knowledge of the arts i feel the contents are great and useful based on my discussion with friends who are artists i therefore bought it for my friends in the arts profession overseas	4
0	i have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now i decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar i recieved as a gift it 's a pretty good method sometimes a bit difficult to work with but you do learn some things i stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when i realized that i had a bass amp so make sure you have all the right equipment and i would have to say that this might be easier for someone who 's taken guitar lessons	4
0	i picked this up for my twelve year old son he is a beginner and has been glued to his electric guitar and emedia rock guitar method for the last two weeks the program is a great starter just in case the kids do n't stick with it it 's better than 45 bucks an hour once a week for now at least great product ! i reccomend it	4

0	i have used this product for about 5 years it is easy to use and alot cheaper than having your taxes done by someone else i especially would recommend it to any small business owner	4
0	absolutely love this program i 'd been using norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch its not as user friendly as norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted on the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity making it an exceptionally good security program	4
0	i 've been using this for several years without ever having a problem i like this new version even better than the last version by having everything in one control panel makes it easier than before it uses less system resources than norton plus i know people that have gotten viruses using norton mcafee kaspersky always rates in the top three the only drawback is there is no anti spyware but i do n't feel that is an issue let them worry about viruses such i 'll continue using webroot 's spysweeper to control spyware together they make a great combo to keep my computer clean	4
0	i have used works type products for years microsoft works 7 is the best of the lot it will work on almost any computer in use today and is definitely a best buy at the current price	4
0	i have used ms works from about the time it was born when it was quite primitive and sometimes unstable but i have continued to use it primarily for databases because it has become progressively more stable and easy to use these are not all small and simple databases many include several thousand items each with 20 to 30 fields of data it is easy to quot find quot single items or to assemble groups of items \( quot filter quot \) and to print customized reports so if you do n't need \( or want \) the super sophistication of access i have found works to be a friendly and helpful and inexpensive alternative	4
0	i put ms works on all systems that i make for other people it has everything they need and it dose n't break the bank the only thing i do n't like is that there is no presentation software or powerpoint clone then again if they included that ms office sales would go down a lot ! !	4
0	i bought this product because i had tried with great success another punch product it was so easy to use and load onto my computer it was a great value to be able to have one product that allows me to redesign anything from interior floors and walls to my deck and plants outside	4

0	have been using acrobat since v3 v4 v6 v8 is in line seems a bit faster smoother etc have tried imitations on other machines from a purely subjective view acrobat is best a bit pricey but the best with the usual caveats can be installed on a desktop and a notebook but requires a call to tech support which was quick and smooth	4

0	installed on windows xp with no problem and have already done an e file before the mid feburary update mentioned by others no problems with either having used turbotax for 6 years i had been led to believe that taxcut was inferior to turbotax i was pleased to discover that taxcut is just as good as turbotax and it 's cheaper too ! it also includes a rebate for a free federal e file something that intuit quietly has removed from this year 's turbotax i plan to use taxcut from now on	4
0	i think the rosetta stone software is a pretty effective mode of learning however it is necessary to do it on a regular basis and would probably be even more effective if one were to study verbs and vocabulary outside of the program in order to get the most out of the program i feel it is essential to do all the portions of each level lesson	4
0	i can never understand why others would want to use anything else i have tried four others and this one has been the best of all i now have been using this product starting about 1989 i upgrade about every 3 to four year	4
0	the software is better than the previous family tree deluxe version i bought it allows you to better classify potential matches and decide whether to look at them later or tag them if not interested the merging process of two databases is easier and allows you to pick what info to merge or whether to keep some info as secondary	4
0	i fell in love with another genealogy software years ago and was not happy with any newer ones when support and updates stopped for my original version when ancestry updated this year i decided i had to try a new software package again that was compatible with the cool things you can now do on ancestry so purchased this version i was very pleasantly surprised and happy i am still learning the best way to do things and occsionally get frustrated correcting info i have entered incorrectly but i would certainly recommend it the online checking it does and ability to attach the records found online is pretty awesome	4
0	though it may lack some of the integrated tools of quicken or other financial software ms money continues to be the best entry level software of its genre and the best value for the money particularly notable is the ease of integrating it with your on line banking tools to create a one stop shop for your financial needs	4
0	i upgraded to this version from money 2000 the interface looks cleaner and the reports and budgeting options are better i do find it a little less intuitive than the older version that i am used to overall i'm happy with this product and there is room for me to get to know it better i think it will last me for several years	4
0	money has built in value for the none accoundant person with little or no training a novice can become familar with this software in a very short time microsoft has a winner	4
0	i bought this a few months back and have used it quite a bit the maps look good although i hav n't noticed much change from version 2005 there are still some mistakes in the maps and they are still behind on being updated a little slow to load on both computers but it does fine after it gets going it has alot of nice features that make it convenient to use the phonebook is very nice !	4
0	i am not a professional reviewer or a tech guru but based on my experience with this product i am very satisfied i love the new interface and how easy it is to work with documents and apply formatting with such ease i have only used it for a month now and i still have to use some of the applications yet if you have the money and will love to have a new office suite that can give you some happiness working with documents every day go for it	4

0	as a beta user i assure you that this will make your life easier by not having to stock a lot of forms from the court	4
0	excellent product the 'over 450 value' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value during installation the 1 year free trial to showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker com support and a subsequent call to ancestry com support ancestry com provided a 1 year free trial to their us deluxe product over the phone and did n't ask for a credit card number for renewal to me that 's a sign that they 're a reputable company some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation cd but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install especially the gensmart software	4
0	i have used a few other genealogy products and this is the best so far i am a novice and for me family tree is easy to use and has a lot more features than roots magic the initial cost was more but the extras included made it a better value	4
0	i have not had a chance to thoroughly review this product but i was disappointed the calendar feature could not display the information i wanted especially since i had contacted customer service prior to purchasing the program and was assured it could be done	4
0	i have been using the family tree maker products for a number of years i love its ease in the ability to add new people into the genealogy charts i am a little disappointed in the change that moved the screen away from looking like a tabbed folder i feel that the old style was a lot more user friendly both visually and functionally	4
0	this sw is fantastic having the on line access made this product perfect without ionline access this product would only be a storage device for family history that you already know i was able to get info on my family back to the 1800 's in a matter of days since other relatives did all the research \( relatives i do n't even know \)	4
0	i am new at researching my family history the v16 collector 's ed of family tree maker was just what i needed as an extra bonus it has a 1 yr subscription to to enhance the research capabilities i would definitely recommenend this program	4
0	this is a great program if you never owned an older version of family treemaker the new version is so similar to the older versions it doesn't pay to upgrade	4
0	the product of windows xp professional is just what i was looking for with many updated features and i am looking forward in using it daily it was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it but most of all service was top knotch i could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems i may have had customer service is a plus i would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller	4
0	i think that this is a very good operating system but it is far too overpriced ! a note to the person who has the issue with disk 4 of his setup disk set try and get access to another computer and run diskcopy if that does't work then boot into ms dos with a windows 98se bootdisk and select the cd rom drive letter and then type cd i386 then type winnt then it will start the installation from the compact disc i gave it 4 stars because i believe that they could sell a better operating system for that price	4
0	i have been using computers since dos 5 0 and this is by far the most user friendly comprehensive and powerful operating system i have used so far aside from linux if you are interested in an easy to use dynamic os go with xp professional it has lots of features that are always coming in handy unless you wanna go crazy and are an it power user \( in which case linux \) go with this os its great	4
0	i found this upgrade has fixed some things and attempted to fix things that did not require fixing hot keys that go to dockers does not speed up the work process it appears to be slower in handling bmps larger files cause it to hesitate selecting objects a real memory hog the new contour tool makes the upgrade worthy so far it is not crashing like 12 did	4
0	i have used corel draw for many years and too many had serious problems this version seems to make up for the past with a stable system capable of most anything artistic it is still a complicated system though	4

0	this new version is cleaner and better than v12 in several areas that are important to me particularily the improved trace features	4
0	coreldraw x3 is a fine product it has added some nice features from v 11 coreldraw came with a rebate and i must say amazon failed big time in helping me apply for it on line was a joke replied by e mail 3 time never got a reponse talked to reps 2 times they did not help yes i got the product in 5 days but if you have a small problem amazon aint gunna get r done	4
0	he trabajado por 14 anos con coreldraw desde casi sus inicios para verlo convertirse en un programa realmente poderoso sin competencia en su area a mi parecer en esta nueva version de corel el x3 les digo que no me ha desilucionado no hay muchas herramientas nuevas pero son excelentes lo bueno es que se estan dedicando a mejorar las herramientas anteriores lo que es mucho mejor todavia	4
0	i 've been using system mechanic 6 professional for about a month i 'd have to say that the overall performance of windows xp has improved greatly since installation upon starting system mechanic a general report is given on the overall health of windows it fixes problems in the registry defragments the hard drives ram and boosts internet performance all of this is done is done in a short period of time \( under an hour \) i 've also read all the negative reviews on amazon i'm not going to dispute any of them since each user has his her own experiences using the product all i can say is that i'm glad that the software worked for me	4
0	you likely wo n't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very messy system but it does have a great antivirus and firewall and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on behind the scenes it 's an okay product but be very careful with the cleanup tool it will delete some important files if you are not careful ! !	4
0	system mechanic 6 professional is an excellent product and it solved all the problems i was having with my computer it also alerts you of impending problems i highly recommends this product	4
0	this book is among seminal works on system safety and safety engineering and should be read by anyone who is entering the field one may not necessarily agree with prof leveson 's views \( e g her often unfair and unjustified dismissal of european approaches to safety engineering \) but her views in the field are simply too important and influential to be ignored ! the book is a good bed time reading that gives an overview of the field major problems and introduction to some major approaches it is however not a handbook per se you will not understand any particular method sufficiently to apply it overall very good introductory text with a good coverage and a very easy and clear language	4
0	the computer game version of the number devil closely follows the book as kids progress through sections on prime numbers the fibonacci series pascal 's triangle and an infinite series approaching one nine of the ten games worked well for us but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth the arrow game we understood the math but could n't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows this was disappointing because we could never reach the bonus section all in all though this is a good investment for a child 8 or up who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers	4
0	i purchased fix it primarily to correct a registry problem it was rated very highly on the pcworld website it did a great job i had over 850 registry errors corrected them and did a reorg on the registry my computer is running beter now the other utilities included work as advertised i have been using norton systemworks for many years and this product is very comparable at a lower price	4
0	i think this is the best version to come out yet i would have a high end pc if i was to upgrade only software i would just wait and buy a new pc its alot easyer then learning a new operating system and if you enable the adminstrator account and only use your standard accounts to surf the web then it give you some security the firewall is good in the business versions and there is some good virus software out there its got alot more features and run 's good 's device drivers are easyier to load scott	4
0	this software was easy to install the terms and conditions of use are very clearly stated i found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me the puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood my one wish is that there were more varied games included but it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging	4
0	this is a great product to manage your email calendar and contacts this program has great power and features and is now much easier to use	4
0	maybe it 's because i was upgrading from an older version 2002 but i found the new features to be very good for example the junk mail feature works better than any other i have used it was catching junk from the very beginning and has missed very few things i have only had one thing put in the junk folder that was not junk email also the security features are far superior to the 2002 version and the calendar is more flexible and easier to use installation was seemless i think it might be a little overpriced but considering how long i will keep it it 's not too bad	4
0	this is an excellent product for kids my kid loves to learn with this software i had issues installing this product other than installation issues it has been excellent we are having fun now ! i will recommend this title for kids starting on chess	4
0	my children absolutely love this version they wake at 5 a m to play before school my son says it 's great i 've learned lots of tips and now i'm a much better chess player why a 4 star and not 5 \? the down side the game does n't allow the player to save at a certain level totally frustrates the kids when they want to return they have to start at the beginning again	4

0	my 4 year old son received this as a christmas present he has really enjoyed playing it so far he can do most of the activities without help there is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump which i think is pretty hard for little ones \( it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain \) there are many different learning activities matching memory shapes size etc we did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did we have a new dell computer running on windows xp	4
0	the upgrade presents a good value for a vista compatible product that includes improvements to ease of use particularly for combining documents into a single pdf	4
0	adobe standard 8 0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions if you do research and want a better interface design and functions then you need this new version of adobe it is an incredible tool for gathering sorting copying and formatting information it also is faster than older versions see details \( above \) on amazon recommended for all information knowledge workers	4
0	the operating system is a very good operating system for a home computer but obviously if you want a computer with more security features or networking features you should go with windows xp professional at the time that i am writing this which is a long time from when i purchased windows xp it is a time where windows vista is emerging if you plan on upgrading a slightly older computer i recommend windows xp home professional \( based on your requirements \) but if you are looking for a safe operating system for your beast try windows vista but one word of warning about vista the user account control \( uac \) is a pain in the butt	4

0	a great bargain you get full office professional vp and full version of windows for under 300 dollars after waiting for months and months for office 2004 professional to be released when it finally came out i was ecstatic one problem vp 7 0 would n't install on my g5 only on my laptop i called microsoft support and within minutes they told me that they were working on a patch for machines with over 2 0 gb of ram i downloaded the update a week later when it came out and everything is now golden the moral of the story is that microsoft underestimates the needs of mac users because they are used to wimpy pcs that have no ram	4
0	the rosetta stone language software was a great investment the product provides learning words together with listening seeing and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases it provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace the product has been worth it 's hefty price i do recommend purchasing a german english dictionary to accompany the software i have also had in the past a basic german 101 course prior to using rosetta stone so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the german language such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings	4
0	i tried an inexpensive program first and found it just did n't work this program has been fantastic !	4

0	this is another great card making product but i do n't believe as good as hallmark but \? i still use it a whole lot and love it ! i know you will too ! try it out ! and take a chance on a great product	4
0	i think this is actually a very good os there are a lot of new features and home premium appears to be the best vista os for the money i purhased a new pc with this os and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to ultimate for 150 only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for non microsoft products not excatly sure why this is microsoft 's problem though regardless this os is the smart choice for a new pc for home use accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new os then upgrade otherwise wait till you need a new pc	4
0	like the new look but am having problems making the transition jury still out	4
0	i only installed the product two days ago and have not really been able to give it a solid workout that said my initial take is very positive as a writer and lousy typist i think it will increase my productivity expotentially i look forward to really getting into the nuts and bolts of the product very soon	4
0	in my experience really learning a language requires a mix of learning approaches that means books tapes tutoring and experience in a country that uses it i have done all of these and feel this product is well worth including in the mix i highly reccomend it if you 're serious you need to just pony up the money and use it	4
0	we ordered this program only two weeks before moving to bogota columbia for a two year tour however the spanish rosetta stone taught was much higher level than the survival spanish we needed when we arrived overall we are learning the language and it is a great program wish we would have bought it 3 or 4 months before departing	4
0	it 's a great product especially for someone like me who works long hours and no chance of getting to take a language class formally this is the way to go ! thank you	4
0	i do n't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it it is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did and realize that you forgot to select test at the beginning also it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise' also not just the regular exercises other than these two things the program is very good	4
0	i recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not thepro version which costs 150 more and gives more functionality this is a fully functioning animation software with lots ofinteresting features i can see no reason that a noviceanimator such as i am would not be happy with this software i would like to see more energy put into a manual but youcan scavenge the anime blog chat site to find answers orgoogle other places with a more robust manual this wouldbe 5 stars not 4 it is really the reason i am reluctantto upgrade to pro because i would want more lessons andtutorials to go along with the upgrade if you have an interest in animating this is the softwarefor you	4
0	anime studio 5 is surprisingly powerful fairly easy to get started with and appears to have a lot of power waiting to be exploited	4
0	turbo tax deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return it 's very annoying to find and adjust the state return once you have gone back into your federal return i think it is a very good product but they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas especially for the state return	4
0	this product did an excellent job of figuring our taxes this is the first time we 've tried something like this and found it very easy to follow and complete you can go back and change things or review them it gives you a way to e file you can print out all the copies that you may need i was surprised how easy it was to use however it took us a long time because we read all the items very carefully and double checked everything but it saved us a lot of money from what we used to pay our tax preparer i was very happy with it	4
0	my only reccomendation would be a better user interface it can be a bit confusing the underlying functions work well though	4
0	i have been using omnipage for several years at my law office and found that the ocr with this version is impeccable i frequently scan and ocr newspaper and magazine articles they are multi column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts when i convert them into word documents i seldom get any formating errors in fact because the ocr is so good i have set up a batch process to run at night to ocr all the day 's work so my computer resoiurces are n't being taxed when i am in the office working way to go nuance	4
0	i only have the basic and its good but i 've seen this and it has to be the ing koolest thing you can have right now i highly recommened it for begginers to experts	4

0	the software was just what i expected and very useful to me when creating publisher documents that need to be emailed to clients	4
0	the program is over what i expected performance is great and such a useful tool	4
0	many more fonts to choose from an excellent value	4
0	i like the way the program goes through the tax forms as if you are interviewing with a tax preparer however i think it needs to do a better job of explaining why a tax form cannot be emailed and how to address that issue	4
0	purchased this edition of taxcut last week on win xp2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues i imported last year 's data in less than a minute and i had my return completed in less than 1 hour this includes capital gains losses dividends and amt calculations it does n't get much easier than this yes you have to download updates the irs is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores the alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it but would n't that take at least as long	4

0	it is a little bit clumsey when i go to it instead of my cursor being in the space where i write the word for a definition i have to place it there and that takes time the first one of these electronic dictionaries i had \( about 5 years ago \) was fabulous it was called deluxe and had everything but my computer outgrew ot amd the makers have never bothered to bring it up to date and offer it again	4
0	this software is very user friendly easy to install easy to use i would recommend it to anyone	4
0	it is wondeful software simple easy to use user friendly and very accurate in the pronunciation buy this cd do n't waste your money on the subscription at merriam webster 's website also try the medical dictionary it is as equally superb	4
0	i purchased this software mainly for web design i am beginning in web design and found microsoft frontpage 200 easy to learn with a lotof interesting features to design a web site i would definitely recommend this product	4
0	frontpage 2003 is a great easy to use wysiwyg web builder most hosting companies support frontpage extensions a set of web robots to help you build a dynamic site similar to dhtml two warnings though 1 \) this full version is too expensive you may qualify to buy the half priced academic version \( search for frontpage 2003 academic on amazon \) 2 \) more important though frontpage is being discontinued as a product altogether and will be replaced by office sharepoint designer \( for businesses \) and expression web \( for everyone else \) you can download the latter for free \( for now at least \) on msft 's website	4
0	given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt frontpage was a a really big help i was able to get a website up and running in about 2 weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering i did n't realize though that frontpage is n't the cureall for making a website really primarily only for web design i e if you want to make a website with e commerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like you 're gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in asp or php but as far as web design goes frontpage can take a novice a long way	4
0	it was some years ago when i bought a previous cd version of this encyclopedia although technology has advanced and wikipedia has come into existence encyclopedia britannica is more reliable	4
0	the hard copy of britannica has been the standard in reference for centuries now you can have all of that with video audio tons of photos and extra support from the web for a fraction of the price of the original for what you get it 's an incredible deal and an indispensable part of any reference library	4
0	i trust the information i find from britannica and so invested in the 2007 britannica ultimate reference suite it has something for everyone i use it side by side with microsoft encarta and together i get a more complete subject review i prefer the content of britannica but for ease of use encarta is still superior i look forward to britannica making the interface and ease of use better in future productions and that is why i am only able to award 4 stars	4
0	i have used quicken for over 12 years whenever i got a new version it always worked for me but it has too many things on it that i do n't need i like to keep it more simple for me so i just use the register reconcile reports and lists catagories for all i use it for i am happy with it	4
1	i have rented this video for the sake of a trip down memory lane of course fourteen years produce a great shift in gullibility i hated this video for its teaching of american ideology in perhaps the least open manner imaginable for example in	11
1	this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because amazon com never sent it too me this has happened about 4 5 times while usually i have no problem getting movies sometimes i do sending them e mails does n't seem to work if they did n't have the best prices for movies i 'd leave	11
1	hard to believe that sidney poitier went from directing a classic comedy like stir crazy to this music video not ready for mtv type of film very 80 's campy it was corny then as it is now	11
1	this romantic comedy was charming funny and clever i recommend it to anyone who does n't have a problem with heavy british accents \( if you do try it with captions \) it was fun funny and a nice pick me up when one needs a lift	11
1	this video did not live up to my expectations i have a five year old chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close the description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression instead ian dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with and focuses on puppy socialization in the video well that 's great if i had a puppy but i adopted an older dog and i need help now i do n't recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems if you have a puppy it might be somewhat helpful but there are better books	11
1	great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes it gets stuck or restarts itself very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd	11
1	the movie title itself says a lot the movie itself is a total scam fools people to rent or to watch it a horrible directing script and performance you 'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain dean bad movie	11
1	this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes yes it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment but not enough to watch this film it could be a cure for insomnia though fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen and it 's really just very boring all those fans of johnny depp be particularly warned he may have co star billing but blink and you 'll miss him	11
1	admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it 's moments of entertainment but overall it 's long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this did n't do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman 's silent scientific discoveries completely amusing could n't wait for the movie to end honestly	11
1	this movie made me sick to my stomach here we have a woman like nora ephron a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries she turns into a needy desperate women whom evidently believes her own self worth is determined by having babies one after another i ususally love all of meryl 's movies but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy always pregnant quot homemaker quot if i were a man i would have run awary screaming too	11
1	by the time you see the ending you 'll already be wishing that you had n't watched this movie	11
1	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky \( rodney eastman \) was in the movie \( for about 5 mins \) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars	11
1	the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin whatever you do do n't buy or rent this garbage wait to catch it on tbs or something	11
1	i was very disappointed the acting by the principles was fine but i think the only thing that saved this movie for me was the choreography by bob fosse i think what really turned me off was the omission of a few great songs the following tunes from the original show were left out near to you we 've got to think about the game a man does n't know and applegate 's tune the good old days was abridged a new tune there 's something about an empty chair was added to replace near to you but it was very weak i wish someone would remake this wonderful show as they 've done recently with music man and bye bye birdie	11
1	i'm sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick dick is funny this is not i'm sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst \( or that level of indefatigable cuteness \) just go rent dick instead you 'll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country	11
1	i imagine this movie might be funny if you 're really into dog shows i'm not so i could n't tell you mediocre at best this is spinal tap was better	11

1	michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through 'the big one' i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick \? this is not one of his better films	11
1	i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average bad guys on the run movie gee billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he does n't like cops at all he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard	11
1	this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny and that is also why the man who is now making x men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke	11
1	the move is one of my favorite sci fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to dvd that i have seen there are no special features and no chapter stops this is as if they copied a video tape to a dvd i could accecpt it being full frame but if i had known that it was this cheap a transfer i would not have purchased it	11
1	almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of 'shaft ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree	11
1	i get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide ! \? the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself ! \? ! \? it is not matching the character	11
1	i admit i have n't finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !	11
1	this movie is basically about 12 yr old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen \? the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what 12 yr old worries about never getting out of this small town \? i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense i have a feeling oprah would like this movie	11

1	chuck jones continues to entertain new audiences with the road runner and wile e coyote chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo i found it to be very exciting if you have road runner vs wile e coyote the classic chase from warner bros golden jubiliee 24 karat collection this video might not be for you the other five cartoons actually appear on that video zip n' snort operation rabbit hook line and stinker beep beep and ready woolen and able otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages	11

1	nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi	11
1	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	11
1	an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful quot eat drink man woman quot frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you have n't seen either see the better of the two \( exact same stories \) eat drink man woman	11
1	i rented this movie from netflix recently expecting a wonderfully campy cheesy horror film wrong its just an hour and a half of boring film the plot is lacking the characters are annoying especially duane its simply a ridiculous film	11
1	this movie made me sick to my stomach here we have a woman like nora ephron a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries she turns into a needy desperate women whom evidently believes her own self worth is determined by having babies one after another i ususally love all of meryl 's movies but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy always pregnant quot homemaker quot if i were a man i would have run awary screaming too	11
1	i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks this film was wack the acting directing but the story line was cool in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been interesting this film flip flopped time periods it hurt it 's cause i will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare truth be told in 2004 it ai n't that much better on a whole	11
1	this movies rates right up there with schindler 's list in terms of unapologetic propaganda fortunately ted turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making gettysburg and the even better gods and generals if you want to see a real accurate depiction of the war for southern independence \( aka the civil war \) watch gods and generals or gone with the wind and stay away from movie garbage like andersonville also watch for the extended version dvd of gods and generals coming for the christmas season of 2005	11
1	please think this dvd is recorded in 1986 more worse this is recorded as a documentary sound quality is worst after i bought this and dvd of quot company quot \( same worst sound quality documentary \) i suspect the word quot concert quot or quot soundtrack quot in dvd title	11
1	i will not watch the movie andersonville until they make a movie called elmira \( the camp in elmira n y the worst of the union prison camps had 35 death rate \)	11
1	i would have given this film 0 stars if possible this film was long boring and painful to watch if you like jane austen films or other bbc period films do not be deceived by this one it is nothing like those types of films	11
1	this movie is laughable today it 's very dated and it shows it 's not worth your time the acting is so so but felt forced \( like william shatner style \) the storyline is okay by today 's standards it appears like a low budget flick	11
1	this romantic comedy was charming funny and clever i recommend it to anyone who does n't have a problem with heavy british accents \( if you do try it with captions \) it was fun funny and a nice pick me up when one needs a lift	11
1	off hand i ca n't think of a worse movie \( and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films hey he 's making a buck here \) that 's all 1 32 star if possible	11
1	a work of fiction is a great thing but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong why not just make up a story with no historical basis	11
1	i love this film it 's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing i was thrilled to see it being released on dvd unfortunately it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used i have only viewed sections of the film so far but every frame i have seen has surface dirt or scratches in one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture i was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves i 'd have given 5 stars if it had so the minus three is for the appaling print one of the worst i 've ever seen	11
1	this movie could 've been something had they gotten some real actors a script and a director well they did n't and this movie is an embarassment to mankind	11
1	off hand i ca n't think of a worse movie \( and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films hey he 's making a buck here \) that 's all 1 32 star if possible	11
1	this must have seemed like a great idea at the time cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor the problem is his range is all the way from a to b this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many chance happenings in the end all we get is this thriller \( and i use the term very loosely \) that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling	11
1	this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because amazon com never sent it too me this has happened about 4 5 times while usually i have no problem getting movies sometimes i do sending them e mails does n't seem to work if they did n't have the best prices for movies i 'd leave	11

1	sat down and saw this one on televion only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement slanders the u boat men portraying them as heartless marauders other than allied propoganda pieces there are no incidents of u boats machinegunning people in lifeboats the movie itself i have little respect basicly plotless and unrealistic action scenes unbelievable characters two dimensional this film awful	11
1	i got this film because i'm from detroit where this takes place it 's a pretty typical revenge flick four brothers want to find their adoptive mother 's killer usual smartass remarks guys talking bs fights shootouts blah blah blah i guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch this script was mediocre at best give me a clint eastwood or bruce willis film any day over this tripe	11
1	i was expecting much more from this video it did have kids doing poses but it was hard to find the 13 year old some of the circle games looked like they might be fun i wanted to show it to my third grade class but i do n't think it would hold their interest all in all i felt i was watching someone 's home video of their family doing yoga	11
1	this is much more interesting as a visual chronicle of 1982 new york \( there are generous aerial views lots of location shooting etc \) than as a horror movie even a cheesy one the special effects are used extremely sparingly with the word special being a definite overstatement some amusing performances somewhat redeem the proceedings but not by much in the end q the winged serpent is watchable and certainly not horribly bad but it 's hard to imagine this being anybody 's favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure to end on a positive note the dvd features a clean sharp print of the film	11
1	the recent disappearance of spalding gray has made me realize what i do n't like about this film its narcissism it 's gray 's defining characteristic after a while despite jonathan demme 's fabulous direction \( he makes the best of a limited repertoire \) it just gets boring	11
1	i read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the mom in the book fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late so i feared that this movie would not be up to the book my fears were unfounded the casting was brilliant and i loved this movie even though it is tough to watch i still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and must watch that is how good it is	11

1	i am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf i had to return it	11
1	unless you enjoy movies that are not funny not scary and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even so bad it 's funny absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! !	11

1	the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow tepid and hard to grasp film the previews for this film were better than the actual movie i guess that 's a bad sign that the movie is n't going to be great \( i 'll try and remember that next time \) the only reason i am giving the fogotten 2 stars is the scene with alfe woodward you 'll know what i mean when it happens the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere very intrguing spurprise awaits anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that 's it happy viewing	11
1	nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi	11
1	a typical altman film made to please himself not an audience i do n't know how he keeps getting financing no one sees them except family and friends additionally it suffers from soft focus out of focus photography that will drive you nuts ! after awhile you do n't give a damn whether they have a wedding or not	11
1	i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i could n't find anything about this film i remember enjoying it 's a cross between the blob the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty 's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80 's kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you 'll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense few laughs and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more	11
1	while a wonderful story this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch a bit hard to understand why the child of two english parents would speak like she 's from new jersey ! i could n't watch the end of this it was so bad recommend you see another version	11
1	nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi	11
1	the details are all fine if you do n't know the middle east but are not well researched and inconsistent i wo n't bore you with the list all the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake tell us something new the overall storyline does not have much else going for it i was expecting more intrigue a more synthesized story line a disappointment	11
1	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	11
1	an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful quot eat drink man woman quot frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you have n't seen either see the better of the two \( exact same stories \) eat drink man woman	11
1	this is absolutely no improvement on the poor vhs video tape a travesty i subtract all stars for the terrible transfer menu and options	11
1	shameless rip off of jungle taitei \( kimba the white lion \) by tezuka any anime lover can tell \( similarities in characters scenes and story lines are unbelievable \) disney 's response \? never heard of kimba oh purleese i'm kicking myself for paying disney for this piece of swindle	11
1	this video did not live up to my expectations i have a five year old chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close the description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression instead ian dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with and focuses on puppy socialization in the video well that 's great if i had a puppy but i adopted an older dog and i need help now i do n't recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems if you have a puppy it might be somewhat helpful but there are better books	11
1	a slow loggy movie about a philandering husband \( everyone was guessing this was watergate reporter carl bernstein in the nora ephron novel on which the movie is based he was ephron 's husband \) jack nicholson plays the husband and meryl streep the wife and both are uncharacteristically bland there is hardly anything to the story they marry she gets pregnant he gets restless and wanders we finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started very dull	11
1	this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes yes it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment but not enough to watch this film it could be a cure for insomnia though fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen and it 's really just very boring all those fans of johnny depp be particularly warned he may have co star billing but blink and you 'll miss him	11
1	this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the u s to escape the persecution he 's suffered in cuba and that 's about all that can be inferred from this movie there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what 's going on this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all whatever the message of this movie is whatever it 's trying to convey it 's lost in the plotless story	11
1	i will not watch the movie andersonville until they make a movie called elmira \( the camp in elmira n y the worst of the union prison camps had 35 death rate \)	11
1	this movie made me sick to my stomach here we have a woman like nora ephron a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries she turns into a needy desperate women whom evidently believes her own self worth is determined by having babies one after another i ususally love all of meryl 's movies but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy always pregnant quot homemaker quot if i were a man i would have run awary screaming too	11
1	talentless people and garbage music torture you in this turkey in no time flat you 'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming make it stop ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! out into the yard do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense	11
1	this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties eli wallach is good but confusing who and what is he after \? the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it is n't what a shame ! ! ! it could have been made better less comedy and more plot and of course action and suspense ! ! ! ! buy or rent on your own if you dare i would n't	11
1	unable to see the movie received the original shipment and later a replacement and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie	11
1	i simply spent time watchnig this french response to a chaplin style but non silent motion picture maybe it was a top at the timing of the making	11
1	should n't a masterpiece of comedy be i do n't know funny	11
1	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers	11
1	after purchasing this i have only been able to watch it once audrey hepburn is my favorite all time actor actress and she \( joanna in this \) is brilliant as always however albert finney 's roll \( mark \) charactor and performance is in stark contrast the further the movie goes the more i disliked mark and was angry that joanna was putting up with him mark 's charactor is over the top and unbeliveable five stars audrey minus four albert	11
1	jet li as a contrac killer \? come on ! the reason why this movie is n't that famous is because it pretty much sucks it 's just a shootem up bang bang type of movie no realy kung fu here	11
1	it 's about time for someone to make a strong pitch to hollywood for a new version of fahrenehit 451 although i appreciate what truffault was trying to accomplish back in the sixties the movie just does not hold up well in 2007 particularly when shown in a high school classroom advancements in cgi could transform bradbury 's novel into a very frightening and exciting thriller my students spent more time laughing at the adaptation than appreciating it thematically that being said the book gained value exponentially to them because the movie did n't satisfy their understanding lose the wires on the jet packs !	11
1	quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book hopefully they will remake the movie soon because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice	11
1	i could n't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking the characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do \? mamet appears to have never left manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective to be honest i did n't finish the entire film but instead checked the tv guide for reruns of northern exposure for the real thing	11
1	but it gets one star for the brief moments that ricky jay has in the film and another for portions of alec baldwin 's performance overall this is a stinker mamet is not a good director he should stick to writing	11

1	overacted boring horrible movie the only likable character was cat	11
1	so not at all what i was expecting i had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it i was terribly disappointed and confused	11
1	i have no idea why i saw this movie in the first place perhaps it was because the jungle book is a fascinating story however i was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly \( in a stupid way \) the action scenes were terrible i recommend this movie to 6 year olds who dont care about the quality of movies	11
1	the young actor is great in this movie but the film itself is non exciting and a bit boring	11
1	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers	11
1	this movie is watchable but barely its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions and see leatherface as a never mind youllhave to see for yourselves we have a yound renee zellweger in this one	11
1	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that did n't play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok	11
1	i rented this and once downloaded it stated that my client license was up tech support couldnt help me and instead just refunded my money it was nothing but a waste of time	11
1	this movie is far from being anything great some of the characters do n't make any sense what so ever with the original cast leatherface 's role has been mocked people spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up leatherface the first tcm is a classic and the second tcm is great as well but leatherface tcm iii the next generation and the tcm remake have all made the texas chainsaw massacre franchise a laughing stock i really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up the only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with cgi enough is enough	11
1	i thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot it was terrible first because of the camera shake i do n't know about you but i ca n't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking needless to say i did n't make it through the whole film but from what i saw the main actor was irritating to watch	11
1	this is one of the most boring films i ever watched there is nothing erotic in it the whole story is perverted with a poor innocent but very stupid woman submitting to the sadist fantasies of various lovers she is introduced i put inverted comas in lovers because none of them have a single tender erotic moment with her but instead they brutally beat her and rape her in the presence of others who seem to be totally oblivious to the proceedings	11
1	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that did n't play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok	11
1	i agree with most of the reviews here that the movie is just so bad the director had the wrong idea of an art film methophors and strange incoherrent ending is not the only thing you need to make an art film i was pretty intrigued by the lead 's obssession with the hunky swimmer but it just did not end the movie satisfactorily can anyone explain like when did he have the rubber suite whats with the garbage dump ending it is just too pointless ! ! ! i felt cheated of 90 mins of my life	11
1	as i recall 1967 was not the most prolific year for movies and point blank in my opinion would be one of the worst films i have ever watched notwithstanding the very violent nature of the film the acting by such notables as lee marvin carroll o'conner and angie dickinson continually appear to search for conviction with their dis jointed and nonsensical dialogue flashbacks san quentin the san francisco skyline cannot save this film from the trash heap of celluloid history if your a lee marvin fan better to watch the man who shot libery valance twice than waste your time on point blank your disposition will be better for it	11
1	ok so claud was never a great actor and this was not his best work yes the martial arts are weak at best but i still own this movie and watch it just to see raul julia go over the top why do they still call me a warlord \? and mad \? all i want to do is to create the perfect genetic soldier not for power not for evil but for good carlos blanka will be the first of thousands they will march out of my laboratory and crush every adversary every creed every nation ! until the world is in the loving grip of the pax bisonica and peace will reign and all humanity will bow to me in humble gratitude	11
1	i ordered this the night of the oscars i will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy there was n't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging it looks like a bad vhs transfer i should have returned it but it would 've been more trouble than it was worth i thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be but unfortunately in my case i have to add buyer beware	11
1	bernard hermman 's score is magnificent this was a major let down for me considering it was directed by truffaut lacked any real suspense and edge boring camera work for the most part some nice editing touches here and there but overall pretty lackluster the acting was fine i guess it was just a pointless story i felt that really did n't go anywhere and what was with that crummy ending	11
1	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television do n't bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd	11
1	it 's always a pleasure to see fred 's legwork but his relationship with hepburn is completely implausible due to huge age difference and weak plot	11

1	i am completely befuddled that anyone with any love for the book could enjoy this movie it is merely a monument to hollywood 's stunning inability to read or to understand the simplest moral tale in dumas 's book the count learns that he cannot play god dispensing punishments to the evil and rewards to the good because of the complex ways in which the wheat and the tares are intertwined in this earthly life he abandons his project of perfectly just revenge and accepts a new love as a gift from a mysteriously merciful god hollywood gives us instead triumphant revenge	11
1	save your money or give it to charity this is one of the worst films for a long time the characters are one dimensional you do n't care who they are and when they die you 're indifferent the direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory i was so bored with this film that i ca n't even bring myself to write anything else about it	11
1	all the promos made me think that this would be a really great sci fi story with beautiful babes all over the place well there were some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies never materialized has the art of posing been lost by modern girls \? maybe all the good directors have retired or died ! what a pity why i could n't even muster a stiff upper lip as i played this dvd through to the end in spite of my being a certifiable dirty old man \)	11
1	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i'm downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that	11
1	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i did n't really want it i just thought i 'd try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again ! ! ! and the directions do n't work so i do n't even have the free stuff i paid for	11

1	we all know that tamilee has that body did n't expect her to be the only body in the video i am more for a group atmosphere so in that regard i pass on this video maybe next time tami	11
1	i too was n't very impressed with jarhead i thought half way through that jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the marines and perhaps other branches of the military for those of us who have n't i just do n't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested as someone else mentione i too thought it was going to be a more modern version of full metal jacket but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it was n't	11
1	maybe i'm spoiled by big budget sci fi films but i thought this movie kind of stunk it felt and looked like a tv movie and was n't scary at all the best funniest part was how no one could remember the one lady 's name or face and everyone described her the same way the one with the glasses oh her have n't seen her lol	11
1	totally disappointed ! ! ! i love woody allen love his filmsbut dvd s are coded for us market and are not possible to be viewed on our european dvd stotal waste of moneyyou should have warned me on thatbarbara kalas architect from croatia	11

1	i'm an animation fan and when this came up recommended to me i was eager to check it out while the animation was fine \( although a tad creepy \) i found the story off putting its basically about a bunch of dysfunctional people on drugs in a depressing future where there are a lot of people doing drugs a k a substance d i found this film depressing and annoying i particularly found the 'blur suit' to be distracting to watch it almost gave me a headache 1 star did not like	11
1	this movie is not for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird sure there are plenty of plot holes reeves is in it so do n't expect an academy award however the plot is very interesting \( again filled with tons of holes \) but i watch a movie to be entertained not to be a film critic or to analyze everything overall if you like weird movies like fear and loathing in las vegas this movie is for you if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how true to life it may or may not be well just skip this one	11
1	i'm sorry i really really tried to get into this movie and just could n't it was just plain boring normally i love these types of movies but not this one i just kept waiting and waiting for the 'point' or for something to make the last hour and a half of watching it worthwhile never happened i would recommend renting this one first just to make sure	11
1	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money	11
1	most of the time i love french films 400 blows breathless etc this one caught my eye so i bought it waste of horrible i never did really get the plot becuase there was not much of one it was just like a homemade movie with really bad sound i looked around the room and the other two people watching it with me had fallen asleep	11
1	pleasant movie but nothing special a very ordinary story audrey hepburn 's charisma is what puts some life to the movie some subtle humour though	11
1	this movie was awfull supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion	11

1	this movie the story of a shocking long ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime the modern day portion of the movie is very tedious elizabeth hurley 's and sean penn 's characters are laughable caricatures anita shreve 's writings never disappoint read the book instead	11
1	i did n't even open this copy of gothic as soon as i realized it was n't letterboxed i immediately returned it i 've seen the movie before i love ken russell but i wont' watch it if is n't in letterbox	11
1	this was a critically lauded film so when i went in i had high expectations roger ebert himself called it a masterpiece i saw it and it was certainly interesting but i immediately forgot about it right after i left the theater there really is n't much depth here it 's more reminiscent of getting a quick rush from something then after it wears off you do n't even remember how you felt afterwards i remember a scene where a cow is blown up but other than that it 's hard for me to remember anything about it it ultimately was very ordinary and not a really deep film about war	11
1	very bizzare movie ! not for kids or anyone who is prudish ! can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it	11

1	a poorly conceived poorly put together mess do n't bother	11
1	jeremy brett was by this time indeed quot the dying detective quot but his real life condition in no way helps this tedious and undramatic rendition of one of conan doyle 's more tasteless holmes stories the original features some of holmes' worst and most insensitive treatment of poor watson but since this series made such a thing of their friendship the adapters have a heck of a time getting around it stick with the brett episodes from the mid 80s when he was fresh in the role and the adaptations were true and intelligent	11
1	i watched anger management on the plane since there is nothing else to watch and the flight is more than ten hours you usually watch whatever is on t v i thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad though there are some funny parts there is some offensive language overall it 's a bad movie and is not worth watching	11
1	the unbox video version of this film for tivo is useless only after purchasing it did i discover that this film can only be downloaded to a tivo a certain number of times in a certain time period for more than the cost of the dvd i'm restricted in when where and how i can watch this movie nothing like being treated like a criminal by the movie studios i will not purchase another tivo unbox film	11

1	it gets two stars for the unintentional comedy other than that it 's one of the worst of the ultra cheesy predictable low budget horror movies from the early nineties the fx are funny at first but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy the acting is uniformly terrible and one has to image that the typically enjoyable barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her	11

1	this sure sounded like a hot movie when i read the overview a young woman curious about sex and trying to get herself off boy i sure was surprised at what this really is a super softcore b movie with terrible acting and almost no sex ! ! ! you want nudity \? sorry but this movie does have worms thats right worms ! in one of the sex scenes a guy puts live worms into the womans private area yeah it 's that bad stay far away from this one	11

1	watching the razor release \( which i bought to save a few dollars \) elevated my blood pressure due to the careless way this rare gem of a movie was treated let alone that the terrible translation made me miss the meaning all too many times fortunately i was able to find the much praised version released by era of taiwan from a seller here on amazon and it sure did justice both to the film and to the dialog sheer perfection	11

1	the unbearable lightness of being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason the point of kundera 's writing is not his plot or even his characters but his style for instances his endless digressions about history politics and philosophy for the movie we are left with nothing but plot and character ok what is one to do \? that in itself would n't be so bad if i did n't watch the film with the constant thought i could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie this is a slow film it takes an hour and a half story and takes three hours to tell it i ca n't recommend the film	11

1	maybe it 's because he is such a stright shooter \( pun ment \) or something but clint does n't do cold war thrillers very well \( remember firefox \) while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they do n't cover up the fact that it was a good book that does n't watch as good as it read some may like it but i found it to be a let down	11

1	set against the backdrop of the spanish civil war quot talk of angels quot could have been provocative and sweeping but it settles for little more than standard issue governess falls for the rich guy romance vincent perez has a smoldering presence but the beautiful polly walker is as flat on screen as a fascist protest poster the two have little chemistry the result a stilted and perfunctory outing the only saving grace is the always wonderful frances mcdormand whose hard bitten love struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest	11
1	i was n't expecting disney but i was less than thrilled by this feature i'm assuming there 's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70 's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story i am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything but i could n't get through this whole film	11
1	this in an uninspired telling of a transparent political fable good enough to watch once	11
1	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i did n't really want it i just thought i 'd try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again ! ! ! and the directions do n't work so i do n't even have the free stuff i paid for	11
1	not that i know everything about crime especially getting away with it but a shock to the system made it look too easy performances by michael caine as a done wrong now doin' wrong angry executive and will patton as the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on television but a shock to the system needed to close a few holes in its story to make it worthy of your movie theater home video payment	11
1	two moderately decent looking white people who apparently are n't very good at sex go at it in this movie if that 's your thing why not just rent a bad softcore porn film and be done with it \? at least then you wo n't have to listen to the cornball pseudo artistic dialogue in this film what a crock they could at least have cast a fine young sista like rosario dawson or gabrielle union to make this movie moan and squeal ! this movie makes sex seem boring	11
1	one of the worst films of a generation many talented comedic \( dave thomas colleen camp \) were wasted in this decrepit piece of digital doggeral	11
1	this was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by sir arthur conan doyle it did n't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters the plot and scripting are incredibly weak it seems the editors just stopped mid movie and rolled the credits there the cgi dinosaurs' appearances were impressive but their animation was very stiff in my opinion not worth the 83 it costs	11
1	i was really disappointed with this entry even though jason takes manhattan is n't much better ! the dvd treatment is way to good for this film if you want to complete the friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the freddy vs jason movie	11

1	i read this book for a project two years ago i was n't about to finish this book and had to move to another one first off this book lacks emotion this character is so boring she does n't seem to ever feel sad or mad and to me a book without emotion is just unreadable i hated this book but i do n't like most scott o'dell books just go read another book	11

1	lorna is pretty and her suitor is devoted the story holds your attention for many that is enough some auspicious beginnings without depth so maybe 3 stars for some people i give 2 stars if i do not keep it to watch again in later years i found the romance unfulfilling and so the movie romance movies that i liked better are north south pride prejudice 1940 1996 2006 wives and daughters and a walk to remember adventure with romance the scarlet pimpernel	11
1	just a note to those who were uncomfortable watching this film with their children movies have ratings for a reason this movie is rated pg 13 which tells you up front that it has content that is considered inappropriate for children in this case it is crude humor what i do n't understand is why they made a movie with a story line aimed at a young audience and then inclduded content that earned it a rating that recommends that a young audience should n't see it	11
1	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money	11
1	between the amended politically correct ending to this famous tale and the so very hokey interaction between kirstey alley and lloyd bridges i could n't wait for this to be over ! the animation was very poor quality the music was not the focus my grandchildren lost interest shat else could possibly have been wrong	11
1	unfortunately i was sent a standard american copy of the movie which of course does n't function on a european system despite my adress beeing in switzerland so i was kind of disapointed to have a \) lost the money b \) not been able to watch the movie one is wrong to assume that every european household is having an american compatible dvd player	11

1	it 's always nice to watch famke janssen of course but i like it better when she 's either a very smart x person or a bond busting sadist this movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh and the bad guy was like an evil version of sgt carter from gomer pyle totally implausible i think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them	11
1	this was on television earlier today it 's a horribly dated film bad pacing bad music with not much of a plot also i 'd suggest not eating at dante 's and please try not to kill the messengers	11
1	i do n't think so contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script think about it take a dump on a stock and get wiped out now you are a messenger \? i do not think so i know of a few new york stock exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades but this is crazy thank goodness they kept the new york scenes to a minimum yes he was suppose to be at the nyse and not the pacific stock exchange as a previous reviewer wrote	11
1	this movie i think was just plain depressing ! just when you think something good and happy will happen someone dies people seperate bones are broken so on and so forth this movie got alot of great reviews and it was a fun movie but for people who like complete happy endings this film is not for you	11

1	to be quite honest although there was a stunning cast the plot was gory it was sweet and had it 's element of romance but it was too morbid for me to enjoy if you are watching for drew barrymore do n't bother she only appears halfway through the movie and then only sporadically afterwards dean cain on the other hand looks mighty fine if you 're after a gay man it 's not the type of movie you want your children to watch trust me	11
1	a shallow treatment of shallow characters with shallow values a waste of time	11
1	when danny devito 's plays larry garfield he is like taxi 's louie de palma of wall street	11
1	something fishy is certainly going on if the average review for this movie is 4 stars this is truely the worst adaptation of a novel ever made costner should be tried for crimes against cinematography this movie is far beyond awful	11
1	i love this movie as i have seen it many times audie murphy did a great job in playing himself although it must have been really hard to relive a movie that i would highly recommend	11

1	what i mean by the title of my review is yes this movie is going to be funny its monty python ! but there is also some parts where it just really gets out of hand in my mind if you are new to monty python i would get the quest for the holy grail before this one also the monty python 's flying circus is great too it comes in a 16 dvd set so it will give you a lot of their old stuff i really did not enjoy certain parts but there is a few good moments	11
1	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i'm downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that	11

1	george segal is a good actor but he is out of his element in this type of movie he is much better in light hearted movies like fun with dick and jane the biggest disappointment is the dialog by harold pinter the characters exchange meaningless small talk at cross purposes while nothing happens and we all get bored this spy movie is not even in the same league with day of the jackel and the odessa file i threw away my copy of the quiller memorandum after watching it once i ca n't imagine ever wanting to see it again	11
1	over done is the best way to describe this over the top attempt to view gang life from the eye of a stolen video camera	11
1	this is not one of fred 's better efforts the dancing is so so and rita hayworth is among his poorest dance partners lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the astaire rogers films in spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching	11

1	i am a huge fan of bbc period drama and have nearly exhausted my library 's supply of miniseries based on the works of austen gaskell dickens and eliot but i would have to say that the bbc struck out this time the direction was bad the acting was mediocre at best the music was obtrustive and the screenplay was just plain awful after the first half hour my sisters and i survived the rest by poking fun at one cliche after another i have not read the book so i do n't know how much of it is from the source material makes me curious to read it though the costumes and some of the scenery were good i 'll give it that	11
1	i was very unimpressed with this movie borat suffers from the same delusion as sarah silverman in thinking that crass or politically incorrect automatically equals funny it does not of course sometimes it can be hilarious \( and borat does have moments like that \) but overall i did not find this movie particularly funny or even amusing especially the scene where the naked friend sits on borat 's face was just disgusting and it dragged on and on and on at some point i just fast forwarded it you 're not missing much if you do n't watch this movie	11
1	i have no idea why i saw this movie in the first place perhaps it was because the jungle book is a fascinating story however i was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly \( in a stupid way \) the action scenes were terrible i recommend this movie to 6 year olds who dont care about the quality of movies	11

1	the plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language this could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated it is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting dying young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality i threw it in the trash as i would not share it with those that i love	11
1	everthing about this movie was bad the acting the story the revenge of the nerds like characters and humor the acting and production value was so bad that you 'd think it was a home made movie with somebody using a home camera from 1975 how much did it cost them to film this movie \? 50 bucks \? the revenge of the nerds like script has been done to death and has never been funny to begin with	11
1	this film really made me angry and pissed off i bothered watching it the characters were cardboard and i ca n't believe ingrid bergman starred in this junk the main character totally lost it believing all what her husband was saying about her she was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con	11

1	very bizzare movie ! not for kids or anyone who is prudish ! can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it	11
1	a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era but what can one expect \? there is \( at least one \) great movie to be made about that era dont look for it here	11

1	save your 3 50 dvd rental fee if you 're looking for a movie that will make you feel like city of angels made you feel look elsewhere ! sorry my vote is for hollywood the director of wings admits that there was no script before shooting began the extras that came with the wings dvd interviews and info on berlin were more entertaining than the movie	11
1	this movie does n't have a single scene worth watching femalien 1 is in another league do n't waste your time on the sequel	11

1	this movie is a dog pure and simple we ended up with two of these are the freebie give aways for the last few dvd players we bought they ca n't sell it so they 're giving them away hide fast	11
1	purely for fans of crappy van damme movies again like i says really corny from beginning to end paul sorvino is totally and utterly fat and moronic in this one rob schnider is wasted and why the hell was he in this i will have no clue van damme kicks more butt and does more corny things then he did in double team with horrible dialouge and a plot that seems like it came from some guy wiping his ass with a piece of toilet paper and then saw it on the piece of paper and said hey ! ! ! ! damnit lets make a movie about this piece of crap right here	11
1	this film was dreadful streisand is absolutely unlikeable to enjoy this film you would need to buy into the romance between streisand and nolte and i just ca n't see how that is possible i could n't believe it when i found out how critically acclaimed this film was along with the english patient this is one of the worst 'critically acclaimed' films i have ever had the displeasure of viewing	11
1	i tried to watch this twice to see what the hype was i fell asleep both times not funny just slow boring and stupid way overated	11

1	carly simon 's the only one worth watching on this dvd but she 's only in the film for 69 seconds and her only line is i read that sh t you wrote about me and thats what this movie i	11
1	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money	11
1	but it gets one star for the brief moments that ricky jay has in the film and another for portions of alec baldwin 's performance overall this is a stinker mamet is not a good director he should stick to writing	11
1	this movie lacked the luster i expect from robert duvall it was an endless journey into boredom at least for me	11

1	i bought this dvd on the basis that shania twain performed the half time show even when i did a search for shania twain this dvd was listed incorrectly as there is no shania performance on the dvd as far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the uk and know nothing about american footbal sorry ! !	11
1	an hour and a half of beautiful men prancing around wearing very little can never be less than watchable but aside from the nudity and homoerotic horseplay there is n't much else granted there are a few nicely filmed poignant moments but it 's often dull	11
1	only worth the second stop motion sequence when flesh fights a robot twig that scene is almost flawless and as good as any harryhausen animation the one love scene with flesh and the hot curvy brunette is also nice the film is worth a rent if your curious but it 's really just a lame and unfunny movie if your open to seeing a trashy sci fi satire of flash gordon with some interesting special effects give it a look especially fans of stop motion animation in which the film features 3 creature sequences	11
1	i enjoyed this movie i orginially saw this move 30 years ago and it brought back some good memories from the seventies i would n't really call it a porn movie it 's more of a movie with adult humor i 'd give it an r rating compared to some of the stuff that is available today	11
1	what a waste of fim ! too snide for my taste maybe it'd been entertaining back in the 60's but today it's attempt at camp or kitsch is just too thin	11

1	i must admit that i am a guy and that i bought this movie before seeing it i was not shocked with the horrible acting but was surprised with the hot stars this movie had both hot guys and girls the actor that caught my eye was steven albrecht freddy he is so hot we get see him completely nude showing off his hot body he did a great job in his breif scene josh edwards trian was okay to look at too as for the actress venesa taylor is also hot	11

1	this movie the story of a shocking long ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime the modern day portion of the movie is very tedious elizabeth hurley 's and sean penn 's characters are laughable caricatures anita shreve 's writings never disappoint read the book instead	11

1	i do n't know what 's up with all of these 4 5 star reviews this movie was awful there was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag not even the guest appearances by afrika bambataa melle mel and the rock steady crew could save it i could n't wait for it to be over with the graffiti throughout the movie was absolutely awful ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair guy davis was fine back then but not anymore rae dawn chong was just annoying this is one movie i never want to see again	11

1	sleep with me would be completely worthless if not for a quentin tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of top gun that lasts about two minutes the remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious ersatz neo bohemian characters except for tarantino 's top gun bit \( and the twenty seconds or so when parker posey has her shirt off \) there 's nothing worthwhile here	11

1	i used to think this film was okay but it 's really lame he 's going home only cause he wants a car shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas they only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season	11
1	simply not enough of amy weber in the film in the scenes she was in she looked lovely but i was hoping to see more anyone hoping to see weber get down and dirty will be disappointed	11
1	this has got to be one of the worst films i 've ever seen the characters are pointless and one dimensional the guy is a jerk and inspires no sympathy they have sudden fights over apparently nothing in fact there is no cause and effect in this movie at all ! things just happen randomly for no apparent reason there 's no real story the takes are boring most scenes hum along endlessly making for quite boring viewing the violent ending was n't even believable ! instead of inspiring any kind of shock or sympathy i was left just thinking what the \? \? \? really really pointless all around	11
1	the young actor is great in this movie but the film itself is non exciting and a bit boring	11
1	i was really disappointed with this entry even though jason takes manhattan is n't much better ! the dvd treatment is way to good for this film if you want to complete the friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the freddy vs jason movie	11

1	if you were hoping for a skin flick this is not it a couple of minutes of long shots of the young girls swimming topless and one real nice look at julie mccullouh \( \) in bed is not enough too qualify the acting is awful angie looks great for her age still not enough	11

1	even though fans of hk cinema have as a whole come a long way since hk films were generally only seen in the states on saturday afternoon television some studios are still refusing to provide buyers with the option of seeing hk films in their original language with subtitles this film is available from columbia tristar only in a dubbed format and for that reason i wo n't be getting the region 1 release of this film	11
1	this film stinks it gives b scifi a bad name even makes those roger corman movies look stunning if possible i would give it a negative rating to balance the positive reviews seen here if you want cornball underwater action buy quot voyage to the bottom of the sea quot provided that your cerebral cortex is active you 'll agree it 's a zillion times better	11
1	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500 000 on him and it all goes down hill from there there is no rhyme or reason to the story i gave it two stars because the landscape is great	11

1	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
1	it 's not just that if lucy fell is a bad film 90 of what comes out of hollywood is uninspired formulaic dross just like it and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it what makes this movie memorably remarkably bad is writer director star eric schaeffer 's nauseatingly immense sense of self regard which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday 's roadkill the mere fact that the photogenically challenged mr schaeffer should have the likes of elle macpherson tell him he 's cute speaks volumes	11
1	this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence	11
1	i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company 's software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon 's player to view it blah you 're better off buying the dvd for 20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer	11
1	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs	11

1	i'm a firm believer in freedom of speech but honestly this movie was disgusting without any redeeming qualities the product description listed above is completely misleading it 's basically a movie in which the abusers abuse and degrade their victims and then at the end they slowly torture them to death pretty much the worst movie i have ever seen	11
1	i just want to let potential marketplace buyers of salo that the seller closeoutgoods and other amazon marketplace sellers are selling pirated \( bootlegged \) editions of this movie and other criterion dvds if amazon were legitimate they would ban these marketplace sellers from their website every potential buyer should report these crooks to the fbi and criterion	11
1	i found this movie to be a fascinating story about the trauma that can be caused to those we love when we allow our fantasies and daydreaming to interfere with our actual lives i was constantly wondering where i would draw the line if i was the heroine the experience allowed me to visualize the mayhem that could be caused by to much fantasy daydreaming	11

1	do n't know about anyone else but the dvd i purchased had lousy video the only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots all of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either i know the concert was indoors but i 've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem did i get a bad dvd or did anyone else have this problem	11
1	if you want erotica then this is n't the emanuelle film for you yes there are a couple of so so love scenes but the one lesbian scene is pratically non existent and the obvious focus of this one is the blood and gore content i expected more erotic content and instead got mostly gruesome scenes that i did n't particularly expect remember that scene in quot tarzan the ape man quot where a nude bo derek was tied up and bathed by native women \? that scene was erotic nothing like that one this video	11
1	good cast adaptation of king lear do n't bother unless you are really bored	11

1	why oh why do you advertise the 1979 version of crime punishment with john hurt using the pictures from the 2002 version starring the sublime john simm i would download the 2002 version all day everyday but the misleading pictures are really unfair either offer me the version i want or get the pictures right	11
1	this title is the bootleg title for a film called the the ratings game i'm no sure why amazon is selling this on their web site the quality of this dvd is terrible i was suspicious when i got it the dvd caseand the dvd itself look like they were home made having said all this knockoff or not this is a bad film with a lot of big names in it it 's like they were trying to make something campy and failed big time i expected more of danny devito	11
1	i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after 22 minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show	11
1	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11

1	interesting story line but shallow and goes nowhere kubrick style drawn out and paced shots are unimaginative poorly composed and add little or nothing to the experience looks like the ending is just a contrivance to exit a lost story line i 've lived in rural japan and it 's the most boring place on earth \( perhaps the intent here but hardly something you 'd pay money to suffer thru or for masochists only \) you dont think the younger generations flee to the cities for no reason at all	11

1	have n't read the book so ca n't compare but the relic on film is simply pathetic yes it 's a monster movie the problem is this movie is no better than most of its genre and worse than some the monster looks like a refugee from one of the star wars episodes the acting and dialogue are terrible what a yawner !	11
1	this movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books ethan hawke leans to heavily on kris kristofferson 's performances not to mention jeff tweedy 's music as a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music it is written interestingly enough but the visuals look like there was n't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on the best way to watch this movie is in the background you do n't need the visuals and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away	11

1	cyrano is one of the greatest verse plays ever written unfortunately gerard depardieu is no cyrano he 's a great clumsy side of beef not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of hercule sevanien cyrano de bergerac with the best will in the world his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance the english translation was especially commissioned for this film it is undistinguished prosy and dull it has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great american actor walter passmore get the jose ferrer version this one 's a dog	11
1	there is a reason there are 247 used ones of this book we used this book in for our men 's study group and every one of the men and every one of the wives agreed that this was a worthless book it was written for a 1950 's wife that no longer exists now 3 truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are discovering the mind of a woman by ken nairif only he knew by gary smalleytogether forever how to overcome problems and rekindle the love in your marriageby anne kristin carrollthey are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband	11

1	i brought this movie a couple of days ago and i was very very very disappointed do n't waste your money on this movie	11
1	this has already been expressed here in the reviews but just as a reminder one more time this dvd is not the original version the original version has more material and is much better hopefully someday they 'll release an unrated version the way it was on vhs at one time	11
1	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	11
1	one of the most pretentious and exaggerating movies ever seen the dialogue the acting whatever all suck big time everything in this movie looked unrealistic not funny but pathetically pretentious and exaggerating to the extreme that kinda performance would have won an oscar yeah right maybe just because there were only worse pictures nominated in that year what a hype	11
1	i did not like this movie i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity nonetheless i found it very disturbing his lack of concern for his wife and children how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have a bit on the side and what about her kids \? apart from the first scene we never see them again she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man i'm not a prude really but this film left a bad taste in my mouth	11
1	except for two cuties william zabka and dana ashbrook ! especially dana who constantly having a hard on	11
1	i'm a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa \?	11
1	anyone who thinks this is a good transfer must be daft in addition as was mentioned earlier 11 minutes have been cut and as i remember the film they were some of the best scenes if you get my drift if you want to see the original film this is not it avoid at all costs	11
1	this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb \? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd \? what sense does this make \? what a disappointment this service is	11

1	i have not seen this movie but thanks to the review of a viewer from july 2001 i do n't have to	11
1	well do n't know where to start bought this one because it has jeffrey combs in it stuart gorden is director and they did a good job on re animator but let me tell you horror freaks will be disapointed only one really bloody scene is worth watching not because of the blood not because of the gore just because it is the only bloody scene in the movie a nice looking woman is eaten by the castel freak if you have seen re animator the evil dead from beyond hellraiser and maybe the thing then skip this one you will be disapointed like me even a john woo action movie has more blood in it	11
1	this movie is not worth sam elliot i was very dissapointed i will most likely thow it away	11
1	i am a teacher who reads this book to my class every year i show the movie and this is a terrible version they leave out almost the whole story and change the rest it is such a great book and i think they could have done a better job on the video i am always hoping a newer and better version is made	11
1	this is a poor excuse of a movie the actors are less than right for these rolls i will be selling this movie used if anyone wants to waste the cash	11
1	i purchsed this video a few years ago and was also very disappointed i have nothing more to add to the other reviews posted here just to agree that the sound was poor and the viewing quite fuzzy i remember watching not only the first broadcast on nbc but several broadcasts years after that with different casts it was and still is my favorite christmas story i will certainly purchase the schippers cd and hope to see another video or dvd in the future	11

1	sorry but i totaly disagree with all these positive reviews i'm a fan of war classic films but this one is a mess nothing is moving action is zero and filming is poor we are very far away from dirty dozen battle of the bulge midway enemy below etc a total waste of time and money	11

1	expected more from this movie although deniro was good as usual	11
1	shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver the most interesting part is all the shark footage the best scene is after the bad guy hotel owner is eaten the shark clearly shown with a hook in it 's mouth being pulled towards a boat this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot so where did this hook come from \? it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie	11

1	i own both blu ray and hd dvd movies and have been consistently dissapointed with all the hd dvd 's they just do n't compare to blu ray the hulk was not a very good movie to begin with and the transer to hd dvd was not impressive picture quality was average at best and the sound quality was also mediocre i have yet to find any hd dvd that is even comparable to the best of blu ray	11

1	ca n't understand what all the fuss is over this movie it 's cute but so boring i could hardly stay awake	11

1	this is what happens when you buy movies that amazon recommends i consider my extreme boredom with this movie my punishment for letting them recommend a movie for me to buy do n't let the fantastic cast lure you this movie is boring ! true it is realistic in the sense that conversations among friends more often than not do n't necessarily go anywhere and oftentimes the texture of a movie is not in the conversations themselves but in the relationships that become evident within those conversations but nevertheless do not waste your money on this movie did i mention that it was boring	11

1	i was not thrilled with this work here 's why the movie jumps about in non logical fashion that distracts from the flow it is beautifully filmed with great costumes colors imagery but the acting is so bland almost weak ! christ i wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate ! the sex scenes were boring maybe i should make films ! this is frustrating ! ! it had it 's moments so 2 stars wish someone would make a movie about 'narcissus and goldmund' or 'cloister and the hearth' now that would be passionate ! \( unless amblin or touchstone did it \)	11
1	dont purchase episode 5 of season 2 it 's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf ! ! ! can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download ! ! !	11
1	man there 's no way to describe this movie slow boring unidimensional bad plot really bad acting really low budget \( in a bad way \) i'm not gonna get my time or my money back i bought it based on the reviews and they were really off even if you enjoy the gothic ambience believe me it 's really bad you 've been warned	11

1	this movie must be restored the quality of picture is unacceptable beginning with bloody mary 's singing bali hi i tried to purchase a completely restored digitally remastered dvd of this musical and could not find one in 2007 i returned this dvd to the seller	11
1	this movie starts off blazing hot and ends up ice cold martin does a great job with nick nolte as an artist in life lessons and i thought after this story that i was in for a real treat of a film but after watching ford coppolas somthing zoe i began to tire and by the end of woody allens snoozefest i was bored stiff my advice is to watch the first 30 minutes and then turn this one off the first 30 minutes is great film followed but very average film and ending with truley awful film	11

1	years ago a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends and decide to keep a secret years later when they 're all in high school the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them your typical 80s horror film not very notable other than leslie nielsen and jamie lee curtis this is one prom better left unattended	11
1	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500 000 on him and it all goes down hill from there there is no rhyme or reason to the story i gave it two stars because the landscape is great	11
1	it starts out as one of those movies where there are a lot of unrelated characters that you think will connect in the end and about 2 3 through the entire story line breaks down into mass confusion	11

1	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11

1	filmed in 1933 this movie is in black and white and might be considered dull and slow moving by today 's standards an accurate chronology of the six wives of henry viii the characters of the wives are rather undeveloped and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important religious and political questions around which the marriages centered a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story but the serious scholar will want to conduct further research	11

1	watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled boring and tacky even by horror standards the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids' future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet hence the title i 've seen far worse but those worse movies were more quot enjoyable quot than this the following morning you probably wo n't remember having seen it if only the monster had eaten this movie 's negative then we would all be spared	11

1	an average movie with average performances glosses over many of the details in the book and ignores the role of many important characters it wont appeal much to the general audience and neither will it satisfy the people who have already read the book	11

1	an accessible story with all the elements of a great american novel was somehow transformed into a perverse worst of the worst abc afterschool specials if you had not read the book you would be unable to follow what was happening some of the worst directing and editing i have seen in a long time the original evil dead with all its flaws is a better put together film than this one this movie is flat out painful to watch you get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do it all seems so random read the book if you see this movie in a rental store just move along please nothing to see here	11
1	the movie is widely considered a classic for hong kong action movies leslie cheung is a fantastic actor and i enjoyed bridgitte lin very much in chungking express so even though i do n't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies i still decided to watch this movie i was extremely disappointed the cinematography is boring and poorly done the plot is juvenile it is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys i hated the movie however i fully understand that many many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important hk movies ever made	11

1	with as many big names in this i thought it would be amazing well it is a corn ball adventure its set in ancient times yet one man beats someone up flies off whips out a pair of modern day sunglasses and puts them on and poses ! ! \( shakes head \) its things like this that really hurt the film for many kung fu hong kong film fans i really wanted to like this film but could n't get past the ridiculousness of it now corny can be ok at times but this is just rubbish	11

1	so this movie is made of 2 stories the first one is quick and involves takeshi kaneshiro and brigitte lin both have their stories and i actually found kaneshiro more interesting so this thing ends and the movie should have also it should have been a 30 minute movie so for the next hour or so we get to watch tony leung chiu wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs wow what a movie the only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day she was fun to watch but i still wish i would n't have seen this dumb movie	11
1	this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence	11
1	i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after 22 minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show	11

1	shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver the most interesting part is all the shark footage the best scene is after the bad guy hotel owner is eaten the shark clearly shown with a hook in it 's mouth being pulled towards a boat this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot so where did this hook come from \? it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie	11

1	this is one of our favorite movies but when we sat down to enjoy it the last 2 scene segments would not play very unsettling	11
1	do n't waste your time or money with this dvd the best part of the dvd is probably the trailers and most of those are garbage also my dvd came loose in the package and scratched too bad it did n't do any damage to ruin the movie i could n't wait until the movie was over i would have stopped it earlier but wanted to see if any damage was done you 'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier the last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off do n't waste your money spend it on the cheap 5 6 horror dvd 's because at least those can be somewhat entertaining	11
1	to put it succinctly brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis which is then swiped by joe pesci the homeless dude who predictably is really quite wise the problem is that his wise sayings are n't really too wise he 's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent but does n't really know that much joe pesci 's character is pretty annoying that 's probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser 's character	11

1	ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped	11
1	except for two cuties william zabka and dana ashbrook ! especially dana who constantly having a hard on	11
1	when i watched this movie i have to say i thought it was pretty pointless napolean dynamite is too but it 's funny this is n't quite up to dynamite standards i'm afraid it 's not as squeaky clean as good ol' napolean either do n't buy it if you must see it rent it	11
1	as ex infantry i found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable this low budget movie spoils the book a supposed highlight is the sas field craft but that 's a bad joke the sas troop crowds around for camera shots all the while talking loudly if not shouting bog normal infantry do n't do this never mind the best of the best the sas the fire fight sequences are passable the interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but ca n't make up for the rest of it the foul language even if it 's what they used in the field should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot making it unsuitable for many audiences	11
1	oh please whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 masterpiece theater tv series of 'cousin bette' do so and make it available on dvd this was one of the finest shows ever created for television truly it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now 40 years later i fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to dvd for the sake of one of the theater \( and humanity 's \) most glorious theatrical efforts please make the original tv version available ! \( btw i rate the original item at 5 stars !	11

1	i love nature and cowboy movies jeremiah johnson was on of the best movies i 've seen it is unforgetable it was my favorite robertredford movie he did very little talking talking in this movie he just acted his best performance ever the movie deals with the american indian also in a profound and touching way this movie is engrossing and based on a true story it 's simply the best do n't miss the opportunity to see this movie it is a classic it truly is in a league of it 's own	11
1	i'm rather upset with the technical quality of this dvd grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000 without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade this is certainly not worth the 20 dollar price tag amazon com has right now	11
1	if you are n't really into jokes about the difference between black white sex drugs and how bad gays are this is not for you i had seen other stuff by pryor i always liked but this time i never once really laughed out loud it was dissapointing good thing he has so many other good stuf	11
1	richard pryor is my all time favorite stand up comedian i consider him the best in the business but his performance in quot live and smokin quot shows he 's still just a rookie he 's nervous in front of the camera and says so several times his material is typically raunchy but not very funny you can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience buy this tape only if you 're a die hard pryor fan but do n't expect the side splitting laughter you 'll get from quot in concert quot quot live on the sunset strip quot and quot here and now quot	11

1	i 've taken kickboxng classes and have owned other kickboxing dvds but did not like this one its boring kathy seems to be doing a number of the moves in an awkward manner and the other people on set are distracting from their outfits to their sloppy moves skip this one	11
1	at first i did n't realize that you have to use amazon 's software to load onto the zen once i figured that out \( actually my husband figured that out \) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i was n't able to edit the stars if i could i would give this 5 stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon 's unbox is great for the zen	11

1	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one \( rare \) or better than this one as an example buffalo '66 is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die	11

1	colorado 's san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is myfavorite place to vacation in the usa so when i saw the preview ofdurango kids on another dvd i decided to rent it on netflix it isone of those movies where villains are cartoonish and the kids whilecute outsmart all the stupid adults the first 30 minutes showed somenice locations in and around durango including the steam train \( that 'swhy i purchased a used copy \) but then it goes into time travel to saveouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore intended for young and undemanding children do n't bother unless youlove durango as much as i do	11
1	the dynamic root duo deliver yet another yawner in this painful children 's comedy my advice to root is that he should be selling barbeques rather than this silly trash the only thing that redeems this movie is the acting of the child curtis big props to my man for his preformance hope to see you in more movies to come p s i think taylor root is still a virgin	11
1	just awful slasher picture with not one hint of real talent behind it the first movie i ever walked out of and i was home ! ! ! ! the pits ! ! ! ! ! ! !	11
1	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	11
1	this movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over acting i found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying	11
1	i thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular it kept me awake but just on the verge the few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie i thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best overall i was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star	11
1	the only seen that i like is where he had crap all over the walls of the bathroom and bob saget went crazy yelling	11
1	if i ever a \) subject myself to this movie ever againorb \) subject anyone else \( including animals \) to this movieform a mob and follow through with my wish in the title of this review just one question that still haunts me how does travolta 's career survive this debacle and pepper 's hits the tank \?	11
1	there are not many movies i have switched off after the first 30 minutes but this is one of them and i recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise	11

1	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	11

1	this is the worst holiday movie in america ! i mean if you buy this product you 'll face torture \( as in singing horribly \) making friends as the movie says is not the most important thing in the world in my belief they also said that if you want wish for fairy tales and it will come true right some fairy tales are gruesome \( for example this one fairy tale is so gruesome because it has fairies heads cut off \) eeww ! the voice talents are very annoying better save your money when you buy a christmas movie	11
1	i might have enjoyed this movie more if they had n't gutted the book which was a pretty good read the best character in the book fbi special agent pendergast is n't even in the movie and new york city police lt d'agosta is just a comic caricature of the book 's character another criticism of the movie is that almost every scene is so dark you can hardly see anything if the purpose was to create a moody scary atmosphere they went way too far see if you must but do n't expect too much	11
1	this is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic i had n't read the book before seeing the movie the film stunk a few years later i read the book and was enchanted i did not make the connection that this was the same story until i saw the film again on late night tv i was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen then i realized what movie it was i tried to sit through it i just could n't the monster should have eaten the film	11

1	i thought thet this movie was the worst movie ever based on the talent that was involved i do n't think that yuen wah could have been any worse jet li was pretty good but how the hell do you screw that up tsui hark seemingly did n't rush through this movie but it still turns out horribley i would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad but i 'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse	11
1	i like japanese films and really wanted to like this one however i must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot now i have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day if that is true i might give it a higher rating as of now however there are just a lot of things that do n't make sense	11
1	movie got 2 3 through and just quit no problem this is windows right \? just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i ca n't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it	11
1	most l amp h fans know that the boys made a long series of mgm fox pictures which reflected the big studio quot assembly line quot film making approach and the wartime atmosphere students of film comedy understand how the quot traditional quot stan amp ollie would be somewhat suppressed in that regard however it 's very sad to watch a decent premise with great performers go completely to waste as it does in aaw the presence of edgar kennedy should lift th proceedings instead it reinforces the melancholia i found the drunken scene most distasteful still l amp h followers might want to place it somewhere on their video carousel for an occasional peep into what could have been	11

1	i only liked it when pinnochio talked that was funny but the rest of the movie was discusting some of the scens were very sick \( not the blood but other things \) there was no blood hardly and i could have made it alot better i espected a good film but it was and i would never see it again	11
1	this movie was obviously made for young children and older people will noyt understand it	11
1	despite of having the hand of a true great director at the helm and a multi star cast \( including a top notch soundtrack by u2 \) the movie lacks the rhythm and charisma needed to live up to its expectations with great performances lost in a bad script it 's just a wanna be art movie and nothing else	11

1	it 's amazing that this much acting talent could be shoe horned into such a bad movie i do n't see how it could have yielded six 5 star reviews \( the godfather it ai n't \) using its better scenes you could put together a trailer for this movie that would make you want to see it and you may be entertained through much of the movie but when the story becomes quite nonsensical in the final minutes of the movie you will feal cheated and wish that you had watched something else at least that 's how everyone in my family felt when we watched it	11

1	i do n't understand what the people in charge of producing the wiz as a film could get by joining the former big names of diana ross michael jackson richard pryor and lena horne in this trashy picture the music soundtrack is by far much better than the movie itself i have lately become a great soul music fan so i recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative soul music work not keeping in mind that it 's a movie soundtrack in such manner you will enjoy it more !	11
1	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show	11

1	dont purchase episode 5 of season 2 it 's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf ! ! ! can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download ! ! !	11
1	do not waste your time or money see the original once in awhile a remake of a movie from another culture works for example seven samurai becomes magnificant seven most of the time the remake is trash the original la femme nikita is a great movie exciting with a strong political viewpoint this version is simply hollywood pablum	11
1	a comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of heaven \( fanny ardant victoria abril \) and hell \( gael garcia bernal penelope cruz \) battling over the soul of a mexican boxer is promising but this attempt at satire full of symbolism \( hell is represented by english speaking executives for example \) is clumsily executed only rarely amusing and the superb fanny ardant is not given anything to do what a waste ! you 'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors	11
1	i never received this product and will not order from you again when there is a problem you are not easy to reach	11

1	this is overall a real hoot ! anthony hopkins is superb ! fats the dummy steals lots of the scenes the question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the dummy or ann margarett trying to act ! burgess meredith is great as the manager one point of interest is the horrible score by jerry goldsmith he throws in a great harmonica riff when we see fats but during some of the more romantic scenes the music is so cloying it would make yanni blush don t miss the extras where they talk with the real vent that worked with them on the movie if you like movies that are a bit outside this is a must have for any collection pete cavan	11

1	jane fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful if opinonated \( remember hanoi jane \? \) woman i watched this as a teenager and despite the striptease this has to be one of her worst hormones be damned watching this was a waste of time if you like fonda try klute she was an excellent actress but no one could survive this mess	11
1	as ex infantry i found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable this low budget movie spoils the book a supposed highlight is the sas field craft but that 's a bad joke the sas troop crowds around for camera shots all the while talking loudly if not shouting bog normal infantry do n't do this never mind the best of the best the sas the fire fight sequences are passable the interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but ca n't make up for the rest of it the foul language even if it 's what they used in the field should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot making it unsuitable for many audiences	11

1	oh man this is really one of the worst of the 80 's slasher movies tom hanks shows up for a minute but the last almost 90 skip i	11
1	this movie is the worst piece of clap trap that i have ever seen built in the mold of the rambo series the film tries to play off of the west 's fear of the soviet union you 'd be better of watching a quot how to pour milk quot instructional video than watch this film that will make you less smart	11
1	i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company 's software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon 's player to view it blah you 're better off buying the dvd for 20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer	11
1	as along time fan of paddy chayefsky i found altered states his first novel terribly disappointing the film was in my view utterly dismal the only reason i would recommend it would be as an example of hack movie making if it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either chayefsky or russell both would be relegated to obscurity	11
1	amanda pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity but otherwise this film did nothing for me a bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests \? i ca n't even relate and they 're trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness \? yeah right ! see it if you 're a big fan of fart jokes or whatever	11

1	this is my favorite production of the alice books i love the sets songs and casting it 's also very british which i think adds another great element to the mix however skip this dvd edition i got it excited to see alice's adventures in wonderland in widescreen and perhaps a better print than what 's previously been available no such luck the dvd appears to be struck from the same crappy vhs version that 's been out there for ages faded colors pan and scan in this age of dvd quality like this is such a shame	11

1	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one \( rare \) or better than this one as an example buffalo '66 is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die	11

1	i thought this video was disjointed and not oriented to any plot also the lighting was very dark and much of what was going on was unseeable	11
1	ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped	11

1	this movie is not very well written in my opinion and is probably a good thing that it is priced so high most of it is uninportant dailog that seems to have little or no piont with no story or structure there is alittle action at the end but of poor qualaty to make a long review short it is basically like a bad episode of g i jeo	11

1	that 's basically my two cents shallow characters bizarre story i am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films but i do like a good story and heard this was one it was not all of the characters were inverted ada and her daughter were utterly irritating george was disgusting from start to finish and sam neill 's character \( supposedly the heartless jerk \) was actually the easiest to sympathize with how frustrating ! on a positive note michael nyman 's score is unbelievable i love it	11
1	and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i'm 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i did n't for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved	11

1	i'm not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot it 's redundant and unnecessary and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that 's based on and well my gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it 's original format onto dvd was bad the soundtrack is about 1 2 to 1 second off from the video part of film therefore the voices do n't sync up with the lip movement	11

1	an incredibly bad film whose only redeeming feature is lana clarkson in \( and out of \) some skimpy outfits she 's completely gorgeous but even she ca n't save a disaster of a film buy deathstalker instead	11
1	i wanted to see a romantic and touching movie this movie is contrived the character that reeve plays acts like a star struck groupie personally i do n't find his behavior to be romantic he seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him this is not romantic to most women nowadays he is not suave in the role he is playing it seems like a cheesy 70 's contrived romance that does a bad job of it	11
1	as segal continutes to move toward orson welles dimensions his movies get progresivly worse let 's hope this is his last	11
1	albert pyun is my absolute least favorite director i hate his guts his direction ruined quot cyborg quot and was murky in quot omega doom quot this is his best flick and it 's not that good in fact it pales in comparison to the so so original sasha mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable but highly forgettable the villain from the first tong po has returned after killing the sloan brothers from the first movie now he 's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother david sloan standard martial arts fare some choppy fight scenes but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck	11
1	okay i was excited to see this movie i read a few non fiction books on the dot com bust and thought i knew a thing or two but when i watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more i found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from i mean who cares about these people 's relationships \? \? not anyone who is watching this movie ! we care about why and how businesses succeed and fail this movie sucked	11
1	i bought this as a gift for my nephew because i loved the book as a chid and vaguely remembered a wonderful treehouse in the movie i'm very glad i screened it first the female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow boring and illogical i'm not very pc with old movies but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits choose one of the other disney re releases instead there are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog	11
1	blech ! i really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute wrong ! it was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were the only redeeming actor was justin long the rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells	11

1	this version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the dvd and listed in the imdb i saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie the dvd packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by amazon they made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done i do not recommend this version to anyone the orginal movie deserves better than this chop job	11

1	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	11
1	not sure what to make of the movie but it is definitely not one of the best movies and not sure if it is even a movie	11
1	this has to be dolph 's suckiest movie i'm a huge fan and i own a ton of his movies and watch a bunch more on a regular basis but do not buy this movie save your money and buy one of dolph 's better movies like army of one or men of war personally though i'm pumped for the release of masters of the univers	11
1	i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it did n't play anyway i gave up	11
1	why should one buy this series \? what about the missing episodes \? are they going to be added later or this is it \? i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel \? or a keyboard without the c and r keys \? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do	11
1	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11
1	im not sure why i gave this a second star maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with \? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman \( the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious adaptation \) this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer \( john cusack \) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz	11
1	this movie is so bad it barely deserves mention however i am a big dl fan and i am writing this in the hope that dolph will not abandon his fans he may be making movies like this just for the but i believe he is also doing irreparable damage to his career	11
1	i love norm macdonald and this is the dumbest movie of all tim	11
1	everything is this movie seems out of place the old cliche quot good cop bad cop quot lived by sutherland and his pal does n't work at all ! dridget is in an awkward performance totally unconvincing unreal flat anyway it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a tremendous waste of time	11
1	after a promising start stan laurel and oliver hardy 's 1944 effort plunges into a sea of mgm mediocrity with a ludicrous plot involving the attempted murder of a boy king however chef ollie 's steak a la oliver is worth a few laughs	11
1	so i saw this one live action alice in wonderland movie and it sucked ! ! ! ! but i'm confused this is n't the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie i think it is i'm not sure if i want to risk boring myself with other crap so will i watch this verison ever who knows	11

1	i bought this movie because i thought it would be like the movie version of louis l'amour 's conagher unfortunately it is a far cry from that movie the quick and the dead was too predictable the dialog was stilted and unrealistic and the characters well they were too much in character and not believable i am curious how faithful the script was to the book if the movie is as faithful to the book as conagher was then i apologize to the movie makers and will hold a grudge with mr l'amour instead	11
1	i did n't even see this movie and i know it sucks all that i had to see was bon jovi and i threw the video to the ground as hard as i could muster at the video store where i was promptly kicked out it was worth it though it actually was offensive that such a thing could exist the vampire genre could be so awesome and yet very few films live up to its potential i guess it also lends itself to complete drivle such as vampires los muertos	11
1	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
1	dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4 i didnt even get a full 45 minute episode no finale i got rippped off 1 99 dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show	11
1	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs	11
1	this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence	11
1	oh did this one stink convoluted and confusing the buildup to the conclusion was positively endless i did n't laugh once	11
1	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show	11
1	this is still to this day one of the most aweful films i ever saw i took a girl ona date for this movie and wow what a mistake the movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more	11
1	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11

1	someone just today told me i should see this film what a disappointment to see these warnings of poor quality dvds being produced by fox lorber oh well	11
1	i recall this movie fondly unfortunately the dvd quality is so poor this cannot be watched pity amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings do n't waste your time until someone cleans this up but it makes a nice coaster though	11
1	will someone please produce a dvd vhs re make of diva with the excellent sound quality deserving of this film ! \? i was so excited to finally find this movie but quickly realized after reading reviews from fellow fans that it would be a disappointment and waste of my money to purchase it i hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they 'll re issue a quality dvd and or video soon	11
1	movie got 2 3 through and just quit no problem this is windows right \? just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i ca n't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it	11
1	do yourself a favor and read the book and dont even look at this movie	11
1	this has to be stephen king 's worst work adapted this adaptation is even worse than needful things children of the corn \( i am talking about the original and not the crappy sequels \) was miles abouve better than this garbage just a stupid movie adapted from a lame book just plain trash	11

1	i watched this movie seeing that it was a shark movie but where 's the shark \? \? the plot is these people are hostages the shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie but i was watching going okay they 're in the water where is the shark \? \? \? even jaws 3 \( which sucked \) has more sharks if you like hoatage movies see this \( on second thought do n't \) but if you like sharks see something else	11
1	this movie was ok i do prefer the messenger starring milla jovovich milla is exceptional in that version	11
1	this review may sound pretentious and ignorant but in truth i'm a big fan of british history so bear with me ! even as a film itself it 's surreal and i do n't like the acting but as with any historical film that includes the british they 're made out to be the absolute bad guys ! sure we were forging an empire within france \( i e the hundred years war \) but rapists and murdering pillagers ! \? never ! historically accurate full of british sentiment and down right weird avoid this film today folks !	11

1	i 've seen all of elvis' movies most several times this is one of the worst only stay away joe and harem scarem are worse i usually watch every elvis movie every time it comes on tv but not these three	11
1	the first film was much better than r e apocalypse more gore better acting better presentation overall and it was done with a lot less money	11
1	i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after 22 minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show	11

1	cyrano is one of the greatest verse plays ever written unfortunately gerard depardieu is no cyrano he 's a great clumsy side of beef not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of hercule sevanien cyrano de bergerac with the best will in the world his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance the english translation was especially commissioned for this film it is undistinguished prosy and dull it has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great american actor walter passmore get the jose ferrer version this one 's a dog	11
1	recently i read about the revival of a chorus line on broadway i 've never seen the broadway show or any other staging of it so i thought the movie might give me a sneak peek well somewhat disappointed here i can only assume that the stage version with its long running reputation must be better than this film it 's not that the film is a total debacle but it 's only mildly pleasant and quickly forgettable even songs which i had heard before like what i did for love were reduced to barely a mention in the film the film seemed to lack any real point a bit of a yawner	11
1	this movie was even more ignorant \( in a bad way \) compared to that other movie the stupids and i thought that movie was ignorantly bad as well the name of the movie \( dumberer \) explains how retarded and unfunny this movie really is the old dumb and dumber movie with jim carrey and jeff daniels is way better than this sorry excuse for comedy it was part of a classic comedy which made lots of people laugh do n't waste your money on this sorry excuse for comedy if you like dumb and dumber go for the unrated never before seen film of the old dumb and dumber instead it 's worth every penny for comedy fans	11

1	i thought thet this movie was the worst movie ever based on the talent that was involved i do n't think that yuen wah could have been any worse jet li was pretty good but how the hell do you screw that up tsui hark seemingly did n't rush through this movie but it still turns out horribley i would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad but i 'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse	11
1	i have to wonder what world what physical plane what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on \? or maybe they are full moon employees lol first of all the movie especially one of the earlier scenes was identical to the 80 's flick the unnamable which is also and hp lovecraft based flick the castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit when he breaks out his cell well this was just hilarious it reminded me of the incredible hulk yes jeffrey combs is in it but his acting is cheesy as it can be hunt down the unnamable instead a much better movie	11
1	what a shame this dvd transfer is so aweful because the movie is great i have seen this movie before on sbs tv \( australia \) and have been wanting a copy since but this dvd looks like a transfer from an already poor quality vhs copy very disappointed	11

1	to put it succinctly brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis which is then swiped by joe pesci the homeless dude who predictably is really quite wise the problem is that his wise sayings are n't really too wise he 's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent but does n't really know that much joe pesci 's character is pretty annoying that 's probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser 's character	11
1	this is one of the most offensive and anti gay movies i have ever seen do n't let the title or the box fool you every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment i was shocked that such a film could come out of france if you 're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass \( verbally and physically \) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job then rent this and snack on a can of worms hideous	11

0	this was the first scary movie i ever saw in the cinema and it made a strong impression on me the bathtub scenes were so eerie that i only took showers for a few years after i saw this movie at 15 that is how much it scared me i have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective although i do have to say it is pretty scary and well done watching it many years later i was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70 's cheese that you see in many films from that era the carpet and some of the clothes were funny but it did n't detract from the film glad i bought it	11

0	this great film will finally be available on dvd on january 31st 2006	11
0	for me quot get a life quot provided plenty of laughs in its spoofs of what often manages to pass as television comedy from chris' unique effort to rehabilitate a collection of street punks to his discovery of a space alien \( in home video volume 2 \) which is anything but cuddly i only wish rhino would expand its offerings of quot get a life quot episodes	11
0	my wife and i just watched this disney movie with our 8 year old son the colors are exquisite deeply saturated clear crisp detail and picture quality is incredible sound quality was substantially better than the original all 6 channels of sound were strong without being harsh and convey a sense of beauty the film is all about the triumph of human spririt i'm sure that the girls will relate to the princess but my son was impressed as well thanks disney for doing such a great job in remastering this classic i will keep it in my library for the princesses in my family	11

0	this is a nice love story a little dumbed down but with a great message the money may be the root of all evil and what is important is the human heart this is a message that is badly needed in a very materialistic world nicholas cage is one of our finest commercial actors he proves is versatility in this picture what ever happened to bridget fonda \? \? j	11
0	this movie combines two things i love in a film the actors are able to enjoy and showcase their talents this is animprov lover 's dream andit makes fun of a topic which takes itself too seriously in thiscase dog shows only one character in the film keeps the importance of the dog 's rating in context mainly though it is just hilarious some \( okay a lot \) of the humor is too crude for my kids to see unfortunately and nearly too crude for me still it fits the genre	11
0	fantastic film memticulous and carefully built loaded of the highest suspense you may expect in this clever film noir eastwood is an outsider he is not a detective but a jewel thief who watchs something he never had to see this brutal murderer will reach the highest governement levels in which a very well planned chase will be made behind the traces of eastwood a great script hackman is absolute convincing in the best role which he has represented more than any one else the immoral corrupt decadent and perverse villain intelligent puzzle and artistic film prove once more than industry and craft may join one of the best films in his career	11

0	i expected to learn how to build a gypsy wagon so i could join a caravan this movie did not help at all worthless ! i thought i would find a complex and riveting tapestry of deep and well developed characters and storylines what a disappointment ! i just knew i would come away with a better understanding of cutting edge business management techniques ! total waste of time ! instead i had to sit through a long film of incredible landscapes beautiful people and amazing music that altogether gave me a new and wonderful understanding of gypsies eurasia and history and i watched it about thirty times it 's excellent i mean terrible ! whatever get it and watch it	11
0	far more complex and feministic than the girls and flapper fashions would have you believe needs to be seen in it 's entirity and revived for a modern audience as the series is now an overlooked gem the leads are excellent and follow in the best traditions of such british historical series such as upstairs downstairs if you have never seen it you will not be dissapointed and the lead actresses are extremely good both rada trained and both have worked extensively with the royal shakespeare company	11
0	i caught a glimpse of this movie years ago and i could not remember the name but i did know who stared in it so when i went online to get the name of this i was pleased to see that the sender had it at a very good price thanks so much for having the movie and second getting it to me so quickly ! ! ! thanks again ! !	11

0	this is a truly funny movie the main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is this is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night it 's a good buy for your dvd collectio	11
0	this outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis please notice how lumet works with grayish tunes in the lawyer ' s office to accent his personal drama go for this emblematic film where paul newman makes a delirious performance	11
0	we have all wondered what would happen if the alien and predator met head to head this movie answers that question very well no cheesiness we have watched this movie so many times we have lost count and we still watch it sitting on the edge of our seats or our knees to our chest great saturday evening movie	11
0	this dvd brings me back to when i was growing up in the 70 's i am happy to share this with my kids who can forget the baby puppets in the hospital window trying to figure out if they are boys or girls or rosie greer singing it 's alright to cry one of the highlights is the duet by roberta flack and a young michael jackson singing you do n't have to change at all i am so happy i am able to have this piece of my childhood to share	11
0	big fan of 80 's music and culture and most of all the movies she 's having a baby is not just a teen movie like sweet sixteen or breakfast club its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day soundtrac is great with kate bush the woman 's work my girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played i told her i 'll feel the same if she were the wife boy i got lovin that nite i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80 's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby i thought it was clever	11

0	there are a great many gay themed films available today but when longtime companion was released it was but one of a small handful of films brave enough to paint gay characters with empathetic and intelligent brushstrokes something that continues to beset filmmakers even today set during the late 70 's and on into the 80 's the film is a bare bones and ruthlessly truthful before and after portrait of the devastating effects of the aids virus on a small group of close friends lovers and on the wider gay community very funny extremely moving occasionally upsetting whether you are a gay viewer or not this film is a courageous celebration of the strength and frailty of the human spirit	11
0	i begged to see this movie in 1985 ! i was only 14 but i knew i had to see it and buy the soundtrack \( remember cassettes \? \) never has rob lowe or emilio estevez looked better ! hot hot hot ! ! no this is n't oscar worthy or anything but if you are a die hard 80 's brat packer this is the one !	11
0	this movie will make you laugh and cry with a who 's who of hollywood the music alone will move you to the kleenex box if you have lost someone to aids this movie will touch you deeply i was told not to watch this movie alone watch it with someone to hug how right they were bronson pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have eric roberts and gregory harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples i know bravo ! get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect	11

0	i was contemplating on getting the director 's cut of gone in 60 seconds until i looked at the time length usualy a director 's ct has more added to it not taken away believe it or not but the original released version of gone in 60 is 118 minutes long where the director 's cut release has a minute less footage for those that do n't care it 's not a big thing but for movie goers a minute off takes alot away unless you 're in it for the new extra features	11

0	wow let me start off by telling you that i had this video personally when i was younger i would ask for it constantly and can still remember having it and watching it everyday it really helped me learn and the drawings are great ! somewhere in the process of 'growing up ' the video was lost and i'm still upset about it i'm not ready to have kids myself but i know that when i do i definitely want to re purchase this video ! it 's so great to have things like this to help your children start learning at a young age and i recommend it to everyone	11
0	this is a rather scary look at what could be a possible future if things continue the way they are heading our food supplies becoming more depleted due to unfavorable growing conditions climatic extremes lack of water and nutrient poor land as well as overpopulation continuing at an uncontrollable and alarming rate this type of recycling may become a necessity hopefully it would at least be voluntary as the movie depicts an eye opener for sure	11

0	i cannot believe how mean and down dirty elections can get when they get too close does it tell us something about the election process it needs to become kinder democracy can be great if we work a little harder at it it can be done ! it would have been nice to see more opinions of those on the right the film did seem to have a bit of a biased edge to it like it was pushing an agenda good awareness piece though	11
0	a light hearted but still kind of sas movie poweful	11
0	this is by far my favorite version of this classic story and the most authentic and true to the spirit of the book the cast and direction are excellent and the setting is gorgeous this film will delight both children and adults with it 's adventure suspense and innocent romance it 's a little spooky in some scenes but of the fun rather than truly scary kind this story has a very positive underlying message but does n't preach rather it expresses it in subtly beautiful ways as the characters unlock the mysteries of the secret garden and of themselves no matter what age you are this is a thoroughly enjoyable uplifting perhaps even transformative film do n't miss it	11
0	i really like these tapes the first one is pretty easy but it is very relaxing and i use it on days when i want to take it easy the second one is somewhat challenging and the third one is even more so these tapes are a great guide from a beginning level to a more advanced one tracy rich is a very good instructor and makes you feel comfortable i also like how they \( ganga white and tracy \) show different versions of the poses with one being more advanced	11
0	this is a masterpiece of cinema after watching robert mulligan 's more famous \( to me \) movies to kill a mockingbird and summer of '42 i found this jewel i did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is directors like ford hawks lubitsch or vidor and capra are long gone and so is cinema as art but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it although it may only last a blink of an eye i am off to check out come september now who is this robert mulligan anyway \? lovable little gem	11
0	i own the first two volumes of the lost treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat they are brilliant and i hope more volumes appear on a regular basis why though must i suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get the plays volume without buying them all over again \? i suspect \( and hope \) that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime i can only say that if you do n't already own any of these and are a fan of broadway theatre or the performing arts in general buy this today ! a fantastic showcase of theatrical talent	11
0	i'm delighted to see there are n't a string of 1 star reviews from people who do n't get a mighty wind if it has a weakness its that its played so dryly its almost like non fiction that just happens to be funny thank god for fred willard who adds some vitally important crassness to these serious proceedings i share a sentiment expressed by some of the characters i 've never liked folk music but somehow this movie manages to poke fun at those less cynical times without being too cynical itself my one dissapointment is that we do n't get to see ed begley jr sing how 's it hangin' grandma \? in swedish talk about a missed opportunity	11
0	this movie has great casting the actors play characters that they usually do n't play this may be the best acting i have ever seen keeanu reeves do	11
0	i must say that i am generally not interested in watching a romance movie but this movie is a definite exception it possessed a great soundtrack that fit the scenes perfectly captivating scenery that is incredible and a cast that perfectly fits the mold of the story from beginning to end it was an absolute success of a complete movie it piques the curiosity it warms the heart and it even manages to make you feel slightly better about life after watching it buy it you wo n't regret it	11

0	this story is so fascinating that i could n't stop feeling that the drive to create and to be true to one 's identity and sexual preference had to be overwhelming to cause the writer arenas to survive and escape the homophobic surroundings in cuba under castro johnny depp is unbelievably wonderful as both the sadistic lieutenant and the transporting drag queen	11
0	this movie would probably not be on anyone 's top ten list but it is a must see for the 1980 's b flick movie loving enthusiast ! the stuff is an interesting look at consumerism in the 80 's and the hairstyles and outfits are just plain hilarious ! i remember renting this movie \( on beta \) in my childhood over and over again much to my parents chagrin the stuff will bring you back and make you glad the past is where it is	11

0	as a fan of new order and joy division this was on the top of my list fast paced witty and shot in documentary like style 24 hour party people is a great movie along side the more traditional narratives like go all gone pete tong groove etc winderbottom does a terrific job in satisfying a range of audience and steve coogan is terrific the soundtrack is solid and the produciton value is high not to be missed by fans \( not ultimate fans \) and general movie goers alike	11
0	this was not the scariest film i 've ever seen and i really ca n't take horror very well but it was good because there was beauty in it and that is quite rare in horror films i think the idea of the film was very good and surprise in the end too even though the plot was not so brilliant i actually liked it i 'll probablu rent it again and watch it this time with sound	11

0	thank god that there is a full recording of this evening available on cd because this video only shows about 45 minutes of the actual concert granted they are 45 minutes that are not to be missed with this brilliant cast and this amazing show from stephen sondheim this is truly a broadway event the documentary which makes up most of the running time of the video is a lot of fun but cutting the actual concert down to bare bones is a sin we who adored sondheim should appeal to the producers and beg that this magical night be released on video in its entirety	11
0	this is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject the clips of ginsberg amp burroughs are especially effective the celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself amp not just empty theatrics the beats are still a source to return to for inspiration amp insight the world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now of course there 's more but this video gives you enough to get you started amp gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to late	11
0	cannes man was funny i do n't know why this movie was in the drama section of blockbuster but it made me laugh out loud just goes to show that nobody knows anything in lalaland and movies are made by a bunch of nincompoops who do n't know their s from a hole in the ground	11

0	this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since don't look now back in '73 this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out alongside white noise as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense	11
0	contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has no subtitles or closed captions or whatever the r2 neither so again do n't feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff non anamorphic or simply 4 3 format no subs not available at all \( yes i mean you disney \) in short no quality or consistency go and take a hike stop lobbying for legislation and start making real dvd 's	11
0	robin williams is an afrs disc jockey in saigon during the vietnam war he is fast talking zany unconventional and a problem for his superiors williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten the movie is an exhausting experience to watch as it must have been for williams to perform it 's an amazing one man show but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty	11
0	let me start out this review by saying that this anime should be a martar for other anime to follow because it is an amazing anime the plot is basically a cybernetic government agent major motoko kusanagi who goes and tries to catch a computer virus called the puppet master from start to finish this movie is amazing with great animation and storyline i think almost everybody should be able to see it as long as they are mature enough there is a lot of violence and some language also some slight nudity but very non sexual overall i think this is one of the best anime ever	11
0	i can remeber being a little over eight years old the first time i saw this movie while i did n't understand it then i found that the music and the scenery was breath taking seeing this movie years later along with other great 's such as young bess and mary queen of scots helena carter 's and cary elwes performance 's are right up there with such great names as stuart granger and jean simmons i would recommend this movie if you like period piece movies but like i said do n't take into account that the history is a little jumbled just enjoy it for the tragic history that is burried underneath the plot	11

0	overwhelming in sincerity and pain to watch and observe stephan 's life go from a pain of loneliness and secrecy to love and shame rips at your inside and leaves you feeling both uplifted and vulnerable at the same time this cinematic masterpiece moves beyond the typical coming out story and focuses on true love and the boundaries it faces and must conquer inflicted not from the outside world but from the lovers themselves combining a mix of heart wrenching drama and laugh out loud dark humour i was left enthralled and fixated not wanting for it to finish a great cast and a great script push this movie forward to the top of my list	11

0	there are few great movies that will make shed a tear but this one is really great daughters do n't know how much their mothers will go for them they just understand their mothers when they get to be one this movie the place the weather the circumstances is so depressive but beautiful dolores started to work hard out of love for her child after that she worked because of gratitude what a great woman and her daughter never understood her until the very end at the beginning i was weary about this movie because is based on stephen king 's work but this movie really proved me wrong	11
0	this is another american remake of the original danish movie starring stellan skarsgard which is more interesting than this remake i always wonder why when hollywood does a remake they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place even though i give this remake 4 stars mainly because al pacino and robin williams restrained themselves and that hollywood changed the ending check out the original i give the danish original 5 stars	11

0	putting it simply this film is the work of a genius as a tom stoppard fanatic i adored it from the moment i read the play which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with he was significantly more satisfied with the movie and there is very little doubt as to why he clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film they may or may not like it but that 's not what matters this film is amazing	11

0	anthony hopkins is absolutely riveting as adolf hitler he captures all of hitler 's mannerisms quirks and facial expressions my only complaint is that he does n't use a german accent the production is poor and there are some flaws in the story for example albert speer is made out to be almost a hero in the film it has been proven that there was actually no assassination attempt made by speer the guy who plays joseph goebbels is horrible one of the worst acting jobs i 've seen but overall the acting is great and the performance by hopkins makes this movie worth owning	11
0	this is the original version of this film with david niven peter sellers woody allen and other very familiar faces the film is nothing at all like the 2006 version which was very good but ian fleming intended his 007 to be a non serious serious agent excellent film and i heartily recommend it my 20 something grandson is a 007 fan and he really liked this movie had to have the dvd after seeing it on tv	11

0	this two parter commemorates the 10th anniversary of the arthur show on pbs it 's nice they could have gone cheesy and just recycled old footage but they decied to be subtle about it really the only thing that specifically makes this a 10th anniversary show is the fact that there are '10 's hidden throughout each episodes kind of like how marc brown hides the names of friends and family in his picture books it 's nice to see them both together too \( episodes 1 2 \) i think they aired them seperately on tv	11
0	i viewed this film a few years ago when i had nothing to do and found this to be a masterpiece luis bu uel 's direction is unique i found that the main character 's desposition changes his love for the woman when she gets him angry we see one woman when she makes him happy we see a different woman in the same character i do n't think i 've seen a movie quite like this this movie will stay with you for some time especially if you have a broken heart	11

0	i very much enjoyed this story of a man battling drug addiction alcoholism michael keaton has never been better and his portrayal is dead on even when the film is occasionally hard going at times in fact the whole cast is first rate the direction good and the script unflinching and realistic of all the films about drug addiction this one is highly recommended and the ending is even happy	11
0	scary movie is an instant movie classic director keenan ivory wayans outdies himself in a spoof of horror films involving an innocent teenager named cindy campbell who 's being stalked by a goofy killer in a cheap rendition of scream though funny to watch scary movie also has it 's share of gross out gags and laughs the way wayans slanders horror films is so funny that you ca n't help but laugh out loud	11
0	bo derek plays the title role to perfection in this blake edwards comedy despite what the amazon capsule says julie andrews plays dudley moore 's girlfriend and not his wife watch the film before you write a summary of it ! along with the pink panther films this stands as one of edwards best films it is a high point in the career of dudley moore and he is just perfect as george robert webber also is good as george 's gay cowriter and friend andrews is fine also but what you leave the theatre with is the images of bo derek someone knew how to cast the title character perfectly	11
0	what more can be said about this film \? filmed on location in rome italy in the fifties greg peck and audrey hep nuff said	11

0	this film must be scrutinized in the light of being tony scott a famed and renowned director of spot lights and subtle commercials at that moment additionally the figure of the vampire is refreshed and renovated with the presence of the feminine vision sarandon and deneuve are in very good shape and bowie gives another of his outrageous and perverse performances after his standout performance in the man who fell to earth and furyo so think about all those factors at the moment you bet for watch it it 's extremely important to my mind this is one of the hottest cult movies of the eighties	11

0	my brother henry always said this was his favorite movie he loved film noir \( although i did n't know what that was at the time \) and of course he loved richard widmark in his role looking back widmark should have gotten the academy award for best suppporting actor for this \( he was nominated \) but there are many oscar should 'ves if you like prison gangster movies classic film noir richard widmark victor mature and of course brian dunleavy you 've gotta see own this if you hav n't do n't already	11

0	jacques tati takes on the modern world in his second sally as the perpetually bewildered mr hulot while the movie is very funny in its pokes at modernism \( highlighted by the house of hulots sister with its newfangled conveniences and its hilarious spouting dolphin fountain \) it drags some of its jokes out a tad too long and several scenes \( notably the garden party \) would have benefited by judicious paring still the movie demands to be seen by anyone who is a fan of classic comedy	11

0	when you consider the physical condition olivier was in his performance is pretty damn good the supporting cast are mostly excellent with diana rigg a standout as a venal vicious voracious yet strangely feline and alluring regan and dorothy tutin not far behind as a grabby and lustful goneril leo mckern is the definitive gloucester	11

0	colin firth is the quinessential mr darcy ! this film captures the depth and essence of jane austen 's novel in such a beautiful classic way it is worlds better than the recent keira knightley version whose weak interpretation of the role of lizzie made me appreciate jennifer ehle even more	11

0	this is a pretty original 70s horror movie starring two very likeable and attractive stars of the era katharine ross and sam elliot it 's just fun not really all that scary or even too tense basically sam and katharine end up unwilling guests in a spooky mansion where the guests are dropping off like flies while waiting for an old spooky man to pass away and leave them an inheritance roger daltry makes an appearance the deaths are all way over the top and it 's just fun dvd is the movie plus a trailer that 's about it but the transfer is great considering the age of the movie great spooky flick for a cold night by the fire	11

0	this video gives insight into the life and persona of picasso while it touches on his climb to fame recognition and success in the art world it focuses primarily on his personal relationships i love his work but i sure would n't have wanted to live with him ! the video had therapuetic effects for me i would assume it would for any viewer as it certainly calls into question your own view of relationships how they are and how they should and should n't be a winner all the way around	11
0	if you played any of the pc video games than you know how much they left out of this movie still its one of the best b movies i 've ever bought i enjoy it every time i watch it	11

0	a fantasy dealing with the curse of star crossed lovers ladyhawke never fail to be top notch entertainment the cast is exceptional and get their characters right it 's all too easy to fall into the story and believe what 's going on along with dragonslayer this is one of the top fantasy movies the story is compelling the setting has a very gritty dirty feel to it and the location just adds to the overall feeling of living in the middle ages this is not a movie i can just put on 'in the background' and let play while doing other things because it suck me in every time	11
0	this is an excellent movie for the romantic type a real classic ! got it for my wife for her birthday enjoyed it very much	11
0	aside from the rather chintzy quality of the disc itself \( why oh why do n't they re release the special edition again \? \? \? \) the film is fantastic kris lemche is as always sarcastically funny and somehow very real and relate able katherine isabelle is quite convincing in her portrayals of madness and mayhem and emily perkins is uniquely lovable as the younger sister trying to save her sibling from the woes of lycanthropy tightly edited and beautiful in it 's cinematography this is one indie horror flick you do n't want to miss ! ! !	11
0	a schizophrenic journey through the dark urban world michael a young writer comes from a dysfunctional household and uses his cartoons as an outlet eventually he begins to delve himself into his dark toon world and the movie is beautifully animated and stuffed full of creativity sex bigotry and ultimately a true grim view of society as dark as it sounds i found parts of this movie very amusing housewives pass on this one it 's not 'finding nemo' if you enjoy a truly stunning visual experience and dark humor satire i 'd reccomend you watch this a true must see for the inebriated	11
0	i really did like this movie and the different kind of story it was very imaginative and well acted the story was very scarey at times and gorey as well the only problem with the movie is that the director covered up ezra godden 's nude scene with a half shot of his butt in the begining of the movie other than that if you would like to see a town that prays to a fish god dagon that wants human sacrafices and the town 's people peeling off the faces of it 's visitors then this movie is for you	11
0	if you have read and enjoyed the book then you will love the movie micky rourke is excellent \( this is still in the days when he could act \) and so is the rest of this stellar cast well worth it	11
0	grand old movie well acted will watch many times agai	11
0	being a fan of russ meyer movies since classics like mudhoney vixen and lorna it is amazing what happens when russ gets some money to make a movie for a major company likewise italian competitor tinto brass russ gets in feel with picturing erotic in a slight different way i liked this movie very much for it 's blooming 60 's pop feeling and great decent inszenation of the participated women i'm in general a fan of exploitation movies and this one is an especially great one presentated on dvd with a great transfer and lots of extras well done \( hope my english is half the way understandable sorry i'm german \)	11

0	i have always loved this movie but especially love the music used in the soundtrack it lifts the soul	11
0	i got what i ordered in a timely fashion with no complaints thank you	11
0	i have to say that i picked this one episode out of the many as an example of the talent of these two gentleman if you see comedy and want comedy that is more direct and honest in how it portrays different groups this is the series i enjoy their skits and think that it simply pokes fun without being mean that is hard to do the different characters they take on makes me think there is more than two guys they are that good in my humble opinion you do not need to be an anglophile for the series but it would really help to be an anglophile valley girl for the vicky skit	11
0	i highly recommend this dvd for its superior acting all hands as well as for the spectacular photography scenery and overall quality of presentation a real keeper	11
0	probably the best portrayal of louis l'amour 's sackett series although more than one book was used it all ties together casting was excellent i would highly recommend this dvd for all l'amour and or sackett fans	11

0	the dylan \( \? \) lyric to laugh and cry in a single sound came to mind the first time i saw this movie as part of a saturday night film series at the local university 25 years ago it 's just brilliant a wild and manic ride that ends up being completely life affirming you just want to cry out at the end of the movie it 's too good to be true this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen	11
0	if you like denzel washington i think this is one of his best movies yet he is sexy and so is his co stars the movie delivers great action suspense and surprises at the end	11

0	most of us have seen the movie a great drama with great acting the dvd is a super clean transfer not any features to speak of but well worth the money invested very clean for a movie made so many years ago mann	11
0	eisenstein 's verve has never been questioned even if it was absorbed by living in 'dark times ' to reference hannah arendt this feature is worth anyone 's time as the angles of observation and superb editing defy adequate description	11
0	when i was little i remembered this show before i read the original cat in the hat i was enanmored by the animation of the great late chuck jones and the wonderful vocals of allan sherman as the cat in the hat if you see the credits theodore geisel had his hand in the music i recently bought the sing a long tape for my daughter grace who is 3 years old she requests to see it so hopefully the new dvd will be a great asset if it has extra features such as interviews or even behind the scenes of one of the best animation short classics ever	11

0	jamie lee curtis plays a college co ed who and her friends throw a party on a train and a killer is amoung them a good slasher movie of the 80 's david cooperfield plays a sexy magician who forms his wonderful magic almost putting a spell on those ladies around him just remember jokes could kill you	11

0	i purchased the dvd for my adopted chinese grandaughter the whole family loves it	11
0	although given short shrift by the few critics who watched it this is a worthy effort marked by good acting direction technicals and an intelligent script although in a state of undress through much of the film kelly lynch is given an opportunity to display the full panoply of her acting range as there are essentially only two actors and as so often with independent films all involved have an opportunity to be truly creative the desert setting enhanced the starkness of the extreme emotions to which the viewer is exposed	11
0	this is a very dark film kevin reynolds illuminating allows him to describe somberly the hard and bitter conflicts with the students in a high school but this picture has nothing in common with to sir with love this is much more than a simple fairy tale carefully made script and a brilliant performance given for samuel jackson	11
0	just one of those classics i'm in the mood for once in a while and needed to replace my vhs version excellent copy on cd very happy with it	11
0	gibson and weaver star in theis steamy view of the fall of imperialism in indonesia they start living the expat life in jakarta and live the transformation as the country moves to military rule the movie is interesting on many fronts seeing the leads before they became megastars watching the subtle condemnation of expats amongst locals and the history woven into the fiction supporting roles are played superbly as well it 's a great movie	11
0	to say this is a great film is probably an overstatement but it certainly is a great idea for a film gibson looks good weaver looks good hunt acts good weir directs good and the script is better than good much it 's a movie about ideas which earns high marks these days as so few flics can make that claim sure it stumbles a bit and the ending is purposely frustrating to carry forward the theme of white guilt and what then shall we do \? beyond all that it 's sensual and unpredictable and pretty damned intelligent seen anything lately in the multiplex that fits that bill \? i ai n't see it for yourself	11
0	at the tine it was unsurpassed in spectacle and scope and has held up remarkably well despite a few touches of typical silent overacting heavy handedness still the 1925 hur belongs in any collector 's collection for its importance in film history not to mention the fact that it sealed mgm 's financial future so of course as of this writing the greedy oinkers at the studios have n't released it on dvd because it wo n't sell 4 million copies	11
0	all 3 wiwag are excellent this is more than just a well put together documentary its very moving because of the footage narration and music you do n't feel like you are watching a dvd about baseball it feels like you are watching a snapshot of americana from the 50 's and 60 's after watching this you wish that things today were as they were back in those days not just baseball or sports but life in general as it was protrayed in the dvds	11
0	why the record company would put this out on vhs and not dvd is beyond me especially considering its release date the ultimate would be \( and they have done it before see both the doors and sepultura dvd releases \) to take this and add to it live at brixton and put it all on one dvd since this does n't seem likely i suggest burn your own dvd and include not only ricochet and another bloody murder \( both left out \) but also mr bungle 's one music video release happily while stripsearch is not listed on the back of the vhs box it is included fnm videos \? great great great	11
0	even though this cinderella does not have the modern day movie magic \( in fact the sets are pretty corny \) that does not hurt or take away any of the wonderful memories of when i was a little girl and looked forward every year for the airing of cinderella and the wizard of oz i was thrilled to have found this and would highly highly recomend it to any 40 woman out there that has the memory of this wonderful version of cinderella leslie ann warren is simply timeless in this	11
0	we 've seen several versions of cinderella now and like this one the best when my kids were smaller they liked the disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the disney version out the window i personally really liked the julie andrews b w version due to the great singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the dvd plays	11

0	i wo n't spend a long time explaining why i like this movie it 's just mindless fun and that 's all it needs to be a movie about a bunch of overweight kids taking over after their fat camp is sold into the hands of a crazed lunatic is enough reason to watch and while it 's not the funniest or clever done comedy it 's a great kids movie with enough laughs for us adults to enjoy along with them plus that blob thing is just too freaking cool	11

0	this is definitely not the typical look at the death camps this is a truely horrific look into the reality that was the death camps i wish it was longer but the limited time reveals so much more than we ever get from all the other narrative tours with the option of just listening to the soundtrack that adds a different dimension that ca n't be duplicated	11
0	ive seen them live in norwich \( england \) and they were wonderful its a little slow to start but with wonderful light humour and sound that have to be heard live to belive a wonderful performance from 6 men who are all in their own way geourgus and extreamly talented you will leave tired for them i brought the dvd but it doesnt give you the real thing if their in a town near you go their worth every penny to see im not a dance person but oh how i wish now i was ! ! ! ! ! wonderful breathtaking and loud	11

0	this is definitely screwball forget about anything resembling emotional reality this movie tromps along it 's own gay way a lot of the humor comes from the absurd manner cary and irene skip along in their own little la la land of wealth suspicion and inzaniness maybe not for everyone but cary gives one of his classic clueless performances	11
0	a little known documentary that is both entertaining and informative touching first hand accounts and rare footage that give an extraordinary look at both mr welles and the brazilian culture if there is one reason to own this tape it would be to see over and over again the last part of the film a piece called quot four men on a raft quot it is the most beautiful black and white short film i have ever seen the love mr welles had for these poor fishermen is so wonderfully apparent	11

0	this is a brilliant film by a master filmmaker storyteller dark moody exciting \( and fast ! \) thx 1138 is an amazing example of style and substance so whatever you do don't buy this dvd ! instead spend just a few bucks more and get the 2 dvd version which delves into the making of the film the early days of lucas and coppola walter murch 's involvement and the whole story about american zoetrope it also has a little segment made back in the day about the actor 's getting their heads shaved all in all it is a spectacular dvd set and worth the extra few dollars \( the 2 dvd version also has a much better cover	11

0	i love it when two of my favorite actors are in a movie together when one 's off screen you have the other to keep you entertained and when they 're on screen together it 's movie making at its best the plot itself leaves a bit to be desired the film 's production was stop and go for so long i heard that the director changed direction before it was finished my guess is that some of what was lost was what was missing from the movie particularly in regards to understanding benicio 's character properly nonetheless tommy lee jones and benicio del toro shine throughout p s being an animal lover i love that two leads in a movie are pro animal too	11
0	this movie was made mainly to potray the cycle of jesus' christ life and what he when through sacrificing himself for our sins people may think that it may be too religous for their standards but everyone has their own beliefs i highly recommend you view the film it is very innovating and emotional being a christian myself everytime i watch this film it uplifts my spirits and i hope it will do the same with yours	11
0	was forwarned about this one but wanted to experience it myself the directors camera style was very hard to take but overall added to the feeling of control being taken from you great performances by all the actors the reverse storytelling was used to great advantage subtitles not to hard to follow overall a shocking unexpected experience i would give 5 outa 5 to	11
0	cary grant was a great actor with countless memorable films although that this film is not amongst his very best it is a fun movie with a good plot that may be watch by the whole family with pleasure it is a war comedy with kids in main roles and one may see some disney influence but grant offers us one of his typical \( in a good sence \) perfomance that wilkl satisfy his funs enjoy it	11
0	then this would be a really serious detective as it 's executed now it 's a superbly relaxed copper gets the villain with serious undertones cool	11
0	sadly the dvd does not contain the special features i had hoped for like deleted scenes or a commentary but that does n't detract from the movie which i think could n't be more perfect do you already love michael \? then buy this movie for your collection just to have andie mcdowell singing about miles ralph and bradley is worth the price of the dvd all by itself	11
0	funny crazy you might want to be sure to watch it first before you buy it its terrible b movie material but so bad it 's actually good	11
0	i purchased this a gift for a special friend as i know that she loves musicals and had this movie but only on video tape when she first opened the gift she could nothing but squeal with delight and run around the office showing everyone with much excitment she has watched the movie several times and invited other friends over to enjoy the experience i myself have watched the movie and must say it is enjoyable but not the best movie of this genre would only recommend for people who like broadway shows and musicals i'm glad i got this movie as a gift for her as i will now be remembered for many years to come	11
0	i have loved this movie since i was a kid it is lightyears better than the hornblower series that was on a e i have read forester 's hornblower series at least 10 times and never get tired of returning to them gregory peck is not quite the hornblower that i have come to know over the years but he does a great job thank goodness this movie is out in dvd my vhs version is on its last legs	11

0	being from midland you might say i'm a homer and thus have a bias towards this movie this movie was literally made at the very end of the oil boom period in fact many of the companies' whose name appear through out the movie had gone out of business by the time it was released \( that 's how fast the bust hit \) terry jastrow \( who is from midland \) and his real life wife anne archer are great opposite each other on the screen while mary kay place provides great commentary on life in texas oil business	11
0	perhaps the only sculpture movie i ever saw very french she finally looses her mind at the end much angst	11
0	the characters are likable there is some decent progression and growth seen over the course of the film but only about half of the scenes are necessary it seems as if they just wanted to give gene wilder a few more chances to be quirky gene is a funny guy there is no doubt about that but enough is enough ! the film is family friendly except for a few instances of harsh language and violence but it is really nothing compared to the sorts of things that get into theaters these days it is worth a look but only if you 're willing to deal with some pretty decent stretches of time when there is not a lot of progression in the story	11
0	this is one of my favorite movies ever it really captures life in the 1800 's slums and you really get attached to the characters there are parts that you can barely watch because you feel for the characters this is a great story about people who hit rock bottom and become much stronger people by becoming tougher and working their way up again to achieve their dreams i 've seen this movie about 3 times and each time i see it it is just as good	11
0	well written well acted and well directed this is much better than 99 of all films on tv or in the theatres the only reason it is unknown is its adult content marijuana smoking and romantic affairs lending amusing background to a woman 's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life this is that rare bird an intelligent film for adults my favorite line joe mantegna 's remark to mia farrow you 're really interesting after she relates a private comment she heard him make while she was invisible it is not a 5 star film like say witness but it is an excellent small film this is for film fans who prefer romance to violence	11

0	this version of pride and prejudice takes quite a few liberties with jane austen 's most beloved story but manages to endear itself in spite of that olivier 's darcy will be a shock to those who are in love with colin firth or matthew macfadyen but he does so well that you 'll be charmed by him in no time and greer garson 's lizzy is as spirited as you could wish the costumes are all wrong yes and it is a little distracting for those of us who revel in regency dramas but once you get over that and immerse yourself into the story you 'll be swept away highly recommended	11

0	there are tons of women in prison films out there there are so many that often times they seem almost repetitive however this film was very unique because it provided a great mix of comedy and action pam grier as a tough revolutionary provided all the action as she ploted to free the mistreated women from prison the comedy mostly came from the sexually deprived women who were full of one liners and crazy notions but of course the movie still contained all the things that make a good prison explotation film lots of nudity violence bad laguage and did i mention lots of nudity it 's worth seeing ! if you like it also check out the big doll house	11
0	having watched this dvd only once all i can say is it has lived up to the expectations i was expecting the tour de force of sondheims music is fun and the numbers are well executed the highlight for me was carol burnett and the hilarious performance of everyone needs a maid only carol could perform this number with a touch of mad humour i do recommend this dvd and i look forward to veiwing the disc again on a cold wet night with a bottle of wine and a good fire going in the wood burner	11

0	ah yes tarantino 's first script entitled true romance which he sold for 30 000 dollars is a genius effort of great proportion and the writing you will notice in subsequent films and scripts is common for him certain terms will show up later on in other movies and as for reservoir dogs his second greatest film ever he used the money from true romance 's script to make this ingenius mob classic complete with terms used in his other films including one or two from true romance	11

0	i have to say that i picked this one episode out of the many as an example of the talent of these two gentleman if you see comedy and want comedy that is more direct and honest in how it portrays different groups this is the series i enjoy their skits and think that it simply pokes fun without being mean that is hard to do the different characters they take on makes me think there is more than two guys they are that good in my humble opinion you do not need to be an anglophile for the series but it would really help to be an anglophile valley girl for the vicky skit	11
0	this study of the intertwined lives of the sculptor rodin and the artist who loved him with a fatal passion is quite extraordinary long a student of modern art i learned a great deal from this film that had been unknown to me before furthermore the film is compelling as a work of art itself and enormously important to the on going study of women artists this is a work all admirers of modern art should view	11
0	this is a very enjoyable film in which everything from the acting to the music to the costumes is just right it depicts an earlier friendlier los angeles and makes one want to get into a time machine and go back to an aviation nut such as myself it is heaven perfectly capturing the excitement of the golden age of aviation the music fits the action so well in fact there is a performer on the air show circuit who does old time aerobatics and uses the the theme music from rocketeer as his performance music most excellent ! the joy and fun of this film carries beyond the actual watching of the film i wish there were more movies like it	11

0	while this movie was filmed in the coos bay oregon area i got to be an extra in it i had my doubts about it at the time but now that i have seen it i say it is well worth watching if you like humor and a feel good movie some profanity and mild nudity not for the real youngins btw i am the guy in the blue baseball cap at the bar the girl i was flirting with is my sister	11
0	let me be honest here i'm not a big fan of either nicole kidman or tom cruise however this movie is wonderful great story great characters the only reason i did n't give this movie five stars is the ending i think it could have been better great movie overall	11

0	this movie rocks man i'm so happy that they finally produced a stephen king script almost entirely true to the original story more than that it 's about 99 accurate they added some stuff like a new female character played by julie entwistle that was n't in the book but it turned out to be integral to the enhanced ending normally i'm very critical of people who watch these movies without having read the books first but this time i think i can confidently say that even non readers should like this movie it 's a masterpiece of suspense and gore rent it folks and call him the night flier	11

0	as others have noted arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the 1930s screwball my man godfrey genre it is an effectively told outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies however without sir john gielgud \( a gentleman who truly deserved the knighthood \) the film 's faults would be much more apparent he elevates every scene he is in with his impeccable refinement and a wit that is sharpened to perfection he is the pillar in a film which desperately needed credibility and the title song is a classic	11
0	this is a surprisingly good show it manages to have 'a little' violence sex and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid and it 's still intelligent enough to be interesting humorous and kind of addicting to an adult a modern nancy drew is veronica mars i wish seasons 1 and 2 were here i wish anything more were here and i 'd get that as well i'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest i prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent tv to sell me in that genre so i bought vm season 3 just for kicks i'm glad i did	11

0	i showed this to my 6th grade english class while we were reading miracle worker to give them a glimpse into contemporary deaf culture they loved it and really learned a lot about cochlear implants i highly recommend it for teachers who are interested in giving students a broaded understanding of deaf culture and also something that will really spark classroom debate and interest	11
0	with c i already except for peter artinian the father of heather since 2003 and they have moved back to long island after 1 year in maryland deaf community all of the kids are probably mainstreamed instead of institutionalized in a residential school for the deaf this happened after 3 yrs of watching the trends and etc this documentary is excellent insight into turmoil between ci and culturally deaf community nina and others appeared on abc good morning america in 4 2003i also hear that josh aronson has released a follow up video of sound and fury anyway this sound and fury video is a must see	11

0	this three part television production by the bbc released in 1999 is one of the finest films you 'll see in a while the acting is brilliant especially the performance by lindsay duncan the direction is extraordinary and the plot is most unusual \( if improbable \) the production is flawed only by a weak musical score the real question is how did this superb film ever get made in a media devoted to pleasing teenagers and adult sickos \? do n't miss it	11
0	a very enjoyable retelling of shakespeare 's romeo and juliet valley girl may be an extremely outdated movie but it still makes me laugh	11
0	when i watched this classic documentary i could n't help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here we just would n't make it what it took for inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls body piercing hummers and rap music underneath it all is a heritage that is raw rich and admirable and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up it would be interesting to produce nanook ii and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now	11
0	i like the story line of this movie but most of all i remember watching it when i was a kid of seven it was scary back then even with limited special effects and no graphic details watching it now was very enjoyable i found myself going back in time this film is in its own right a science fiction classic	11

0	i am serious ! what is going on \? i look at myself now and do not recognise the guy in the mirrow he likes baseball and football \( american football \) he eats hotdogs and humburgers who is he \? have no idea but the worse part he loved this movie and he fell in love with ingrim bergman for her unbeliavable performance in it forget walter matthau forget goldie hawn they allways good ! but the way ms bergman rediscover for us the story of love when you not 15 anymore she really touched my hart	11
0	this movie hurt hurt in its absorption and hurt in its aftermath much like betrayal also starring jeremy irons but far far more devastating jeremy irons and juliette binoche were good damage all around	11
0	i really enjoyed this movie the characters were believable and most of the actors did an excellent job if you 're looking for something heavy this is not for you this is a lighthearted movie that west indian people can relate to on many levels it is true that young island women often find themselves with much older men that can offer them financial security in these hard times and it shows how mothers are sometimes willing to turn a blind eye to the situation around them i have seen this alot all in all this movie serves its purpose to entertain there is good music dance and jokes cant done latah	11
0	so much is unknown about the valid attempts african americans made to build their own society 's during the 18th century forward this story tells of how they were thwarted and destroyed for 'just trying to live in america as free productive people ' my classes sat with eyes glued to the screen it was a horrific awakening for many of my students they were fed the lies and propaganda throughout their educations and lives that african americans were a useless species well they now know the truth african americans were very diligent in building businesses places of worship homes etc which frightened the cacausion people of that era so they were destroyed and much hope with them	11

0	this is one of cinema 's great achievements a testament of the combination of elements \( subject visual style photographic image movement sound background music character montage \) are perfectly blended into a unique experience the new yorker print however is the worst copy of this film \( 16mm 35mm television screenings \) i have ever seen this was a copy with a lack of contrast extra noise on the track looking like a dub if only there was a decent attempt to attain anything better would have begun to do the film justice as it is enjoy what you 're stuck with but know there 's something better out there burt shapir	11

0	this movie is great fun i remember watching it quite a few times when i was a kid and it is just as good now with this edition on dvd interviews with both corey 's let you know a lot about what happened between the two of them and how they became friends only disappointment is that corey haim comes across as a real stuck up snob type of person it makes you want to slap him because he seems so pompous corey feldman was great to watch and he has n't changed much in the last 18 years still a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who enjoyed it when it was first released	11
0	this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father a must see	11

0	i saw this movie when i was a student of latin literature and thought it captured the spirt of plautus 's plays brilliantly later i saw a stage prodction which i liked as well but no one can replace zero mostel he is one of the most naturally funny men in the world this is vulgar and bawdy and even corny at times but it is lots of fun it is one of my favourite comedy movies of all time	11
0	this movie not only has some creative fight scenes it also has some very funny scenes as well some scenes will have you laughing and not like other kung fu movies that are stupidly funny this one is on purpose recommended highly !	11
0	darkness \( for those who wonder what the title film means \) is not the only time of the day tenebre 's would be victims should be afraid of when a psychopath starts imitating the murders of one best selling author 's latest creation before you can even say what the this 1982 horrorfest has already delivered the goods with style and flair never has it been more fun to witness the untimely premise of its cast with a touch of ingenuity from its director and a killer score to boost tenebre is a strong and inspiring piece of film that is a definite must see undoubtedly one of the best efforts of dario argento 's career martin bouche	11
0	this is a great picture that i think grant morrison was imitating in his first issue of quot the invisibles quot it has cinematography and acting that repressed hollywood would n't get away from for another few years great ending that completely caught me off guard a very complete film	11
0	first of all i am a huge beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love with that out of the way i can say that this was a very good movie for those expecting a movie like a hard days night it is nothing like that this movie is about john lennon 's friend who was the bass player for the beatles at the begginging of their carrear it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a german lady i wont tell u the ending but this is a true story all in all i thought this was a great movie you should defiently buy it	11
0	saturday night and sunday morning is very good social realist film finney is fantastic as rebellious youth arthur seaton having a sexual relationship with a married woman while also having a girlfriend portrays the sexual liberation of that time sex before marriage was becoming more and more common and this film represents this change in british society it was a well made film for the time and even today has an appealing quality	11
0	movie way ahead of its time the violence is cuttiing edge for its time a peckinpaw trait but is tame by today 's standard first rate movie i think and very underated i like warren oates and the support acting roles are well done i think well worth the money 5 star	11
0	even now the quality of music in this musical movie is excellent this brings back memories from my childhood \) great version of a classic	11
0	this movie is absolutely ridiculous ! i'm a super musical fan and i had a friend who kept telling me that xanadu was a movie you could n't turn away from whenever you caught it on tv boy was he right ! the music themes and special effects are totally 80s i was so pleased to see one of my all time favorites gene kelly as a starring character olivia newton john 's love interest michael beck was the guy from warriors another of my favorites this is a great movie	11

0	a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it the story is simple enough and not a whole lot happens but there 's no denying it this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way it 's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers and that the film does n't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience not one charachter is stereotyped they are human and they 'll probably remind you of people you know i applaud this kind of a movie and i wish there would be more of them	11
0	i'm dumbfounded by some of the reviews this page guess they just did n't get it this film is hilarious it 's clever witty and extremely entertaining travolta is classic as the pathetic gameshow host wannabe weather man the characters are so well defined and so sadly pathetic in their own ways it 's what makes the film such a classic comedy it 's unbelievable that more people have not caught on to it if you liked the big lebowski orange county the cable guy any film with esoteric characterization you will absolutely love this film it 's a dark comedy people get over it	11
0	emotionally shattering true life tale \( well sorta \) based on an incident in director louis malles youth wherein the school in which he \( played by the very beautiful gaspard vanesse who sadly did not continue acting \) was enrolled served as a haven for jewish students hiding out from the nazis what could have been merely a suspense tale or a coming of age movie \( and it is both and splendid examples of each \) instead resonates as a meditation on survival betrayal and accomodating and forgiving oneself a great film but only for mature audiences	11
0	instead of watching a documentary learning the history of brittan ireland in an entertaining way	11
0	this has got to be the best adaptation of jane eyre that i have ever seen and samantha morton is the reason she is positively delightful in the title role she has grace and beauty just perfect for the roll one of her lines of dialogue is incorrect she says i am not a beauty i am jane eyre truthfully speaking she is a beauty ! the story flows smoothly it 's not too long nor too short my favorite used to be the orson wells joan fontaine version but after seeing this british version i had to change you will not go wrong buying it	11
0	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office confucius overcame many difficulties	11
0	i had forgotten how awesome this movie is even for a grown up like me it could do without all the songs \( it was made before disney wisely decided to ditch all the cheesy singing \) but it 's brisk double layered humor more than makes up for it kids will think the gags are sufficiently silly adults will pick up on the nearly sarcastic nearly risque dialog so rare in disney animated movies plus big foot dancing to 'stayin' alive' is just freaking hilarious basically it 's just a disney movie but it 's a great \( and severely under appreciated \) disney movie	11
0	great shows about binky taking up cycling and learning to challenge himself there 's a cycling champion vance legstrong who inspires him to succeed \( wonder who that character is modeled after \) 'operation dw' is about dw having surgery to get tubes put in her ears some really funny stuff in this one but that 's pretty much par for the course with the dw based episodes	11
0	after watching this video i examined the bible and it is very close to the scriptures in accuracy it helps give the bible life so that you can see the reality of creation and vividly picture these true events that occured thousands of years ago in our history this is truly a video the whole family can enjoy together	11
0	this 1960 effort by famed hammer productions of london england is one of their finest efforts and the greatest werewolf film ever made even by today 's standards the make up for the werewolf is eye opening and well worth the wait to see the movie is filled with underlying themes and for those who look it may be filled with a number of messages that are not readily apparent from the otherwise simple narrative color photography normally a strong suit in hammer films anyway is among their very best the performance by the young oliver reed as the werewolf is filled with energy and passion a highlight of director terence fisher 's accomplished career if you only can have one werewolf film this is the one	11

0	i love this movie maybe it 's because it seemed so risque as a kid or maybe it 's because jane hates it whatever it 's great fun sure the script leaves much to be desired and yea the special effects suck it was 1968 what do you want \? but that only adds to its charm it 's a funny movie more on the silly side this is true camp and if you like campy flicks this one has to be in your collection	11

0	'the curse of the grebes' is sort of a tribute to the red sox return to world series glory with cameos by damon timlin and renteria timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by emily dickinson with remarkable aplomb 'arthur changes gears' is also great he gets a bike he 's been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he 's so worried about getting it dirty that he wo n't ride it	11
0	this is an ideal movie for home theatre i grew up on a working ranch and richard farnsworth james caan and jane fonda are totally convincing as cowboys and cowgirl jason robards is utterly evil in this movie i 've liked them all in several other movies but none are as good as this one the breathtaking backdrop and a really well written story combined with an excellent array of talent makes this one of the treasures of my western collection	11
0	ok i 'll admt it when i first saw this movie i was only 6 or 7 i thought it dumb and pointless i also thought 'omfg ! what was that teacup thing for \? it was soooooo pointless this movie is stupid ' now i am 13 and i saw it again on abc family then i thought 'wow !

0	i was never a richard burton fan until i discovered this movie richard burton 's acting in this movie is top notch burton is able to pull you into his character of british agent alec leamas and make it all believable thankfully the movie is in black and white because it adds to the overall suspense and mood of the film the dvd transfer and digital 5 1 sound are excellent it 's hard to believe a movie from 1965 with no fancy gadgets or special computer effect 's could be so entertaining but it is the question is will alec come in from the cold or does he have one more mission in him	11
0	this has always been one of my alltime cinema favorites and i was happy to see it available on dvd the story the script the direction and the acting are superb	11

0	some of the best lighting i have ever seen on face of that hunk c tommy john peters is a genius	11
0	i have to admit that good writing or not this is one of my favorite escape movies and i wish it would come out in dvd my liking it has something to do with john 's use of the typewriter and his ability to change the direction of the characters through the machine once he damages the typewriter he needs to make a technical sevice call to get it going again you ca n't beat that we even get to see a perplexed robert wagner and the rest of a great cast	11

0	however noone has commented on one interesting fact theres a episode missing ! the orginal miniseries is 10 hours long theres 2 hours missing and the part where they attack the processing plant is too soon unfortunately i do n't remember whats missing but it seems that it belongs before the first ep presented on this dvd set !	11
0	being a fan of the better cg and graphics of sci fi such as star trek \( the newer ones \) i was greatly surpised at how good the v series was v the final battle is the second installment of the saga so make sure to buy v the miniseries first the storyline is good and characters are likeable and three dimensional i highly recommend it for any sci fi fan for old hands it is a fun movie and for newcomers to both the series and the genre it is a good introduction	11

0	one of the best films of the seventies in my opioin charles bronson plays a professinal killer who is doublecrossed by powerful mob boss who wants bronson to join his family simple straightforward action that never lets up the ending also proves memorable when bronson realizes bronson means business in this film the guy can portray this type of chracter better than anyone else and has proved it time and time again over the years	11

0	100 men and a girl is rank sentimentality with a great sound track it deserves to be on dvd for the sound track alone durbin 's rendition of the mozart alleluia sends chllls down the spine	11
0	i saw this several times as a kid and it always stuck in my head it 's a beautiful english production that has a definite melancholy bittersweet flavor that 's missing from other adaptations really worth seeing it is a kid friendly version \? not really but smart teens may enjoy it great performances from ralph richardson peter sellers and fiona fullerton as alice	11
0	seller was very timely in sending the dvd and the quality was as described	11
0	haha now all the other reviews say this movie is cheesey now maybe its cause i get scared really easily but this movie just had something about it that scared the crap out of me i couldnt even finnish i	11
0	the more historically accurate the film the more it tends to drag the molly maguires certainly passes this test ! still it presents a fascinating account of an oppressed people and a wrong headed response which brought them into conflict with the church	11
0	ok this is like so many other sci fi movies of the 80 's \( and the second of three underwater action movies that year \) that you always feel like you have seen it before the story is about miners on the ocean floor who find a sunken russian ship near them after checking it out the find a video tape and a flask of booze as two crew members drink from it they get very sick and why not it has a drug that changes you into a blood craveing monster not the greatest but i had fun watching it and if gore and f x 's are your thing you 'll love it	11

0	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality is n't very good it 's streamed and the bitrate \( quality \) is low personally i want to watch survivor on my 50 plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider	11
0	seriously one of my favorite movies of all time thank goodness for 1980 's rewinds kate hudson 's character is ridiculous in the absolute best sense of the word oh and martha plimpton never ages she 's a freak of nature now get off the computer and let 's go party risa garcia style f yeah	11
0	great movie excellent condition and as always shipped quickly and in good shape	11
0	i saw this movie when i was about 15 or 16 and that was a long time ago i ordered a copy through amazon and when i watched it i remembered everything in the film especially queenie hiding in the woods i like this as it was directed by charles kaufman brother of lloyd kaufman who made the toxic avenger i give this film a rating of 5 stars and as it is a troma inc release this is one of the best troma films i have seen	11
0	the fly is fantastic and well worth a watch goldblum 's performance is also just outstanding for a really cool creepy interesting and engaging film this is the one fly 2 not so good so dont bother the extras and presentation on the dvd is also great adding to the package here definately worthwhile if a little cronenberg splat isnt gonna offend and watching what could have been a really tacky cheap project done really really well sounds good and if it doesnt get over yourself cause it is	11

0	this film really shows the versatility of peter sellers and the truly magical nature of his acting this is a light hearted comedy and a treasure to watch the quality of the film is superb even though it is based on a black and white source frankly you forget that it is in black and white format	11
0	my side of the mountain is a terrific and educational movie i ca n't agree with some of the negative reviews here this is an interesting movie the whole family can watch together little sam gribley is a walking encyclopedia this movie would be good for classrooms watch it and learn ! i'm going for the novel	11
0	i do n't have television have n't for 11 years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i 've purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows	11
0	with a well crafted script good actors at the heights of their powers and brisk no nonsense direction emma thompson has done better work since but kenneth branagh has n't unfortunately too bad really branagh may still be a pretty good director but i think working with emma is what lent him an appeal and warmth on screen that he has not been able to recapture his hamlet was glossy chilly unpleasant and too old nevertheless i'm grateful that we at least have this as well as his henry v and much ado about nothing	11
0	i dont remember watching he man growing up but i think i saw this movie i watched this movie without thinking it would be anything speical and i was wrong the preview really drew me into the movie before i watched it it was pure fun and an excellent sci fi movie dolph lundgreen was the main source for finding this movie thanks dolph ! where the heck are you these days \? i didnt check all reviews but at the very very end of the movie skeltor comes on and says i 'll be back ha ! guess that movie never happened	11

0	the classic comes to the screen and is reincarnated as a classic film the film gives just the right touches of a dark moodiness welles is excellent as edward rochester the tormented master of the house joan fountaine is wonderful as jane look for a very young elizabeth taylor in one of her earliest roles this material has been done many times but watch this version	11
0	the movie is a bit dramatic at times but those who have studied the doolittle raid and the treatment of the 8 men captured know it does not tell the american public enough about the terrible way humans treat other humans if the americans had been able to know how badly their prisoners were being treated the japanese island might not be there today read four came home for the best view or study other exerpts of various items on the internet i am writing about dean edward hallmark a graduate of paris junior college and one of the three who were executed	11
0	this is a classic gangster movie already anyone whos into the whole block scene should add this to their collection	11
0	veronica mars is my favorite show currently on television although the show has been focusing more on veronica 's romantic relationship than in the past the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode the writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show the acting for the most part is top notch and kristen bell who plays veronica is amazing i especially enjoyed episode 9 spit and eggs in which veronica figures out who has raped her fried parker and at least two other women on her campus	11
0	where are the dvds \? i'm still waiting ! i want it all but especially the second season i 'd rather not have them done on both sides of the disc i want good quality discs not too many episodes on each please however i 'll take what i can get just put it on dvd please !	11
0	what most people fail to realize is that most life story movies are not made for the purpose of glorification to the viewer but to let them know of the real life trials and tribulations of that person how can you criticise someones life story \? to go threw what they went threw to see what they saw and to experience life threw times when life was almost impossible to grasp \? i think josephine baker was a very great person regardless of her nationality anyone with the guts to live life to the fullest and overcome impossible barriers deserves much praise	11
0	this is a surprisingly good show it manages to have 'a little' violence sex and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid and it 's still intelligent enough to be interesting humorous and kind of addicting to an adult a modern nancy drew is veronica mars i wish seasons 1 and 2 were here i wish anything more were here and i 'd get that as well i'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest i prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent tv to sell me in that genre so i bought vm season 3 just for kicks i'm glad i did	11

0	this episode embodies why i love this series the bad guy is bad and makes appearances throughout the series and now this episode offers some more understanding of the wraith species and actually begs you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs now you really do n't know what to think except that today is a day of honor i wo n't blow it for you watch this one first if you 're not sure about which episode to sample and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci fi adventures	11
