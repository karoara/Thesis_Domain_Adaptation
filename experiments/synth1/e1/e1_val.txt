0	i loved the look of the boot the price was great i guess you get what you pay for they run a size small there is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location you break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off believe me i tried i really wanted to keep the boots based on the look once on they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all i am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe i tend to be pretty easy i just could not make these work ! sorry	0

1	as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present one size fits all it becomes increasingly difficultfor those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit inanything other than the most expensive brands these shoesare well made and an excellent value the only negativeis that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacerto make them narrow the heel tends to wallow a little bit inmy particular case	0
0	they run much smaller than birkenstocks i sent the size 44 back \( which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks is it the boston \? \) and got the 45 and it still feels small the upper is ok the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate it 's just the size thing that bothered me	0

0	broke within 12 hours of purchase very cumbersome and non flexible for different types of cars would n't recommend	0
0	i did n't pay much for these so i had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag they repel water from the outside just fine but they also keep it in they might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them but that is hard to do in a pinch go for it otherwise invest in something better i certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	0

0	maybe just maybe someone will buy one of these stick up bulbs and maybe just maybe the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out i thought to myself buy another one because maybe this one was defective i bought three more every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use it 's a great idea but a worthless piece of junk the spare bulb \? useless as well do n't waste a dollar on this junk if i could have found the receipts i would have gotten my money back	0

1	i ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well i 've been wearing birks and various varieties of them for years i'm always very satisfied with the fit delivery time and the customer service that i receive from midwest sports i wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow but as soon the walkways and streets are clear i'm back in them with thicker socks of course they can be a little stiff at times but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing you will love them like no other	0

1	i really liked my tote bag what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag stuffed in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship that was foul ! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much	0

1	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than 30 retail price even on sale was 60 the jacket arrived in about a week its nice and warm very good quality the upper torso shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear it fits great and looks good only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little but all in all i'm very pleased	0

1	this is a heavy thick robe i expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly i am 5'8 and the sleeves are only slightly to long but i do n't even notice now the comfort level is amazing this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed i cant speak on durability as i 've only had it for a month or so but you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel i got the brown color and i love it i feel like grisly adams in this thing	0

0	in the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable but it shows it in a smaller size than the one i wear so once i opened the box i was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome it could not possibly be worn with a low cut top which is why i bought it if you were a size 34d or above beware	0
0	i found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it 's worn the more it loses shape the shoulder straps i did n't find had enough support hooks for lift up i personally would n't recommend this bra	0

1	i have owned and worn this for several months now and it is very durable and warm as well ! i would just be cautious about the unisex sizing as i am a medium sized person \( 10 12 \) and it does seem to be a little large yet i wear it anyways hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size	0

0	i absolutely agree with brett a warner these replacements feel horrible they do n't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 's on i bought them at a local store which did not take returns so they just sit in the closet if you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will i wear a 11 1 2	0
1	i was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years yet was n't going to take years to pay for ! \( ha ! ha ! \) this is a nice checkbook cover for the money my only complaint is that it needs to have a tab to keep your check register open to the page you are working on however it does have a loop to keep a pen inside you should desire to do so all in all a good buy	0
0	these broke within the first 3 days of use 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located	0
1	and i am very pleased with them they are very comfortable ! ! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	0
0	buying this was a mistake this bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt the straps are not comfortable it 's cuts deep into the shoulders it should be atleast padded def not what i expected from this product the material and pattern is the only thing i liked it has a sexy look to it	0
0	i agree with the other review i love the tag free feeling but that was about all i liked about this bra the fabric seems really cheap after maybe 6 washings my barely there cc tagfree was feeling flimsy and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill for what they charge for even basic bras these days i definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months ! i would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric	0
0	very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers relegated to cleaning after just one use	0
1	i give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle i ordered i like it delivery is fast i will order something else	0

1	as the weather has cooled for fall and winter i needed socks for my baby i initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just did n't hold up as well i have also tried socks with grips on the bottom but they were so thick my son just sweated in them the children 's place socks are not too thick and very durable also the non slip feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked the other socks did not ! i strongly recommend these socks for your child	0

0	as i said above the vanilla you 'll get is artificial it 's vanillin not the way more expensive vanilla being advertised personally i do n't care for vanillin because it tastes harsh and chemical laden to me this stuff tastes no different than the fake vanilla at the supermarket and i did n't have to trouble my poor mailman into delivering it	2
1	if you like smashing things this does the job nicely i smiled taking it out of the box it is quite heavy and large very nice open bowl with large capacity i highly recommend this as a workhorse warning you may need a second smaller mortar if you pour dump from your mortar often as this is very heavy but this is very handy for working with larger items or quantities	2
0	i must admit the first one that i ate was indeed tasty though slightly undercooked however the second one was much less cooked and when i went to cut it blood from the sausage squirted into my eye now i am beside myself because i remembered my wife going on one night about blood borne diseases i am scared that i might have unwittingly acquired hepatitus or aids my wife told me not to worry because the animals the sausages are made from do not carry these diseases i refuse to take any chances because my wife and i are having problems i still await the results from the blood tests my doctor ordered	2
1	product arrived quickly and was priced much lower than i have ever paid for it in minesota or illinois packaging was excellent i will do business with this company again	2
1	i love this popcorn i buy loads of it so i never run out i do n't know why this is n't the most popular popcorn out there i do n't think people know about it or maybe they do n't want to have to cook it but it 's so easy and good	2
1	i first picked this tea up in paris at the bon marche department store food halls \( le grand epicerie de paris \) on returning to the states and trying the tea i was most impressed redolent of bergamot and flowers it has an intense aroma and flavor that is well enhanced with the addition of honey and a little milk it is now my favorite tea enjoy	2
1	an incredibly refreshing drink when iced ! mix in a teaspoon of honey while your tea is warm and then pour over a generous amount of ice because of the ice use two bags and steep for three minutes or more depending on your taste you will be pleasantly surprised	2
1	i used this years ago when i lived in europe and tried it again recently when i found it on amazon it adds a wonderful molasses taste in recipes calling for corn syrup like pecan bars and chocolate frosting it 's a hit with my friends one likes oatmeal now with a spoonful of the syrup	2
0	okay i just got my ups delivery 1 \) these are half the size of a real donut 2 \) dry overpriced and just terrible3 \) no flavor and horrible presentation4 \) totally overpriced and not worth the moneyi recently bought the low fat donuts recommended in the oct issue of every day with rachael ray holey donuts ultra low fat gourmet donuts and these low fat donuts are full size packed and shipped in a frozen cooler and oh my god they have real cinnamon buns that have 3 grams of fat double the size and yes they cost more but everything arrives frozen thaws soft and moist and just blows this way	2
1	great product ! my only real concern is the high sugar content but it sure does taste good	2
1	i am a seattle native who constantly finds herself living either abroad or on the 'other' coast as an avid tea drinker i frequently find myself with other epicureans and always try to convince them that market spice tea is the greatest tea blend ever ! ! now that i can buy market spice on amazon i can finally prove it	2
1	i 've been buying these freeze dried strawberries for several months and use them mainly in my cereal they are delicious and consistantly high quality i have only had one can with what seemed like excessive strawberry powder at the bottom	2
1	this is the best candy i have ever had my aunt gave everybody at christmas this candy in a red box what a great gift it does n't help my atkins diet but i 've got to have my chocolate	2
0	i thought that i would try out this product since i 've tried a number of green teas and after trying this i was not at all impressed with it by any means i do n't recommend this product there was no kind of flavor to this to me and i 've been all over the orients just my opinion but hope someone else enjoys it better than i did	2
0	i was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements i had nothing but high hopes i was totally open minded i thought it seemed too good to be true \( low cal no carb noodles ! \) but hey i'm an optimist guess what \? it is too good to be true ! i read about washing them and drying them i did no problem i added sauce i put them in my mouth the taste was not the problem it was the texture it was seriously like chewing rubber bands no noodle resemblence whatsoever i honestly ca n't understand those who rave about these but hey to each his own	2
0	when i received the item the box was busted open and all the cookies in both packages were crushed up one of the packages was open and leaking cookies dust all over my car when i pulled it out of the mailing box on top of that the one or two cookies that were salvaged were stale ! ill never order anything from this company again ! ! ! my entire 11 00 went down the tubes what a waste ! ! !	2
1	i was not sure what to expect upon receiving a box of this tea as a gift during the holiday season and indeed the ingredients struck me as rather unusual being a person who generally likes my tea and coffee black with no flavoring whatsoever i was rather suspicious of the orange grapefruit and other extra 'scents' however i was delighted with the concoction the extras are definately present giving a slightly citric quality to the tea but are not the least bit overpowering and provide a unique aroma that is quite pleasing i do recommend steeping it for a long time to get the most out of the leaves especially if you are to get the citric scents that make it so unique	2
1	truly a unique spice which used sparingly adds a real zest to meat and poultry dishes a wonderful addition to a spice collection colett	2
1	these fruit candies are not too sugary sweet they have good tart fruit taste under the sugar coating	2
0	the sweet taste was excessive and unpleasant i thought it was not fresh tasting the picture is deceiving because each fruit is cut in half and you get the top half only other marzipan is the entire round shape of the fruit i am glad that i only bought the small size since i ended up throwing this purchase in the trash	2
1	i'm a fanatic for gummy candy especially the sour kind but most sour gummy worms look and taste like a chemistry experiment and most apple and \( especially \) apricot fruit \( ish \) rings taste artificial too haribo does a much better job their pink grapefuit was my favorite gummy until i discovered these apple ones they taste natural real healthy apple flavor less stridently sour than grapefruit now it 's a tie for top place apple and grapefruit when i ca n't decide i eat 'em both together my dentist taught me that trick believe it or not i sometimes wonder whose side she 's on	2
1	i sent this to a friend and with free shipping who can beat the price my mom saw it and said it was wonderful i will definitely purchase again	2
1	it was great but i don't think the price was near what i'd be willing to spend again price was way to high sincerelyjeanne higgins	2
1	it 's just like you had in europe or latin america and it they send it pretty quickly as you probably know if you 're ordering it it 's delicious for cooking coffee uses and slightly nasty for everything else	2
1	i'm a huge fan of jelly belly jelly beans so i really enjoyed this gift box of 50 different kinds ! my favorite is definitely tangerine but it 's always a treat to try new and different flavors this box comes with a guide that tells you which flavors are which so you can avoid the ones you dislike \( for me peanut butter jelly beans gag ! \) it 's pretty good size with a decent amount of jelly beans for the price jelly bellies have never been cheap ! it 's well worth the cost though and a great gift this year for christmas	2
0	i was very disappointed it has a definite after taste i was surprised at the small container size after tasting i was glad it was small would i order it again \? yuck !	2
1	it tastes like cornbread but it is still good however the shipper took 1 month to deliver the product ! okay if you do n't mind waiting for a ridiculous amount of time	2
0	i ca n't believe that this is considered a gourmet food in the uk long life uht milk is an excellent standby when you run out of fresh milk and it tastes much better than this parmalat ok brands differ and taste is a matter of preference and there are mixed opinions as to whether the uk uht milk tastes as good as pasturised but many are just as happy with it as fresh there is no way that the parmalat could be mistaken for fresh milk and how expensive just add gourmet to the title and up the price ! in the uk it is similar or cheaper than fresh milk i ca n't understand why it is not more available in the usa	2

1	great taste excellent spicy flavor \( with or without meat added \) one of the best dried packaged soups ever	2
1	i recently started a diet where i could only eat the egg white not the yolk because of the fat content i make a fruit smoothie every morning using egg whites as my protein source the powdered egg whites have simplified my mornings and saved me alot of time in the kitchen \( anyone who has spent time seperating eggs knows what i'm talking about \) not to mention not having to worry about salmonella anymore i also saved a boatload of money compared to buying the whole eggs this is a fantastic product and well worth the cost	2
1	the tin makes the world of difference i purchased the large tin and have been using it for over 7 months the spice still smells extremely fresh	2
1	these beans were really fresh and lower cost than other suppliers the beans were shipped free and promptly	2
1	it was great fun ! we had talked about the candy when we were all young and that you do n't see them any more so i found it on your site orderd a box and took them to work it brought back alot of fun memories and we all had a great laugh ! thanks	2
1	i love this stuff and was quite please to find it so easily on amazon since i ca n't find it elsewhere not for everyone tart and spicy at the same time	2
0	beware the cadbury from netgrocer 's is not the creamy uk cadbury it the hershey cadbury from the us the difference between the two is like the difference between a miller and a fresh guiness	2
1	i was very pleased with my order of vanilla beans the beans were soft and smelled wonderful i will order this product again	2
1	i have used this pasta for two years it has an excellent taste and consistency while being low carb much better than whole wheat choices i 've tried all the selections and all i can say is i'm looking forward to the company adding rigatoni and acini de pepe sometime in the future it 's hard to find in restaurants but if you are ever in pittsburgh they serve it at gullifty 's wonderful some diabetics may find it does n't work for them trial and error if you eat it because of diabetes	2
1	i ca n't stop eating these babie ! they 're good companion for watching a movie at home do n't forget to bring some to the office	2
1	these are the best berries i 've ever tasted ! i thought for sure they were sweetened but they 're not the berries they used must have been perfectly ripe and the flavor just blasts your mouth when you try them additionally the slices are whole with very little breakage in the can the value you get is pretty great considering that 8oz of berries is approximately equivalent to 5 of fresh strawberries at 3 lb \( shipping \) that 's really not bad and you can have these year round even when strawberries are n't in season	2
1	the best experience for this tea is at the actual pike place market where they brew it so you can sample it in their charming little store past the flying fish and florist it is also really great to have any other time in your life and to share with everyone you meet since every grocery store does n't stock this wonderful tea you will have to order it and stock your kitchen office cabin whatever with it and enjoy	2
1	this one caught us by surprise ! we do n't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it 's really good ! we love the way it smells the way it tastes and the fact it is just plain different most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent and it 's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee meaning a rich flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good singleservecoffee com	2

1	wonderful service and product ! best price for freeze dried strawberries that i 've found there was some powder but i 've always noted this with freeze dried strawberries i did n't think it was excessive and i think it 's great added to the graham cracker crust for cheescake	2
1	i purchased this for an oktoberfest party there was a lot left over mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk the sweet tasted nicely and were decorated in a very pretty way i 'd recommend this to anyone who does n't want to make their own marzipan and needs to purchase a large quantity there are several little flats of the candies so you can package them seperately or give a flat away to a friend easily enough	2
1	this popcorn oil does indeed make your popcorn taste like theater popcorn it is simple and easy to use i use it in my whirley pop stovetop popper and my popcorn comes out perfect every time my family and friends love it	2
1	this is my first asian food purchase with pier mall and my first review here at amazon as well these matcha candies get better and better with each one i can see how they could become quite addictive ! individually wrapped and matcha powder coated this flavor takes some getting used the outside is kind of hard underneath the powder and then the inside is all chewy and decadent yummy actually i think i'm already addicted ! ! also nice to travel with or put in your bag these wo n't melt or make a mess	2
1	i bought this candy and when i tasted it it tasted so good so its the best candy but it hurts your teeth when you eat but this is good and addicting cand	2
1	this is a superb product that used to be found on most grocery store shelves sadly they disappeared from the shelves after an extensive internet search for the product i was able to find them through amazon com and gristede 's supermarket i ordered a case and they arrived in perfect shape and just as advertised when these are gone i will certainly use this same procedure to order more	2
1	i am so happy to have found this coffee this dark roast is rich in flavor a great cup of coffee brightens my day every day	2
1	this is a very good product it keeps you from having to try to mix your own cinnamon and sweetener it 's good for a lot of things for those who ca n't have sugar my favorite is cinnamon toast i will reorder it when i am out of it it 's so nice to have something with splenda instead of aspartame	2
1	if you appreciate caliente you must try this	2
0	i love the popcorn but the shipping costs are insane ! ! a total rip off wabash valley farms or amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind 5 stars for the popcorn minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping argh yes the popcorn is tender and luscious and it melts in your mouth like you 're eating cooked grasshoppers but come on ! ! ! ca n't you ship this product for less \? shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse sigh too bad really	2
1	this product is great ! i love cinnamon sugar on my toast and bagels but not all the calories i did n't want to just mix splenda and cinnamon together on my own since i did n't know what ratio to use i will definitely order this again when the 3 i bought are almost gone	2
1	we received a box as a gift last week \( ca n't keep our hands out of the box ! \) it truly tastes fresh what a treat it reminds me of the fresh boxes of chocolates i used to pick up on business trips in belgium and netherlands you wo n't be disappointed	2
1	in my experiences with indian cuisine from patronizing local restaurants owned and operated by native indian folks this is quite comparable and the flavors are very similar it 's nice to be able to open a package of indian food to eat with some basmati rice quickly recommended some of the flavors are spicy	2
1	these have been my favorite cookies for over 20 years now both in new york california i just love the shortbread and the fudgy center and have never found another cookie that even compares recently i moved to the southeast tho and panicked when i could n't find any stella d'oro cookies anywhere ! i'm so happy to find them here at amazon where i'm a regular shopper anyway now i can add them to my order everytime i buy something !	2
1	i buy these ginger chews for when i feel sick to my stomach they really help	2
1	having spent several months trying to find the cookies in our area to no avail located them through amoazon ordered them during the holiday seasonhad a very quick respons and were able to have them for christmas day i just ca n't beleive how quickly we received the cookies without one being broken	2
1	if you like strong coffee typical of the flavors used in better expresso brews this is about the best one we have ever found period ! it 's worth the money you have to ante up and the extra hassle required in order to buy	2
1	this is my favorite tea it 's strong and spicy and to me tastes like cinnamon and orange i prefer it hot but like it cold especially in the summer i think it 's the best thing on winter mornings	2
0	i expected parmalat brand milk but received a different brand altogether i also excpected this to have a long shelf life not just a few months i thought the product was overpriced for what i received	2
1	i first had this tea served at the firebird resturant in new york they served it in traditional russian tea glasses with sweetened cherries from moldavia \( no sugar \) this is by far the best way to enjoy this fine tea but even when i'm in less civilized parts of the country prince vladimir with a spoonful of sugar is wonderful	2
1	i 'd do n't know exactly how to write an in depth review of anything let alone a candybar so i 'll just describe what i think of it in my opinion the dark chocolate toblerone candy bar is my favore candy bar for simple reasons 1 dark chocolate is my favorite kind of chocolate2 the honey that 's added adds a subtle smoothness3 the almond pieces are n't very big so the bar is mostly chocolate4 swiss chocolate is the best chocolate i 've eveer had5 there 's no denying the packaging is really neatwhat can i say it 's a candy bar	2
0	i am a huge fan of most of the tasty bite meals i 'd tried almost all of the indian flavors and had never been let down i ordered the green curry meal without ever having tried it before based on the good reviews here and my past experiance unfortuantly i found it to be nearly inedible the rice is clumpy and unpleasant and the spicing was just wrong i love thai green curry and this tasted nothing like it i still recommend the indian tasy bite meals but track a box of this down and sample it before you commit to a pack of 6	2
1	i ca n't say enough good things about jr mushrooms these are top quality chef inspired vanilla beans i got them primaraily for my creme brulee another plus was the free shipping which really helps a struggling young chef like myself the only slight dissappointment was that there was no best creme brulee recipe enclosed no problem for me as i 've memorized the procedure i can say this you wo n't be dissappointed by this product use it in whatever calls for vanilla even ice cream	2
1	this is by far the most enjoyable hot chocolate i 've ever come across for consumer purchase it is high in calories and expensive but if you are looking for a rich comforting cup of chocolate this is it this hot chocolate is thick and delicious in the european sense yet not overly sweet as many american brands are unfortunately mariebelle is neither organic nor fair trade but if that is not important to you then there is no downside i 've found no other maker produces a finer cup of chocolate save the city bakery in nyc which is the next best thing to parisian hot chocolate	2
1	these are actually pretty darn good nice consistency for what they are with a nice chocolate taste	2
0	this is what happens when starbucks destroys a good brand to elevate its lousy brand this blend is undrinkable save your money and buy a supermarket brand	2
1	it is as close to theatre topping as it could be good taste good flavor a in my book or should i say on my popcorn	2
1	this candy is awesome read my review i posted on the 5lb bag page and while you are at it buy the 5 bag they are way cheaper this 12 pack ends up being only 3 75 lbs and costs 12 50 and the 5lb bag is only 13 00 as of this review	2
1	this one caught us by surprise ! we do n't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it 's really good ! we love the way it smells the way it tastes and the fact it is just plain different most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent and it 's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee meaning a rich chocolate and raspberry flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good singleservecoffee co	2
1	this green curry is really really good the only thing that would make it 5 stars would be a few more vegetables but the flavor is excellent nice and spicy	2
1	i have n't been able to find this product in my local grocery stores when i found it online through amazon i was delighted i ordered 10 packages they are all gone i love them especially to dunk in my morning coffee if you have n't ever tried them do so you will love them	2
1	the red sea salt has a earthy flavor it is slower to dissolve on the tongue it is a beautiful unexpected hue and surprised and delighted my dinner guests none had ever tasted it before ! i used a light sprinkling on my endive salad \( along with pepper \) and it looked exotic and tasted amazing !	2
1	a friend introduced me to this coffee and i am addicted i am an avid coffee drinker and this is the best coffee ever i have never been a morning person but this coffee is now the highlight of my morning i look forward to getting up the coffee flavor was not in any way noticable chocolate to me but very sutle i love this coffee	2
1	as someone who absolutely hates water crystal light was a life saver for me now that they make it in little packets 'to go ' i can put several in my purse when i go on business trips or vacation and feel good about buying bottled water i'm doing what doctors suggest we all do drink lots of water yet doing it with something that makes it taste good ! the only complaint i have if you can call it a complaint is that they have n't come out with kiwi strawberry in the individual packets yet that is by far my favorite flavor lemonade comes in a close second i highly recommend this product leanne burroughs author of highland wishes and her highland rogue	2
0	i did n't care for this pumpkin soup it taste more like pumpkin flavored corn starch	2
1	the matcha tea is exactly what i expected extremely green great flavor keep in mind i'm in no way a matcha expert but from my limited experience with this type of tea \( starbucks etc \) it was great got the product within days of ordering it far before the estimated date of delivery highly recommend this seller	2
1	this was hilarious all the teen boys enjoyed this as a gag gift order was processed shipped and delivered in a timely manner	2
1	these are not for weight control but are very diabetic friendly it is so nice to once again be able to enjoy one of my favorite cookies and keep control of my blood sugar if you are a diabetic and loved oreo 's i recommend trying these	2
0	purchased as a gift to client the gift basket arrived on time and the recipient commented on how nice the basket was but one of the cups was chipped they could not find the chipped piece so we do n't know whether or not the break occurred during shipping or not either way better care could have been used to insure that the cups are in perfect condition upon arrival i'm very disappointed especially since this was sent as a gift to an important client starbucks coffee and mugs are great corporate gifts but i would choose another company to handle the gift baskets will not use them again	2
0	i bought this 5 pound bag of candy because the reviews were all beaming about how good these are and i 've bought the gummy frogs in the past and liked those so i thought i 'd give this a try these are gross not only that but they 're huge i recommend the gummi frogs as a better alternative now i know to try out the candy in a smaller portion first before investing in my next 5 pound bag 2 stars because well it 's not fair to people who like these to say they are absolutely terrible but still now i have a 5 pound bag of candy i have to get rid of	2
1	since i discovered this wonderful relish in england a few years ago i have tried to buy replacements in this country it is served at most pubs in the uk as part of a ploughman 's lunch along with various cheeses and other goodies it has a wonderful taste and texture unlike anything in this country i recommend every one buy some i 've found it only on amazon	2
0	i expected something softer in texture but these are like chewing on rubber with flavor much too hard for my 3 y old child if you 're looking for something tasty softer in texture try kasugai gummy candies	2

1	love it cooks up easily just like rice and comes with a booklet of recipes really good for you and makes a great side dish that is high in protein but eats like a carb	2
1	these are not the shriveled scrawny beans you find in a jar in the grocery store they are amazing do n't tell jr but he is n't charging enough !	2
1	i love this coffee and drink it nearly everyday it is my way of pampering myself although it 's rather expensive godiva chocolate coffee with milk is something i look forward to drinking in a polka dotted mug somehow the cold winters of new england become more cheerful	2
1	my entire family loved this soup we are fans of butternut squash soup as well as various ginger spiked soups and this one does not disappoint it is thick hearty and not too ginger ish highly recommended	2
1	we have enjoyed market spice tea since our first taste at a local las vegas coffee house when the coffee house closed a couple of years ago we did n't even know how to get it again until last summer when we went to seattle on vacation the tea is delicious ordering it on amazon was easy the delivery was fast and we all had it for christmas	2
0	the prime rib slices i had were pre cooked and they are terrible nothing like what you would expect from a good restaurant or make at home they lack in both flavor and texture the remaining slices i have will probably be sliced up and used in tacos	2
1	i love this salt it tastes fantastic i even find myself putting it on things i normally would n't salt i 've gotten my husband to buy me more of the sea salts they are all equally delicious	2
1	tasty bite punjab eggplant is delicious and spicy try adding a bit of plain yogurt serve with rice or bread \( nan or pita work well \) and you have a brilliant meal that costs only a few dollars this is true of all of the tasty bite indian entrees i wish the tasty bite thai meals came as entrees \( i e without the rice or noodles \) so i could streach them out into a big meal by adding my own rice or noodles tasty bite entrees are really easy to keep on hand since they do n't have to be refrigerated buying in bulk works well for these	2
1	good product that 's good for you packaged to last forever only way it would be better is if it came with a quarter cup scoop	2
1	i live in a small town and you ca n't buy these in the stores they are very nice leaves some smaller but most very nice sized excellent for thai food i froze mine so i should have enough to last at least a year	2
1	we just tried this excellent cheese sampler package the quality is superb and i have just ordered their 4 pound package the cheeses are of excellent quality you cant go wrong an excellent buy 5 star rated	2
1	finally a company that cares about it 's reputation and products ! i ordered these truffles and recieved them securely packaged and protected to ensure they arrived safely and as quickly as possible i am even planning a special dinner with friends entirely based around the truffles i ordered as i was so please with them i also saw the other products this company carries the attention to detail and the information provided on each and every product is outstanding just like their quality \( i e saffron \) i have found my gourmet source from now on !	2
1	i 've used this to produce batch after batch of great sprouts with no issues the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is that the instructions are confusing and contradictory	2
0	i have liked other hot pockets like the ham and cheese is not bad if you spread some mustard on them but i think they over spiced the pizza hot pockets they taste kind of strong and weird	2
1	this matcha green tea powder is delicious ! it does come slightly pre sweetened so people who do not wish to consume any sugar may need to be aware also sometimes the package has mo cha on the label which is 'chinese' for green tea \( exactly the same as matcha green tea \) i used this powder to make a green tea smoothie frappe and it tasted great highly recommend	2
1	ordered for christmas and it came very quickly was a great gift to give with very quality items in the basket	2
1	this glitter looks great on cookies frosted or not ! i love it ! thanks	2
1	teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that this is a moderately price matcha tea so do n't except the best flavor it is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks desserts broth etc real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet if you do n't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice	2
1	i like pasta and tomatoes are used in the sauce i put on pasta so i like tomatoes	2
0	i ordered this product expecting at least a pound of candy there is no information on the bag to tell you the amount you are getting but it is not near a pound each jelly bean is separately wrapped to make it look like more and when you get in at them they do not taste good you are probably used to jelly bellies but these are not jelly bellies there flavor is medium at best i would not buy this product again	2
1	i had this stuff almost every day while living in chile for 2 years let me tell you there is almost no comparison with the non fat milk we drink here in the states this stuff is way better do n't quote me on this but i heard that nido is n't 100 non fat that being the case it does n't keep as long as non fat powdered milk but i might be wrong at any rate it 's worth it if you really want to make it taste good just add a little bit of sugar to sweeten it up	2
1	this is a great linguisa ! i usually buy mine from a store a few towns away because they have 'hot' chorizo sausage but these have a really great flavor even though they are not 'hot' and they are organic the fat content is minimal when microwaving for a fast high protein snack yet it 's high enough to use only the meat to coat the pan when adding it to scrambled eggs and the price is good too free shipping and handling with a nominal purchase makes this a really good buy i highly recommend it	2
0	these noodles have a terrible squidy texture and a wholly unpleasant smell they cook strangely and taste odd	2
1	i love chocolate and always buy the 70 on up variety 's so i looked forward to trying these i expected some bitterness but these tasted \( when eaten raw \) like burnt chocolate nuts i still prefer to eat them this way though	2
1	i loved the vanilla beans sent by jr mushrooms they price was great and the quality was equal to more expensive beans	2
1	i do n't even like tea but these candies are delicious on first taste they 're a little bitter and weird tasting as you absorb the green tea powder coating as you continue eating the candy it develops into a chewy tasty gummy type candy very tasty and definitely grows on you ! one warning they 're not a healthy snack so watch out how many the you and the kids eat	2
1	this was my dad 's absolute favorite candy he loved orange and bittersweet chocolate best of any flavors and this was for him a match made in heaven i adore it as well after my dad passed away i found a stash of them in his cupboard they are n't easy to find but they make a most welcome after dinner sweet with coffee for guests	2
1	i originally bought this small container of fleur de sel for a fish recipe i found that said it was de rigeur however i thought it was like any other salt simply grainier of course i only added a little bit of salt after i had grilled my fish and did not think it would add much to the dish can you imagine my surprise when i tasted the fish only to have a veritable bouquet of flavour explode in my mouth i must say that i'm never going to use commercial salt on my food anymore now i understand why the great chefs of the past and present consider this the queen of all salts	2

1	this is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience the taste is barley sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste the aftertaste is very mild and fresh green tea is touted for its health benefits not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight ! ! green tea averages about 10 30 mg of caffeine as opposed to 90 mg in a cup of coffee tazo does not put how much caffeine is in their tea on the box	2

1	the scent of this tea brewing is a real wake me up cinnamon nutmeg allspice and orange peel are some of the very redolant flavors the cinnamon is so strong that it gives a slight burning feeling in the mouth one of my favorite things about this tea i'm not a huge tea drinker but i really enjoy this in winter it 's great for mulling things as well apples pears and wine my only complaint is that it is not 100 reliant on chopped ingredients and there are some flavors added but it 's still incredibly good and nice for a thoughtful morning or evening makes me miss seattle wa and pike place market	2

1	this has a wonderfully intense ginger flavor without managing to be overwhelming i cannot speak about its effectiveness in combatting motion sickness though it did do a good job settling an upset stomach that being said whatever ends up getting you interested in this product whether it be the flavor or the other properties of ginger this is definitely a candy you will want in your candy dish desk etc my only suggestion is to buy more than one at a time because the flavor is so good that you will go through these rather quickly	2
1	i really love this tea it is my every morning tea it has the very green \( fresh \) taste of the tea served in japan that is distinctive of japanese tea alone for this reason it is not necessarily for those who prefer the taste of chinese green tea and there is a big difference between the two because its flavor is definitely characteristic of japanese green tea the color is beautiful almost as green as the twice as expensive gyokuro variety i have reordered this tea many times and expect to keep ordering it as long as the price remains close to its present price	2
1	clark 's teaberry gum became the rage in the 1960s when herb alpert and the tijuana brass played the teaberry shuffle originally produced by the d l clark company who got their fame with the clark bar the gum is a pittsburgh favorite for over 100 years the mild flavor is somewhere between wintermint and a very faint touch of cinnamon that somehow gives it a bit of a tea taste it is a very sublte flavore which is to me much more refreshing than the extra strong gums from the other guys there is also a sugar free variet	2

1	i am a plus size person 6' tall with 69 hips and within the 400 weight limit this chair fits me perfectly and feels so sturdy ! i did a lot of research trying to find a chair that would accomodate me and my friends and this is the one ! i will be buying more ! the manufacturer of the chair states that a 300 pound person can use this chair and it will withstand vigorous use we work in conjunction with str labs to develop and administer destructive testing of our products our reality check is for a travelchair product to withstand twice the force exerted by the recommended weight limit in an agressive situation	10
1	these are great cards they can be bent and even get wet and the are still good as new they are easily cleaned with a damp cloth perfect for the avid card player	10
1	i have had many backpacks for school and am always left wanting more space i like to have different places to put different materials this gives me the opportunity to do so i like the fact that i can put my ipod in a section that is not likely to recieve the weight of the many books i use i would say that the area where you hold the smaller items such as pens and calculators is nice you have dividers where you can hold many different things overall this is the best pack for school i have come across	10
1	i am very happy with this product it 's made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it i had initially rated this product with 1 star because it was twisting up so much that it became too short to jump over but my brother fiddled with it and discovered that \( unlike the rope in the picture \) there should be a gap of the plastic rope so that it 's not right up against the handle so now i would give this product a 4 star rating because the manual should have mentioned it \( and the sellers should have known that \)	10
1	i had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses the hugger mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it does n't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip	10
0	i bought it given reviews by others but my one must have been faulty coz it worked for about 1 second after installing it and it has n't worked ever since i 'd suggest any would be buyer pay a bit more for something that works	10
0	i got this heart rate monitor and the strap was way too small so i had to order a replacement strap when i went to change the strap the battery was dead the battery lasted only 1 week so i had to buy 2 new batteries one for the watch and one for the chest strap and now there is a line of pixels out on the screen of the watch i am going to get a forerunner those seem allot better i was very disappointed with this my suunto dive computer is great this hrm sucks	10
1	i have recently purchased this item i think that it is cheaper to by the new tube than buying patches for holes in a tube	10
0	i was surprised by what i got this flashlight is not bright at all especially when used as a lantern i could hardly see the other side of my living room	10
1	this is a better stroller than the other three \( all for one child \) strollers we have very maneuverable and adjustable it turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently folds down very quickly it 's great that the kids can sit next to each other	10
1	i'm serious about acqua aerobics and the upper body workout i can get by using these high resistance water gloves the unique velcro closure is a great improvement over other types which were a struggle to get on and off wish they had a medium choice of size they only make a s and a l these gloves were a great find and the price was right	10
0	well i got through about a clip and a half before it started breaking first it went from semi auto to uncontrolled auto then it just stopped working it was pretty cool for a bit and is pretty light and easy to set up but i 'd suggest looking somewhere else for a pistol	10
0	this is a piece of junk spring broke constantly resets itself and after less than a month it completely gave out do n't waste your money	10
0	i recently purchased this item and with the first nite of rainfall it crashed down the cheap metal sides were bent and it became useless a waste of over three hundred dollars	10
0	the jacket works well for shedding water which is n't really losing positive weight the pants rip during the first work out i 've purchased two of these hoping in good faith that the pants woould n't rip but they did save your money unless you just want to jacket	10
0	i can do this without the system it 's simple why do n't you get a pair of 20 pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups trust me it works i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying anything	10
0	after only one or two uses the heads of the clubs began breaking off from the shafts rending themselves completely useless i'm very disappointed as i have another set of cougar clubs that has performed well for the past 2 years i would not recommend buying this set of clubs	10
1	just like the ones used in college intra murals excellent stitching and look to be very durable fast shipping and great deal	10
1	there were a few minor imperfections but i'm overall happy with this sword the attention to detail and replication of cloud 's weapon are commendable	10
1	fantastic product i am a group fitness instructor and i use this product everyday i add a banana peanut or cashew butter plain yogurt ice and water this is in lieu of dinner i do n't get hungry and it really keeps my energy levels up	10
0	it was flat after one night of sleeping we had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning also be aware that you need an ac outlet to pump it up it 's not for camping	10
1	it 's actually called a tent organizer and it works fantastic just hang it from any tent pole and fill it up with whatever you do n't want on the ground toilet kit socks towels etc what a great idea	10
1	i 've had ab sonic for three years i bought it at target it 's great it allows me to have a productive workout while i'm working overtime to be productive	10
1	found the edge 284 easy to asemble and use it was less expensive than comparable models i checked out at 2 large fitness stores in my area and i did n't have to figure out how to get it home it was delivered for free	10
0	impossible to get off after a good work out just not for me	10
1	i would just like to tell everyone who did n't understand the use of this item they are n't actually anti gravity boots ! they are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling so in other words you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar they are in no way meant to make you float or fly or anything else that can only be found in sci fi magazines	10
0	tent leaks in multiple places including door seam back panel and through seams on rainfly ! this is not normal condensation \( i promise \) but leaks that resulted in two bath towels and one sleeping bag getting soaked the tent was set up according to instructions with rainfly secure and failed to keep its occupants \( 2 adults and a three year old \) dry during a rain made for a miserable experience	10
0	i just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap but there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate what is it for i can twist without it anyway 10 mins after using the machine i got a severe knee injury i didnt have an injury before using it but i got one now i am going to have to get rid of it	10
0	well it was shown as a full tang double bladed katana but after buying the item and checking it out for myself i have found its nothing more than a rat tailed show piece as far as show pieces go it does look nice however its not the full tang construction i was expecting to see and feel when i bought it fast shipping though	10
1	i have used the bottle to take tasty beverages with me on the road while playing sports to drink while i am in class the bottle washes easily in the dishwasher the narrower profile fits easily in cup holders i highly reccommend the n gen it is much larger than 24 oz if you fill it all the way to the top you have nearly a quart of capacity it is the best functioning and looking drink bottle on the market you can also use the bottle as i have to pack small items which you want to be slightly more secure while traveling by air and also keeping some items out of the rain in your backpack	10
1	i purchased the light and medium resistance bands over a month ago and they are still going strong ! i use them a couple times a week during my pilates workout and they work perfect	10
0	i found these gloves to be ok for short rides but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful i actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying granted these are mtn biking gloves i do n't understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand i 've tried to break them in but after a dozen or more rides they are still stiff	10
1	these bands were recommended by our son 's summer camp and we were quite skeptical about them but they seem to be working very well and are comfortable to wear our son likes them much better than the sprays and smelly lotions that we used to use and never really worked before using these bands his legs and arms were covered with bites we are very pleased with them and highly recommend them to others	10
1	by wife and i bought both the men and womens model they were a great buy arrived on time and were easy to assemble they 're comfortable to ride and seem to be well built enjoy	10
1	this bike computer tells you all the things you really need to know without giving you a whole bunch of stuff that would only complicate its use it is simple to install works great is easy to navigate and is actually kind of fun to use i love being able to get a small report of my bike ride like average speed distance etc and when i'm whipping down the trail i really like to look down and see how fast i'm going or get other statistics without having to stop and push a bunch of buttons	10
0	terrible as a musical toy my daughter liked the colors but that was pretty much it it is difficult to squeeze the feet too cute as a stuffed animal	10
0	it has n't broken yet but it is going to eventually i'm 5'10 180lbs and these things barely support me and do n't provide a stable grip these would be fine for a smaller woman but thats really it the pvc construction is n't adequate i thoguht they were metal when i bought htem but was obviously mistaken	10
1	after a several uses the anti fog starts to fail at the beginning when it is band new it works great ! clear and sharp i always wash it with water and hand soap after swimming to clean up the clorine still the anti fog inner layer wears out quickly the good thing is that it does n't leak that 's the important part over all it 's still a great product compare to other models if not because of the poor anti fog thing i would have give it a 5 stars rating	10
0	these clubs are a waste of money the graphite shafts from cougar in a senior flex that is way uncontrollable unless u are 75 my 8 iron broke the first time i hit it the bag is falling apart save ur money and buy a quality set of clubs u can get some clone clubs that will last years and u 'll play twice as better for just a tad more	10
1	loved this mat ! great for taller yogis great tickness too a bit slippery but after a couple of sessions it wears offi totally recommend it !	10
0	other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason over 65 of the decks are marked and unusable that means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be ok for poker play \( unless you 're lucky \) i have purchase casino used cards before and honestly they are not worth the trouble	10
0	i bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning i had to order another inner tube then on the third day of trying to use this stroller the front wheel completely bent what a piece of garbage i only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all i was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb the other thing i did n't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang put a diaper bag i sent this stroller back and bought a maclaren double stroller	10
1	this is a great skateboard ramp for kids who are really into skateboarding if space is an issue this is a great product it is very sturdy for any type of skateboarding tricks i would recommend having an adult present at all times when folding the ramp because it is very heavy the wheels on the side make it very portable my boys are 13 and 11 and they love it	10
0	this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit what it does n't say is that you really get a workout no matter what incline it is in it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil if you want a strenuous workout then this unit is for you if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface then this is not the unit for you	10
1	my husband and i purchased this bike to replace my 4 year old son 's 12inch toddler bike our son loves that the bike looks like a big kid 's bike with it 's hand brake i was concerned that my son would n't be able to squeeze the hand brake hard enough to make it work but he has had no problems ! in addition the bike still allows him to brake the more traditional way by pushing the pedals backwards this bike will be a great transition into the next level of bikes with gears and hand brakes !	10
0	the suit will make you sweat if that 's what you are looking to do i had rivers running out of my sleeves and pant legs but the pants tore within weeks on the inside seam i was using the suit about 5 times a week with a vigorous treadmill routine it will likely last longer and be fine for occasional recreational uses but buy something more substantial for a serious workout you truly do get what you pay for	10
0	i was very excited to order this bike as i started to put it together i noticed that some of the prepackaged parts for assembly were missing ! i still attempted assembly and noticed that pre drilled holes were n't even close to being inline with the display ! the largest drawback and thing that upset me was that i did n't pay close enough attention when purchasing this it is does not allow for adjustment from seat to pedals i'm 6'3 tall and not being able to adjust for my height makes this completely unusable	10
1	works great used it to drain the oil in my 2005 vw beetle tdi	10
1	backpack just what i expected and i got it really quickly thanks	10
1	the thule 450 foot pack is quick and easy to install fast delivery on a scale from 1 to 10 this whole transaction is a 10	10
1	do you even know what you are talking about \? i may be a kid but i have been airsofting for 5 years now 350 fps is nothin my ak47 airsoft gun goes over 410 next time please know what you are talking about before you give a bad review	10
0	the day we received the stroller we were very excited we put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction however when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming we have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company i would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time	10
1	blackburn racks are getting harder to find but they are still at the top of the pile in terms of build quality and strength weight i have had blackburn racks on a couple bikes over the years and never had a complaint one is still going strong after 20 years highly recommended	10
1	very very good stroller ! and very convinient too this stroller can be used on different type of terrains and is very maneuravabble the only thing that i do n't like is that the seat cannot recline or can be made straighter my husband tried to work something out but the thing is that the manufacturer have n't thought about it	10
1	i bought this product to use during my camping trips i had a minor issue with my order but was corrected immediately great customer service this is a really neat hammock it packs really small but is very resistant my friends loved it when they saw it and it was really easy to set up you will enjoy it whether you go camping or on your backyard	10
0	it really deserves a 0 rating non skid surface is a joke it is slick as glass tripod dog could not get any traction with single hind leg golden slipped off side and hurt her leg learn from my mistake there is nothing positive to say about this product	10
0	i would n't recommend this shuffler to anyone it shuffles more from one side than the other when through shuffling on the left side the right side is only half through the cards will jam in the tray stopping the rest of the cards from coming down the switch just works part time you have to stop and restart several times	10
1	we got this bike for our 4 year old and it is sturdy and rugged enough to last the next few years the assembly instructions looked intimidating at first but since many pieces are already pre assembled you can skip most of them it was a lot easier than anticipated the only reason why i gave it 4 stars it had a deep scratch paint chip on the frame but since i got this during a sale for a great price and considering it was needed the next day we kept it anyway	10
0	i cant say anything for the other things but the compass does not work at all north is always changing and if you move it to see if north will remain the same north does does not i was looking for a simple compass keychain this is small and a keychain but a compass that works it is not	10
0	my husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it they were so disappointed \( this has now happened twice ! ! ! ! ! fyi the first one we inflated and it deflated within days \( slow leak \) what a waste ! it is so heavy that it would cost 20 to mail it back for a replacement do n't bother	10
1	does this gun use 6mm or 12 and if i do use 12s will it damage the firing mechanisim	10
1	i 've been shot by many other airsoft guns but this one really packs a punch my back looked like it had measles after fully automatic the automatic really drains the battery quick though and when its dead it will scare you that you broke it but no it 's just the dead battery the metal gear box is extremely reliable and helps it shoot fast this gun is a little overwhelming when looking at it to assemble but be patient it 's actually easier than it looks i highly recommend this gun	10
1	i love my jansport odyssey backpack it has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack i have ever owned or tried i have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack ca n't be beaten for tranporting books a little more padding in the straps \( or smaller textbooks \) would make it perfect but it is still better than anything i have seen out there i would highly recommend it to any high school or college student	10
1	very nice good coverage of light lights can always be brighter in my opinion easy installation and good battery life	10
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
1	this litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions it 's collapsable strong light and easy to use i wish the price was under but the best price i could find was on amazon com and it 's what my wife wanted and loves we also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly a good product ! !	10
0	as the previous reviewer said i can see this being passable as a one player score keeper but do n't make a mistake it 's impossible to correct if it is possible i do n't know how as there are no directions using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical with the buttons the way they are its going to get bumped and errors made and you probably wo n't even know it just a horrible design and a waste of money	10
1	i am very pleased with this product it is good quality easy to use and well worth the money	10
0	when one trips the safety key one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again this action looses all the time and distance information the keys fitness who manufactures ironman and a bunch of others help line confirmed that this is normal for their products i see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body	10
1	we already have a few of these but not enough to go around they are a lot of fun and hold up well a good buy	10
1	its weighted and feels quite real it only holds 40 bbs unlike said in the product review buy a bunch of these at the same time because this company has outrageous shipping charges i recommend taping two together \( facing different directions \) to reduce reloading time in a match	10
1	gloves are toasty perform as expected and are a sweet luxury after a long cold day on the slopes however the d sized batteries \( 1 per glove \) are considerably more bulky than what i expected most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 aa batteries but no just one bit fat chicken roastin' d sized battery good product but consider whether wearing the big ol' d 's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves or whether you 'll barely notice being bundled up and bulkified anyway may also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it 's really nippy out	10
1	this swim cap is easy to use and thick enough that i ca n't imagine it ever ripping or tearing	10
0	you can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride because of the adapter it only charges while its on the machine there is no seperate battery charger	10
0	initially a very good buy however after only 3 days of very light use i had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk and i was in another room for the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case	10
0	and buy a gps instead i agree with previous reviewer \( dave57 \) i would never buy a suunto again worst than dave i simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my vector was full of water could n't even tell the time i send it to suunto finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and kindly offered a repair for 140 euros	10
1	this yakima roof rack system works great and i highly recommend it i bought one for my mazda 3 and have use it along with a yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips \( i live a florida skiing is far away \) the rack has n't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car	10
0	this item is horrible ! it is flimsy and did n't even come with any instructions even though it was so cheap i feel so ripped of	10
1	sword looks awesome ! very heavy and cool blade is strong but not sharp for collector purposes handle and point where blade connects to hilt is very shaky but can be fixed quickly overall sword and scabbard are very realistic and cool looking	10
1	these gloves are pretty good gloves if you 're wanting to get started in boxing or working out with heavy bags this is the way to go they are very traditional yet slip on design	10
0	these knives are terrific unless you actually want to use them i threw these knives into soft pine wood and they bent like crazy one of them bect almost 180 degrees ! if you want to throw these into something softer \( like pillows \) these may work but do n't expect to throw these into wood	10
0	i was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat i got neither it is pretty but that is about it	10
0	i consider my dogs to be small they are all around 25 pounds i have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and i still feel like they are a little bit too big i think that for a small backpack that they are just too large thank you	10
0	overall poor quality in craftsmanship one can clearly see the glue that holds the gold trim in place and on mine the trim on the handles was loose and could be easily removed the wood is of subpar quality as well the price is low however i would not recommend these swords	10
0	nothing against these particular paddles but avoid cheap paddles if you splurge on any item in your kayak budget it should be the paddles if you paddle you will develop a close relationship with your paddles it can either be a good one or a bad one you can markedly improve your paddling experience with a relatively small increase in spending good paddles will make you want to use your kayak	10
0	i bought these skates last year with the plans of putting outdoor wheels on them when i tried to take the wheels off they would n't budge ! spend the extra 50 on a pair of quality skates that you can keep for years when the indoor wheels on these die the skates die too these most definitely are not roller derby skates since those girls change their wheels all the time !	10
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
1	it had special meaning for me because when my two daughters were little \( they are now in their late 30s \) i taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they did n't flush i caught them both with the toilet monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences it is more funny than scary though it does give you a start when you first open the lid	10
1	this is a great exercise ball it is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines let me tell you ! ! ! it is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and i can really feel my muscles working out it helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility this is a great product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	10
0	horrible the trampoline came in with 3 out of the 6 legs missing this is the second product form stamina that came in damaged i would not recomend to anyone	10
0	i guess you get what you pay for this pedometer was difficult to calibrate and continued to miscount steps and therefore distance covered it is made of plastic and came unclipped easily i am a big person and have started walking to improve my health this product does not work for me although it might be a different story for a slim person it has been relegated to the junk drawer and probably will eventually be thrown away i 'll have to find another that works better and purchase it	10
1	the product itself is good and feels safe when i use it the assembly instructions could use some help but i eventually figured out what the pictures meant	10
1	i purchased three of these units to mount in a utility trailer they did a great job on the trip of holding our bikes rock steady very easy to get the bikes in and out of great product	10
0	for 20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking jogging with a bonus pedometer the radio has no channel display and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial then a scan button when walking it loses the station occasionally luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial but if yours is n't this could be terribly annoying as for the pedometer it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when i was holding it perfectly still thus worthless i'm sending it back	10
1	this is a must have for anyone interested in boxing or boxing fitness everlast is the most trusted brand in boxing history established in 1910 they are a quality company that specializes in boxing equipment take it from an owner of an everlast heavy bag they are great and very durable and can withstand lots of punishment great for any teen young male or old tymer tryin to get his groove back	10
1	i was actually surprised at how much this bike exceeded my expectations it 's more than quiet it 's silent very good resistance settings and even a nice variety of programs the bike is sturdy and easy to put together it 's compact and does n't take up a lot of room and the seat is also quite comfortable i could n't be more happy with this purchase for those concerned about the shipping issues that were raised my box had a dent or two but the contents were fine and there were no missing parts	10
1	the thule sidekick was the perfect size not too big not too small it did not appear clunky big on top of the car nor was it too small to fit anything in the assembly was a snap \( did it with only one person no problem \) it withstood freeway speeds in oregon rain without even letting a drop of moisture into the box highly recommended	10
0	got the mat for free for ordering the series 7 treadmill and while putting the mat under my treadmill it ripped it is made by this rubbery plastic and it 's just okay i would n't pay 100 for it it 's true but i was very disappointed that it ripped so easily not very durable but i got mine for free so i guess i was n't too surprised it was given away	10
0	the suggested 1 to 2 drops does n't sweeten and more makes coffee bitter	10
1	this was the first toy my son picked up and put in his mouth at 3 months i think he liked it because it is very light and easy to grab on to he has found it so entertaining and i especially appreciated that in his first months when there was n't a lot i could do with him now i try to include it with all of my baby shower gifts !	10
1	the ultrastar is a classic disc wonderful to throw and catch i personally feel that ultrastars vary based on the color but i just may be imagining things these fly better than the average whammo although i feel that i can throw 180g innova pulsars a little bit further still the ultrastar has more curvature and has a nice stable flight pattern i 've thrown the adidas 175g as well and while that is not as bad as a beat up whammo it 's still not quite the same	10
1	combining the simple easy workout with the eating plan my body changed what seemed like instantly i highly recommend this i m on week 5 and have already dropped two pants sizes	10
0	received the order in a timely fashion however the box was badly i mean badly damaged it was a birthday gift for a family member i always order early mistake returns are 30 days we had the party 45 days later when we opened the box rust went on the carpet did you ever try to get rust out of off white carpeting to make things even worse it was missing all the hardware for putting it together probably fell out of the hole in the box that was there before they shipped it to me happy birthday ! ! ! ! ! ! and your welcome for the carpet stain all new things come rusty you did n't know that	10
1	great product has a nice spin \( \) \( \) d	10
1	does n't look like the typical lunch bag that a child would carry and does a great job of keepin cold food cold even without ice	10
0	i returned this item as it did n't fit my 19 pound boston terrier well at all it was way too large for his body small obviously means small for a larger dog instead just be aware !	10
0	i ordered 2 of these pedometers and neither of them count steps accurately one only counts about half the steps i take and the other is usually 2500 steps behind that i wore them both for a week and got the same results everyday i could understand if one did n't work properly but i got 2 at the same time with the same problem i would not recommend this product	10
0	the attachment is n't textured enough to stay where i put it as i ride the entire assembly slowly spins around the handle under my hand	10
0	i saw another mini microphone it got one star the review was telling me it was horable if i were you i would get the maga phone one the top of the list type in maga phone in the search and you will find the list do not get this ! ! ! ! !	10
0	this fitness mat is thick and cushy but i find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it 's about a foot too short my biggest complaint is that the 'washable' cover \( a major reason i selected this product \) shrank to a completely unusable size when i washed it \( in cold water line dried \) now i'm left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable	10
0	this unit is amazingly heavy given that it is mostly mesh the poles are not super high quality and i would imagine are going to break is used a lot i used this in some high winds and the zippers broke	10
1	i purchased this snorkel equipment for a vacation in aruba and i used it for 4 days of snorkeling i had always rented snorkel gear before and this was the first time i decided to purchase a set i am very pleased with this purchase the fins are fantastic the design of this fin from us divers with the split in the middle makes it extremely easy to move through the water it 's a great design feature ! the snorkel mask was comfortable and it never leaked the set also comes with a great blue and gray backpack that you can store all of your gear in	10
0	after ridding a only a couple of times this bike began to fall apart the brakes were faulty to begin with which were repaired soon after purchase while ridding on an easy trail the seat broke off half way through the ride with out a seat i had to walk the bike back to the car i advise extra caution for first time bikers and do a check to make sure all the components are working	10
1	we purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the keys the dvd gave her a good overview of how to use the mask snorkel the mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out this was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for	10
1	i own an older version of this net it is about 10 years old and has been used once week every summer it was used in a high level volleyball league but it would be great for recreational use as well i paid 200 for the net and it is still like new i ca n't believe this is selling for 69 get it now	10
1	my son was very happy with the product good quality and well worth the money	10
0	i think they are too stiff for comfort i do like the short finger but the material over the back of the hand is too stiff i thought it would stretch out and soften a bit but it has n't protects the hands well through off road trails though	10
1	a standard 5' bar not sure how accurate the weight is it feels more than 13 pounds but that could just be me not a big deal either way	10
1	i bought my son and daughter a pair of these shoes for christmas i have a hard time getting them to wear regular shoes anymore they love to wear them everywhere they go great way to get the kids physically active !	10
0	bought it 2 months ago for in door usage thought it 'd last until the end of the semester after less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage punctures started to appear and the patches that came along with the package did n't help much even though the design and the built in manual pump is a big plus the quality is very disappointing	10
0	the set up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load but when used in a 2 in hitch it wobbles like crazy ! i was a nervous wreck just driving across town watching our bikes sway 45 degrees on every right turn i had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right but it 's just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch	10
1	this little device is easy to put together and easy to use not for 'intensive' workouts however you can pretty much use it anyplace you 're sitting down that could mean even while the tv is on ! like all exercise equipment if you do n't use it you lose it	10
0	the following were the problems 1 bent fender poor packaging2 sratches in paint in several areas3 three nuts were missing4 the front wheel hub had lateral play cannot be fixedplanning to return cycle if amazon accepts it	10
0	i never got to use the product upon opening i realized the sizing details on amazon 's website was different than the one on the box i am 5'5 and the 65cm was too big for me although amazon states it 's just my size	10
0	i bought this for my niece thinking it would be a plug and play version of the video game this has nothing to do with the real dance dance revolution game other than being a cheaply made imitation and using their name which is not on the actual product very disappointed !	10
0	i bought this for my 5 yr old and he ca n't even get it on his head he wears other youth bike helmets so i would n't recommend this item unless it 's for a 2 3 yr old now i have to pay half the price in return shipping	10
0	i purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine unfortunetly the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical i would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment	10
1	the drishti yoga strap is just great ! i 've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga \( several different studios borrowed friends' etc \) this one is excellent it 's 2 feet longer than standards straps but it 's offered at the same price as standard straps what a deal ! it 's also thick and sturdy i would certainly recommend this product	10
1	this is exactly what i wanted ! i 've had so many slipping problems in my ashtanga yoga class both my hands and feet would slide and it was soooo hard to hold poses here is the answer ! it works great ! i'm very happy	10
0	i received the exercise bike put it together as soon as i got it and started using it just looking at it i had second thoughts about buying it ten minutes later it broke some part in this cheaply made product broke on the inside i contacted the guys who sold this to me to get my money back but they never got back to me one more thing even if it had n't broken the resistance setting on this thing is horrible you get absolutely no resistance on it that means no workout	10
1	i had this set up in my daughter 's crib when she was a baby it would light up the room just enough for her to feel comfortable but not so much that it kept her awake the music is very soothing and not as cartoony as you would think the unit would turn itself off after a period of time so i would n't have to creep back into the room hoping not to wake her this is a wonderful crib toy i would recommend it for any newborn especially those who have a hard time falling asleep	10
0	i ordered 2 of these flimsy tables they were not only expensive to ship but one arrived damaged the one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully meaning that people 's drinks would slide off the table these are the most flimsy tables i have ever encountered if it were n't for the replacement tables i found at costco the party i planned would have been a disaster	10
0	one of the handles would not go in the digital unit did not work and had no instructions on how to work it and when i would use the unit the little keeper ring on the side would cut into the side of the housing and cause some drag or friction they told me to send it back for a replacement and i'm still waiting and waiting ! ! ! so i would rate this unit a 0 how do i get my monies back \? \? \?	10
1	i 've had this gun a little over a mounth now and it still works great do n't bother useing the scope though it 's a peace of junk the guns not acurit enough for it anyway this gun is great for mid range rapid fire do n't get this gun if u want a sharpshooter the folding stock was broken when i got it but a little bit of vel crow fixed that easy the strap also broke but a zip tie fixed it do n't get me wrong this it a tugh gun it 's been drop banged up and runs like new so yea get it ! ! ! !	10
0	i went to swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others this is the only pole they have which is n't saying much for the brand but i found that the suggested retail is 4 lower to what amazon is selling it for just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price even though amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap probably too cheap to be any good	10
0	this gun is a very bad gun ! ! ! ! ! if you are from the ages of 6 10 i would get it but if not dont i got 2 of these the first 1 broke rit away and the other only shoots 15 feet trust me this gun is a piece of junk just poket to shipping and buy something else ! !	10
0	this is a useless product i do not exercise much and i do not even get a burn from this machine the dvd is boring and the instructor speaks in a mono tone it looks like it is low budget !	10
0	well first of all i ordered this product on amazon and they sent me something completely different they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades i ask for like in the picture then when i sent an e mail trying to exchange the product no one returns my calls or e mails me back after so long of trying it 's already past the 30 day exchange policy so yeah if you want a better review contact me so i can exchange the product	10
0	i received the net missing a pole which you obviously need to erect the net properly but i was particularly disappointed in the net and its ability to stop a golf ball it no more stopped a driven golf ball than drapped toilet paper ! unless you hit the nylon target you have lost a ball ! i may as well hang the nylon target alone from a tree and the results will be the same if i miss the target	10
1	i live on a large college campus and have had my bikes stolen before but with this lock i have n't had anyone even try to steal it it 's not as heavy as i thought it would be \( a plus \) and it is pretty small so it can fit in just about any larger pocket it feels solid and looks strong too i would definitely buy this lock again if ever need be	10
1	i bought this for my 10 year old grandson it is an unusual ride took him a while to catch on but he is really enjoying it now that he has mastered it	10
1	this product is wonderful ! it sure helps my son rest comfortably with a variety of music we received this when he was a newborn and he is now 2 5 years old and still loves it we keep it right next to his twin bed so he can turn it on whenever he wants and since he knows how to change the music he is in control of what he wants to hear	10
1	i love my broncos bagit is very comfortable to wear and has lots of roo	10
0	the goal arrived at my house assembled wrong then after it was fixed be me i successfully put it together which was relativly easy after several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net that is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak the weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post overall this is probably not a good buy	10
0	we registered for two of these mobiles for our twins we recieved both of them upon putting them together we realized that the mobile ca n't operate without the pieces hitting the bar that holds it to the crib ! how annoying ! we returned them both	10
0	did not come with supressor or laser and the sight broke within 3 shots do not bu	10
0	the padding is too bulky toward the knuckels there is no padding on the fingers the gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves	10
0	i bought both the ark iii and the super ark the super ark is a slight improvement over the ark iii but i would never recommend people buy either one there are far better entry level kits for just a few dollars more available from other sources the ark iii contains 24 oz of water a food bar and a small inexpensive emergency blanket in a kleenex sized cardboard box i 'll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits i subsequently purchased i'm surprised and disappointed amazon carries these products	10
0	i bought this watch because i wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size it is huge looked like i had a clock on my wrist take into consideration	10
1	great flooring system easy to assemble and very strong expensive but worth it	10
1	i was happy with my purchase i recieved my bearings within 6 business days the bearings were in great condition	10
1	i recently purchased the gofit 40lb weighted vest and it 's everything i hoped it would be i was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts and this vest has proved to be a good choice the weight is balanced well between front and back of my body the shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks the velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement i have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting though it does hamper some bending movements the weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter i am well pleased with my purchase	10
1	these are fantastic belts for teaching children how to swim they offer mobility and support and have the ability to lessen the support as time goes on i taught swimming for years and this is the product i 'd recommend	10
1	this product does what it claims it will do put in the time and effort you 'll feel great ! of course i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box however i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it	10
1	this item is such a great value everything included is a basic necessity for anyone interested in getting into boxing i suggest this set as your first purchas	10
0	i wish i 'd read the reviews for this piece of junk before buying it i had the same problem many other reviewers here had after using it for about an hour a day for less than two weeks the cable snapped rendering it useless this is just a poor quality machine plain and simple	10
0	i bought this exact one maybe a year ago about 2 months later it just collapses set up is not the onlt thing that is hard actully trying to get a high jump is very difficult this is a little kids toy but most little kids do n't just like baby bounces do they \? i would not recommend this trampoline to anybody	10
0	small print on box charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the ac charger adapter and approximately 12 20 hours using the 12v car adapter the spotlight lantern cannot be used while charging a full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power 30 minutes after charging for 15 hours \? what the heck is the point of this flashlight	10
1	i got this for my daughter awhile ago but due to no snow i had to wait to actually see if it worked well it did ! nicely made and durable daughter loved it	10
0	do n't be fooled by the positive posts i am convinced they are bogus this is just a cheaply made toy at adult prices	10
0	do not do not do not do not buy any products from the weslo company i just received my weslo cadence c44 treadmill and have attempted to assemble it the handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console the customer service numbers are all disconnected their website gives an additional number to call and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you i have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them this company is a complete scam if you are even considering buying one of their products your money is better spent getting your head checked	10
1	i just wanted to comment on sarah 's comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together my son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help i agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated i took it in parts after reading it fully twice after all the small parts pole height adjustment apparatus rim backboard i carried it all outside and put it togehter one picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard overall i got it done in parts total time 2 5hrs with breaks in between have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten	10
0	i just found one of these while climbing the stairs down at the track today i brought it home and looked on the net for some info about it and found these reviews when i read that people are losing this thing all the time i could believe it ! loli 'll enjoy it until it falls off and somebody else will inherit it	10
0	this bagpack is ridiculously small believe me it cannot even fit 1 college book the description did not say that it is for elementary school kids believe me this bag is for elementary school kids yes ! ! ! it is that small i'm gave it as a present to my friends cousin who goes to the elementary school i am not kidding the photo is misleading it is unbelievably small if you buy you 'll see	10
1	the item is nice but 15 for shipping on each blade is outrageous i know that if you shipped two of them together it would n't cost 15 for both of them let alone separately and everyone wonders why their items are so cheap	10
1	too long for 5 tall person i had to modify it for my wife its the same identical chair as ab lounger ablonge cair etc same manufacturere it has a sticker on it that says watch fingers while folding your ab longe 2 on it same company same chair easy to modify 'drill or saw' either way to fit short people great product wife loves it other family members buying them now 4 stars not 5 due to me needing to midifying it buy this one save money instead of ablounge	10
1	the computer is really good and installs quite easily the only problem is the setting instructions for the functions \( in 11 languages \) they are not very good \( as noted in another review i read \)	10
1	i am a 71 yrs young female i purchased these men 's skates for myself i bought a size larger and they are very comfortable as an older re learner these skates worked out just great the wheel 's do n't have speed which is what i was looking for they are indoor outdoor skates they work better for inside skating a great price and a great quality skate especially for a beginner \( the wheels \) no matter what age you are these skates are the best i love these skates	10
0	this item sounded great in the ad but the only thing right in the ad is that it 's pocket sized no one can understand what i say through it when the volume is turned up the sound becomes fuzzy and incoherent i thought this would be a great device but no one can understand me 10 feet away much less 200 if you order this device save the box it came in so you can send it back and get a refund warning the shipping is non refundable	10
0	this machine literally broke within the first 15 minutes after it had been assembled i could n't believe it my advice would be to avoid this product	10
0	i bought four of these and all of them broke within the first or second use making them completely unusable	10
0	i ordered the pogo roo pogo stick on dec 6 2006 and i am still waiting for it to be shipped they just bumped it back another month to mid may for delivery and yet if you go to the web site it says it is in stock best of luck to anyone who wants it within 6 months ! very poor service	10
0	i bought this ab roller after my chiropractor told me that i needed to strengthen my abs without straining my neck the neck support that it comes with does not support the neck or head in any way but forces all of the weight of the head onto the uppermost vertebrae of the neck ouch ! i would strongly recommend against this purchase not only does it not work properly but the foam pads were stained upon arrival gross ! i will try another model	10
1	we bought this for our 2 year old on his birthday he loves it ! his older brother \( 3 1 2 \) has the regular razor scooter but that was too difficult for our 2 year old to use as it does not stand up by itself this kiddie scooter is more balanced and as a result our son can keep up with his older brother good for the younger kids but it does not go as fast as the regular razor as a result he will most likely grow out of it in a year or two definetly worth the money though he just loves it !	10
1	it 's a nice rope with great length my only problem is it really stings if it hits you overall it is a good robe	10
1	love this knife looks great sharp as can be out of the box thin enough for the pocket of my khakis one disclaimer use the safety it opened up in my pocket once \( no clue how \) and could have been dangerous	10
1	the item was delivered quickly as advertised have not hadany problems at all the stiching was fine i would purchase again from this supplier	10
1	easy assembly great variety of equipment to train your body pretty sturdy great value for what you get only negatives are the rack arms are close together and you cant reverse the bar pins to rack the bar for easy access to do squats and military presses	10
1	i was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd 100 it recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in denali national park in alaska the weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents but the price and features make up for that it survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage the two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy the vestibules are very handy for storing your boots on colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though overall a good purchase	10
0	i purchased 5 of these for christmas presents i tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time number 1 this was dead in the box so were numbers 2 3 and 4 i did n't bother with number 5 every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested speaking of instructions they tell you to make certain the light is off before attempting to charge there is a rubber button that doesm't click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is real junk says hummer made in china and all five are going back	10
1	i bought this for my husband last year and it 's still in good condition we love it the whole family can fit under it it keeps the wind out really well due to the double layers it never ever turns inside out	10
1	i 've owned a gust buster for over 5 years now and it works great i 've had it out in the early winds of a hurricane and it worked exactly as it was intended i like the big size because it keeps the rain away from more of me than the smaller ones do mine is n't automatic so maybe that 's a problem but every automatic umbrella i 've ever owned eventually stopped working and had to be opened by hand	10
1	i have stopped at least 5 shops \( walmart sports authority target etc \) to find foosball replacements but no avail the table was acquired at a charity auction but had no balls the foosballs were shipped exactly and timely as promised and still having a lot of fun playing with family and friends	10
1	i used mine for two weeks snorkeling in hawaii it is n't perfect it does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface but it is n't enough to cause any problems it is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow you probably wo n't find anything better	10
1	bought it for daughter 's christmas gift she loves it cool color adjustable height is useful for her short height she is very proud with it bigger wheels gives a bit more stability	10
1	treated myself to a yogitoes mat and i love it ! it 's very absorbent \( great for hot yoga \) and very non skid it allows me to focus on my practice rather than the distractions of slipping feet or hands wonderful tool	10
1	i was looking for a bike trainer but did not want to spend 150 and up took a chance on this one after seeing it being sold by nashbar and performance it seems to be quite solidly constructed and holds the bike very steady and secure i got it set up in 5 minutes without any difficulty only 3 levels of difficulty but this does not seem to be much of an issue it is not too loud but also not terribly quiet about as loud as our washing machine overall for the price \( i paid 80 \) this trainer meets exceeds my expectations	10
0	the item was packaged well but it took over 15 days at normal shipping rate the lighter for it stopped working 15 minutes after it was opened anyone want the rest of this can \? what a waste of time	10
1	i have had one of these for 10 years but recently purchased a second one because i was having to move them between the rv and house this case on the newer version is so much better and the second handle is a great improvement every outdoor person or cook should have a deluxe blade trader in their set	10
1	just the perfect cap ! it fits like no other swimming cap it wo n't pull you hair when removing it neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning very resistant material and a great finish awesome colors !	10
0	i bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when i rode on vacation when i assembled the trailer the chain was twisted i bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel the sprocket was badly bent i bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel by the time i got it all working my vacation was over by the time i see my granddaughter again she 'll have her own bike i'm going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to	10
0	this machine is too easy even with the additional resistance bands it 's just not enough if you 're an active person at all the assisted crunch funtion is a joke and most of the moves are just as effective without the machine i used it every day for a month \( until i felt i 'd gotten my money 's worth \) now it collects dust i 'd sell it for 20 at this point just to get it out of my house i see my easy shaper becoming a goodwill donation in the very near future	10
0	i received this trike with 3 flat tires the 12 inch tire tube needed to be replaced the valve in the other two tires were defective and had to be replaced	10
0	i wish the review written in january was posted before i bought this thing i bought this as a present and the exact thing happened the cable snapped after only 2 weeks of use the ad states it holds 250lbs but when you get it the item states 220 which she was still below that but the cable snapped anyway stay away from this item far far away	10
1	i bought it through the target amazon store which was cheaper than the same product through other vendors its very easy to assemble although you may want to play with the chain a bit to set up the desired tension \( by shortening the chain to belt connection which can get chain grease on you a bit \) to me it was exactly as advertised a long rowing machine that is not too quite but far less loud than expected and works well i do not fold it away after use but its a nice feature if you want to move it to another part of the house and dont want to lug an 8 foot long device	10
1	i just read the other reviewer 's comments yes the bag is n't huge but it certainly gets the job done it 's not the over sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks but it 's a bag that has style that 's why i got it it 's a bit more european in its design and is of good quality i dont expect zippers to break anytime soon look to be good quality also at this price it is such a good deal	10
0	there is nothing wrong with this product it 's how you use it we almost ruined our 300 trampoline in it 's first week by using this product we put it on our new trampoline and it fit fine it rained the next day and filled completely with rain water causing the trampoline to nearly collapse it took a huge effort to remove the water out of the trampoline cover and we have not used it since trampolines are constructed using fabric that is breathable and will let the rain run through by covering it you do n't allow it to drain unless you live in a very dry climate i do n't advise using a cover	10
1	this product is quit usefull to walk overnigth and to do works at dark sites	10
0	the brace or axle to hold the goal in an upright position was to short and could n't be used a new one had to be purchased	10
0	i bought this for my wife because of it 's low cost you get what you pay for she uses it a few times a week after a little more then a month the left pedal broke she is not overweight at all so that was n't the problem i 'll spend the money for a good one next time	10
1	great swivel action tough construction easy to remove for adding air to your speed bag worth the price	10
1	expensive but i use it for aerobic and occasional high impact exercises as well as yoga very satisfied	10
0	received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly 5 days after emailing the company they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and i must return it to them before they will send out a new box very frustrating i must drive 20 miles to the nearest ups store to return it wish i had just bought the thing at walmart	10
1	my husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state they wanted to share email address no one had a pen pencil so my husband 's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside my husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it could not find it so i did some searching on the net and bought it for his christmas gift he was so excited to receive it on christmas morning thanks	10
1	very cute skateboard ! very girly ! the only thing wrong with it is that it 's very gritty on the top which i'm assuming it 's like that so that you do n't fall off however it hurts ! ! ouch ! other than that it 's cute	10
1	i write very few reviews but i just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels i have fought this battle many years with no success i started using this stuff 3 weeks ago along with a heel sander and i only have a small scar that i suspect will go away i cannot believe the results ! ! ! i only wish i had taken pictures to proof the results ! ! but who wants to look at ugly cracked heels \? \? \? lol it works ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	10
1	this is our second set of eyeglass mirrors they are easy to use and once you get used to using them you do n't want to go anywhere without them i even find myself checking my mirror when i'm walking and do n't have it on one drawback that we 've found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent but that has n't really been an issue for us give these easy to use mirrors a try i wo n't ride without one	10
1	i paid less for this item then i would at a store and it came to me ! i did n't have to carry a heavy item out to my vehicle hassle with getting it into the trunk and drag it into the house it was right there on my door step waiting for me i love amazon	10
0	the accessories that come along with this nice are great albeit somewhat impractical \( who 's going to use a slingshot anyway \? \) but the thing that stands out most about this knife is the plastic handle survival knives with hollow handles can go either way as far as usefulness and quality but this handle has a cheap brittle feel to it that suggests easy breakage it 's not too hard to conceive that the blade could break off from the handle under enough stress which makes this blade a dangerous one to use do not buy this knife or any other knife with a hollow plastic handle	10
0	not very bright for an led and guess what \? this is about 2 1 2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy toes ! given the picture shows a spike on it one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something well the spike is more like a thumbtack i realize the images are provided by the manufacturer so i do n't blame amazon but there is no excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this	10
0	the front wheels came off the first day christmas day ! very frustrating !	10
0	these are fast but inaccurate and break easily bet bigger and more accurate bb'	10
0	we bought two fannypacks one for ourself and one for our friends who were going with us on our trip we were doing some shallow water snorkeling no diving my husband wore our fanny pack which contained his wallet and our passports our stuff got soaked ! why our friends worked we and ours did n't is anybody 's guess possibly ours had a defective seal these fanny packs have a seal just like a food storage bag and i know some of them do n't seal right !	10
1	i looked at several therapy websites to find the perfect sized ball from my 2 1 2 year old autistic son to use to bounce on everything was too big and too expensive this ball is just the right size and price and it was delivered quickly	10
1	bag is easy to carry and lightweight it is good for carrying gym clothes to school bag is somewhat hard to open	10
0	when the scope arrived it came slightly cracked on the end you look through which was n't a good start then when i looked through there was no magnification just small red crosshairs if you are looking for a functioning scope do not buy this scope but if ur looking to decorate your gun then this looks pretty cool on it	10
0	was billed by the company and they never sent it had to challenge the company to get a credit still waiting for my bill to see if credit was done	10
0	this item is a piece of junk all you get is smudges and black marks it does not work buy your balls already labeled or get a better stamper just please do n't buy this thing	10
1	my wife and i love this product now it 's not for backpacking but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove it does require one of those disposable propane tanks \( which can be tough to dispose of \) and it might make sense to get the carrying case \( not seeing it attached here \) but besides that a great simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions	10
0	this tool will not take an edge either with a grinder or a file it is very flexible so that the energy of a blow goes into flexing the blade rather than cutting stems which has undesirable consequences for your hand if you are looking for a useful tool keep looking	10
1	this gun was great when i got it i immediatly pulled it out and went to play with it good for kids just starting out with bb guns also it is n't that powerful overall this gun is great and i cant beleive it is 0 0	10
0	i enjoy the elliptical i really do especially when i first received the box it had no instruction manual ! ! ! how da heck do you expect someone to put this together !	10
0	may be okay if you take it to a climate controlled office but not much good as an outdoors job food jar	10
1	as a chef in a hot dc kitchen i have tried all manner of powder and cream with the hope of eliminating or decreasing chafing at one point i even devised a kind of rosin bag of cornstarch suspended on a string this stuff works for me and if it works for me in the hours of blistering heat and hot sweat it will work for you	10
1	this wiffle bat is light and easy to use substitue it for a whip or crop when training your young horse it will not hurt the horse but will get the horse 's attention	10
0	did n't pump any air into the tire the first 2 stomps tried it again another day 3rd stomp and the gauge went flying off put the gauge back on and it still does n't work biggest waste of money never even filled one tir	10
1	i just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and i needed a place to put the 400 lbs besides the floor the the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more the only thing i do not like is that it does bend in a little when you put the max weight on a slot but it does its job	10
0	scary looking but inpractical the wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already \( if your fists are that big you do n't need claws \) the talon shaped blades are sharp but ca n't dig in they can only scratch they even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard nice wall decor but nothing more	10
1	i really like the heart rate monitor and it works great as has been said it takes some time learning all it does but it 's worth it in my opinion the only thing i was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit but from what i have been told by others and their brands of running watches they all do this to an extent everything else i'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone the distance reading has been right on the money after calibration	10
0	this is a nice bag with a fatal flaw the major zippers break very easily after my first bag broke within a few months amazon kindly provided a free replacement deja vu ensued for a few extra dollars delta could use more robust zippers they really should	10
1	the sword itself is awesome to behold though the guard was only minorly spot welded and is loose from just a few minutes of play no i did n't hit anything blade is heavy would look good if it were not scratched so bad can be polished up if you know people to repair this i suggest you do so cool sword chinese craftsmanship should you buy it \? hell yeah	10
1	neoprene pouch keeps water cool but it has a very strong displeasing smell kind of like used motoroil which overpowers the taste of what your drinking from the bottle so you might want to pour your drink into a cup to enjoy it	10
0	i dont have this item but how can you expect this to be a good mask if the list price is 100 and they are selling it for 2 50 ! ! !	10
0	very disappointed it didnt play any music its own quiet difficult to squeeze	10
0	in my opinion this thing is flimsy and worthless i set it up in the doorway and it is so poorly designed that it just does n't hold once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin up you realize that you 've already thrown away your money and now it 's time to throw away this product i absolutely agree with the reviewer who cautions against making this product available to kids without close supervision	10
0	i paid bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it worksand after using it a few time si relized its flawsfirst its too damn smallits accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crapand doenst do squat in heavy battlesand the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystembuy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it	10
1	you wo n't believe how many exercises you can do on this home gym it takes up very little space and there 's even a diet plan included	10
0	this thing simply does not work ! i bought this prodcut for my mountain bike and i cannot even believe someone manufactures a false stuff like this it cannot even hold the weight of my bike and bends out to side and eventually my bike falls i tried to adjust the distance between the two archs to fit the tire width to see if i get better result but no luck	10
0	since i have received this piece of s t i have had to call twice because parts were either damaged or not working you have to call several times to get through to a customer service rep and they never answer when you leave a message	10
1	overall i'm very happy with this mat at first i was n't sure i was going to like the mat because it had an unpleasant smell but the smell disappeared within a week or two i also initially did n't like the fact that the mat was rolled so tightly that it would n't lay flat but i solved the problem the same way a previous reviewer did just turned it over	10
1	after reading the horror stories of the assembly process instructions i was a little worried myself and my 12 yr old daughter put it together in about 3 hrs without issue all parts were included instructions were clear she did the step check off 'sthe base took 400lbs of sand vs the 375lbs stated in the instruction	10
1	excellent service and a quality product at the right price i had no luck finding foose balls locally	10
0	i never received the product and had a terrible experience with amazon trying to get my money back	10
0	is it squeeky \? yes but i did n't mind what i did mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use i did n't use it vigorously and i'm only 160 lbs i 'd say avoid	10
0	i bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out ! very dissatisfied socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place i much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other i would not recommend these for anyone	10
0	i was just looking at tennis rackets on the amazon site the next thing i get is an email to say i have agreed to purchase one i did not press to conferm this order but amazon kept my credit card details on record and used them nicola bradle	10
0	maybe i should read the description better but i was disapointed to find out when receiving it that this is just a usb key with a pen and anemic led light no swiss army stuff not even a knife i thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have you know a knife \? that said the usb key is very tiny almost too small on its own \( detached from the swiss army non knife housing \) so it 's good it has a home within the casing otherwise it would probably go missing	10
1	i got this gun for christmas and i just got the m14 sniper from pyramyd air this gun is a very good beginners gun and a great backup in an airsoft war im a sniper backup man and this is my backup i am very happy with the performance of this gun pros has a decent rate of fireelectric so it doesnt have to be cocked for each shotcomes with 8000 bbs \( great deal \) collapsible stockcons small but manegeable magazineaccesories are sketchy laser broket handle is very loose but helps stabilityaccuracy on semi auto is ok not good not badif ur looking for a decent beginners gun or backup like me than i highly recommend this gu	10
0	my son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs cannot get it to work our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems but it is not for the beginner	10
1	the display is pretty much perfect but as a display it is supposed to keep balls facing forward a litte bump inside holders allow balls to move	10
0	we bought 2 of these things they both literally fell apart within 2 weeks of receiptthe stitching in various parts of the bag came undone we ended up throwing them away i 've been purchasing things on line since 1995 and this product was by far the worst thing we 've ever bought ! ! ! run away run away	10
0	well first of all i never folded it up because it was very difficult to fold so i would just roll it into a closet i would jump on it everyday for an hour and it was great low impact exercise i had it about 3 months and the suspensions snapped and i had a good shock as my feet suddenly hit the floor hard i weigh 110 lbs ! i really wonder how long this trampoline would last with a heavier person	10
0	my daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them she learned how to move about on them although a year later she 's still quite wobbly the shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use my problem is that there really is no way for her to stop no knob brake like normal skates have so most of the time she 's pretty out of control or walking like frankenstein also the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own so we have to dot it for her it was n't like that when i first bought it though we bought her normal skates for christmas to replace these	10
0	goal frame is okay but net is a pile of pants and does not last five mins cant seem to buy replacement	10
1	this item garners the same complaint that i have with the aqua sphere pull buoy it floats is functional but nicks gouges very easily i try to keep this away from the sharper objects in my swim gear bag \( snorkel fins \) but it still gets dented nicked scratched and gouged regardless it works quite well and i really like the smooth underside the ribbed handholds and the ample crescent at the base \( perfect for kicking with my head down into the water \) one of the best parts is that it is n't as small as a kid 's kickboard but it 's not huge either really good product overall	10
0	this stuff has a very strong smell like wd 40 or something if you can stand the smell you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store at least then you 'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt i bought this stuff because i thought it would be odorless like all other treadmill lubricant i 've bought but it is n't odorless it really stinks i do n't like that permeating smell in my house especially in my workout room i recommend the lifespan 100 silicone lubricant it 's a little pricier for the quantity you receive but it 's the good \( odorless \) stuff	10
1	this gun is the best deal for anyone who wants to get started in airsoft it comes with a ton of accesories and although it says it only has 200 fps the distance is much greater and the hop up the only reason i would not reccomend this gun is if you play tournament cause the people who do that have way better guns o yea make sure u buy extra clip	10
1	i take power or ashtanga based classes 3 times a week so when i travel on business taking a mat along is n't the best plan so i purchased these and when i traveled they were great on the hotel carpet i read some of the other reviews that they are n't durable and i do n't think these were designed for everyday use regardless i love them for travel or when i ca n't make it to the yoga studio	10
1	no this gun is n't very powerful but that's the point this gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns slow enough you can actually see the bb accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet	10
0	i bought 2 one fell off my belt and i lost it the other does not work at all it works even if if i shake it and the insides hit the cover from inside maybe its broke already i dont recommend anyone to buy it just walk rather than buy such gizmos that is the pilosophy i learnt from this episode	10
1	i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs	10
1	i'm not an expert on footballs but i have n't seen anything wrong with the way this one is performing it 's easy to grip and throw and it does n't have that cheesy hey i'm a recreational football look to it good deal for the money	10
1	if you notice that when an item is that cheap on ebay that the shipping charge is always huge to more then make up for the difference yes it is cheaply made and not designed to last but so are all similar products so it is at least par for the course in that regard just trying to even out the review i did n't think the other review was fair	10
0	if you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles and pins while camping then this is the item for you the instructions are made only to confuse things more it could be made so much more user friendly once it 's up it gets a thumbs up	10
1	i had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap now no problem ! it keeps my hair fairly dry or at least drier than with other caps i 've tried it 's easy to put on and take off no hair pulling it 's lasted well so far much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap	10
0	i wanted to order the puzzle sports mats but they do not tell you how many you get with your order i also tried the company web site and could not fine info there	10
0	not worth the shipping cost completely flawed i ordered the oregon scientific which is perfect should be zerostars dr parha	10
0	did not fit into the handle bar on my recently purchased bike it should have listed the minimum inside diameter of the handle bars it would accommodate	10
0	i was extremely disappointed when i received this product contrary to the description the handles are hard plastic not comfortable and soft as it states on the product packaging and website other than that it may be a decent product but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin i 've already printed the label to return to amazon beware the other review of this product the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on amazon not only is it not informative there is a good chance they have never tried the product	10
1	these skates were a bithday gift for my child the really fit well and will roll well even on our dirt drive	10
0	hi i am highly regretting buying this mat it is too bulky to carry and it came on sale in big 5 for half the price of amazon	10
0	i purchased a new 26 men 's huffy cranbrook cruiser bike after assembly to my surprise the rear wheel would not inflate because of a bad inner tube so what do you do disassemble and return \? no call huffy and they take you through nine hoops finally they sent me the right part which took ten days and i took the bike to a local fix it shop which charged me 15 labor to fix the rear wheel no savings ! p s the bike is a piece of junk made in china the instruction manual is nearly useless	10
1	i had one of these similar many years ago and let it go at a garage sale dumb idea ! as i get older this stamina machine has replaced it and is giving me all the exercise i need good to set in front of the tv and row for 30 minutes i 've gone from a size 40 to a size 36 waist i like the hydraulic part of it and the adjustability	10
1	it fits a suprisingly large amount of stuff i use it every week to take drinks to sport events it 's easy to pack and carry on your back and much easier than those cumbersome boxes	10
1	i just got my poles and while they seem great in other ways they do not offer the soft antishock system as the description says they do	10
0	the product is well made and a great idea for travel without a mat however i bought it so i would slip less in my postures once i started sweating however although the paws do n't slip on the floor surface your skin slips out of them when you sweat making them worthless guess i will stick with having a towel around !	10
1	these are really great bearings much faster than the conventional abec 7 's i was using	10
0	this item was not very good setup instructions poor lighting poor cannot view screen at night forget it	10
1	the eureka kids 30'grasshopper is an awesome sleeping bag and a great value we have two girls ages 6 and 8 who we purchased the sleeping bags for on an week long camping trip in early spring twice the temperature dipped into the thirtys and once into the low thirtys our girls stayed toasty warm and comfortable in their grashopper mummy bags these bags also pack well and have a good zipper for the money these bags simply ca n't be beat	10
0	i never write reviews but i had to make my comments on these socks i bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work i put them on and turned the switch to high they do not even get warm at all i thought it was broken but realized it was both socks that did n't get warm these are a total rip off and i am going to try and send them back	10
0	i used one powerglove for a month and it was sporadic at working and then quit entirely amazon sent a free replacement it did the same thing i could n't get it to turn on then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on i could n't get it to turn off it needs major redesigning i like the concept and it was comfortable but that 's about all barbara baxte	10
1	i started taking tennis classes at my community college a couple weeks ago i picked up this racquet because it was cheap and light with a big head it has performed very well and my game is good enough to play with some of the more experienced players that have 200 racquets	10
0	the best ever ! ! ! if you do n't have on buy one but buy the bag	10
0	i bought this to replace a c strobe light i used as a tail light on my bicycle the c strobe was bright flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain and waterproof just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack this one was by the same manufacturer with strobe action and 1 3 the cost it does n't flash the strobe action is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light it is n't anywhere near as bright as the c strobe i'm going to get a c strobe later this month from a local boating dealer	10
0	i bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking but after i say 2 3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars at a critical point i did carry a heavy backpack in the basket but still i think the basket is a piece of junk plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork which limits your height of your handlebars the basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable i ca n't recommend this basket buy a basket from your local sports authority or something thanksdarealdeal	10
1	my second pair knew exactly what i wanted small woman with small hands and small fit perfectly great deal	10
0	a real colorful and flashy bike however there were several things wrong with it 1 the tires had so much excess rubber it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed 2 the back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings if not done the bike would basically come to a stop by itself 3 the main \( front \) sprocket is slightly bent so the chain falls off constantly 4 the bike if very heavy maybe that makes it sturdy but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride i should have just bought a bike off the floor at wal mart or target for half the price	10
1	it is a good one strong and to some extent heavy i improved a lot	10
1	practice sword is of superior quality for the price it cannot be beat	10
0	the wood is very nice but the design manufacturing is very poor my experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating the holes are n't properly pre drilled the hole at the top did n't match up with the cap plate hole which a \) made it very difficult to screw together \( the first screw stripped \) and b \) resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly i experienced the same issue with shallow pre drilled holes in the bottom and the bolts not going in all the way i never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions based on the wobbly central column i decided to disassemble mine and send it back	10
1	i like this whistle 's slim design i wear it when shopping in rough areas if i am apprehended i intend to use the whistle to draw attention to me and the assailant this whistle is much louder than my voice and carries well across other sounds	10
0	i ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two after applying one vial it seemed even worse than before \( tread catches as i walk \) so i applied the second vial just to make it usuable \( still not great \) this stuff is overpriced and either they do n't give you enough or it 's poor quality	10
0	in the beginning the led seemed to stay bright for a considerable amount of time but now after almost no use \( except fooling with it \) it does n't remain lit for even 5 minutes very very poor buy	10
0	this is the second nike watch i ordered the first one did not work and isent it back to amazon amazon was great and sent me new one this one worked for a few days i then had the battery replaced two weeks after it stopped working by that time i had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen i have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain i am am glad i have had this opportunity to vent in short the watch is awful	10
0	the title pretty much says it all the bag is solid and did n't get too soft even after a good amount of use the big downside is that the metal clasps that are used to hang up the bag are of extremely poor quality and ca n't support the weight of the bag one of the clasps actually broke in two and two of the others became bent beyond usability all within about six months of use unless you 're prepared to spot weld the clasps to reinforce them i 'd look elsewhere for a heavy bag	10
1	very useful stopwatch i like the mutiple functions my use is for swim workouts this watch allows me to have three intervals going at once the print is a little smaller than it appears on the picture not a real problem i am glad i bought this stopwatch over my other choice which could only time two lanes	10
1	this product does what it claims it will do put in the time and effort you 'll feel great ! of course i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box however i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it	10
0	i receieved the valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous i purchased them after i lost my previous pair of tko fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems i put on the valeo straps and did one pull up and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in my advice this product is poorly made and cheap a complete waste of money go with something better and i would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric	10
1	me and a friend bought 2 of these they look really cool however they are not sharp at all \( hence only 4 stars \) for 15 they are really good value though the hilt is plastic and the blade is a little thin other than that they are quite good	10
0	it does what its supposed to do but its made for someone 5'6 i'm 6' and not really enjoying it	10
1	first of all i am not a kid i am a professional airsofter i own a classic army maruis and lots of other expensive guns the best thing about this gun is that it is very powerful the sight is really good and its adjusts its also really accurate the only complaint is its kinda hard to cauk but its is also heavy which is a good thing most of it is metal my recomendation is whether you are a beginner or an expert this is a great gu	10
0	i bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it so i thought i might like the alps chair too i was wrong it 's very light weight but it 's a lot longer than my other chairs which made it more difficult to carry and transport the arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings one of which broke the first time i used the chair the next day three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless save your money on this one	10
1	i love these workouts they are very intense and the results are almost immediate however this series is not for beginners the best part of these workouts is your left feeling it for at least a day my only complaints with this series were the lack of attention billy paid to the lower half of the body and the bands are sometimes cumbersome to use with certain moves all in all this was a great purchase for me i will probably purchase the new bootcamp elite series	10
0	we found the system very hard to read at night we could n't see it at all to read it our family bought us the better model for xmas so we are going to put this one on ebay would not recommend it	10
1	as the 'blow up' float toys come and go the sea breeze float still looks like new and is still the preferred float the only problem is sharing we love it	10
0	difficult to set up ! netting rips far too easily avoid this item ! be sure to look for something that has hassle free set up and also water resistent nylon netting thats tough	10
1	i bought 3 of these for holiday presents this year and everyone loves them ! inexpensive but not easy to find i was told easy to use my dad labelled 2 boxes of balls on christmas morning	10
0	well all i can say is do n't buy it it does not shoot very well or hard just get a better gun	10
0	if you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat seemed to fill the room with it 's funk does not grip well i bought it for grip yes it 's stable worth it \? not to me try the hugger mugger earth elements mat \( 5mm model \) it 's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat not as stable in place but seems a better value \( reasonable price \) and it 's biodegradable	10
0	i would easily be able to rip this box open i refuse to put a 600 dollar hand gun in a piece of garbage like this any criminal with a little hand strength could easily get into this box quickly	10
1	however it only a six day cooler if it rarely opened but it a great 3 day cooler in hot weather for normal opening to get drinks out ofthant that is very impressive as most coolers can go more then a day or two when there opened frequently	10
0	this backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck it would have been better with metal zipper	10
0	i bought this for my mountain bike with large suspension forks i tried the instructions to find the proper placement of the sensor but that was useless as it just has a picture for this part no recommendations for proper location then i found the only way the system would register a rotation is to have the magnet touch the sensor so now i have an annoying clicking and am wondering when it will actualy break from the constant contact going to send it bac	10
1	this is the perfect companion to take on your next trip no more excuses the gym is now portable with enough resistance to give you a decent workout this gym rat highly recommend these bands	10
0	if this were an office shredder mon fri support would be ok but hey i have a day job and so i 'd like bowflex to be responsive at my convenience not so	10
1	the taste is not bad u can drink 2 glasses and not get sick of it i gained 5 pounds in the first week of using it i went from 140 to 145 using n large 2 eating a lot and working out	10
1	this is probably the most complete training aid that covers set up swing plane grip and tempo however i still need video and pga pro to correct my swing here is the fault that i found i can snap the lower ball with flipping my left hand and coming steep on downswing this is not a cure for all but it helps the other disadvantage is the magnetic force in the balls diminishes fast	10
1	great value great taste for sports drink fare this is the only drink i use these days on the trails very easy on the system ! no bad after taste the 4 5 lbs cans are an awesome value	10
0	this key hider would n't fool my 18 month old ! with a very visible seam on the bottom it 's obvious this thing opens you can practically see the spare key through the cheap plastic ! awful awful awful	10
1	after reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the luna bar flavors i decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself i noticed that the luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil if you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor the toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious does n't taste like a candy bar and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market	14
1	i am very satisfied with my purchase of the wooden foot roller massager it gives you a relaxed feeling for sore and tired feet i discoverd that if you turn it on the other side you can also use it on your arms and legs by holding it	14
1	i got this for my husband and he states that the trimmer is great but it needs to have a smaller base the charger part of the trimmer is just too big even though it is big for size it does not hold all the attachments he would recommend the trimmer to do the job it is intended for	14

0	this scale looked like a good deal and had many good reviews so i bought it expecting the best when it arrived i unpacked it and immediatly hopped on after makeing sure it was at 0 the scale told me i wighed 170 lbs give or take a few from clothes i was extremely shocked ! how could i weigh that much ! ! turns out the scale was off approx 20 pounds 20 pounds !	14
1	i have had this straightener for a while and i still have no complaints about it it is an affordable option for those looking for a pretty good straightener i love the heat settings i only need to put mine on the second setting \( 338 degrees \) for it to do a good job and i have very thick wavy curly hair i like the 1 because it allows me to flip out the ends of my hair but i'm sure the 2 one is great too	14
0	i had the exact same experience as stan another reviewer i bought this heating pad and when it turned itself off i could not get it started again like stan i thought it was a fluke and bought another same problem two days after buying the pad i have looked in four stores in the seattle area and cannot find another brand of heating pad this one should not be on the market i am sending both pads back to the manufacturer	14

0	my wife was very pleased with the vanity perfume tray with all of the snow we have had it arrived shortly after christmas but just in time to warm her heart for the new year	14
1	the product does what it says it cuts your hair and contains it all in a vacuum container	14
0	perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality my experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all i threw the item in the trash and bought a conair at kmart which surprisly worked about 20 times better my recommendation is do not buy	14
0	i received this tweezer for christmas so i'm glad i did n't spend anything for it because it 's not even worth 50 cents the tweezer portion does not grip on to any hairs it 's a piece of crap as far as i'm concerned do not bother purchasing this product if you do you 'll regret it	14
0	i bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as i would like ! it is so hard to find a good heating pad now but i would not reccomend this one	14
0	i 've only used the unit 3 times and the flip over trimmer broke when i flipped it over to attach to the main clipper head the plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head that cracked in two and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor it 's very disappointing i'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer i ca n't seem to find the receipt	14
0	i'm very sorry but the universal remote control was not what i expected like when i want to turn on my tv the vcr came on and visa versa but the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money very pleased about the service thanks regards yoka van dijk	14
0	this heating pad was received as a gift to replace the sunbeam heating pad i had used for 35 years and had finally worn out i was delighted with the larger size but the new pad did not heat at all i returned it to homedics \( along with the 5 handling charge \) and two months later they sent a replacement the replacement heats up but after one use the pad was hopelessly twisted it almost looks like it has melted to itself and it ca n't be flattened out i wo n't be sending this one back with another 5 handling charge it is n't worth it this one goes out with the trash and i go back to sunbeam	14
1	my hair gets weighed down very easily by finishing smoothing products they will leave my hair looking flat and greasy instead of smooth my hair is very fine but also thick \( which is very annoying \) this finishing solution leaves my hair very smooth without weighing it down it seems very expensive for such a small bottle but a little goes a long way \( i 've had the same bottle for nearly a year and it 's still not finished \) definitely spritz it into your hands and not directly into your hair because it does not disperse at all the scent is very light and refreshing and not at all overwhelming	14
0	so yeah it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups and once it 's mounted it stays put pretty well unfortunately it has so far never actually been fogless get a good shower going and the mirror fogs up in record time splash some water on it and you can see yourself for half a minute but overall this is a disappointment	14
1	this is a great heating pad if you like heat it ranges from low to hi with 4 settings in between \( that is 6 settings \) especially nice is the loooooong cord my old heating pad has like a 6 ft cord and i always needed an extension cord for it good purchase !	14
1	looking for something small and portable \? this is perfec	14
0	i bought this scale as an upgrade from a wal mart cheapo scale hated it ! ! i should have read the dimensions more carefully but it was so large that it became the focal point of our bathroom worse still it never displayed the same weight twice in a row even when second weight was taken immediately after the first had to reset it to zero and then the same drill happened again returned the item but ate the 11 return ship fee it 's huge and heavy	14
0	out of the box did n't work would not have givin it a 1 star review if there was a zero now its time to play the refund game	14
1	i get compliments all the time on this scent it is one of my favorites it smells exactly like cotton candy its fun flirty and nostalgic of childhood romps at the fair ! if you like sweet edible scents then this one is for you	14
1	i have a severe dry eye problem and i found in internet that a humidifier may help i bought big one for home and personal for work it 's been 2 days and it 's working fine	14
1	this is a great sized foot bath i pour hot water in it sit back and relax it does n't keep the water warm but if i start off with really hot water it stays warm until i'm ready to get out using the pedicure attachements is hard work though i just assume use a hand held brush the bubble feature is too loud to use while watching tv still for the price i like this foot bath i 've even given it as a gift	14
0	i had to return my recent purchase due to a defect i have used waterpik dental water jets for many many years and typically have to replace every two or three years i was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet i purchased the waterpik ultra and i am pleased with the design size and operation thus far i just hope waterpik can maintain quality of their products and that my current purchase will provide another two to three years of service	14
1	i like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model the kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth it 's a bit louder than the older model probably because it 's got an additional motion and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light overall just what we wanted	14
1	i got what i expected it 's functional and not too poorly made the only problem i had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp i filed the sharp edges off and now it 's great the rolling wheels still have no function for me but they do n't get in the way	14
0	do not buy this ! ! ! it does not work as seen on t v we were able to get it to cut a cucumber and that was it would not cut a tomato onion carrot apple only a cucumber complete waste of money	14
1	i use this product all the time it was becoming hard to find in department stores but i found it available and cheaper online i'm very happy	14
0	i have always thought that a man 's shaver would work on woman 's beard this one does not	14
1	we have it hanging in a closet and it has been working great ! when it changes color all i do is plug it in for about 10 12 hours and then hang it back up again ! we are very satisfied	14
1	the lifesource bp monitor was just what i wanted and was priced just right it was delivered in a timely manner and i am a happy camper along with my wife thanks	14
1	i 've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best strong motor easy adjust strong vacuum other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me one would n't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard the idea is to glide the unit over your beard you 're not raking you 're trimming ! also the unit is easy to clean out after use the waste receptacle snaps out easily as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris	14
1	i love this product it just tastes great especially with milk	14
0	nice idea for all of us office workers but the main backing is too soft to provide any real lumbar support furthermore the movable lumbar support is made of the same soft material and is too small and not thick enough to provide any real support i am looking for something else	14
1	this blood pressure monitor is everything i was looking for and the price was certainly right thank you it works perfectly	14
1	this is easy to use and set up it even has a 3rd space for a guest you do n't have to get your body fat and water each time i like it	14
0	the mattress pad topper has a strong chemical smell after receiving it i left it in an open room for 2 weeks before i can sleep on it the free pillow smells even worse it can be not exchanged since it is free i guess i am supposed to toss it since it 's free i think it will be fair to mention that the topper is comfortable after all	14
1	i suffer from upper back and shoulder tension i 've been using neck warmers for years but recently lost the only one i had after looking at many warmers i chose the happy wrap the wrap stays warm for more than an hour and has the moist heat which is perfect for tense muscles my yorkshire terrier ca n't wait until i'm done using it and fights with the cat to get it when i'm finished	14
0	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele the fusion is a classic example from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel do n't buy into the hype the fusion is an expensive joke of a product	14
0	i recommend using ear plugs or ear muffs protection before using the andis company 22560 rechargeable cord cordless hair clipper kit	14
1	i was suffering from intense neck and shoulder pain before i started using this pillow when i started sleeping on it a couple of months ago the pain was gone after the first night and it has n't come back since then it supports my neck perfectly i highly recommend	14
1	i have tried the gerber nursing pads and one other brand these nursing pads are the best i have a large supply of milk but i have not leaked through these pads they are also very soft and they are not visible through your clothing	14
1	always saw them at the mall and wanted one it was nice to be able to get it on here and not have to search works great ! feels wonderful ! ! ! especially when you get that headache ! ! ! also doubles as a contemporary hat ! ! haha love it	14
1	this is really fun to do with a friend its so spa like i love it ! but it has so many warnings im afraid to do something wrong	14
0	just used this razor for the first time could not get a close shave out of it at all the trimmer will cut hair but not stubble on top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash i'm very disappointed in this razor but i guess i got what i paid for i'm going to order a new razor right now because i ca n't stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary	14
0	bought it and it worked for like a month now it just sits in my room doing nothing i am going to look for the company information and try to get my money back if you are going to get a shower mirror pay a little more and get quality	14
0	i 've got a small bit of hardwood space in my apartment and i figured this would suit my mopping needs it has n't even after sweeping the area multiple times prior to using the wetjet i 've found that it does n't really pick any dirt up what i wind up with is a polished floor with a lot of small piles of dirt everywhere i'm even using the special hardwood floor solution it is n't making a difference i do n't recommend this product for anything other than polishing a floor \( and there are probably better solutions for that as well \)	14
1	my husband and i love this thermometer for our own use let alone the grandkids ! it 's fast easy and reliable highly recommend it	14
0	we have only had this showerhead for one month already the nozzles are clogging the spray has become more like pins and needles than a gentle waterfall do not purchase this product if you have hard water	14
0	after some research online i decided to purchase this dryer because it had all the qualities i was looking for in a lightweight compact model it worked great while it lasted but unfortunately it died 6 months after purchasing it one day it worked and the next day it started smoking and sparking ! !	14
0	i quite liked this trimmer while it worked well so i'm disappointed at how it has held up through only a little over six months as of now the battery will hold barely any charge if at all it 's frustrating to have it crap out on me after initially being pleased with its functions	14
1	works great and with any mattress due to severe neck injuries i can now sleep better at a slight incline thanks	14
0	i was very careful to not press down as instructed when cleaning cds yet i was left with light circular scratches and smudges untouched as for scratches you may as well use toothpaste for all the good this will do you the solution does not fill in even the lightest scratches i tried it with several different scatches and discs and the result was the same multiple applications fared no better the disc i bought this for primarily is in worse shape than when i started	14
1	i love these bags they are easy to get out of the container easy to open and close and once the milk is in they stand on their own to be honest i have n't tried other brands so these may not be the only great ones	14
0	broke after 5 days i used it the way it was meant to be used cleaned it nightly etc i had read a review that said theirs broke after a short time and ignored it i wish i had n't this is junk	14
1	i 've only used the kit once and it did what it was supposed to no problems everything went fine and i intend to use it again within about a month it should pay for itself very quickly	14
1	i 've been using remington 's shaver saver for 20 years it keeps your shaver clean lubricates well with not too much gooey oil and works in an instant i use a remington ms2 100 microscreen 2 and after a shaver saver treatment the shaver glides smoother over my face and shaves quicker and closer a treatment seems to last for a while and i do n't think it 's necessary to use it every day usually 2 to 3 times a week seems to be sufficient and your shaver will continue to perfrom like new	14
0	the battery life is the worst of any electric razor i 've ever used the razor does n't provide a close shave and mine broke after just three uses the razor is very cheaply constructed and i would not recommend this to anyone you 're better off spending twice the money to get a durable machine	14
0	the disadvantage is you have to press on button while you style it makes my arm and finger tired	14
0	unfortunately total block did not work well with my rosacea sensitive skin it caused my skin to become very red and irritated by the end of the day i do n't doubt this is an excellent sunblock just not for my rosacea sensitive skin i use it now on my arms with no problems i do feel it is very expensive for so little product so will not repurchase	14
1	these glasses are a great idea however they do not work with long hair the back strap of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose \( so you can see over them for distance \) long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes i guess most people who need reading glasses do n't have long hair	14
0	good scale could have been better designe for feet fat measurement pretty close	14
0	i purchased this for my mother she states that it runs too fast and it is painful i tried it myself and it hurts just like she says not recommended	14
0	i bought two of these based on a 2005 customer review saying they do n't have automatic shutoff but now they do i guess this is considered an improvement but i bought them for an elderly cat and she ca n't reset the control every hour they are a good value if you do n't mind the auto shutoff	14
1	after buying several different seat cushions for my office chair i found this seat and it is the best choice i ever made the seat has a low profile but is extremely comfortable	14
0	it does n't get hot enough nor does it stay hot for more than 10 minutes	14
0	broke after two uses buttons are hard to switch and drying time was not better than my old school model in fact my hair was frizzier i was kinda glad it broke i wish i had read the reviews before i bought this	14
1	there is no better shaving cream i am disappointed you are out of stock	14
0	when i first stepped on the scale i thought i lost 10 lbs but after reading other review i realize the scale is off up to 9 lbs also this is a big scale too big to store in the bathroo	14
0	i'm a huge fan of the pria line but these are not like the others they are heavier and a little grainy i do n't hate them but will not buy them again the flavor is pretty good though just not what i was expecting i highly recommend the pria 110 calorie line the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind thank	14
0	i gave this item as a gift so i was disappointed when after only a few months of use it was broken i'm not sure what happened but my haircutter has lasted for years	14
0	this item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet so i bought this specifically for that use i used the triangular pumice attachment only i was under the impression that the attachment would rotate but in general it 's just a vibrating \( 2 levels \) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually the vibrations were n't intense enough to make any difference the actual machine has no function the body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok but can easily be used without this machine	14
0	i was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back however immediately after opening the product i tried to plug it in as it does n't work without batteries being fully charged unfortunately this massager would plug in but did not start charging and therefore it could not be charged i will be returning this item	14
1	this is the only energy bar that i have sampled more than once ! the hooah ! energy bar works faster lasts longer and tastes better ! both flavors ! go army !	14
0	i had an old caruso molecular setter that finally conked out i thought the ion feature of this would be great the clicking is annoying but if it worked i would n't mind this puts out way less steam causing the amount of time it takes to heat a curler much longer than the old system then after all that it only curls about 1 2 as much so it takes longer for less curl not worth it i hope i can get another caruso but i hear they have problems now too ahhhh remember the good old days when things worked	14
1	this has got to be one of the easiest blood pressure monitors to use it really does n't start until your arm is in the correct position letting you know by beeping when you 've got it right the display is large and easy to read and understand i definitely would recommend this	14
1	fantastic a great product especially considering the price i love the size i love that the height is adjustable it is exactly what i wanted and i am thrilled with it	14
0	i did not like this thing at all it took too long to shave my legs it did n't even remove all of the hair it irritated my skin as well	14
0	every time i use the product 3 out of 4 times i receive an error and have to try it agai	14
0	first of all i was very disappointed when i received my waterpik cf 203c cascadia showerhead it is all plastic ! i do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs i thought when i oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal sedondly even with the head made of plastic the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it we could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall we installed it repeatedly following each step of the instructions every time thinking we were missing something i eventually returned the showerhead to amazon	14
0	i do n't know if it works or not i just received it and all i get on it is a low battery reading	14
0	edible taste not the best but i would keep buying them if i did n't get the worst stomach ache that leads to to a dirrahea it is not just this met rx bar that will do this to you it is any food with sugar alcohols all atkins food is based on sugar alchols such as maltitol and sorbitol they do not effect your blood sugar like regular sugars do so the theory is that they dont store fat only edible if you are within 20 feet of a clean bathroom you only have 15 minutes to get to the bathroom not worth it	14
1	adds a great fragrance to the room we bought several different scents and placed them throughout the house it 's a different smell in every room what a pleasant change from smelling the pets	14
0	the price is too high considering the ijoy 550 model is only us 599 99 at sharper image	14
0	i guess it 's cheap but the dial rocks like crazy when you stand on it and shift your weight so it 's pretty hard to get anything more than a 2 3 pound estimate which is fine if you 're not obsessive but most people care about that increment	14
1	10 bucks and does the job you do need to adjust it every once in awhile but that 's easy to do	14
0	i wanted to buy this for my daughter i wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill ins with my new scrapbooking hobby the outside is precious but once you open it the pages are like a black and white newspaper material and they have no structure what so ever the pages are boring and do n't look very durable	14
0	horrible just like tend skin try princereigns or min they actually work and dont burn your face off like tend skin or magic shav	14
0	it makes glasses stain and i return it within 1 week	14
1	b b styling creme is absolutely the greatest hair product i have ever used thanks for making it available on line	14
1	this dryer works great but it gets pretty hot watch your ears and fingertips	14
0	i bought two clarisonic brushes one as a gift and one for myself although the product works well unfortunately both brushes were defective the trouble started occurring about two months after using one brush started out with two speed settings but eventually only functioned at the low setting the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty be careful if you are going to travel abroad the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !	14
0	i had great results with this product with the first use however when i used it the second time the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface leaving me with a smooth useless triangle i replaced the triangle thinking i had a dud but had the same thing happen with the second pad the cream will work without the pad but not as effectively if the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface they will have a winner with this product on a positive note i love the facial product	14
1	i have several of these glasses now love them they are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck i wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one good price and good product	14
1	i think it nice for me make my eyes relax after long time working before computer	14
0	the only reason that i am writing this review is because i am on line now looking for a new trimmer i bought this gem less than a year ago and was not satisfied then tonight i'm trying to trim my goatee and it is ripping and pulling the hair out the extra cutting heads are all but worthless i would never recommend this p o s to anybody i wish i could give it 0 stars	14
1	i bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past shoulder length hair it works great ! i gotta admit it 's just big enough for my head and i have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the extra large size towel \( which is n't really all that large	14
1	i 've owned two thermaphore heating pads different sizes for many years and i'm using one right now ! they 're quality made to last a lifetime they trap moisture from the air so no need for soaking sponges to insert the trigger switch allows you to heat as needed as hot as you like and if you fall asleep there are no worries of burns if the trigger is n't depressed it is n't heating i would n't be without mine it helps me manage my arthritis fibromylagia nerve damage pain i 've recommended it to many of my friends who have been very pleased as well	14
0	i followed the instructions and did n't overuse it the motor went after 2 months i miss it so much that i am considering getting another one even though i never got my money back for the first one	14
1	i like guru because it has a more natural feeling towards your body after drinking monster all day my body felt like a mess \( from the many unnatural chemicals it does to your body \) there are so many energy drinks out there that have loads of chemicals its harder to find stuff like guru and bawls	14
0	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me every head is different so maybe they 'll work better for you	14
1	not a bad product irritates the skin a little but does remove your hair the only things i do n't like is that the buffers wear out quickly and your hair grows back with in 2 weeks it does a nice job of exfoliating the skin and is great for hard to reach places not a bad product however i hope someone soon comes up with something that can take hair away permanently or for a longer period of time i would recommend this product	14
0	this is another example of a horrible waste of time and money our emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair and that brings around another problem emjoi customer service and repair service you 'll want to avoid both better yet avoid emjoi and avoid the total headache not only are emjoi products cheap they are painful to use	14
1	i received this chair very quickly even though it was close to christmas the chair was wonderful ! such a great price for such a great chair	14
1	over the past two years i have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs at age 70 those needs are many after approximately two rounds of trying it is miracle greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs i have for feeling better in general	14
1	i'am very satisfied with the vidal sassoon hairdryer there are 3 heat settings and tips in the enclosed booklet on how to use these settings it is a little bulky but it does n't take long to get used to a larger dryer i would recommend this hair dyer	14
0	i have had this straightener for about a year it will get my wavy hair straight but not quickly and i have to use the high heat settings also my hair does not get stick straight but if your hair is already pretty straight then this is a good straightener	14
1	heats up quickly tends to dry out more than previous chi flat iron i had much more economical	14
1	this product works well it takes a while to warm up but it can keep my feet nice and warm once it gets going	14
1	my husband said it is a very good shaver it took a few days to get used to the shaving head because he has always used the norelco shavers with three rotating heads the braun is a closer shave the cleaning system works very well and it is easy to handle	14
0	i got this curler set and i completely regret it ! i used it once and i wont touch it again ! it left my hair frizzy and there was a bump from where the clamps were it took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down i would n't even give it one star take my advice do not buy this !	14
1	i got this unit as a gift from my boyfriend high blood pressure runs in my family so i wanted to get a monitor to keep track i was figuring on getting an arm unit but when i got this wrist unit i wanted to see how it would work the whole system is very easy to use and fast you need to be sitting and resting to take the reading but is happens quickly and then it stores all the results for you i did n't think i would really use the memory function but it has come in pretty handy i can say this was a great gift something i use a lot and something that will help me stay healthy	14
0	i do n't know what those other people were talking about but this energy drink tastes like melted popsicles it 's basically just gatorade with more sugar in it if you want an energy drink instead of a sweetened sports drink you should look elsewhere	14
1	hydrabrush is an excellent power toothbrush because the brushhead has more surfaces to get at your teeth and gum line making the brushing very comfortable and refreshing afterwards i use the soft brushhead because i used to have gingivitis and my gums were red and swollen but since using the hydrabrush and the 8 brushes \( 4 on each side \) i do n't have to worry about missing when i brush my teeth excellent product	14
1	after total knee replacement this wedge sure helped to keep my knee in one place and elevated while preventing me from moving too much while i slept or was resting highly recommended	14
1	bought this for my husband who has a 2 hour \( one way \) commute by bus to work he loves it now he can nap without waking up with a cramp in his neck it is very portable with a small carrying case and is easy to blow up a bargain for the price	14
0	absolute waste of money i bought this for my 13 year old as a beginner shaver and it shaves next to nothing ! i do n't know who wrote the other reviews but i doubt they were independent voices this shaver is worthless	14
1	it arrived in 3 days and i used it for a week and i still get some stray ingrowns once in a while but it is the only thing that worked this good this fast for me and trust me i tried everything in the book a plus is my face is one even complexion when i had alot of dark spots which was a pleasant surprise	14
1	i use this with my m3 turbo and some kiehl 's closeshavers squadron ultimate brushless shave cream white eagle for my daily morning shave it 's the best combination for thick tough stubble	14
1	these wipes are great i have three children and have used the pampers huggies and house brand wipes the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of them to get the job done house brand do n't smell as good and tend to be a bit rough the pampers are thin soft and moist enough to get the job done because they are thin they can be maneuvered around in all the important places and folded refolded for 100 useage \( unlike the huggies that once they are folded they become too thick to maneuver \) definitely not too dry as other reviewers have said if you want something moister go get a paper towel and wet it with water	14
0	i had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews i used the razor as directed in the instruction manual the manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use i used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse i had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal do not buy this product	14
0	i 've had this for about a month and i 've used it less than 6 times even though i 've carefully handwashed it and merely wiped off the ice ring the ice ring has sprung a leak \( ewww blue liquid on my celery ! ! \) the lid is difficult to snap on remove the center container lid is really too tall for its diameter which makes using it for dipping rather awkward	14
0	this grinder was recommended to me but i have to say i find it frustrating to use juice leaks out the bottom when grinding steamed vegetables or juicy fruit and grinding some things \( e g green beans \) takes a lot of force while the price is fine the high cost of shipping and handling to purchase one unit made me angry had i noticed before i bought it i would n't have ! since then i 've noticed that this is sold at most local grocery stores	14
0	its super cheap does not work at all will struggle with the thinnest of hairs stay away ! !	14
1	as soon as i got this item i tried it out right away i will agree the battery cover is rather flimsy but that 's a minor point the real issue is whether it could do what it claims to do take down mosquitos and flys sure enough i killed 5 mosquitos after sitting outside for just a few minutes i also took down a housefly without any sweat this is a great device as mosquitos are a real problem where i'm at and it sucks being held hostage indoors by insects no more an issue	14
1	when my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him it was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings then i bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out just enough to see your baby by but not enough to keep everyone awake it 's been almost a year now and i'm just about to purchase two more we use the light now in our toddler 's room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine we use it every night	14
1	i have loved dolce gabanna light blue since it came out i was so excited to find it at such a competitive price at amazon and am certainly a satisfied customer ! the shipping was so fast i was expecting to wait at least 2 weeks and it was delivered ahead of schedle ! thanks so much	14
1	just bought this showerhead i have a stand up shower built in with a pull around curtain all other heads blow the curtain out and water on the floor this is the one it works great i have a shallow well pump with 40 60lbs of water pressure setting my wife loves this so much i will get one for her up stairs full shower bathtub	14
0	this scale does not weigh correctly your results depend upon exactly where you are standing on the scale when you are weighing in i counted 6 different results within 5 minutes the last time i used it this is one of the least accurate scales i 've ever used spend the extra money to get a higher quality non digital scale	14
1	i got this product when the price dropped down to 12 so for that price i liked this product a lot it heats the lotion well initially i thought it was small but now i think it is the correct size i did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this i switch it on when i go for a bath and by the time i am back the lotion is ready and warm it is a great buy and for all you bargain shoppers wait till the price drops it is especially a great buy during winter	14
0	in the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them i wish i had known this before now i have to waste about 20 in shipping to return it do not buy for body fat measurement	14
1	it seems to be doing the job my next dental check will tell it 's a little awkward at first getting used to the brush \( quite a bit different from the conventional brush \) and i think though they tell you to hold the handle with two fingers only \( thumb and forefinger \) that you do have to tilt the brush a little to get the gumline and i still do find a little tartar on my teeth so you decide	14
1	i used the remington twice up to now and the bottom line it is a great machine you will never need to lube it and that is a big deal with clippers its easy to clean sharp and easy to work with	14
1	i have used olay regenerist perfecting cream for over a year now it leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely it does not have spf protection so for daytime i use a lighter moisturizer with spf over it before applying my foundation at night it 's all you need	14
1	i own this unit for more than a year bought it in the local drug store for 20 first unit was bad displaying low battary error i exchanged it same day for another one i compared readings with traditional thermometers and found it to be very accurate fast and can show in both c and f the best i 've ever had the case is bad lock broke in a week	14
1	a good product to be sure i 've used seventh generation 's other laundry detergents and have been very pleased this review is however a cautionary while it states on amazon that each bottle cleans 40 loads it is only rated for 18 loads just a heads up ! note i tried to notify amazon about this but their system for corrections is inoperable at the moment thus this review	14
0	sturdy enough for the price but no power replaced original battery with a new duracell still fuctioned like the battery was drained like i mentioned before what do you expect for the price	14
0	there are two thing that i do n't like about this set the curlers get too hot to handle and the lid is n't attached to the base which is very inconvenient i would n't recommend them	14
1	this shaver has met all my expectations it cleans and recharges itself automatically the shave is close and nick free the only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes	14
0	i was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer i was using by hot tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers after using about 5 times it stopped working i will say that it is compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable the temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint i ended up purchasing another hot tools dryer a little more money but worth the price in the long run	14
1	i bought from the 3 types of olay total effect and i did try them after reading the instruction there is no magical effect apeard after 1 month but there is diffrence the company was very good in logistic maters	14
0	i own a more expensive braun but bought this model as a gift for someone who i was n't sure if he would use an electic toothbrush after 7 months the toothbrush wo n't turn off something is shorted out unfortunately i no longer have the receipt my more expensive model which i use multiple times a day has been problem free for over five years	14
1	okay i have n't owned a new hair dryer for over 25 years but i must say this one is exactly perfect and has everything i would ever want in a hair dryer it has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly leaving it soft and frizz free i highly recommend this product	14
0	i ordered this product on june 7th 2006 today is july 11th 2006 and i still have not received it i have cancelled my order because it is a lot faster to drive to the story to purchase it than to wait over a month for it to show up i'm really not happy with the turn around time for the tide he detergent	14
1	i purchase two of the eva dry edv 500 renewable dehumidifer and hang them inside the closet where i store my photo gears although in california is not so humid but little moisture do add up this dehumidifer is so easy to use unwrap it then hang it there i check them once per several day when the silica gel change from blue to pick i just recharge it by plug it into the electric outlet overnight then next morning wow a renewed dehumidifer is ready to use again the changing of color is very obviously i strongly recommend this item	14
0	the flexible arm is not stiff enough to support the dry weight of the showerhead this is the most pathetic product that i have seen in decades	14
1	i 've used the pigeon brand \( i believe it 's from japan \) milk storage bags those are the best quality bags i 've ever used unfortunately they 're also very difficult to find these lansinoh bags are a good substitute at 1 3 of pigeon 's price not bad at all ! my baby and i travel a lot so i bring along my stock of bmilk in these lansinoh bags no mishaps thus far highly recommended	14
1	this product does wonders it helped with blotchy skin and made my whole face feel softer yet firmer within a week like another customer i have sensitive skin i did n't feel this dried my skin out at all but a word to the wise make sure to read the directions carefully this product is not meant for use around the eyes which might explain some complaints if used properly its fantastic	14
0	the shave gel bars that are attached to this razor extend out past the razor making a close shave nearly impossible this razor worked ok on my legs where an extreme smoothe surface is not necesssary but using this on the the more intimate areas is just frustrating because the gel bars did not allow the razor to get close enough to the skin this razor does not poduce a light lather it is more like a slime that drips from it i did not notice a tropical scent	14
1	just wanted to note that my delicious bars arrived melted as noted by another reviewer i ended up placing in the fridge and then taking out before eating turns out i did n't find them that great directly from the fridge also they just did n't taste as fresh as the ones i buy individually from wal mart i could n't tell if that was because they had melted or just were n't as fresh to start with	14
1	after brushing with the hydrabrush my teeth feel as clean as when i 've been to the dental hygenist this is a great product i am so glad that replacement brushes are available at amazon	14
1	clothes are soft and smell great works just as good as any fabric softener out there and better for you your family and the enviroment	14
1	i started taking anxietol 7 to help me with my stress at work i am not usually a stressed out sort of person however i recently got transfered to nyc and i'm from utah just that move itself is enough to stress anyone out i am working as a trader and it is very high energy anxietol 7 is helping me cope with my new life here	14
1	i take two of this product before bed and it relaxes me and helps me sleep	14
1	these seem to be an excellent product there is little or not leakage the wipes were a nice treat	14
1	i'm a black male and everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs at first i 'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day i 'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads \( about 10 20 of them \) that was before now after i apply the product i do n't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore it just feels like i never had any hair on my face in the first place the only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but i do n't really care i mean it 's not like the product claims to be painless	14
1	i still have ther original blackmans shaver purchased in 1977 it still works ! this one works even better i have tried other remington shavers over the years the 850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the first one untill now ! i found that by shaving in small circular motion as you move along your face you wo n't need williams lectric shave as i had with the other razors and it 's much easier to claen ! now if the just keep making replacement baldes i will be very happy for a long time	14
1	this is the razor to use ! excellent product does what is says	14
0	this pad works basically but it does turn itself after 30 minutes there 's no way to prevent that this may be fine for some uses but it 's very inconvenient for others	14
1	i purchased this as a gift for a friend who has beautiful long hair and she told me they worked wonderfully i also own a set and have had them for several years travelling with me to the office gym and around the world they are easy to pack and are lightweight	14
0	fall asleep inminutes what a joke don`t waste your money on this product	14
0	i followed the directions on the package but could not get these disks to adhere to my canker sore even one in the flattest part of my cheek obviously they wo n't stick to sores on the gumline or inside of lip either cankaid and kank a are still the non prescription products i have found that provide relief and are much easier to apply	14
0	i have bought 5 of these crappy pads and all 5 stopped working after a short period buy the sunbeam 902 flexible heating pad much more reliable and useful too	14
1	i just bought a vespa scooter for short trips since the gas prices are so high i needed some eye protection that would work with my helmet these goggles are awesome ! they fit perfectly inside my helmet and because the wrap around my head they stay put the magnets in front are very strong so the goggles do n't move the eye cups are just the right size and they 're padded for comfort these goggles have far exceeded my expectations	14
1	i have been using this razor for about 6 years now probably as long as they have been out they may be pricey but well worth it i used to use disposables and nicked cut my legs almost every time i switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little it is so quick and easy to use and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams they do only last for 3 5 shaves but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream it 's probably not that much more expensive	14
0	babyliss pro instant heat 5 jumbo roller hairsetter comes in a compact useful size however the rollers take a long time to heat up even if left plugged in for a half hour they do not reach a high enough temperature to effectively curl thick hair i would not recommend this product	14
0	i 've used the cardiochek 6 times and had my cholesterol checked at a doctor 's office during the same period my cholesterol levels according to the doctor 's tests are always around 200 with the cardiochek they vary by as much as 90 points it is a lot of trouble \( and expensive \) to purchase 3 sets of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total cholesterol hdl cholesterol and triglycerides no test strips are included in the package when i purchased the cardiochek the box says includes check strips but those are something other than test strips	14
0	i had this unit for about 6 months and it broke on me if it had n't broke i 'll give if 4 stars	14
1	i boutght this razor for my husband he likes it but notes that it is hard to clean and does not get the longer whiskers which he seems to miss a lot i think that if he shaved more carefully he would get these whiskers before they get too long ! i think that for the price \( lower end of price range \) it does a pretty good job next time i 'll buy him a more expensive one and hope that it performs better	14
1	i ordered 1 for my twin bed to try out loved it so i ordered a full and kingsize too ! i find i do n't move around as much as i used to a more restfull sleep	14
0	i got the machine for my fat muscle and water analysis as well as my weight after 1 month of use it only shows the weight the scale no longer works properly it no longer shows anything else but the weight it was a waste of money	14
1	i bought it for my daughter 's birthday she says it hurts at first but really gets the kinks out she is very pleased with it	14
1	safari by ralph lauren for women is the only eau de parfum my niece uses after she discovered safari she gave away her collection of purfumes i usually try to find safari for her birthday every year	14
0	i 've used ghds and even though they 're pricier they are worth every penny after using the hai stick just one time i had terrible split ends and the stick did not 'glide' over my hair in the same way but seemed to tear terrible ! i think i 'll upgrade	14
0	worked alright for a few months i was n't especially pleased with the shave quality i e skin irritation hair pulls i figured that this would go away as i was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads it did n't the bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair was n't easy and resulted in breakage no doubt due to the cheap plastic used never again	14
0	i was hopeful that this little product would be up to the job but alas i was wrong it turns out this is a fragile underpowered ineffective tool darn	14
1	panasonic makes a great electric shaver this is the second one for me in the last sixteen years	14
1	i own an older dispensor from around 1999 and i was afraid that these filters would n't fit they do and seem to work fine i ca n't find a replace indicator on these new ones the older filters had a sliding arrow to show when to replace them i guess that i just have to replace it on a calendar basis they say the filters are good for 2 months	14
0	i saw a review that made it seem like these were indistructable not so ! they tear easily better than just empty wal mart bags though but not by much	14
1	i 've used this product with two of my children with out problems i have never had a leak unlike with some of the other brands suggestions write the date on the bag before you start to pump or a nurse once suggested that you use labels also never fill the bag ! it 's only meant to hold 6 oz these bags are much thicker than the gerber bags and they are the only ones to have the double zipper i used these liners with my avent disposable system and standard bottles i 've gone through over 600 of these bags and i must say amazon has the best price around	14
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled when i read chocolate pecan pie i expected just that the taste of rich chocolate with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base what i received was a bar with little taste nothing at all similar to the name on the bar in my opinion the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it the flavor is barely there the bar is dry it is never again be on my purchase list	14
0	i am amazed that all these so called health foods will add artery clogging palm kernel oil as an ingredient do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil cocoa butter and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many organic things are added to it for many years now it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases	14
0	i did not like it it was not as i thought it was going to be i thought it would give me a closer trim	14
1	i 've had my first bottle of this after shave for a year and i have just finally begun to run out while i do n't use it everday i use it regularly and when needed i use an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly irritated this nivea after shave is wonderful it only takes a small amount to cover my whole face and neck it leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling sometimes i 'll leave the house and forget to put it on and i 'll go all the way back just to put it on it gets your day off to a great start no funky smells or textures here give it a try you wo n't be disappointed	14
1	very classy scent very strong spray sparingly a little goes a long way lasts all day will receive many compliments	14
1	tastes great and it 's good for a normal weight training person like me	14
0	as i found it to be really much too fake lemony not unlike the stuff you smell in car dealership service bathrooms i mixed mine w a subtle cookie type one i coud n't smell at all now can smell neither even when i put them in closets which was not the idea i like a little fragrance thru the house may look for something like cinnamon or sandalwood	14
0	i 've got this meter a month ago i intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise but i 've never been able to do so ! at rest the meter gives a reading after several attempts but often inaccurate you have to stay still as a statue for 10 20 seconds to get a reading now i'm using it as an exercise watch stopwatch	14
0	terrible reception tinny speaker radio does not remember last used station when turned off do n't waste your money	14

1	my last braun razor was model 6550 which i purchased 7 years ago the braun 8975 is a pleasure using quick and close shave the technology has come a long way i have always used braun and this is by far the best yet	14
0	i found this item to be equal to the conair curling iron you can buy in a drug store for less money	14
1	it does a great job i just tought it wound n't let any hair go but i gess that 's impossible	14
1	this is such a great product for nursing moms it is not bulky and is reliable to keep leaks from happening for a mom this was a lifesaver for me to allow me to go outside without being embarassed by having a wet shirt	14
0	it was not as good as i expected i felt the quality of this item was cheap therefore i returned it	14
1	these wipes are just as soft and durable as pampers but much less expensive ! they are not alcohol free unfortunately though i have noticed that those wipes which are alcohol free contain citric acid \( fyi \) quick free delivery	14
1	i was having a problem with over eating and eating when i was n't hungry and as a result gained quite a bit of weight and felt awful i 've only been using this product for three days but already my portion size has shrunk immensely and my energy is way up i have n't felt jittery or shaky i feel better than i have in months i would recommend this to those who also have problems with cravings or portion size and want to drop some un needed weight	14
0	i complete disagree with the previous review on that sonicare is superior i 've used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and braun sonic complete is by far the best however this unit is nothing like sonic complete the sonic energy is completely in the handle it 's like holder a vibrator the real sonic complete channels the energy to the brush head you are probably better more with one of the other two models of vitality that uses rotational brush heads	14
0	i 'd give this machine 5 stars if 1 \) it was n't so expensive and 2 \) it was n't so darn small it barely fits anything inside it works well for pacifiers and a rattle or two but that 's about it anything else just wo n't fit and the design of the inside with the piece in the middle makes it even more restricting in my personal opinion this product is not worth the money i am so disappointed because it sounded so perfect but its just not	14
1	this is a great barber style setup it comes with a lot of guides and has a little case they even give you a garbage bag good dea	14
0	i ordered 2 of these only 1 came with the ac plug that was disappointing	14
1	amazon still has n't quite figured out how to ship these mine arrived with one case broken open although the whole thing had been stuffed in a clear garbage bag	14
1	i am a big fan of 2 curling irons but they can be difficult to find my last one \( different brand \) wore out a couple years ago and i had a hard time finding a replacement until now i have shoulder length hair fairly thick plus wavy and frizzy 2 curling irons do a great job of smoothing and straightening my hair while also turning it under \( or up if desired \) at the ends for a nice finished look i find it much easier and faster than using a traditional flat straight iron while achieving superior results you will not get curl with this curling iron you will get smooth hair quickly and easily highly recommended	14
1	this would be a perfect curling iron if heated to a slightly higher temperature it takes a little longer to curl my hair because of the lower temperature	14
1	i find this product to be very good for calfs one of the best foot massagers i 've ever tried the one drawback is that it tends to slide away from you when you are using it on your feet i would reccommend it	14
1	i 've used hot air brushes for a couple years this works better than my last the low setting and the larger brush works better for me the high setting blows the hair off the bristles it 's nice having the small brush option for different styles though i believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron	14
1	has all of the features that i wanted digital readout body fat monitor relatively easy to set up	14
1	a very gentle undereye cream i have used other name brands which extensively irritated my eyes and made them tear all the time this one is definitely a keeper	14
0	this does n't even deserve 1 star this supposed relaxation gadget was a complete waste of time and money it had no heat as advertised and the vibration just left my ears itching \( \) instead of relaxing it has increased my stress level 150 ! ! \(	14
0	they have to be lubricated several times during a hair cut my hair is very short and this is unusual if you do not go over every area of your head at least 5 times you will have tiny haris sticking out i spent more on these clippers thinking they would be better i would have been better buying a cheap pair at walmart which i normally do	14
1	lightweight easy to transport easy to put together just remember the person in the chair cannot maneuver on their own someone must be able to push but what a great product	14
0	i like to use the wet wipes they 're good products i gave only 2 stars because the package was n't packed well i received the package this week all seals of three boxes were broken lids fell off and the wipes were everywhere in the package they were dried up but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet and it almost fell apart what a mess it was !	14
1	i really liked the outside design of the book a lot of books were cartoonish and really was drawn to the look of the book i wish the book did not have so much random fill in pages i had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events ages of the child but all in all i am pleased with it i would most likely buy again	14
1	i have used opti free enzymatic cleaner for years still with the same great results i have a feeling this type of product wo n't be around much longer because my using extended wear contacts seems to be a rarity at my optometrist 's office where everyone else is wearing the disposal lenses that are always in stock	14
0	i was very disappointed with this product not only did it come in a foreign \( chinese \) box it does n't work well at all the powder that was included actually made it worse if i were you i would keep searching	14
0	please note that any electric razor requires at least 10 days use in order to properly condition the skin so that you can have a good shave with it i have used the panasonic es8043 for about 20 days now and it still tears my face to shreds every time i use it stay clear of this device unless you have stubble like a porcupine it 's like french kissing jaws the worst part is that no matter how bad you let it tear at you you still have stubble left that no amount of choppi shaving will remove seriously this must be one of those devices left over from the spanish inquisition	14
1	i was really enjoying my oregon scientific pedometer i found it easy to use and accurate however after 1 month it accidentally fell on the floor and that was it it no longer works i will probably buy another one but it needs to be treated with kid gloves	14
1	i was hesitant to spend this much money on a shaver but i am so glad i did this one gives me a really good shave i have had it for one month and have not used a hand razor since another review says the cleaning process is a bit loud which it is but since you turn it on and leave it i just close the bathroom door so the noise is not a problem	14
0	like the reviewer below my dryer also stopped working within a short period it was never dropped or misused after about a month it simply refused to turn on when plugged in now there is a decent warranty for the product however with the money you spend on shipping and the 4 they request for handling return shipping buying another inexpensive dryer starts to sound like a better deal i do n't know if the other reviewer and i got the only two lemons but since we both found our way to amazon with this review i would n't recommend the product to other buyers	14
1	my husband is very pleased with his self cleaning razor although he did n't like the idea of having to keep purchasing the cleaning solution packs it 's an excellant appliance	14
1	love it ! love it ! love it ! it 's like a high pressure car wash \( i do n't sound like a high pressure salesman \?	14
0	this product has not been certified that the harmful mercury has been distilled out by chance i read an article today in the jan 16 issue of time by andrew weil m d he advises strongly that fish oil be mercury free weil also lists the mercury free fish species to buy he recommends anarctic krill oil amazon has it but it is expensive i guess i 'll throw out the almost full bottle of nature made read up on it mercury is bad stuff	14
0	very disappointing the shower head itself is massive the size of a small dinner plate it is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it ca n't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use predictably when you turn on the shower the head drops groundward spewing water in a horizontal spray installs easily but save your money	14
0	i really dun know if i was expecting too much out of this machine but its not really that great there are just one or two sounds that u may like like the running stream heartbeat tropical forest etc the rest of them like the ocean waves rainfall thunderstorm white noice etc pretty much dont let u sleep also someone complained here about the alarm what alarm \? \? \? \? \? thats a different model which is about 20 this one is just the sounds which sound artificial if u are expecting a more natural sound move on this one is more like a radio with too much static !	14
1	so far these fit the bill just used them for the first time find that they are easy to put on and comfortable and better yet do n't interfere with jewelry as they would if they hung off a chain rope string	14
0	i bought these for my dad for christmas and they did not fit his head they did n't even fit mine and i have an average size head another thing they did not look cool at all they were ridiculous looking nothing like the photoshopped pictures	14
1	i had reasently bought this vibrator because i like trying out did kinds of vibrators to get more pleasure from and well i would have to say this one and my magic wand vibrator well i like this one better because it is cordless so i can use it anywhere in my home even away from an outlet like in my car and no cord gets in the way it also has a very flexable soft head that feels really very good when i use it it has really strong motor that can make me have some exteme orgasms that fell very good and last it looks to be made very well so it probly will last pretty long i hope so	14
0	amazon is claming great entry level charger system charges four aa aaa nimh batteries in 6 10 hours includes four 2300mah nimh aa batteriesit is only 1800mah which makes these rechargeable an average capacity by today standards while if it was as amazon claims it would have been a nice step up shame on amazon oversight or misrepresentation charger is cheaply made it can charge 4 aa or only 2 aaa poor design the charger that came with my camera can do 4 aaa go figure get something else	14
1	these are marvelous ! ! i had gotten a different style last february for mothers these adventure towels are great for the dorm and college kids i love the snap strap and the pouch now all of my children want them too ! ! also love the up to date colors !	14
1	this product does make the appetite disappear ! ! however it made me very irritable while i took it i took it for four days so i did not give it enough time to see how the fat burning part worked the pills were also very long and caused me throat irritation everyone is affected differently when taking things so i would say give it a try you will notice the effects right away	14
0	this stuff does not work at all ! i tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that did n't have negative feedback save yourself money and do not buy this product it looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lense	14
1	i have had this model for years ! and i cut my hair with it 3 4 times a month between me my sons it is the best clipper set i have ever owned most clippers i buy only last 1 2 years i have had this one i think 5 6 years ! well worth the money	14
1	i bought the remington mb 300 mustache and beard trimmer for my husband and was holding my breath as he is very picky he has a gorgeous full beard and keeps it precisely trimmed the remington has several adjustments for length that pleases him the most it trims whatever he aims it at and does it well it is light weight and maneuvers easily	14
1	i found this product to be very unique and helpful in that i could quickly remove retain the glasses around my neck being far sighted i have come to need reading glasses and these are perfect for my needs i can look 'down' through them and look 'over the frame' for distance all while they are secured around my head and neck i do hiking using a gps device and these glasses allow me to look down at the gps device in my hand while also looking forward towards my path of travel thank you for the innovative product	14

0	i purchased these but had to return them while the molded strap is adjustable it only opens up approx 1 the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23 5 or larger around at the eyebrows forget it these will not fit you	14
0	i bought these professional clippers only to discover they are very unprofessional ! i am very disatissfied with this product and would not reccomend it to anyone the blades guards slip off easily and the clippers get stuck in my hair which hurts a lot try looking for a better quality hair clipper	14
1	so far this dryer is working great ! another brand did n't last 1 year so i hope this one lasts longer	14
0	nothing but problems with unit since i received it either it did not work when i went to use it or it had lost its memory and had to be recalibrated all over again never had the same weight reading twice ! the only reason i rated it with 1 star is because it would not let me enter anything less	14
1	this product was reffered to me by my hairstylist after she noticed alot of frizziness and breakage in my hair this has worked beautifully to protect my hair from the blowdryer and straightening iron ! i would give this product 10 stars if it were available ! my hair is very smooth and very healthy looking because of this product and other products by chi i absolutely recommend this to anyone	14
1	very convenient reading glasses you could hang them on your neck when not using them and not even notice they are there they are very sturdy and are flexible making them almost imposible to break cons both sets i purchased i notice them to be on the narrow side they sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face the glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair as the glasses would trap your hair against your face	14
1	have n't had to clean it yet and it keeps the humidity level in out daughter 's room between 41 and 53 we have had it for 3 months now and no problems at all works as advertised and worth every penny	14
1	i am a busy architect and this is the 2nd pair of clics i own if you are active and need reading glasses they are perfect their only drawback is that they take two hands to put on ! i 'dlook at slimming down the frames to make them less heavy and trimmer lastly i 've found these readers to be really rugged and good for outdoor use	14
1	this dispenser is easy to install and works perfectly every time after initially filling the dispensers it took several pumps for the product to dispense but after that it comes out on the first push of the button it has been very convenient in my shower and no more shampoo bottles all over the shower ! it also saves on my shampoo because the kids just push the button twice to dispense the amount they need instead of pouring shampoo out of the bottles and using more than they need	14
0	it looks alot better than it works very bad vibrations	14
0	this epilator by emjoi does not work without the cord attached the motor is too weak in addition the only disks that work at all are the two on the ends the middle disks since they are inset from the top never reach the hair i had to return this item and i would not trust or recommend any item by emjoi extremely poor quality and does not work as promised	14
0	the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head \( but be careful of buns \) the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet	14
0	i got one of these to help me after i had major surgery i have better than average hand and arm strength but i found this particular model to be hard to operate \( i ca n't imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it \) normal sized cans \( like soup or beans \) slipped out of its pitiful grip i wound up using it just to roll things to myself when i dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash this is definitely a lightweight too light for much real use i should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more	14
0	this cannot be the real thing the scent does n't last 5 minutes what a waste of 50 00 i am so disappointed	14

0	worst product on the market ! a huge disappointment i was very careful to use as directed the result \? one big mess ! the lens were smeared and foggy with bubbles in them and i had no choice but to throw them away	14
0	however after using for 10 minutes it automatically shuts off and would not come back on straightened and dried my hair beautiful but spend the extra money at sephora because everyone is getting bad irons from amazon it is really sad that no one can get one that is worth what you pay so if you have had good luck with one so far be glad because i paid for the 2 day shipping could n't wait and have great disappointment because now i have to return it !	14
0	this product does not massage at all just vibrates i have it under my desk at work and rarely use it very disappointing	14
1	well this is marketed as a quick and healthy snack for kids but i find it perfect for me it 's a great charge of chocolate and not too many calories and bit of fiber what more can you ask for	14
1	easy to open package tastes good stays fresh after opening and not using all at once does what it 's advertised to do	14
1	have used this product on myself for many years when particapating in ultra endurance cycling events as well as on my family when vacationing in tropical area 's where the sun will cook you quickly without adequate sun protection do not be fooled by thinking you will not get tanned by using spf 45 or better that is a misconception why not walk away from your experience in the sun without the discomfort of sun poisoning found best result 's when put on indoors prior to being in the sun	14
0	i wo n't be buying these because there is not enough public comments or even actual photos of people using these goggles if you look closely on the example photos provided by amazon the people that supposingly wear these things then you 'll notice they are n't really wearing them its just drawn	14
0	i bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son 's fast growing hair he 's got thick hair that we like to keep buzzed short the first time i used the clippers he complained that they really pull at the hair i realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair i buzzed the little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair i 've decided to send it back reasonably priced but not worth the pain not recomended for thick hair	14
0	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele the fusion is a classic example from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel do n't buy into the hype the fusion is an expensive joke of a product	14

1	this product works great for water retention i like that it does n't keep you running to the ladies room works great	14
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled when i read chocolate pecan pie i expected just that the taste of rich chocolate with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base what i received was a bar with little taste nothing at all similar to the name on the bar in my opinion the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it the flavor is barely there the bar is dry it is never again be on my purchase list	14
1	for me a good tweezer is well worth paying for and this is a very good tweezer i had the same one this brand for six years and then dropped it and it went out of alignment i immediately ordered my new tweezer if not dropped i suspect this would last a lifetime	14
0	ordered this item on sept 28 they were supposed to ship it within 1 week after 1 week i received an email they said they needed 2 more weeks another email today \( nov 7 \) they think they can deliver it by november 27 that 's 2 months after i placed my order at this point i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year fortunately with amazon they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order which is what i am going to do right now	14
1	i was very happy with the prpduct and the shipping was very quick even in the middle of the holidays i will probably order another 3 inch memory foam from allsleep for my queen size bed	14
0	fails at it most basic function to provide a non leaking seal you might as well throw the top away and just use your hand to coverthe top	14
0	sleepmd did not work for me and in fact kept me awake most of the night the next day i felt horrible partly because i got no sleep and partly because i had been ripped off for 20 i threw the pills in the trash and will never purchase any md product again	14
1	i knew a man who once wore this classic cologne and always smelled so good i bought it for my hubby this christmas and instantly remembered why i loved that smell so much it is a classic frangrance not stinky or overpowering but fresh there are other vetiver cologne 's out there but they smell nothing like the guerlain from france it 's a gorgeous smell and i guarantee you would love it if you are looking to smell great without it being overpowering it 's smooth and mellow fresh	14
1	i love the idea of the glasses always being where i can find them the only problem is they need to also be adjustable for how wide the band is every time i look up the magnets pop apart if they fix that i 'd give them 5 stars ! !	14
0	having owned several panasonic wet dry shavers over a 20 year period i can with authority say that this model is a big disappointment the battery life is outstanding but that 's because the motor speed is so slow it 's not using much juice and with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor the next time i wo n't pinch pennies the higher priced models from panasonic are worth the price difference	14
1	i was skeptical about this product but tried it anyway it does work and it does eliminate the dip in the middle our mattress had formed this has given our mattress a little more life so it will last a little longer until it 's time to give in and buy a new one	14
1	happy with price and product very very easy to use fast and accurate	14
1	i get this stuff for my husband he 's got really thick hair and it has the tendency to get oily but this stuff makes his hair perfectly soft and shiny it 's worth the money	14
1	you know right away your teeth feel different much like how they feel after a dentist cleaning the dual action \( larger \) head is gentler and feels more like a normal toothbrush but it certainly is n't as aggressive as the smaller one in it 's ability to clean if you can handle the smaller heads they certainly do a better job the flossing attachment was also very effective	14
0	i bought this for my husband and son and was not even able to give one hair cut it pulled the hair and did n't cut well my husband kept complaining that it hurt and was pulling since i could n't finish i had to use our old clippers to get the job done this was so disappointing but i guess you get what you pay for	14
0	product does n't really do anything more than blow air it does n't appear to do anything with the ultraviolet light	14
1	they had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and i stayed at and i fell in love with it ! i had to have one of my own and thanks to amazon i was able to find one this is an excellent product my husband installed it easily and i would never be without one again one side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good lol and eyelining is a breeze though he would never admit it my husband uses also \( trimming mustash nose hairs \( eewww \) shaving etc \) great product order one you will not be dissapointed !	14
1	upgraded from an old norelco to this and just love it shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip the only con i see is the 8 hour charge time which has been the norm for norelcos in this class for a long time if you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price this is a great choice	14
0	after one year of owning this scale i replaced the batteries and it stopped working	14
0	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me every head is different so maybe they 'll work better for you	14
0	i bought this product and thought i would be very happy with it i was not it snagged and quit and was overall a piece of crude very unhappy with this purchase	14
1	i purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it well made with good trim length settings it 's also easy to hold recommended	14

1	i find the item in perfect shape and operates effectivelythank you so muchbimvik	14
0	this product just does n't cut my nose hair as close as the panasonic it replaced if i could remember the model of the panasonic i would mention it in this review i hope i can find the manual for the panasonic so i can get another one beware that many of the new designs are going this rout \( even panasonic \) the manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration but i think its more of a liability issue on their part \( someone probably got sued for a nicked nose \) i just wo n't buy their products anymore if they 're going to design them for marginal performance	14
0	i have used three of these the first two each lasted a year before shorting out i kept buying them because i liked the cordkeeper function this last one though shorted out and started a fire i have notified the company and will see what happens but i doubt that i will purchase another it 's obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market	14
0	i 've used this trimmer only twice but my initial opinion will lead me to return it when trimming my moustache it 's nearly impossible to get the areas close under the nose i used it to cut my sons hair but it kept binding up and pulling his hair i ultimately gave up and returned to the old oster clippers i have they buzzed right through with no problem i 'll be sending this item back	14
1	there are several listings for this item in different versions before making a decision check out the other versions you will see many different reviews overall it seems to be as long as you use the product as intended it works ! you can see my full review under zeno pro pink	14

0	i like this hairdryer when it works ! it has broken twice on me the first time it starting spitting out sparks so i sent it back they sent me a new one \( of course i had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back \) and now it only works on low the high is broken i am going to throw it out and get a different brand not impressed !	14
1	received my pack of 4 in 2 days with the free ship option shop rite sells individual box for 8 99 so even the regular price of 32 beat that the 10 additional promotion was icing on the cake	14
0	i suspect that the phrase mentioned in the title of my review \( which i saw in the description of the product \) was amazon 's idea since most \( if not all \) of the label information is easily found on nature made 's own website www naturemade com there you will find that several of the components are synthetic \( not necessarily bad but i like to know \) and also that amazon is near the top in selling price of the 6 listed online retailers for this particular product ai n't it just amazing what the web can teach you \? thanks amazon ! \)	14
1	my wife and i have used this a few times now and really like it from a novice 's point of view this is a great meditation aid i like being able to get the visual feedback as i calm and center myself i guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as i try to accomplish the task in front of me it 's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack	14
1	the product smells really good is very affordable and helps maintain my hair style all day i highly recommend trying it i will make it part of my daily hairdress \( grooming \) for life !	14
0	i got this humidifer for my daughter 's bedroom she loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time then automatically shut off tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail i had to return it however i did buy the penguin shape for my 2nd daughter 's room and that one works great	14
1	i absolutely love this scale ! it is easy to program and enjoyable to use best of all it 's beautiful to behold	14
0	i simply love most all of olay products especially the regenerist line until i bought the tone enhancer it did nothing for my face not one thing stated on the tube happened to my skin i guess i will use it as a moisturizer until it 's gone	14
0	i wish i 'd listened to the other reviews i bought this and it heated for exactly two months and then quit on me claims a five year warranty but i ca n't return it to amazon so it 's just money wasted be smarter than me avoid this product if you value your money	14
1	i use these almost every morning they 're hot and ready to go in seconds i like the nonslip surface of the curlers makes it so easy to set my hair remove and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style i like having 12 large rollers to handle my thick long hair these rollers rock	14
0	the size is good but the second one we ordered leaked the cap did not fit the after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container warmer which costs only 6 10 dollars in the market around too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product	14
0	i purchased these but had to return them while the molded strap is adjustable it only opens up approx 1 the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23 5 or larger around at the eyebrows forget it these will not fit you	14
1	pink sugar is a wonderful scent i have received many compliments on this fragrance its not a strong scent nor is it perfumey it is however a sweet scent everyone i know that has this fragrance loves it at this price 32 14 for 3 4 oz spray you cannot find it cheaper anywhere else and free shipping on top of that i say buy it you cannot go wrong	14
0	thought this would save time and be easier than a blow dryer and round brush but no my hair is long ish and kind of fine straight the brushes would not grab the hair enough like my regular round hair brush so i could n't get the full volume results i wanted i can see how those with thick or wavy hair would fare better it is very loud though i returned mine	14
1	this was sent to my daughter and son in law as a thank you present for a recent visit i had noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought it would be a great way to neaten it up they love it ! ! ! not only does it get rid of the clutter and make it easier to dispense soap shampoo etc my son in law can now shave in the shower and keep his shaving paraphernalia there as well	14
1	i bought the first mattress topper for myself and my husband after the first night i knew i wanted one to put in our rv too my husband complained about the smell when i unpacked the topper but that dissipates quickly and he too slept well and woke up without back pain for the first time in years he had me order one for his sister for christmas i thought my sister would enjoy this comfortable mattress topper so now i have purchased four ! this is a wonderful product i would recommend it to anyone	14
1	good product does what it says however it could smell better it has almost no scent you smell clean but it has almost no scent other than that it feels great lathers great leaves your skin feeling nice and it clears your skin up	14
1	although i am a writer who composes on the computer i often do my editing on hard copy in a comfortable chair until i started using the posture rite lap desk i could not do this comfortably now i have it it fits my lap perfectly i use it and love it i recommend it highly	14
0	i bought this from qvc it will do the trick for quick touch ups not close hair removal but close enough unfortunately mine is barley operating anymore even with a fresh battery i'm not sure why the motor seems to be dying maybe the life of the trimmer is not that long as a result i think it would be better to buy a cheaper one since it should work just as well	14
0	every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight we returned it to amazon probably the first time we 've ever had to do that for the price it should at least work also in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner it earns two stars for looking great i would not recommend it	14
0	using this on my legs feels like electric shocks because of how it pulls and chews i would n't dare use it on my underarms very poor shaver ! !	14
1	this is the last hair straightener you will every buy heats up quickly and straightens long thick and even curly hair in minutes have n't stopped receiving compliments since i started using it	14
0	this product was not as i expected it is much weaker than ones used in the past it certainly was not worth the price i paid i returned this item	14
1	i was looking for a lightweight simple wet dry shaving device that had inexpensive replacement foil and blade assemblies the panasonic wes9941p fit perfectly gives a nice shave and it 's so easy to clean it replaces my old braun single head linear \( i like the panasonic better \) the batteries supply over two weeks of shaves on a single charge give it a few weeks of shaves to break in to cut real close	14
0	this scale is too small i have size 11 feet and my feet dont fit on the scal	14
0	first of all the battery that was supposed to be enclosed was not when i bought a 9 volt battery and installed it it would not stay attached when putting it back in the battery compartment finally i got a read out and entered my height and age then i stood on the scale and got nothing no weight no body fat nothing but the word error at which point i boxed it up and sent it back for a refund	14

0	this flat iron combo curler is not worth the money that i spent for it first of all it does not get hot enough to straighten my hair although i must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry if anyones hair is the least bit thick it will not work i wish i had spent more and got the sedu since it had very good reviews now i have to start over and buy a new one because this iron cannot be returned if it has been opened now tell me how anyone would know if it works or not if it is not opened and used duh	14
1	i 've been using nicads for long long time and while in some applications the alkaline might last somewhat longer the money saved after just a couple of recharges is worth the extra expense of buying twice as many as one needs and just keep on recycling the batteries from flash units gps walkie talkie 's flashlights etc however these newer nimh are just great no memory shelf and longer current life nicads and alkaline 4 stars these do get a	14
0	i was trying to make the shift from a razor blade to an electric shaver and found that this shaver did not provide the close shave i was looking for it also was taking me much longer to shave because i had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs in the end after using it for 5 weeks i took advantage of the 60 day return policy and returned the shaver i am back to my razor blade i still hate shaving	14
1	as a reviewer of the hitachi magic wand i can say that this accuvibe seems just as adaquate to do the job the plus is that this can be used with or without the power cord perhaps just not as powerfull as the hatachi but pretty dam comparable if not the same the cordless battery operation is worth the trade off as mentioned it does the job	14
0	i purchased this lumbar support for a recent back problem big mistake ! it simply will not stay put no matter what chair i tried it with the arch that is supposed to help relieve back pain and give support is just too much it has you bending over backwards i believe it actually made my back ache more	14
1	this product is totally awesome it works great no problems at all since i have mostly carpteting in my apartment i have to move it to a hard surface every time i want to use it it zeros perfectly every time and gives me an accurate reading when compared to the doctors scale	14
0	after a very positive review by a popular consumer magazine i purchased this scale on the unit i received the upper weight range appears to be overstated by some 20 lbs the scale i was previously using and the one in my doctors office clearly have my weight below the 300 lb limit i have been lifting weights and somewhat discouraged by the scale alone i wanted to see if i was having an impact on body fat so i purchased this scale when i attempt to use this scale it errors out with the ol code perhaps the magazine should retract another article	14
0	i thought buying a item with a well known name as this would be great i would have hoped the price would even out my possible satisfaction for this product also i loved the pink when i opened the box the plates on the flat iron were hanging off i tried to snap them into place but they would not stay for the amount of money i payed i expected a much better product needless to say i returned it the next day	14
0	you were kind enough to replace my first order of these razors due to the fact that one never worked and the other wore out quickly the second pair seems to be pretty much the same one sputs and spurts and the other works only when i shake and tap it several times i used to own another brand of these razors that were great but i ca n't recall the name unfortunately i am very disappointed in the product but i'm very satisfied with amazon and the way in which they are trying to please me every way they can	14

1	i 've tried for literally the last 6 years to find a way to straighten my hair \( and have it stay straight \) ! i am happy to say that i 've finally found something that works ! i 've had many different straighteners and this one is by far the best i have long curly hair and this straightener gets it done in about 20 minutes much better than the hour i'm used to plus the straightening lasts my hair stays completely flat all day instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other straightener you simply ca n't get better than this !	14

0	it 's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror i suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification the light is not great at all it 's very dim one of the good qualities of the mirror is that it 's cordless and comes with an adapter if you do n't have batteries handy	14
0	i bought this after i read the first review below \( the one who gave this 5 stars \) it just does n't work very well i do a better job pumicing on my own \( it just takes more effort \) the motor does get extremely hot and the batteries die very quickly the box says it can run for 45 minutes on two aa 's but after about 5 minutes you can feel it slow down definitely not worth it i'm calling today to return it	14

1	initially the sensation made me giggle after a couple uses i got used to the process and have even changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly my teeth feel cleaner mouth fresher and i'm hopeful that i will no longer get the floss lecture from my dental team now that 's something to smile about !	14
0	i have never used such an impactless \( if that is a word \) product there is absolutely no effect whatsoever not even remotely it is simply a waste of money and bottle i am terribly disappointed you are better off blowing air and water over your ingrown hair areas for better effect	14
1	these wipes are awesome ! they got here real fast too !	14
0	picked this up to try out because of the ratings price did n't do a thing for me wipe it on let it haze and wipe it off no difference	14
1	this was almost too strong for me at first i put it on the lower level of the house and it took away that basement smell for months i was impressed with the throw this thing had i would definitely repurchase	14
1	when i do n't eat as many veggies as i should these are easy to take	14
1	this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure we 're yet to verify what the culprit is but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch i would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist inflatable blood pressure monitor it 's been consistant reliable and informative for both myself and my doctor	14
0	the brush completely feel apart prior to using it i sent a review to the company with no response the wooden back fell off of the handle and then the loofah fell off of the backing if i would have had some response from the company offering some recourse i would not have been this dissatisfied	14
1	this edger is a perfect match with the wahl beard mustache trimmer you can do a real professional job with these two items robert paul jone	14
0	the hair dryer is very heavy also while i like the yellow design of the dryer itself the yellow cable makes this look rather like a home improvement tool	14
0	i ordered the regular size they were to big the smaller size \? too small neither one fit well but both did one thing well hurt the area under my eyes buyer beware	14
0	i have been using cross product for lat 15 years this product which is made in china has highly disappointed me the finish of the pen is very poor gold plating is of a poor quality it has some patches of a different color the body has sharp edges overall it has spoilt my impression about cross products regardsr p kal	14
1	works great no problems after 4 months	14
0	this product flat out sucks ive been shaving my head for years and never had issues with clippers had a basic remington beforethis product gives me nothing but trouble	14
0	this product come with a washer that keep causing the leak it works fine for few weeks then the washer become worn out and it keep causing the leak now i just leave it in my garage and ca n't return it or use it very bad investment	14
0	though not advertised to humidify a large room i found it incapable of making any significant difference in even a small room i tested it in a roughly 1000 cubic foot room by placing a relative humidity sensor in the middle of the room and after 2 hours not even a 1 increase in humidity ! fortunately i was able to receive a full refund	14
0	a big disappointment after filling with hot water as instructed the water temp cooled off immediately regardless of the warmer as advertized it was too shallow to cover the feet if massage attachments were in place i returned it for a refund	14
1	i was n't sure what to expect when i 1st tried this two part microdermabrasion peel kit i use it twice a week and what a difference it has made on my skin the only thing is i wish they made a bigger bottle of the peel mariann	14
0	unless you have the physique of an nba player find another make of massager this one is too heavy hard or impossible to hold and very awkward to use if used by one person on another it might be usable on the positive side it does give you a good massage	14
0	i really like the size of this pitcher but there is one thing that i'm not too happy about the filter does n't lock down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out the filter plops out of the top causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher it 's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it 's worth the other brita pitcher i have the filter locks into place and does n't do this	14
0	i bought this product thrilled with the thought that i could use an epilator in the shower even though that 's possible the very last thing this product does is remove hair at least with the epilator head the shaving head works fairly well but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better i ca n't believe panasonic thinks they 'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective	14
1	i appreciate the gentle yet powerful cleaning of all free clear allergen detergent i have an infant find this cleans her clothes ours well without leaving any harsh irritants so it 's easier to do the family 's laundry all together	14
1	i bought this dryer based on other people 's review it is an excellent dryer the air flow is strong and it dries my medium to long hair faster than my old one ever did i did n't give it 5 stars because it is a bit heavier than most dryers however since it dries my hair fast my arms do n't mind the weight \) 2 thumbs up in my book ! !	14
0	hello i recently bought this blood pressure monitor it functions all well but it gives incorrect readings i mean the readings vary significantly not once twice but many many times i was and am never sure about the validity of the readings purchase this at your own risk my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors atleast u will know that the readings r genuine and u can always find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings take care and stay healthy	14
1	we use the zbars for breakfast and my kids love them ! i love them too as they 're organic contain no trans fat no refinded sugar or flour they 're yummy and healthy	14
1	i wanted a cordless shaver because at my age \( 49 \) i need my glasses on to see the hairs i'm shaving and that does n't work well in the shower ! this braun is a good buy easy to use and works well if you follow the directions and shave slowly it 's not as close or smooth as a blade and shaving gel but it 's quicker and less mess so i think it 's a good trade off	14
0	i 've been taking these for over 3 weeks i have not seen any new hair growth i think that new hair that does grow will be stronger but this has not caused my hair to grow any faster i would suggest just buying hair supplement vitamins from gnc or any other place you can find them they are much less expensive	14
0	picked this up to try out because of the ratings price did n't do a thing for me wipe it on let it haze and wipe it off no difference	14
1	this is very easy to use and quite convenient i'm not sure however how accurate this monitor is it seems to record a higher reading than a manual one at times the value of this home monitor is if the readings change dramatically then it 's a warning to go to the doctor 's	14
0	i bought 300 and 500 units they are not working in my small condo i cannot find the place to see how they finally work	14
0	this pitcher is designed so that when you try to empty it pour out all the water the filter comes crashing out ! it 's top heavy i much prefer my dispenser that lives in the fridge it may be clumsy to refill which is why i thought i 'd try a pitcher but it 's extremely easy to use	14
1	these are great glasses easy to put on and take off and are there around your neck waiting for you to use them i saw them on the csi ny coroner on tv and had to find some amazon was the place to go	14
1	very convenient to use however since the neck band is rigid and does not fold it is difficult to carry	14
1	i came across the hooah drink because my boss a retired military man running for office always has a case lying around with campaign season heating up and workdays getting crazy long these are invaluable for getting me through the day and keeping my thoughts coherent apparently military studies said these drinks improve alertness by fifty percent i ca n't measure that in myself of course but i do sense a dramatic improvement	14
1	i have been using this line of products since they were marketed my plastic surgeon \( not used for facial needs \) keeeps remarking on my skin and has to remind himself that i am 61 !	14
1	i really like this product it 's very dry and windy here and my lips have been very chapped the neutrogena has helped 100 when nothing else worked ! ! i 'll definitely buy this product !	14
1	i was amazed at how well this device worked and how easy it was to setup out of the box the best part naturally is how well it worked on clearing out my clogged nasal passages i feel refreshed everytime i used it it took awhile to get the drainage to stop but i am glad i purchased this system it works	14
0	do not buy this iron it 's fabulous while it works for which it does merit the one star but it broke in less than a week it overheated or something and then would n't turn on again but here 's the kicker if you buy it from amazon the company wo n't honor the warranty i do n't have particularly heavy duty hair this is just totally unacceptable	14
1	these are a helpful item for me the cloth pockets are nice and the instructions for microwaving are clear and simple	14
1	i am very satisfied with nizoral anti dandruff shampoo many anti dandruff shampoos tend to make my hair feel dry or rough i have thick waist length hair and nizoral got rid of the dandruff and left it feeling soft and easy to manage unlike some anti dandruff shampoos that have a medicinal smell nizoral has a pleasant fragrance i 'll definitely use this product any time i need a dandruff shampoo	14
0	these did nothing for me ask your doctor about aphthasol a prescription drug approved by the fda which means it 's passed rigorous government testing standards aphthasol changed my life	14
0	we received it with broken cover it did n't work properly and stopped running every hour we tried different ways to make it run but nothing worked we 've returned it it 's just waste of money on the other hand the cow humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well no complaints	14
1	we have a goldendoodle with a lot of hair and this clipper works wonderfully it breezes right through the thickest hair ! i highly recommend	14
1	i love all the varieties of chocolate and if you mix them in a blender they are smooth and creamy you can add a frozen banana or a couple of ice cubes and the shake is thick enough to be a milkshake shaking by hand or using a hand held mixer does not do these nutrition shakes justice these are a great meal replacement healthy nutritious and full of quality protein	14
0	all sleep md is is melatonin with a bunch of other herbs that do nothing mixed in you can get melatonin at any grocery or drug store at a fraction of the cost melatonin is a wonderful sleep aid but you do n't need to spend a bunch of money or take additional herbs to benefit from it ! sleep md is a total rip off	14
0	i just received my conditioner today and it 's going back to sephora i do n't know how this can be called a conditioner because it 's nothing more than water it also smells nothing like vanilla the only scent i could smell was coconut and i do n't want my hair smelling like that	15
0	i read many good reviews for this product on this site and elsewhere so i eagerly bought it it came in a quaint little tin but i thought it smelled kind of awful as a skin softner it worked well but i threw it out after using it only a few times because of the way it smelled	15
1	i love this fragrance ! it reminds me of some of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers of hawaii if you 've ever visited the islands and smelled a pikake lei or walked past luscious jasmine bushes and thought to yourself what is that heavenly smell \? this is it ! there is not a scent out there on the market that evokes such memories and enjoyment as kai my only concern about this fragrance line is the cost but how i feel and think when i am wearing it makes it all worth it	15
1	heads up lightening fast very cute purple works great i wonder if they make these smaller as well ill be looking i love this thing	15
1	this is the very best hairstyler and hair dryer in one ! i have very fine thick shoulder lenght hair and was a little skeptical that this product would be usefull for me it is ! actually it is the best hair styling product i have ever purchased it dries and sets my hair very quickly usually in five minutes or less what a timesaver i am so delighted with this product that i purchased eight \( 8 \) to keep in my closet so i do n't have to hunt for the best product ever ! ! !	15
0	i was excited to try out this product given all the rave reviews but after just 2 uses my face broke out in a rash ! it 's awful ! and i do not have sensitive skin by any stretch of the imagination i would not recommend this product	15
1	i use to be a huge calvin klien fan until i came across this product i 've been wearing it since 2000 and have not been without it since the ladies love the scent which is obvious as i 've had women come up and sniff me in public \( yes public and then be excused when asking me what brand of cologone i have on \) forget bout those axe and tag promo 's in the real world this is the stuff that get you remembered not just noticed	15
1	i love the shine lip glosses offer but really do dislike the stickiness when wearing a gloss lip prints come off on glasses \( paper cups are the worst ! \) napkins and whoever you 've just buzzed found the answer to the stickies with chanel 's aqualumiere line the lipsticks give the slick shine without the telltale spots it can be blotted and still shines as if that were n't enough it 's spf15 my favorite shade is macao a rosy pink	15
0	there is absolutely nothing special about this leave in conditioner besides the fact that it smells really good however i did n't see any changes in my daughter 's hair after using this conditioner none it is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly otherwise it will run down your face and neck \( wish it came with a spray pump instead \) i was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well known and has a lot of star celebrity power behind it however i found this conditioner to be all hype	15
1	i use both this mascara and lancome flextencils when i'm going out flextencils first then coat with hypnose my lashes look huge and not too clumpy flextencils add great length while hypnose adds volume i use hypnose by itself on just an average day great product ! makes my lashes big and not clump	15
0	is this shampoo or sap \? \? what exactly is it supposed to do \? \? i received a sample of this shampoo and i am ever so glad i got to try it free before i actually spent money on it not only did my hair feel like straw as mentioned by other reviewers but it was so heavy i could n't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo i 'll save this one for halloween	15
1	i had read about these new creme eyeshadows in one of the magazines within the last few months i decided to go to the counter at the bloomingdale 's near my house the sa at the counter said she thought based on my coloring and eyes that the rose gold would be a good choice for me i was looking for a shadow that could be good for daytime and also nighttime i took home the rose gold and it was really really beautiful on not only that but it is long lasting and does n't crease i may have to invest in one or more of the other colors available definitely a worthwhile purchase and the tube will last you a long time	15
0	this stuff has great shine but it dries my lips and it starts peeling and uber sticky	15
1	naturally with a name like buffy i would have tried this whether i like it or not i get these on a regular basis from friends and family who see my name splattered all over it lucky for me i like ever heard the expression 'soft as a baby 's butt' \? erm no \? easy simple to use obviously no messing with jars or bottles just go to town massaging those pesky areas i'm convinced it works wonders on orange peel skin and cannot be persuaded otherwise	15
1	i like this lotion it is moisturizing retexturing but sort of waxy hence the 4 stars but it is still good stuf	15
1	i like this product but am not sure it is worth the money i have bought other products for 5 at my local store and i seem to have similar results	15
1	the cream is great it instantly gets absorbed after application and i believe helps over time close up leakage of blood capilleries \( which causes black circle appearences \) i suffered from chronic dark circles this cream after 1 month of application has considerably lightened my dark circles and has reduced puffiness i would suggest anyone who is looking for an effective cream give this product a shot considering my condition i still have light dark circles left and hope this cream will continue to benefit me i still have doubts on this cream totally brightening my skin tone around my eyes but never the less i find it effective	15
1	this perfume is n't comparible to anything finally a totally unique scent ! it 's sweet and sexy and the scent changes with you i'm addicted to it so are the men !	15
0	i'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes i seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you ca n't smell a thing yes the scent is great i love it but the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me really really disapointed i guess i'm just used to the channel and ralph lauren lines they are quality and can last most of the day this stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days	15
1	i was given this product as a gift and i just love it i 'll often wear it on weekends without any additional makeup it smoothes this skin surface true the coverage is not the same as with a tinted foundation but it offers a lot of improvement worn alone also i was using a tinted cream makeup base that was not working well on my dry skin it would create lines etc so i started combining the two things the tinted cream base and the philosophy skin perfector together on a sponge before applying and bingo this solved the problem so if you want a tint plus the smoothness you might want to give this a try	15
0	i am a big philosophy fan i have bought the best facial cleanser ever from them \( purity \) i have two other fragrances that i bought scent unsmelled from them amazing grace is lovely and pure grace is tremendous get them do n't buy falling in love it 's yucky	15
1	i like this scent my first thought was pears before reading what the notes were yes apples this is not a hardcore apple scent but enough so very fresh and sweet but not too sweet crisp and spring like a hint a tiny hint of dandelions and a tiny bit of rose just a tiny bit my husband likes this scent on me as well which is saying a lot he hates roses and foody scents but still likes this	15
1	i absolutely love this scent i originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much i bought the lotion the scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell i have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells if you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you 'll love this	15
1	this scent is truly intoxicating i have tried various perfumes like arpege evelyn rose and j'adore but there was always something missing flower by kenzo is by far the most satisfying fragrance it has the elegance of arpege sensuality of evelyn rose and classiness of j'adore this product line also have matching deoderant so not to clash with the perfume how nice is that ! it is not too strong either but lasts for a long time i have at last found my favorite scent that makes me feel really good	15
1	i actually got a sample from the lush store in san francisco and just tried it it 's fabulous on my cracked and peeling heels	15
1	beyond paradise is a wonderful flirty floral scent that is n't too overpowering i recommend wearing it whenever you want to feel extra feminine	15
1	i was amazed by the quality of this product when i first purchased it in the summer of 2006 it gives my hair a perfect sheen and softness that i have never achieved with such lightweight hair oil before and my hair has acheive lengths that i have not seen in years ! tui hair oil has a beautiful scent which does not change over the course of wearing it in your hair for a day or two or even longer if you wish	15
1	o k these glosses are just plain yummy ! actually they do n't taste like lipglosses at all which is a good thing no one wants waxy orchemical flavored gloss thatmakes you want to throw up right \? all the flavors are amazingly delicious each one tastes just like sweets the colors are sheer and radiant without looking cheap or tacky they go with any eyeshadow or blush color and make your lips sparkle i wish the tubes were just a bit bigger and the glosses were less sticky overall nice glosses but a bit overpriced for such lil tubes	15
1	i bought this item as a gift but i have used philosophy products in the past they are wonderful and have an amazing fragrance ! ! and they produce amazing lather	15
0	happy has a really good smell but unfortinately its all gone after 5 mins it is like cheap colognes	15
0	maybe my expectations were too high due to the hype surrounding these products however this shampoo did not work for me like the previous reviewer said it was watery and did not lather at all it also made my hair feel stripped and left it very hard i followed up with a hair smoothie but a large amount of my hair broke off due to how dry and unmanageable the product left my hair i do not recommend this at all	15
1	i really like this peel it is very easy to use and i have noticed a difference in my skin it is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading i even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing i recommend this peel to anyone i have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation i use this one about twice a week i also recommend the microdelivery vitamin c peel that one i use once a week jennife	15
0	used along with shampoo theory my hair turned out worse than it ever had not recommended at least for medium wavy hair no frizz control	15
0	i used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend my face esp my forehead became very greasy and every pore on my forehead became inflamed i thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina my face cleared up instantly when the aquamarina ran out i went back to herbalism but surprise the skin problems reemerged now i'm using aquamarina instead and love it though you ca n't get it through amazon for some reason check the lush website i'm sure this wo n't happen to everyone but give that pink glop a try instead	15
1	beauty is hard work and savvy and so is this product you 'll find your fresh alluring face that 's been hiding since you were a young child	15
1	mac lipglass is the absolute best there are plenty of colors to choose from super shiny and the gloss is thick stays on and does n't run the best colors are nico for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine oystergirl is a shimmery baby pink oh baby is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick chai looks amazing with black smokey eyes it 's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer just pure shine	15
1	great scent and the body wash and the sparkling lotion alone is well worth the asking price i brought the same item inside of my local mall for twice what i am going to pay here and i never even had to leave the comfort of my own home thanks for the dea	15
1	i found it to have a little too much 'yellow' for my brows \( i have blonde grey hair but it performs well and i like the slim point i just mix in a little of my charcoal to soften the yellow	15
1	i love this formula for my thick naturally curly slightly hilighted hair it does a great job cleaning without stripping and this is the first conditioner that did a good job tackling my naturally curly hair without weighing it down i did get a good deal at my salon 9 for the shampoo and a little more for the conditioner	15
1	this is the best perfume that i have ever used i tried estee lauder lancome and i always come back to paloma the scent is wonderful and it stays on your clothes for a long time buy it today	15
1	i 've been using strivectin sd for almost two years there is n't a day that goes by that i do n't get a complement on my skin i do n't wear any make up aside from lipstick my skin alway glows and the fine lines are hardly visible i'm in the beauty business and i recommend this product to my customers i am not a spokesperson for the company only a happy and satisfied customer	15
0	i use the philosophy 3 in 1 with conditioner it works great and keeps my hair luscious the one time i accidentally bought a 3 in 1 that did n't have conditioner in it my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends after only three applications i had to throw the bottle out i lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair i do n't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality but they do this is one of their better scents however i would recommend using this as a body wash only	15
1	i really like this product because i have a natural do products that are too heavy do n't work this is perfect for my hair it makes it easier to style and it leaves my hair soft and smelling good	15
0	this shampoo made my hair flat and dry when i used it every day so i tried using another shampoo and used jonathan 's once a week the one day i used jonathan shampoo my hair was noticably flat and dull i ended up throwing it in the trash and went back to my old shampoo what a disappointment	15
0	the description represents a 2 ounce solid fragrance as a lover of all things philosophy i was very disappointed to get something half the size i expected which was 13 ounces ! my 2 stars are only because the fragrance is divine as are they all !	15
1	this is an amazingly fresh fragrance it 's a light lush and sparkling floral fruity blend a lot of people asked me what i was wearing i highly recommend it for someone looking for a nice scent that they can wear all day	15
1	simplify simplify simplify ! that 's what i try to do with my beauty routine hence i was first attracted to laura mercier's facial cleanser by its name one step cleanser i'm staying with it because it works no more separate purchases for eyemake removers or deep cleansers one step cleanser removes all traces of makeup even from the delicate eye area and leaves my skin feeling clean supple and nourished it 's both easy and effective	15
1	i bought this after using other murad products and loving them i like this but i would n't say i love it first it 's a bit overpriced i can get a comparable drugstore product for a fraction of the price the toner itself is decent but does n't seem to clean as deeply as other toners however for those who find toners to be a bit harsh this may be a good option non drying and does n't have that toner burn overall a decent product but not one i am sure i would re purchase	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
1	i 've been using this product for a few years now and it always rescues me when my eczema pops up in the cold weather i once did a comparison between cortisone cream and dream cream and the dream cream won hands down because it kept the scalies away longer than the cortisone did the scent is lavender herbal and very nice	15
0	i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time because i have very thick wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten it ended up taking just as long but the results were much better my hair was super straight and shiny and it did n't get frizzy even in humid weather then when i was using it for just the 4th time it completely stopped working just as other people described the red light shut off and it cooled down and never turned back on i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now	15
0	very clumpy ! i would never purchase this again it looked like i had one big eyelash they were all clumped together worse one i have ever used	15
1	i too am very pleased with this brush my previous brush had a ceramic handle that cracked this wood handle seems built to last the badger bristles are excellent i paid 10 unusually low price for a quality shave brush	15
0	when i first spray inis energy of the sea cologne spray i could not smell any thing ! then i spray more and more 'till i found out how it smells ! it has nice scent okay i 'll tell you how i found it it is not bad ! but despite that it does n't last for more than half an hour and then it hardly can be smelled you may need to have it with you all the time and spray every half hour this is what disappointed me the most ! i am telling you my taste here that is n't necessarily yours	15
1	i am a fan of ralph lauren and check new products from this brand i liked this scent although i am probably more used to polo blue which is also great it is better to get an idea in a store because it is not quite possible to decide from reviews anyway it is worth checking especially if you are looking for a new cologne for st valentine 's day	15
1	i received this product as a x mas gift this year i really do like it considering the last two philosophy products i did not care for \( the gingerbread man bodywash and amen cologne \) out of the tube it 's a little thick but you only need a thin layer to do the trick it offers up a nice smooth shave and my skin feels soft and moisturized afterward definitely a keeper	15
1	love this scent definately not too strong and it seems to last quite a while perfect for everyday wear it has a strong undertone of vanilla so if that 's not your bag i would n't recommend it	15
1	i 've used this cream for years i like the way it feels and makes my skin look i 'd recommend it to anyone	15
1	i purchased this after reading the reviews i had never heard of it let alone tested it i had some gift certificates thought i 'll be impulsive when i first opened it i thought oh no this is going to be heady \( or strong \) but it seemed to 'change within seconds upon application and got even better as it settled my daughter wears vera wang princess and she too loves lolita it 's my newest fav a possible signature scent for me will def buy again	15
0	after the debacle that was dirt i tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty is this a joke i am sure that jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here i am trying to wash this out of my hair with his very shampoo and all i have is tears clearly this is not product without tears	15
1	after a long day of hunching over my computer at work for 8 hours and a brutal workout after i came home tonight and enjoyed the best shower experience i have ever had by myself with a bath bar ! \) the cooling sensation of the wiccy magic muscles bar the cool air in the bathroom mixed with the warm water of the shower made for a incredibly relaxing blissful enjoyable shower i feel great ! i 'll sleep great tonight ! this experience has made me a lush customer for life	15
1	i discovered the murad acne complex kit about six years ago and have been using it since it cleared my acne up within weeks and has kept the acne away some products i tried dried my skin out but murad acne complex leaves it feeling clean and hydrated without all the chemical smells i recommend anyone with acne try murad acne complex to see if it will work as well for you	15
0	i did n't care for it it smelled good but that 's the only good thing i can say it neither helped or harmed my hair i do n't think i would buy it again	15
1	i used to sell iman when it was in a major department store this stuff would fly off the shelves too bad it was hardly ever in stock which made many customers go to something else i stuck with it for 10 years now and would not dare use anything else ! buy it you will not be disappointed	15
1	citylips has made my lips larger ! i love the clear i use it all day long i will buy this product again	15
1	i could n't resist the very feminine and retro look of the packaging and it does look cute in the bathroom that being said this is great to add a layer of sheen to the legs your calves look great without stockings i find it too waxy to use on the rest of the body but there 's nothing better on bare legs to add a glow to the skin especially to a tan try benefit 's flamingo fancy	15
1	the strawberry milkshake shower gel smells just like bonomo turkish candy i bought when i was a kid i like it but i think the shower gel is overrated due to exposure on qvc other shower gels are creamier than this i 'll enjoy using this and the eggnog then go back to making my own	15
1	for a guy who never paid attention to the face cream he used i found h2o plus to be amazing stuff non greasy no heavy scents it 's worth every penny	15
1	i took this supplement for 6 months and i noticed a dramatic change in hair appearance length and my nails ! ! i would like to keep taking it but i ca n't afford it for a while which i am really bummed out about it i definitely recommend this product it also has a huge celebrity following and now i know why	15
1	wow ! shesheido has done it again ! i love thier products ! i have oily skin so i like to blot my face once a day the papers are awesome very soft they soak up the oil and i can tell after i throw the paper away usually 1 sheet a day is all i need and my face is shine free ! i love them ! i also like this product becuase you get 100 sheets which is the most i have seen so far i love this product and will buy again	15
1	clinique 's bare brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever ! it has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it i have berrylicious \( sheer grape \) and cherry quartz \( sheer true red does n't look like it does on the color swatch \) and neither overwhelms my pale skin i would n't be caught dead without a bare brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse !	15
1	after buying some lush products from here i went into the lush store in pasadena where the staff was awesome and totally helpful after explaining my horrendous hair issues they gave me some samples of rehab retread and big and i bought a bottle of american dream they all work wonderfully rehab made my scalp tingly and my hair felt so soft my hair has literally never felt better i highly recommend rehab or any lush products for that matter	15
1	well for startes this is one of the best cologes out there the smell is chrisp and will last a long time it is a great cologne for any acasion i have many colognes and this one is on the top of my list very masculine but girls love it ! ! ! !	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
1	well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	15
0	all i can say is do not buy this i just got this stuff and used it for the first and last time it smells horrible it left a wax like film over my hair that was so bad i could not even get a comb through it i had to wash my hair \( with a different product of course \) at least 6 times to get it back to normal again what a complete rip off ! ! !	15
1	i gave this to my daughter for christmas and i do not think she has used it because i have used it every day and love it ! great for adult acn	15
1	almost immediately after using this face mask the redness in my face was gone it helps with a number or skin problems and i have sensitive skin so it 's hard to find a product that wo n't hurt me most facial masks cause a minor chemical burn this left my face beautifully soft if you 're unsure of this product or wavering at all let me tell you that you should buy it it 's amazing	15
0	this product did nothing for my t zone i was still very shiney and oily by mid day i recommend benefit 's dr feelgood i gave this product two stars because though it did n't control oil for me it did n't feel heavy or clog my pores	15
1	so glad to find this hard to find item ! i have tried every kind of polish dryer but it did the surface and left a tacky mess underneath for years i have used dry and shine with the great success it goes on like lotion drys to a haze and you buff it off to a beautiful hard shine and dry nails i love it ! ! ! it is magic ! ! ! !	15
0	okay but does not keep cool for long i do like the massage effect from the beads	15
1	seriously at first i thought it may be too harsh \( this from someone who has skin that can take a beating ! \) but after awhile i found it not harsh enough ! what i do now is apply it to dry skin for a more intense scrub trust me this stuff truly is wonderful	15
1	i love this perfume it 's the best that i have in my collection it 's not too strong but it 's enough for everyone to notice i practically wear it everyday and this size will usually last for a while	15
0	sorry to say i found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying something i have n't experienced with other removers in addition it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish on the plus side it 's fragrance free and reasonable in price	15
1	i received a free sample during clinique days at my local department store i wore it the next day to work and received several compliments on how clean and light it smelled two coworkers even went out within the next week and purchased some for themselves it is perfect for a light clean scent during the day to wear to work or a day out with friends or that special someone it smells wonderful but not as though you are trying too hard perfect	15
1	moisturize and refresh yourself as you relax in this foamy bath your stress will soak away and you 'll feel truly happy	15
1	i have very sensitive skin a thick beard and must shave daily what a hellacious combination ! the art of shaving for sensitive skin is the best shaving cream i have found and i have been searching far and wide as for the rest of their products eh i could take them or leave them i e there are similar products you can acquire much cheaper this shaving cream in particular has no alcohol and all kinds of natural ingredients including a bunch of non comudegenic \( sp \? \) oils that really protect your skin	15
0	i bought the cream hoping to get rid of or at least lighten stretch marks from pregnancy i have used it three times a day for 3 months and have seen no results it smells horrible and having to apply 3 times a day is really a pain in the hind parts i was very optimistic after reading some of the other reviews i'm now very disappointed if something sounds too good to be true it is	15
0	this foam product by jonathan is okay the reviews on his products are highly overrated the price does n't bother me at all there are better foams for thin and limp hair	15
1	best face cream ever but even though cosmetic mall com had it for less the three week shipping and poor service from usps from china i 'll pay the extra buck and get it from nordstom again next time	15
0	this mascara works great it lengthens separates and defines your lashes and it does n't smudge but it 's so hard to take off ! i used lancome 's bi facil makeup remover which is designed to remove waterproof mascara but it was still hard to remove i lost quite a few lashes in the process i would recommend buying the regular definicils not the waterproof	15
0	i bought this with a kit this stuff was just not worth it to me but unlike the others i cannot stand the smell it is very strong and gave me a headache so i could not really leave it on that long my scalp did feel conditioned though but if you are sensitive to strong smells be aware that this stuff may bother you	15
0	i'm with everyone else when they say they were diappointed by this product i opened this bottle expecting a totally yummy scent but what i got was nothing like what i expected ! when i read that it smelled the nesquick i thought i 'd like it anyway because i love strawberry nesquick but this stuff smells like well i ca n't describe it all i know is i wish i had n't paid 16 for it live and learn i guessperhaps the strawberry ice cream 3 in 1 gel smells better off topic why do they have a strawberry milk shake 3 in 1 gel and a strawberry ice cream 3 in 1 gel \? would n't they smell just the same	15
1	very good product and great kind of fruity smell leave hair soft and full of bounce easy to comb hair after using this product but might be combine with kerastase conditionner for very dry and damage hair if your hair are very long the price here is still more expensive than in europe around 22 euros	15
0	i spent the for this supposed miracle product a month ago do n't waste your money absolutly no results	15
0	i quickly realized while in the shower that i do n't want to smell like a margarita all day it does lather well and i do n't find the smell to overpowering but it 's not that special warning to those of us that chemically treat our hair this product as a shampoo is very drying and strips color out of hair	15
0	this foam product by jonathan is okay the reviews on his products are highly overrated the price does n't bother me at all there are better foams for thin and limp hair	15
1	i love zoya polish it is pure and the colors are fabulous they stay and stay and stay i'm ready to order again	15
1	this product is truly amazing ! the application method can be a bit tricky and the performance varies depending on the type of mascara you use but if you follow the directions and find a good mascara formula then you will have long long lashes my lashes are medium length but when i use this people who know me thing i am wearing falsies this stuff rocks ! i 've never been able to find a mascara that can do what this does	15
1	i 've had my marilyn hair treatment for some 3 months and it makes my hair smell great ! kind of like a smooth scent in my hair it did n't really lighten my hair but it smells great and it did add some extra softness to it	15
0	i bought this lipgloss at my local sephora store first of all do not expect to see any plumping what so ever it makes no difference in how your lips look secondly it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball the only reason this gloss is 18 is because of the too faced name brand dont waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good better for a few bucks at the drugstor	15
0	i love philosophy products but this shower gel smelled nothing like strawberries more like fluoride treatment for kids i was really bummed out try the cinnamon buns it is so much better	15
1	everything was great about this from the product to the promptness which it was received	15
0	both lipsticks were on back order i never received either one please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received	15
1	i just bought this the other day having owned the regular sized kabuki brush i find i like the baby buki better it still gives great coverage just in a more compact size which i love	15
0	i was excited to purchase jonathan product after watching two seasons of blow out unfortunately i was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair my hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess unfortunately the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that 's about it	15
1	but it definitally did not work as it was intended it is intended to moisturize hair i have long fine oily hair and i received trichomania as a gift i love the smell but when i first used it it left my hair very dry which i consider a good thing considering the state of my hair it just didnt do what it was supposed to however if you have really oily hair this is the thing for you no problems with lathering either especally if you rub the bar in your hair not in your hands doesnt leave white flakes either	15
0	for medium length hair it lasted about 4 uses smells way funky ca n't say i noticed anything different just did n't feel that it warrants the hype	15
0	i 've had this dryer for almost a year now and like the styists who also own it i find it temperamental it does a great job while it 's working but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months if you turn the dryer off you 'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on now it turns off while i'm in the middle of doing my hair the stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other \( s \) cool off as i said when they work they 're terrific i'm going to replace mine with another brand	15
1	there is actually science to support this serum and per a d magazine article several female dermatologists use it on their own skin you spread a few drops on your face \( and i use it on my neck and back of my hands as well \) in the morning before sunscreen or makeup it does not irritate my sensitive skin \( i have rosacea and seb derm \) or clog my pores a lot of expensive products are just hype but i think the science and the fact that so many dermatologists use it make this one worth the money	15
1	i love this soap normally i'm not a bar soap person but this bar really has won me over it smells divine and lasts forever also my skin does n't feel too tight or dry after a bath with this product it is even a pretty color what more could you ask for	15
1	i try a lot of products and this is simply my favorite not only do they feel luxurious they look amazing in my bathroom i sent my mom a set and she loves it too	15
1	i found this sent the most amazing i found it in the december 2006 issue of gq i was determined to find it i found it i was so excited i work at a fast food restraunt and i put prada amber on before my 8 hour shift and tords the end of my shift people could still smell this fragrance i was so excited i would recomind this to anyone who wants to feel safistacated	15
1	this mascara goes on beautifully and looks great but it 's messy it 's more liquid than most mascaras and when i travel with it the tube leaks ! it also tends to smear when i first put it on but after it dries it 's good for the day if you carry mascara with you or travel often look for another brand	15
0	not really impressed with this product it applies okay but the colors look really bright and odd on the colors do fade over time and i do not recommend this product i like lancome 's eyeshadows because they stay on all day and look really nice	15
1	i typically do n't wear much cologne or perfume but this one is a winner ! my husband bought this one for me for christmas i 'd never even seen it before but he liked how it smelled what a great guy ! i could n't have been happier with this gift i love this scent clean and fresh you can wear this scent day or night not heavy or overwhelming the unique beauty of the bottle is wonderful too highly recommend beyond paradise	15
1	i have been using this powder for about 5 years it is amazing i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear it even comes with the perfect application brush this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	15
1	i really like this product i would not however agree with the person who said that it is entirely too strong a scent i would actually like it to be stronger and have less peel and more juice smell but it is a nice scent and cleans very thoroughly not the best i 've used but very nice	15
1	i have this product working in my hair right now it is simply wonderful ! first off it smells like lovely victorian rosebud almond pudding it has a similar consistency i can get about three to four uses from each container and i have very thick hair my hair was preciously quite dry and abused i had dyed it twice in the last six months after one use of this product my hair felt better than it had in years silky strong and shiny i love this product ! i highly recommend it	15
1	givenchy 's very irresistible is magnificent ! floral yet spicy overtones with a touch of black current in a rose peony base better than bob mackie 's perhaps perfume and infinitely complex so that the scent is never tiresome irresistible lasts all day and is a fragrance that captivates this perfume is different than the typical scents that arrive on the market and well worth a try !	15
1	i have loved this product for so many years but have n't found it for more than ten i flew to spain and the evian was an absolute necessity ! it 's just the right amount of cool water as opposed to splashing water on your face out of a faucet it is very refreshing and also brightens fading makeup	15
0	yikes i was so surprised at the size of the bottle i had no idea it would be that small for the price the scent is nice but i would not reorder	15
0	the only reason i'm giving this two stars instead of one is because i love benefit that being said this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper it 's so faint that you can hardly smell it but when you do it 's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better if you are looking for a young fun perfume stay away from this one it smells old and drab like your grandmother 's china cabinet or an antique store but if you like that	15
0	i have noticable undereye cirlces and bought this product in the hopes it you lighten them a bit i use this product in the mornings and evenings for several weeks nothing changed i figured maybe it would take more then a few weeks to notice anything so i continued to use this product \( use the entire jar just to give it plenty of time \) still not difference could be seen for me it was a waste of money	15
0	i used tend skin for a few years and it was the best one that i could find but a few weeks ago i saw a nother product on amazon called solution 2 and ordered it instead i was a little worried because i was getting good results with the bumps with tend skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps	15
1	expensive but a small amount makes a big difference excellent conditioner for dry thick hair also very pleasing fragrance the best hair treatment i 've found for my straight coarse dry hair highly recommended	15
0	i generally love lush soaps but do not recommend this one demon in the dark has a great name but it does n't smell very good \( a sort of faint slightly minty scent \) it also has a black wax coating that is rather difficult to peel or scrape off but must be removed for the soap to work properly i would try red rooster or karma soap instead	15
1	to be totally honest i'm not entirely sure what these ingredients are all about but i do know one thing this stuff really works ! after using this for a couple of weeks i started noticing a visible change in the small dark spots on my face it was n't dramatic but i kept using the repair formula and about a month later i could definitely see a difference ! people have commented on the way i look and i recommend it to all of them it just makes your skin look healthier	15
1	i have the beginnings of crow 's feet the essential c eye cream has helped to decrease the lines and restored the elasticity and suppleness of the delicate skin around my eyes	15
1	this is one of the most perfect concealers i have ever used it goes on nice and creamy \( does not pull on your skin when applying \) and covers those imperfections you also do not need a lot of product to get the job done the colors are very natural and i have found a perfect color in sand for me i will buy this product again	15
1	i got this as a gift i had tested the eau de parfum version at a department store cosmetics' counter and was less than thrilled however the edt was just right for me ! i believe in signature fragrances so i 'll let this be the signature of one of my many moods	15
1	this is my absolute favorite product by lush i received a huge box of bath ballistics for my birthday and out of the whole thing this was the best ! it made the water a nice purple color \( without a ring around the tub \) and made my skin smell great even the next day ! i would recommend this one to any first timers so you can see what the buzz around lush is all about ! i am stocking up on this one	15
1	this product really does feel like silk out of all the eye products i really like this one i would recommend it !	15
0	for me it barely looked like i had mascara on at all i have blonde eyelashes so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop and this did n't really i ended up giving it to my mom thinking that maybe it was just me since so many others loved it and she did n't like it either it ended up in the garbage i 've loved dior show mascara and of course great lash i 'd recommend those over this especially for the money	15
1	this is a sweet treat ! it smells good enough to eat it also leaves my skin smooth and soft it works good as a shampoo on my thick wavy hair too cinnamon buns 3 in 1 is a wonderful product and everyone should buy it totally worth the dough ha ha	15
1	i have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks i love this product ! no build up no dandruf make sure your hair is wet not just damp and you should not have a lathering problem i purchased this from qvc and i will definately be a repeat customer i have short hair so this will last me a while i loved it so much i bought some for my daughter this is my new shampoo	15
1	put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling your dark circles will be concealed and you 'll look wide awake	15
0	i'm in my 30 's light skin everybody was talking about this product so i decided to give it a try did n't work for me after using it for a while i had break outs and my skin became greasy it 's not what they say it is i 've tried many philosophy products the only one that is what they promised is amazing grace for your body but the skin care products are a scam go for neutrogena or clinique good luc	15
1	i 've used paris hilton perfume for about a year now ordering it online at amazon was terrific i did n't have to drive and the price is half the amount you would spend in the department store ! ! ! if you have n't tried this fragrance please do so you will be wonderfully surprised at how special it makes you feel ! donna	15
1	i love jonathan products and especially how it makes my hairfeel so soft and sexy looking keep up the good work jonathan	15
1	face oasis is n't like any other moisturizer i 've tried one application makes my skin appear plump and well hydrated even if i 've neglected to drink my 8 glasses of water that day it is n't at all greasy absorbs quickly and serves as a great base over which to apply my makeup the guys i 've introduced it to have raved about it as well !	15
1	this is by far my favorite mascara and i 've tried hundreds' i have very few and very short lashes this mascara pumps them up makes them look twice as long ! love love lov	15
0	i bought this and shortly after i started using it the sides of my noise started swelling up and peeling i did n't know what was going on and i stopped using it and it immediately went away as soon as i started wearing it again the swelling and pain came back i am a person who does n't break out very often and i can tolerate many products i now have a permanent red mark on the right side of my nose and it has n't faded yet i tried to take it back to nordstrom and they would n't exchange it this product sucks and as it was the only one i was using i know thats what caused the swelling	15
1	i found iman lipsticks from the kits to be not as nice as the picture but the eyeshadows are very soft with high pigments in beautiful colors the pencils good quality and very versatile overall the kits are a great buy	15
0	i work in the cosmetics industry beware this is a copy not a real mac lipstick ! not even close to the formula or color of moxie	15
1	beautiful scent not too strong and long lasting i am complimented on it constantly highly recommend	15
1	after hearing so many good things about philosophy 's cinnamon buns i just had to try it out for myself i found it to not really smell like cinnamon buns but more like water mixed with sugar if you use it on your head it will leave a lingering smell but it wo n't last long on your body after taking a shower i think this product is a nice way of treating yourself but i definitely do not think it smells like cinnamon buns which left me slightly disappointed overall a great product	15
1	high beam is a nice subtle highlighter however be sure to blend it very quickly and well or it will look unnatural in certain lighting \( it 'll look like you have pink nail polish on your face \) it also has a tendency to emphasize pores so only use it on areas of your face where you do n't have any like on the top of the cheek bone and under your eyebrows	15
0	i should have known better people were telling me to use dermaaction from www topicalbeauty com but i wasted my money on hylexin instead saw no results dermaaction on the other hand is making a huge change in my skin and my eyes look way better now next time i 'll listen	15
0	okay so in the beginning i was so excited about this perfume it smelled amazing and the scent lasted forever when i say forever literally forever you spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep \? it lasts until the next afternoon it 's not even just a weak scent that 's left on you it 's like as if you 've been spraying it constantly but here 's the bad part after using it for awhile i felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong i felt like the scent was a little too deep it 's great for people who like strong distinct scents if not though this is n't the product for you	15
1	this is a really fun gift for children \( although you might have guessed that i like them too \) it has a sweet fruity scent without being a sugar buzz and the colors are very bright and cheerful i would suggest one of those wire or slotted soap dishes to help these dry easier and faster though a regular soap dish without any type of draining makes it melt faster	15
1	the kerastase line is hard to find \( used to be only sold in kerastase salons i believe \) the shampoos do exactly what they say in this case this is a moisturizing shampoo for dried hair that may be overly chemically treated i only wish they came in larger bottles	15
0	some of the lush products are wonderful this is n't one of the	15
1	an excellent pair of shears sharp and durable i expect them to last a long time	15
1	this keychain is very cute and great if your'e friends want to try it becuase it is cheap so they can buy it for themselves i have the pixie flavor and it is great but it fell off my purse once so that 's why i am not giving this item five stars if they made the keychain a little stronger i would definetly give it a five	15
1	i like that the gloss is n't goopy or sticky and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while but you do n't get much product i bought flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips i was n't really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen but overall i do like it but do n't know if i 'd buy it again	15
1	i bought this cream after i tried about a dozen other brands and i loved it it a bit pricy but it worth every penny i am 24 so i bought it to smooth out starting lines that i had and prevent new ones it worked ! now i look like i am 20 again	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
1	this lip gloss is great not only does it taste great the initial stickiness goes away after a few moments and stays on longer than most other glosses definitely a must have for anyone 's make up bag	15
1	very moisturizing and smells nice too the sea minerals and exfoliating ingredients keep my cuticles looking good and help cut down on hangnails too i apply lots of it at bedtime	15
1	i wear stay neutral and have been using this product for years does n't clog pors and it looks flawless this is a really great product and work the 18 00	15
0	i have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of k y jelly frankly i am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams	15
1	i love this fragance it 's my favorite no matter where i go if i am wearing this perfume i always get compliments it has a very floral sort of sultry scent to it i love it	15
1	this is a great product but way too expensive on this site you can find it for 28 00	15
1	i suffered from a severe case of shingles that affected the right side of my face the infection left scars on half of my face i started using the exfoliate kit regularly after four months my face now looks normal and i'm able to go without makeup again thanks philosophy	15
0	i would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball the roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out and you find yourself rolling it over over again to get a decent amount of gloss the gloss itself is pretty \( once you get enough on your lips \) and it does taste smell delicious but it is way too much trouble with the roller ball i would suggest they make this with an applicator brush it would make a great product	15
1	terrific for the area around the eyes gets rid of dryness and does n't sting the eyes or feel greasy	15
1	high beam provides a glow or sheen where as my cheeks seem dull it does not look greasy i would say it makes the skin look healthy and vibrant	15
1	i absolutely love lush products and this is my favorite of them all it smells great \( kind of herbal \) absorbs quickly and is very soothing	15
1	this fragrance is both sexy and playful it truly embodies the essence of a woman both men and women find it to be a truly amazing scent	15
1	when i first tried this perfume it reminded very much of victoria 's secret pink it had that same distinctly sweet strongly scented unique floral note yet here the bouquet was significantly softer sweeter it would work well for someone who likes a sweet girly scent that is light yet still pronounced the one drawback is that the staying power is poor i could n't detect any trait of this just a few hours later this is a bit disappointing give the high price yet this still might be a good choice for someone who is looking for an everyday fragrance and does n't mind having to reapply	15
0	it smells great like coconut i have long curly hair and it made my hair dry and brittle i 've noticed this with all of the lush conditioners i 've tried so i would not recommend it for naturally curly hair 2 stars for the great smell	15
0	i'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality perhaps worth the price to some but i 'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness most ionic and infrared is gibberish tourmaline a gemstone has electrical properties \( when squeezed or heated it develops a charge across the crystal \) but that has nothing to do with hair drying or ionizing air or anything else i 'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam	15
0	i bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair sensitive skin which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation this product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face hands etc it did not irritate her skin at all the problem the one and only problem is the fragrance if you can call it that it stinks so bad i did not want to go near her after i wiped her down i had to give her a bath it was so bad	15
1	this product actually works as described it helped significantly improve the appearance of a scar created by a chemical burn within 2 weeks the scar is still visible but has lightened a number of shades and feels smoother i highly recommend this produc	15
1	this eyeliner really matches the description it goes on super smooth and does n't tug or drag i was told at the counter that it was water resistant but it 's really not i used to wear it under my lower eyelashes but by the end of the day it would be totally smudged and gross i would even try to put powder over it but to no avail however in defense of laura i am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes are n't friendly to many pencil eye liners i was just hoping against hope that laura 's would be different ! so now i only use it over the upper lid	15
0	i ordered the saturday morning special gift set and tried the tui herbal shampoo right away as with everyone else no lather and lots of tangles after the second wash i decided to use my pantene relaxed and natural to try and get some lather and moisture in my hair this stuff is a rip off on the plus side it works fabulously on my children 's hair they are bi racial and have naturally curly hair i do n't recommend this to anyone with relaxed hair it just does n't work	15
1	i ca n't even begin to explain how much i love this product although teen age acne is long gone for me like most women at that certain time of the month i get a little flair up here and there this product is great totally takes the red out and i say speeds the healing process as well i found it it made them disappear over night if i dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when i saw the begingings of one ones i caught early on never really turned into full blown acne yes it 's pricey but i think it 's worth every penny	15
1	i love the scent of the grapefruit bergamot bubble bath this combination is suitable for men or women deep steep products are really first rate the foot scrub and lotions are well worth the money	15
0	i hate to say this since philosophy is one of my favorite brands but this is probably the worst mascara i have ever used it clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove it does not simply wash off it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink about half of them remain attached to your lashes and i 've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara everything else i 've ever tried from philosophy was fantastic but the best mascara out there hands down is from lancome	15
0	i thought the product arrived in a timely manner the instructions were clear but it 's hard to hold the stencils and put on your eyebrow at the same time not a bad product for the price	15
1	i like this cologne although my wife uses it mostly the fragrance is incredible and from time to time i use it as an air freshner as well it is subtle yet long lasting and i may only recommend it	15
1	these pencils are the best ! they are the perfect texture and they last a long time	15
1	i absolutely adore this scent ! it certainly is not just for men ! anyone who loves the smell of limes will love this ! the sea salt is amazing ! i literally have n't been able to use any other soap since discovering it two years ago and i used to be a body wash person ! never again ! give it a try ! it 'll wake you right up in the morning and keep your energy high	15
0	this shampoo is so bad that i thought perhaps the wrong product had been put into a shampoo bottle by mistake it is watery and does not lather my hair felt like it had n't been washed for days and the next day i had to use a different shampoo to get rid of the film i never write reviews but felt this might save someone from wasting 10 00	15
0	it only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is not the solution for ending blackheads enlarged pores using this extractor is equal to using one 's fingers to squeeze out imperfections which may produce very temporary results but is ultimately fruitless those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep cleaning instead which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation	15
1	i love this smell its sweet yet warm not too sweet though just right very inviting and you can wear with anything anywhere alot of compliments ! with this one will buy again ! and again	15
1	i wanted to try a new lipgloss because all of the colored ones that i have are horrificly sticky and if they are n't sticky they do not stay on for long this one however manages to combine my love for lipgloss with all the needs of a chapstick the color \( apple a day \) was intimidating looking in the tube but looks perfectly on and does n't go anywhere it also has no stickyness ! yay ! i love this gloss and is the perfect gloss for all of my needs !	15
1	of all the other caswell massey scents i 've tried some are kind of old fashioned smelling high quality soaps in luxurious packaging not as long lasting as some other triple milled soaps i 've tried	15
1	this stuff smells awesome i have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy i have n't used it yet because i love the smell so much and i do n't want it to go away i just ordered a bunch though so i will try it out they are really pretty too if i was a kid and did n't know any better i would probably try to eat it	15
1	this is a life changing product if you have any issues with eye shadow creasing you just smooth a little of this product on your eyelids before applying eye shadow and it provides a perfect base twelve hours later the shadow is still perfectly in place i bought this at a neiman marcus store but the product is so good i wanted to make sure i rated it online so others would know how great it is !	15
0	i have horrible bags and deep creases along edge of preorbital area of all the products i have tried olay regenerist eye cream works the best also my plastic surgeon said that part of the dark purple is my muscle showing thru because i have excess skin but no fat in periorbital area he said he will inject fat from my rear \( plenty \) and that will lessen the color and after he removes excess skin he will use laser	15
0	this thing was such a waste it does not get cold enough to do anything it also wo n't stay flat against your face to give any soothing sensation to your eyes overpriced and worthless item	15
1	i 've been pleased with both the quantity and quality of the bubbles but the scent fades rather quickly if the scent lasted longer it would be much improved	15
1	if jonathan wants to sell environmentally concious products he should promote it in his other hairstyling products the aquasana shower filter is an excellent product which i use whats it matter who 's name is on it it is what it is and it will leave your skin and hair feeling fresher	15
0	i really wanted to like this but i find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours when i went back to get a lighter color it did the same i think there 's just too much yellow in this foundation and considering it 's oil free it did n't really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday i would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you or if you 're looking for a similar oil free foundation i would highly recommend laura mercier oil free or chanel dpf	15
0	as rosey as this oils smells it just is n't as good as the real thing being a fragrance oil it has no medicinal properties i certainly would n't use it on my skin or in a bath ! thanks but no thanks you definitely get what you pay for	15
1	high beam provides a glow or sheen where as my cheeks seem dull it does not look greasy i would say it makes the skin look healthy and vibrant	15
1	it 's interesting to see all of the oil that this takes from your face it really shows on the paper and it does it 's job not as cheap as washing your face but more fun	15

1	this stuff is amazing i use candle light underneath my eyes and around my brows it makes my eyes look picture perfect all day long it 's especially beautiful in sunlight really makes my blue eyes pop !	15
0	why did shiseido have to ruin a good idea with a sub par spf \? they got the broad spectrum part correct by using avobenzone as the active sunscreen ingredient but then came up far short to the widely preferred spf 15 uva uvb spf 15 or more is a standard widely recommended by dermatologists the skin cancer foundation the american academy of dermatology and others plus as a moisturizer this one is just ok there are far better formulations on the market even some made by shiseido containing not only a better daily sunscreen but antioxidents and better moisturizing ingredients	15
0	this perfume smells like you just sprayed lemon pledge all over it was terribly strong and just not quite what i wanted the company did promptly give me a refund though i suggest you try out demeter fragrances they are more natural smelling	15
1	follow the cleanser with the komenuka bijin skin lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of sake in fact this cleansing toner does contain sake along with rice bran seaweed aloe yeast glycyrrhizate orange lemon matricaria algae luffa cylindrica and fountain water the toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion the rebecca review	15
1	this paris hilton perfume is wonderful i got it 2 months ago in september as one of my birthday presents from my mum i 'd heard of the paris hilton perfume a while back but i thought it would n't be that good however a few days before my birthday my mum brought home a tester and i was really shocked the perfume smells delicous every time i have it on i get tons of compliments it really is a gorgeous scent perfect for night and day i have had a lot of perfumes in my life some of them really expensive but this is by far the best ever i would recommend this to anyone	15
1	this fragrance starts off fine but the longer you wear the better it gets and that very nice smell lasts a wonderfully long time ! !	15
0	i opened my falling in love compact expecting a lovely smell after reading the hype this is the worst smelling perfume ever when i put it on it smelled like burnt clothing like an iron had just done it 's worst on cotton it was so awful i put it straight in the bin	15
0	jonathan conditioner is as good as a cheap drug store conditioner jonathan you can only fool people into buying one bottle of the cheap stuff you ca n't fool them twice i know we will all be seeing jonathan product on the clearence rack in a big lots with in a year or two	15
1	i received a sample of this mascara \( in black \) and just love it it 's perfect for everyday wear as it 's not too dramatic and is very long lasting in fact it 's so long lasting that i even took a nap while wearing it and it did n't smudge at all i was pleased to find however that it came off very easily with my clinque rinse off foaming cleanser so there was no need for a separate eye make up remover i have more expensive mascaras than this and they are not as good definitely a great product	15
1	ooohh sparklies ! ! ! ! ! you can put this on your face make you very much pretty turn the heads of boy types stops traffic ! !	15
1	i bought this along with the some kind of gorgeous foundation faker i do n't have the best skin \( oily \) but like a more natural look these two product together are so great i look natural but healthier and my skin stays less shiny all day i use the other side of the foundation sponge to apply it	15
1	i love this product my eye brows are growing but not all over in the areas where i'm putting the product the hair has become darker but nothing extreme just in a way where i'm able to see it now \( i'm naturally a toehead \) i would recommend this to others but i'm saddened that it 's so hard to find and i was unable to do so in a store	15
1	having been blessed with very large pores on my nose and cheeks i was looking for something that might help reduce the appearance of my pores they seem to enlarge as i age came across this product somewhat by accident i was really amazed at how well it works just a small dollop tapped lightly on the skin and your pores vanish and your skin looks perfectly smooth it mattifies the skin all day \( and i have extra oily skin \) other clinique products have made my skin break out but this stuff is wonderful if you suffer from acne on your nose or cheeks highly recommended	15
1	i love this scent it smells warm and spicy on my skin the eau de parfum is strong but not overpowering at all and the dry down is wonderful it also lasts all day long which is great because i'm a spray it and forget it kinda gal	15
1	i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin bringing newer skin to the surface and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier i was a little wary a first but it works my skin feels softer and looks more even all around	15
1	i hsve used clinique moisturing gel for years and this was the first time i had the pump what a thrill as only a little bit is extracted and that is all one needs	15
1	this is not sticky lip gloss the rose tone is easy to wear it's sweet and natural tone you can mix colors and than create new color on your lips ! ! you don't need to shop tons of glosses and lip sticks this is it ! plus the palette case is cute	15
1	i love love this product i ca n't believe how much i actually used it i ran out of my box within two months ! all those tops that have a wide open neck needed the bra strap to sit on the edge of my shoulder this kept my straps in place all day and night ! a few of my work tops have buttons that stop short towards the bottom i use the strips to close the flap in place so it 's smooth all the way down tip in some cases i cut the strips in half even half a strip holds my bra straps in place this product holds things in place or down it does not lift and hold its not ducked tape	15
1	although this is supposed to be used as a deep conditioning treatment i used it several times a week and loved the way it made my hair look and feel only drawback is the price and the container which you have to be very careful with in the shower ! but all in all it 's a wonderful product for fine hair and i 've come back to it again and again !	15
0	i ordered the fedora i am so dissapointed it came off within a few hours ! just peeled right off do not order this brand of fingernail polish it is the worst i have ever used	15
1	my hair stylist first introduced me to this product a few years ago and i 've used it ever since it makes your hair really soft and shiny and even smells good just a little of biosilk goes a long way gets rid of the frizz and dryness and really improves the look and feel of your hair i definitely reccomend it	15
0	i had never tried anything from philosophy and wanted to try the 3 in 1 stuff and i thought the lavendar pound cake would smell really good i was actually really disappointed it sucks as a shampoo and body wash too i ordered the blueberry pie too and i haven't even used it its just sitting in my closet for the price you get a lot and lasts long but i wasn't impressed	15
1	i 've seen lots of negative feedback on the strawberry milkshake scent but i have to say i love it this lotion takes me back to my child hood it 's got a strawberry quick bubblegum smell to it i think it 's fun for summer days	15
0	the product has made my skin much worse than when i started i am so sorry i even kept at it ! ! \( how can i reverse all the damage now that murad has given me	15
1	if there is a better shaving cream out there i could n't find it i 've not had any problems and a year later i'm still on my first purchase with about 40 left fantastic stuff	15
1	very rich a little heavy though can cause buildup but still excellent quality	15
1	i normally do not like anything with a sandalwood scent but this stuff is absolutely wonderfull ! they are not lying when they refer to it as an addictive scent in the description i got a small sample bottle and fell in love it is perfect for the winter fall seasons not so much for the summer it 's fun when people ask what i'm wearing and i get to casually say prada considering i live in tennessee most people have no idea what that means but i still feel special	15
1	this product is very well built the mirrors are clear and free from any distortion magnification level is just right the only negative about this is the light is very dim and not adjustable	15
0	the texture of this product is fine but not really better than anything you can get at the drugstore therefore overpriced now if the flavor and scent were exceptional it might be worth the high price tag but it does n't smell that great it smells rather like over cooked coffee beans the bare escentuals soy mocha spf 15 has a much nicer smell and texture if you 're wanting a bare escentuals product	15
1	this is one of my favorites i love the scent it does n't smell like fresh strawberries because it 's not supposed to it 's supposed to smell like a strawberry milkshake \( and i think they did a good job of it so this is what i expected \) philosophy does a good job of matching the scent to the name the only thing i did n't expect was that i still need to condition with another conditioner i 'd say it 's a shampoo and shower gel a 2 in 1 not a 3 in 1	15
1	the clean crisp smell of this 3 in 1 product will wake you up in the morning and keep you smelling fresh without overdoing it	15
1	this vitamin e moisture cream has a great soft rosey smell and feels great on my skin i was given a sample which i took home and tried and i was blown away by this product i went back to our local mall a few days later and purchased the product i love it	15
0	after using this product i felt less than fresh then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money	15
0	the beauty case was a gift and it never reached it 's recipient i would like to know what i might do about a refund i am very irritated as it was a birthday present for my 7 year old goddaughter please advis	15
1	i 've been using this kit for several weeks now and i am absolutely amazed at the results ! i 've had severe acne scarring due to a birth control pill i was taking they were bright red and no concealer on the market would cover them after one week of using murad i 've noticed the scars fading ! i thought nothing on this planet would fade them but murad is ! i 've also been blessed with good genes in having oily skin murad drastically reduces the amount of shine i have i highly recommend this product to everyone	15
0	i was so excited to try this product from all of the great reviews that i read on it boy where they wrong i used this product for 2 months and saw no difference in my skin at all i have used a lot of products and would have to rate this down at the bottom of my list especially for how much it cost	15
1	this is the way to beat the airline travel restrictions for carrying liquids actually i liked everything about this product certainly easy to use and certainly pleased with the performance no more mini bottles of shampoo for me	15

1	i love how this product works and feels on my skin ! ! does an excellent job off removing makeup and cleaning the skin with out drying your skin out ! makes skin feel cool and clean ! ! i have very sensitive skin an was concerned that this product was going to break my skin out or be very drying because this product tones as well as cleanses the skin but that was n't the case my skin did n't break out nor is this product drying highly recommend !	15
1	its pretty expensive for gel but i like it my hair does n't get rock hard like other gels and holds pretty well throughout the day	15
1	i have been on the search for a new makeup and have been disappointed in so many so i have been pleasantly surprised with how much i like the pur minerals i sets nicely and i do n't feel made up i like that there are no chemicals in it as i have pretty sensitive skin this is not a heavy makeup so if you 're looking for max coverage this is not for you i love the mineral glow too it gives me the perfect glow without looking fake i will be buying this again	15
0	i 've been using this product for almost 2 months and i have seen no difference whatsoever in the appearance of my dark circles and yes it does burn ! the only thing i'm glad about is that i bought it from ebay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere i 've had dark under eye circles all my life i suppose i should just learn to live with them and save my money i will not be wasting my money on this product again	15
0	i'm black and for my hair type 4b i try to use natural products on my hair and it did n't have those no no chemicals and oils that are known to be damaging to black hair well this product did not as it advertised which was to stay put i tried to use it with my hair clean and dry and then with my hair clean and damp and it did nothing both times to hold my comb coils or finger coil in place i did give the product 2 stars because it does smell pretty good sad thing is that i ca n't get my money back i use it as a hair grease for my scalp i hope i 've been helpful	15
1	this works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry i have long hair and i love using this product it works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life fantastic	15
1	used the cleansing foam then bought the moisture cream whatever is in rice bran is truly wonderful it cleanses without any dryness and a rosy glow has returned to my skin have stopped using my old department store stuff replacing 4 of those products with just these 2 with better results good value on both they should offer a deal on the shampoo and conditioner too	15
1	i was hooked on sebastian 's shine serum forever then i switched to this after hearing all the rave reviews it makes it just as shiny as the sebastian but for my thick wavy hair it is easier to apply i only need about a quarter size amount way less than any other product it has a nice soft finish so if you like sebastian and redkin 's shine serums you 'll like this i'm not going to go as far as to say it 's a miracle worker it makes your hair shinier it helps a little with my frizz but does n't depouf	15
1	i am a huge fan of the creme but not of this lip balm for the price they want this should 've been much much better it goes on nice and has a neutral taste and moisturizes ok my l'occitane lip balm or just plain shea butter does a much better job moisturizing my lips than this does save your money and do not buy this	15
1	i recently converted to using powder makeup i am hooked i did n't tell anyone i was using it my son was the first person to tell me how nice i looked ! that truly made my day and was all the convincing i needed i absolutely love it because it is flawless and does not feel goopy like liquid foundation	15
1	put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling your dark circles will be concealed and you 'll look wide awake	15
1	feel sexy and tingly without the burn of most lip plumping products your lips will be glossy shiny and soft when you use this product	15
1	this powder is great it has great coverage without looking cakey i also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it 's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be touched up a little more often than other powders i 've tried but it 's worth it	15
1	i bought this last month in purple looks awesome and it does n't hurt when you put it on best of all it stays on and if you set it it will stay all day	15
1	this is the second product of jonathan 's i 've used and i'm equally happy with it i have thin hair when it 's straight and something in the middle when it 's curly either way i 'd like it thicker and this foam certainly helps it 's great and i 've found it does what it promises it smells good and you do n't need to use too much it feels nice in my hair and the fragrance lasts most of the day it does n't matter if your hair is curly or straight hopefully you will find this as effective and as helpful as i have	15
0	i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time because i have very thick wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten it ended up taking just as long but the results were much better my hair was super straight and shiny and it did n't get frizzy even in humid weather then when i was using it for just the 4th time it completely stopped working just as other people described the red light shut off and it cooled down and never turned back on i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now	15
1	murad promises the miracle cure for acne while the product is good it 's not a miracle i 've been usines murad for two months and while my skin has improved it 's not flawless i still get break outs and they still take a while to heal i 'll keep using it because it 's a skin routine as good as any other and who knows maybe my skin will improve	15
1	the powder foundation is excellent for skin which is oily and large pored it is one of the best around for no caking no oil smooth surface skin if you ca n't stand the feel of cream or lotion foundations chanel does it best ! ! also my seller was terrific	15
1	obviously some people do n't care about reviewing an item just about bashing a pop artist that does n't deserve it anyway i think it smells great obviously it does or it would n't be the bestselling perfume right now but do n't take my word for it go to your nearest store and give it a sniff also be sure to check out fantasy i think it smells even better	15
1	if you have n't tried lush or creamy candy do it ! creamy candy smells delicious and leaves your skin silky soft for soap to match try rock star mmmmm ! ! ! i ca n't place the fragrance it 's cherry but not cotton candy but not it 's very sweet smelling and the scent lasts and lasts enjoy	15
1	during the winter months i have flaky skin under my beard and on my face this product has prevented that problem the last 3 winters that i 've used it i 'd recomend for that use i do n't think it has much of a scent at all certainly not like most soaps and skin care products	15
1	i love the smell of philosophy pure grace the shampoo shower gel smells just as clean and fresh as the perfume it 's not too drying either	15
0	i was using this thing religiously from my 5th month with coco butter as well i still got stretch marks ba	15
1	definitely a must have perfume ! the smell is just awesome not too strong not too mild and stays for long i strongly recommend this it is also a great gift	15
0	i should have listen to the reviewer who said it smelled like lemon pledge it really has a chemical smell and not pleasant at all i'm going to use it at the office to spray down the supply room	15
1	this dry iron is absolutely amazing i really ca n't say enough about it great for all types of hair ! it heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time plus your hair comes out extremely straight highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours it is an investment in your hair one of the better ones i 've made	15
1	i have tried many different products and this one is the best i rely on it for many years already and it always works faster than anything else i have tried four stars because it leaves a thin barely but visible film on the skin where you apply it you can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem especially if under makeup	15
1	this product made my skin look absolutely great ! i use it twice a day and within one week i saw a huge difference i 've been now using murad for a month and the improvement is astonishing i get compliments on my skin every day i highly recommend it	15
1	this oil smells so good i just love it all of my friends say i smell so good	15
1	these are good and do the trick but it 's hard to get my fingers in the holes	15
1	this is the one you give to someone you love the wonderful rose scent is very light not overpowering at all and the pretty little dried rosebuds are so charming i love lying in the tub with those rosebuds floating around me it makes me feel like i'm lying in a beautiful garden	15
1	this is by far the best shampoo and conditioner set i have used i have very fine very straight and very long hair that breaks easily but not with this shampoo and conditioner this set makes it smooth but not oily and so when i brush my hair there is no yanking going on my hair is noticeably more shiny and soft it has a very pleasant scent and it is all natural what a great way to pamper yourself ! definitely worth the extra investment	15
1	if you love roses this is a romantic bath luxury with seven rose buds for your bathing delight for a candlelit bath with romance let it dissolve unencumbered for scent but no mess put it in a mesh bag first because little flower bits will be all over the tub at least it has no glitter the scent is not particularly strong but it is full of a natural rose scent that smells wonderful	15
0	i used two tubes in one month one for daytime wear and one for nighttime and when i was n't going out \( clear \) i like the product how it looks and smoothes out my lips but i just cannot afford to pay 60 a month on my lips ! if they lower the price by 10 12 i will buy it again but not until they do	15
1	well i gotta say this one feels goodrefreshing cool calming gives the same feeling you get after you 've just washed your face	15
1	i am in love with this product it smells wonderful once you put it on and it really seems to relax sore muscles the only problem i have with it is i go through it too fast \( i probably use more than i need to \)	15
0	i bought this for travel gym bag use when it arrived i opened all bottles and sniffed the frangrace was very masculine smelling i guess this is the yerba mate aroma which is very earthy smelling	15
0	this product is no better than any regular washcloth and or headband to hold your hair back save your money	15
1	awesome product best concealer i 've ever used it is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye creases that my almost 50 year old eyes have the pink undertone brightens and lightens	15
1	i received this as a gift and love it i do n't normally use dusting powders but this is light and silky the scent is very patchouli which i happen to like sort of reminds me of the head shops from the 60 's 70 's i especially like the fact that all lush products are natural without a lot of chemicals	15
0	maybe i expect too much however even my lowest expectation wasnt met just go ask a dermatologist to help dont waste your money	15
1	i wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as i can to help keep the shot stable \( i shoot birds at 700mm \) the first thing my friend and i did was to compare two identical lenses cameras etc one with one without the extender result the image appeared the same size and the extender slightly blurred the image in other words completely useless	1
1	i was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first i had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls i located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till i could get there to try it out firstly the bag is nice but does n't hold as much as i thought it still could have worked for my but for one thing this bag is not designed for those with a er womanly build it was the most uncomfortable bag i have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me so glad i was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online just a word of warning to the ladies	1
0	i bought this one as a cheap extra battery i have seen no differences in performance so far and would therefore recommend this as a great extra or replacement battery	1
1	they sent me wrong lens cover and said i ordered the wrong one do n't think so since i got copy poor customer service all around	1

0	i'm new to the digital slr world i had been using the built in flash on my rebel xt the built in flash had done alright but was nothing to write home about since i had spent most of my money on the camera i needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done this flash met both requirements if you are an advance user you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features yet if you a newbie like me this flash is great ! it has improved my picture quality dramaticly	1
0	for those wishing to purchase this product and who also want accessory filters to protect the lens or to add special effects although not mentioned the size of the filter is 30mm \( not the 37 mm mentioned at other locations which caused me to order the wrong size which now must be returned \) remember 30 \( thirty \) mm	1
0	i have sticked with sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago and sony camera has been the moneys worth ! this one dsc t10 is the one for the parent who is carrying to much already and needs to pack down for a change it fits in my purse and still have space for more the only thing to remember to buy a slim fitting case for the camera and an extra battery \( for those kind of battery are not sold everywhere \) you need that one when you do n't thing you need an extra battery you always run out at the wrong time i recommend this one	1
0	unlike many reviewers i am not diver i bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera would n't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park pool and beach this equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash this case has out lived an s400 and s500 well worth the 170 price tag	1

1	to customer before me you camera d200 might be on recall please check the nikon website for more info you have described the exact recall problem good luck ! btw have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 \? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200	1
1	i bougt this camera because i had had a sony coolpix 3 which took great pictures with this camera you can never get it adjusted right if you use the flash the pictures are to light if you dont they are too dark it is a constant battle with this little cute camera worse camera purchase i ever made	1
0	the balance with the grip on is really much better yes i am aware there were problems with some earlier ones but mine seems just fine \( knocking on wood as i type \)	1
0	has any one tried the compatible battery from power101 \? i ca n't believe the price i am struggling btwn buying the sony brandbattery and the compatible ones	1
0	i have been using this camera quite a bit and am completely happy it has both point and shoot and slr features you can take quick shots or get started with amiture photography the software was easy to use easy to set up and it works well on my mac it has the quality the you would expect with the canon name	1
0	i bought this for my mother she loves it ! its easy for her to use and the screen is large enough for her to view the print quality is excellent i got more \( merchandise and quality \) with this hp brand than i would had with any other brand the price was excellent too good job hewlett packard for making me a smart person	1
1	i made mistake getting such a big bulky case for small minidv sony camcorder hc26 this case can take any big size old camcorders \( like old sony hi8 \) so if you are looking for your new camcorder this definately is a bad choice	1
0	the charger really did what it was supposed to do i have an li 10b so i was still some what worried that it was n't going to do the job but it did i also liked that it was small so you can travel with it anywhere	1
0	this is a neat idea you do have to have close up pictures to really be able to see them in the small screen it was very easy to load the pictures and it is very handy to have with me to show others our most recent pictures	1
0	i liked this lens i used it for the first time while traveling through peru it was light weight and easy to use at 200mm most of my pictures turned out great especially when i was on steady ground \( taking pictures from a rocking boat with no tripod is a bit of a challenge ! \) i 've printed some 8x10 's of close ups i took using this lens and i was quite impressed with the quality it was also in my price range overall i 'd say it was a good bang for the buck	1
0	this bag is great for your slr digtial camera it has space for your extra lens everything that came with you slr camera fits in this bag this bag is a great buy and its not that expensive	1
1	tried this as a possible improvement over using aa nihm batteries in my olympus d 524 camera turned out to be a downgrade did not stay charged as long as my panasonic 1950 mah aa batts it would die a sudden death no low battery warnings before the camera shut down i have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the aa nihm batts the cr v3 now gathers dust it did not even improve the flash recycle time just a waste	1
0	despite reading glowing reviews about this lens i was still surprised to see how well it performed the lens is so sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes from a distance of three quarters of a football field away shooting hand held with late afternoon light which will print a 5x7 and still look like a pro took them ! if you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and ca n't afford or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures then you should give this lens your serious consideration	1
0	i have had my canon eos 30d for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted to photography i bought the 17 85mm canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post processing in raw i also have a 70 300mm lens for sports outdoors nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound i bought the camera through dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there ! strongly recommend pay the extra and get this over the rebel xti you wo n't be disappointed	1
0	this is the best price i found for my second rechargeable battery for my nikon coolpix 5200 it 's perfect and so nice to have a second battery ! ! ! it was shipped so fast i received it within a few days	1
1	i was extremely disappointed with this product i felt very let down by sony because for years i bought sony items with confidence knowing that anything produced by them would be good and reliable this item only goes to prove that sony 's standards have dropped and as such i will use considerable caution when buying anthing else of theirs what lets this product down is the lack of distance one can be before the sound breaks up 2 metres \( not 45 metres as stated on the wrapping \) was the best i could do and that was in a straight line no all this item is fit for is the rubbish bin	1
1	i purchased this camera for a friend to use in hawaii we had nothing but problems getting it to wind properly and the pictures both on land and underwater were all blurred and my friend was very unhappy and i was frustrated i do not know if this is just a bad camera or what	1
1	i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame i returned it	1
0	small and compact let me see everyting i wanted to	1
0	it works as specified on my sony hdr hc3 hd camcorder i have used it several times and cant find any noticeable blurs distortions using this lens its a little pricey but well worth the money	1
0	this is a cool implimentation of a much needed device for those with d200s the camera loves batteries having two is good ! having the ability to watch one drain and knowing there 's another on standbye is a fine feeling knowing that there are two more batteries in the case waiting is even better ! for a full day of shooting you need this and some serious memory highly recommended also handles aas always good in field conditions	1
1	i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to 11 inch apertures so i expected better i ordered this for my daughter it arrived defective the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket making collimation impossible in celestron 's defense it likely happened in transit amazon 's return policy is not a hassle and i'm upgrading her to another telescope i'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily	1
1	this battery only gives me about an hour of playing time on my philips pet724 7 portable dvd divx player after that it claims to have 75 charge left but ca n't even get the player to turn on and does n't charge it if it 's turned off	1
0	i was a little skeptical on this product because of the cheap price and the lack of reviews but it is just what it says it is and i am really happy with my purchase i would definitely buy this again	1
0	i got this bag for under 15 and it is worth every penny it fits my canon zr850 and accessories it looks nice and it seems to be a great quality	1
1	i bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera the night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible it snaps and pops all night long and i have to move it all around to find just the right spot i actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise i live in a single story 2100 sq foot house i should have returned it right away but i kept it because i had no other monitor at the time now 10 months later the volume control does not work anymore ! i am now trying to find a new monitor i love having the video monitor though so i will look for a different brand	1
1	i bought two one time but there was no vedio on lcd as opened for both ! they could not recorded vedio but audio only it seemed that they had n't ccd at all ! i had to mail them back to repare just the day i got them and the jvc even would not cover the charge	1
1	i have owned the s410 camera for almost two years when on new years eve i pulled out my handy camera from the padded case it 's always in and to my horror the e18 error message appeared ! it has n't worked since i paid 400 for this camera and canon would like 110 \( plus taxes \) to fix the problem ridiculous especially since this seems to be a very common problem with their cameras i 've enjoyed the camera 's picture quality and ease of use but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years ! beware of this flaw that canon does n't seem to acknowledge	1
0	multi element add on lense used with kodak dx 7590 provides good wide angle capability note that this is a very large add on lense \( screws into dx 7590 extension piece which costs an additional 20 \) does the job well in most portraiture and scenic applications however two caveats \( 1 \) slight curvature of field in extreme corners of wide angle shots \( ie corners of shots may be noticeably out of focus \) suggest cropping to 95 of original picture to maintain sharpness across plane \( 2 \) size of lense will render pop up flash and outside the lense focusing system \( ultra sonic \) less functional	1
0	i purchased this camera primarily as a back up camera but i find myself using it more and more inplace of my main camera it is a beautiful piece of work	1
1	after about 2 months of light use the camera stopped working also the output format was very difficult to work with absolutely will not work on a mac the price is coming down greatly i saw it for 88 at target	1
1	watch out they will not ship it for 40 days after you buy i	1
0	i have had great luck with other opteka lenses but i had to by a thread adapter what is the thread size of this lens here \? i need to know before i buy opteka please put thread sizes of your lenses in the description thanks !	1
1	description or product is wrong there is no quad independent power charging indicators they are set up in banks of two one light for two charging bays batteries must be charged in banks of two tried e mailing vidpro for additional info on this charger e mail came back as undeliverable cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger	1
1	my camera has broken in less than one year of owning it because i received it as a gift i do n't have the proof of purchase so kodak will not fix my camera for no cost what a lemon the cx7300 is first of all it takes pictures so delayed you never really get a good candid picture what 's broken \? i can take one picture before the batteries go dead i change the batteries one picture change the batteries again one picture	1
1	i bougt this camera and a olymus camera both in the same price range the kodak camera was by far deficeint in quality of image and workmanship avoid this at all cost the olympus was well made durable higher quality picture and ease of use	1
1	bought this to get short vid clips of my daughter to post on her page so i didnt think i would need anything with uber high quality but didnt realize just how poor the quality was on this one in low light conditions it is horrendous even with the night shot on and in good lighting it is barely adequate wish i hadnt spent the money on this and memory card should have put out the dough to get something a bit nicer you get what you pay for	1
1	on reciept of the tripod i found it wrapped and packed \( on the outside \) in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product when i opened the box i found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box there was minimal packing around the tripod itself mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around i have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping also if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company instructions are not part of their package	1
0	i am starting my career as a professional photographer and i have n't had any problems with these filters they come in a nice case and are easy to attach to my lenses	1
1	i got to get it off my chest this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful but the camera has several down sides 1 as all have said it eats batteries big time this is a pain 2 it recharges slow between flash and between non flash forget about catching a great spontaneous moment 3 not durable i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at all i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable any suggestions \? \? \?	1
0	very clear pictures very happy with this camera note that it has only the lcd screen and no viewfinder but this has n't been a problem for me as it 's pretty easy to use	1
1	i purchased this to display mpeg movies \( which it says it can \) i was told by tech support that i had to use a divx encoder and that they must be avi \( which is also incorrect \) the sanyo xacti video camera i was using was mpeg 4 \( the ipod accepts the files without issue \) i tried converting them in quicktime to several different types of mpeg4 and none worked there are better frames out there and i intend on finding out which one is the best i have ordered another brand and will see if it works this was by first product return on amazon	1
0	takes great pics and the 3 screen is really nice wall plug in recharger is nice also i have taken pics outside in sunny overcast rainy conditions indoors at sporting events and around the house in all settings the pics have been truly wonderful a few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics however as canon 's top of the line powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom 3x isnt enough when other cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom also image stabilzation should be included	1
1	i loved this camera when i received it and used it a couple of times then it just stopped working i have since purchased the same camera elsewhere and it is works great maybe this was just a bad egg good camera but 2 months of use for the money was n't good	1
0	considering the price this camera works great i use it for taking family pics and is wonderful what i dont like is the lack of zoomgreat product anyway	1
0	it 's good as my title says however i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off	1
0	this is one fantastic flash i had it on my canon a2e for four years and was ambivilent but if you match this lens with one of canon 's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550ex 's features you have an awesome powerful flexable flash that can change the way you shoot	1
0	i am really enthusiastic about this lens because it is an excellent accessory for my camera at a very convenient price i add it and use it for landscapes mountain views nature images and such and also for group pictures in family photos it does what is supposed to do it increases the field of view while keeping the whole image very clear and in this way the pictures appear more natural a whole view and not a narrow frame with perspective and deepness also quite similar it seems to me to what i see with my own eyes a very useful additional tool	1
0	the beauty of this charger is that it is 110 220v compatable so with the appropriate international connector you can charge your batteries on european voltage i have used two of these with the plug adapters and have kept four sets of batteries charged overnight for two olympus cameras giving a day plus of batteries available for each very few cheap us chargers offer this multi voltage compatability lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors if you plan on traveling internationally this charger is a must !	1
0	i just bought this for about 190 at the local px i am impressed so far i was going to buy the gs180 but for the sale price i would be crazy to pass this up so far the low light is much better than a single ccd the video playback is quiet compared to a few other camcorders that record the motor noise onto the tape i plan on buying an extended battery and a tripod today at the same sale i will use this camcorder mostly for home videos of my son and vacations we take around europe i look froward to using this camcorder a lot	1
0	i have been using kodak cameras for years this is my third kodak digital camera it does everything including taking excellent close up wildlifephotos it is as easy to use as a point and shoot however it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera it is well worth the money look no further this is the camera for you	1
0	installing the software was a piece of cake using it is quite another matter the basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a phd in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles tweaks and options first attempts \? the moon came out real nice but saturn was a white blob with no fine detail nothing like type of pics that the super whizzkids proudly display on the celestron site will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well \( oh was using it on a classic lx200 in good see'ing conditions sorry celestron !	1
1	my wife purchased this for me as a christmas present it started displaying pixels on the screen after about 2 months i 've called digital spectrum sent faxes and emailed them this has been going on for nearly a month a real waste of money my time	1
0	i purchased this bag to carry my hp photosmart digital camera and photo printer along with 100pk 4 x 6 photo paper power cord and two chargers that each hold 4 aa batteries and i still have room left i'm very pleased	1
0	the flash works very well i do wedding photogrphy so i need a good flash it works great i am very happy with this product	1
0	this replacement battery is half the cost of canon 's yet offers longer life i bought it when i first got my sd10 when one battery runs out the spare goes in the lenmar still works great while the canon is near end life ! i am buying two more since they are so cheap ! do not buy no name batteries on ebay they do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money ! do n't do it	1
0	you can check the photos that i took with canon s45 and this housing it works brilliant i just tested in 10meters also there are supported extra lenses for this housing \( macro wide \)	1
0	it was n't the easiest thing to transfer photos from a computer and to delete the samples on the frame was no picnic either but once learned it becomes easier i went from frustrated to happy soon enough	1
1	i loved my 4 1mp sony cypershot i got for christmas in 2005 then a few days after christmas in 2006 the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it if i would tap the camera they would go away but then a few days later i was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working it would turn on but then shut off i had this problem before with low batteries but i changed them and it still did n't work it would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out so many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use so sad camera dea	1
0	this product offers a realy equity between price and quality and a good results in photos	1
0	my search for a semi pro digicam made me do a lot of research and after i shortlisted a few models i had to find the best deal amazon helped me get that deal and today when i look at the performance of the camera so far i am amazed the camera was bound to be good but a special thanks to amazon com for helping me get one at a gr8 price	1
0	pros compact and complete this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it 's reversible backdrop \( gray blue \) i also have used the black back panel for some shots as well construction quality is good \( i found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel which is fabric and held in place with velcro tabs \) sturdy enough for its intended purpose i like the output of the lights seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight cons only one complaint the output of the lights could be stronger requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture	1
1	after three weeks the batteries fails i buy a knew one in walmart and less expensive	1
0	i'm new to the digital slr world i had been using the built in flash on my rebel xt the built in flash had done alright but was nothing to write home about since i had spent most of my money on the camera i needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done this flash met both requirements if you are an advance user you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features yet if you a newbie like me this flash is great ! it has improved my picture quality dramaticly	1
0	very speedy delivery a gift for my daughter she loves it i thought we were to receive a free photo card but did not not really necessary did not know that still playing with it and having a blast i do like that it is weather resistant	1
0	i am new to slrs and i cant belive how good this camera is this camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces i always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent but looking back they look terrible compared to this	1
1	just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted never used returned it	1
1	if you purchase this wide angle lens adapter for the xacti hd1a you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash the adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos it does work well for video the sanyo xacti hd1a camera itself is a disappointment	1
1	i was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first i had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls i located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till i could get there to try it out firstly the bag is nice but does n't hold as much as i thought it still could have worked for my but for one thing this bag is not designed for those with a er womanly build it was the most uncomfortable bag i have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me so glad i was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online just a word of warning to the ladies	1
0	the case is great ! it fits the camera perfectly and is exactly what i expected to receive when ordering the price was right but the shipping was a little higher than i expected	1
0	great product good value maybe a little slow for focusing compared to my old 18 55mm canon lens good quality pictures great all in one lens	1
0	the np bg1 type g lith pack had good picture life but i 'd carry a spare if your going to use your cameras movie feature	1
0	excellent camera kit versatile i have a lot to learn about the camera though as it is no simple point and shoot however in auto mode it takes great point and shoot pictures i look forward to learning how to use it fully lenses came with warranty cards but the camera itself did not i bought the sb 600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 gb compact flash cards to round out the kit camera with lens attached is large which i underestimated 80 camera bag is too small for it all great camera though price was the best i could find anywhere	1
0	i purchased this camera for my son he is a doctoral student and needed to photograph items for his research he was able to learn to use it quickly the battery life is phenomenal	1
1	the camera operates good but i thought it was suppose to be new it looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom it does work but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out	1
1	i purchased a canon camera carrying case that came with an extra battery and uv filtering lense the case came within a few days and is perfect for what i needed smooth fast transaction five star	1
1	this product is worthless you 'd be better off keeping your money and buying a good case at a store overpriced cheap plastic y rip off no deluxe here	1
1	i was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today but after reading the reviews i decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact i'm sure it takes nice pictures but a lot of cameras take nice pictures i have to go where the service will at least respect you	1
0	i bought this underwater housing in anticipation of a trip to the galapagos it worked perfectly and i obtained some really incredible shots both still and video the combination of the canon sd550 and this housing were amazing i did make sure to lubricate the primary o ring each time i opened the housing but the need to do so was reduced by using a larger 1gb memory card both card and battery would last a little over two dives before i need to change one or the other	1
1	return \? ha ha ! ! ! you must email them for permission they do n't provide the email address i have spent untold hours trying to get them to respond they will do everything to avoid returns and amazon just looks the other way do n't do it !	1
0	nice and compact the tripod does n't really work as i expected i am using my own tripod overall is a nice little unit for the money	1
1	i bought this for my wife and she loved it but it broke after the amazon return policy was up i contacted the company by email twice and have not heard from them	1
0	the binoculars were suprisingly lightweight for their size and power the 70mm lens were great at light gathering and the 4 75 mm exit pupilprovide more light than most adults can use \( the avg is 3 4 mm \) with a good strap is easy to wear for long periods and excellent for long distance terrestrial viewing or general astromical use you really need a tripod to use the full power effectively but for short periods those with steady hands can enjoy the binocs on the fly	1
0	my fuji e900 fits perfectly and also the battery charger and extra batteries the front pocket for additional memory cards is a great idea case goes on belt or on neck strap to accomodate personal taste very nice and reasonably priced	1
1	this item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter it produces flare in the picture furthermore after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9 light loss vs multi coated filters like hoya s hmc or b w mrc filters as for polarizer effect itself i think it 's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day \( the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive	1
0	this was delivered so fast that it was unbelievable they sent exactly what was pictured and it works perfectly	1
1	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
0	this was my first digital camera and after reading everything i could get my hands on to read about digital cameras i chose this one it so happens that the last 35mm camera i owned for years was also an olympus	1
0	kodak door strains to shut with this battery nice idea but too bad for kodak owners i have great success though with energizer lithium batteries they last me a long time and fit perfectly	1
1	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit the glass itself was intact but something underneath was clearly broken mailed it in to the factory service company for sony and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost 181 to repair this is 2 3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera	1
1	i do n't know what case others got some have said too tight but mine was very loose the camera is swimming around in the case easily half a centimeter of clearance not recommended just buy the battery and wait for someone to make a good aftermarket case	1
0	works as great as orignal battery you will never know the difference except that is a lot cheaper !	1
0	can someone who bought the kit from adorama tell me 1 \) the battery is the canon genuine nb 1lh battery \? 2 \) the camera case is canon psc 50 case \? thank you in advance	1
1	i bought this camera in february and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died i could review the photos i had taken but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the lcd efv and only turned off when i removed batteries i sent it to fuji repair center and got it back again almost one month later then six months later the camera did exactly same thing i have n't received my camera back yet but i'm sure never will buy a fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after i get from the repair center and at the end of the day i will have wasted almost 500 dlls	1
1	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon it was in my opinion not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i'm not satisfied in this case i did not have time to find another camera case thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion linda sutto	1
1	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
1	this camera is a piece of junk you have to be standing outside in bright sunlight to get a decent picture and then when you try to use the flash it is so bright that everything in the foreground of the picture is washed out not to mention the battery life is horrible i got a 1 gb memory card so i could take lots of pictures but the battery runs out after i took about 10 so all in all if you 're considering buying this thing save the money and frustration and just do n't	1
0	what a great little accessory for my camera could have used it in seattle last month boy did it rain	1
1	nowhere on the package is it indicated that this products requires a particular type of photo memory card \( ms or sd \) it will not operate without it ! on the back of the package it reads download photos with usb cable \( incl \) or simply insert memory card \( ms or sd not incl \) wording is extremely deceiving and implies that photos can be directly downloaded to the device they cannot	1
0	i bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because i knew that if she was going to try digital photography it had to be easy ! the printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends i have used the older cx 7300 \( very similar camera \) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions the lack of optical zoom is a plus for me less to break the c530 is more compact has better resolution and still has the option of using aa batteries when the rechargables die if you want simple digital snapshots you will love this little camera	1
1	received as a christmas present dead by february 24 well actually that 's two months now all it does is flash an error message and nothing i do gets it out of that mode i liked it before it died on me	1
0	it is exactly the same thing as came with my camera just what i neede	1
0	the lenes work on the factory lens only with no feature to add additional lens it works as advertized i would have like to add the wide tell lens to the filter for better out door videoing	1
0	i took this with me recently to australia and shot landscapes as well as others and the pictures came out better than the film cameras i have used recently plus you do n't need a scanner this camera works great a must have for semi pros pros wait for the new 1d pictures come out great at 11 quot x17 quot	1
0	i have received this camera for serveral weeks it 's a good long zoom digital camera i can use it for 18x optical zoom when i set its photo size less than 3m ez the photo is n't blur as i use image stabilized the picture is sharp image quality is good however i have to set the iso at 100 or 200 when the iso is 400 or above i can see the noise and the picture lose detail but every camera has its own defect overall i am satified with this camera and i am enjoying using it to take pictures	1
1	you got to have extremely steady hand or camera stand to use this camaera during my niece wedding i put in a 2gb of memory and we were trigger happy we must have took over couple hundred of pictures however i am very unhappy about the result 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy messy out of focus on the other hand for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand you got a great picture size is good weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size but to some people that 's good quality	1
0	yes it is a very fine lens is and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this i decided to sell it in favour of my ef 24 70 2 8l after 2 weeks of usage f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier bokeh is also worse than the other one the viewfinder gets darker in 1 6 crop bodies 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size plus the macro option is weaker on this one if you do n't care about the weight go with the ef 24 70 2 8l imho	1
1	when i tried to install the software my antivirus said it was infected i tried to install on a different machine with a different antivirus program and got the same result i e mailed celestron over a week ago and no reply	1
1	after just over a year my lens jammed and the display read e18 so i was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect and a defect that canon refuses to admit try googling canon s500 e18 and you 'll see what i meant do n't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight	1
0	if you have the big lenses \( 400mm f 2 8l is usm or even the 70 200mm f 2 8l is usm \) this is totally worth the addition the 2x does not kill the autofocus on the f 2 8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges check compatability on canon 's website you wo n't be disappointed	1
0	i like this small thing work great and cheap	1
0	puts a protective glass over your expensive gla without distortion	1
0	i bought this camera for myself at christmas it is my first digital camera purchase i love the clarity of the pics i love the shutter speed ! i do wish the lens cap would stay on better but that is so minor compared to my likes of the camera	1
1	when it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50 of the time if i was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher it seemed to become less effective each time i used it to the point that now i'm lucky to get a reading 10 of the time it still works for clocking cars but for baseball it is almost useless	1
0	this case is vital to protect the lightweight s1 which could be easily damaged from a drop the case does not detract from the convenience of the s1 it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily	1
1	the quality of the pictures are nice when they will actually print unless you use the printer with your camera on the dock it is incredibly hard to get the darn thing to work if you decide to crop the picture on your pc and then want to print it be prepared to invest time in getting the darn thing to work ! i have had it for sometime now and i have never been more irritated than when it comes time to print pictures on this thing	1
1	i got this for my s70 first off in order to use it you have to set the s70 to radio control \( about 9 button pushes \) then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so \( and only in front of the camera the remote does n't work from the rear ! \) oh and if you want to adjust your framing forget it the zoom is immobilized if you need a cable release i strongly suggest simply using the self timer built into the camera it gives you 2 second and 10 second settings and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time	1
0	i purchased this prior to the birth of my son and it 's doing the job perfectly i do n't have a 2 4ghz phone at home so i ca n't say how it would 've affected its performance but video and sound are very clear at a remote location i'm happy with the product and highly recommend it	1
0	this product fits my camera perfectly and is not at all bulky a great safeguard from falls and the velcro latch provides just enough security	1
0	hi have a rebel extreme and needed to use the high speed mode but the flash could n't even vaguely keep up i was taking pictures of dancers so needed a flash system that could keep up the speedlite really does this perfectly i'm able to take a rapid fire sequence of photos and this flash system is there each time i do n't know if it really helps when taking a single photo but if you want a flash that can keep up this one is great ! i like it so much i'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot to run in slave mode with this one	1
1	because the camera eye moves only in one direction the device had to be permanently attached on a wall across baby 's bed you have to decide whether you want sacrifice the resolution to see the entire crib \( older child can crawl away from the view \) or see just a part of it we have cell phones and wireless network so static was pretty bad we went with graco 's excellent digital imonitor	1
1	boy this is way too much to pay for a hood on this lens it 's a great a lens but this is hardly worth the price	1
0	i canceled this order because shipment was n't going to arrive in time for christmas	1
1	it was not all there the part to put the camera on did not come and i need that to put the camera on so please it for a c875 camera please think you w b	1
0	i purchased this case for my canon a530 camera i find that it does a great job of being light durable and compact it keeps the camera clean and scratch free however i wish the case had a better carrying capacity i would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips i use different ones for different pictures or video batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy the case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn that can be a bit akward otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well	1
0	i just got back from vacation i have a bad back and it was sore i was very happy to discover that the way this bag hangs i could carry my nikon d 70 and one or two extra lens very comfortably gear is super easy to access and the bag provides a nice platform for changing lenses i have other bags which heft lots of gear and they 're great for travel days and the occasional big shoot but if you 're looking to hike \( and have a separate way to carry a tripod \) then this is a wonderful bag	1
0	the quality is definitely great when attached to the s3 is it makes your camera look serious about taking good shots if you are attaching the hood and doing flash photography i suggest you use a slave flash to eliminate the shadow caused by the hood	1
0	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day they are comfortable easy to focus and a great choice for the price these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel concerts sports etc	1
0	very clear pictures very happy with this camera note that it has only the lcd screen and no viewfinder but this has n't been a problem for me as it 's pretty easy to use	1
1	do not buy the case canon sells for this camera it takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in	1
0	i read many reviews at fredmiranda com before i purchased this lens and i was not dissapointed one bit i was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try the macro shots were very sharp and contrasty the center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at f2 8 anything beyond f4 is tack sharp be carefull with this lens though the dof at f2 8 is extremely narrow do n't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp focus properly and crank up the aperture and you 'll get some very satisfying macro shots the only thing i wish this lens had was image stabilizer canon how about a 100mm macro with is \?	1
1	if you like to take pictures with macro lense it sucks i 've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality if you get closer than five inches the pictures messes up i 've had no other problem with the hardware though i hate carrying around that dock and it 's odd shaped charger no other charger cable in the world is going to fit ! so loose it and you 're screwed oh and night photos also suck big time even with the flash on	1
0	i purchased this camera a year ago \( summer 05 \) definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect there are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera but after a year mine is still working perfectly	1
1	it was suggested by amazon com that i buy this product since i was purchasing a canon powershot s2is digital camera not knowing any better i bought it it does n't even work with this model camera i bought a memory card reader instead at a local store bypassed the need for an adapter altogether	1
0	holds all my lenses camera body remote card reader etc with room to spare compares to bags costing 3 times more	1
1	i got the dreaded e18 error after owning this \( naturally \) for just over a year repairs will be at least 100 and repairs are only guaranteed for 90 days even if the exact same problem occurs again ! this is clearly a design flaw \( just read how many users had the same problem \) my first photoshot broke after about a year and a half and since i liked the ease of use and basic design i chalked it up to bad luck and bought another big mistake	1
1	this is a nice looking brown suede camera case based on all the stylus models listed i assumed my olympic stylus 595 would fit in it but unfortunately it does not	1
1	another lense jam problem the lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket and the lense extended and jammed this happened frequently with my old powershot s30 but never caused a problem canon said the warranty is void because there 's a tiny dent on the front and back they said any physical damage voids the warranty i complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily they gave me 20 off the repair	1
0	i did n't have a ton of time to research this flash i 've used it now on several occasions with my canon 5d and could n't be happier with it it 's great for shooting portraits i can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up i would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser get 's rid of the typical flash harsh light	1
1	pros great resolution nice packaging excellent door stop cons stopped working after 3 weeks horrible overall quality no customer support what so ever since i did n't have a receipt \( ebay purchase \) tried contacting the ebay seller for receipt never got a response now i'm stuck with a 360 dollar dead weight tried contacting pacificdigital they offered a none warranty repair for 199 becareful what you purchase on ebay specially pacificdigital products	1
1	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably where you ca n't even tell what you have taken if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did on this useless piece of crap	1
0	for the price paid this is a great camera should last me for a long time debated buying a slr but this seems to have all the features of an expensive slr \( actually it is a slr just no interchangable lenses \) and a lot easier to use	1
0	what i love about this case is its softness and its superior quality it fits just like a glove and it protects the camera at the time it never poses a danger to it \( i have had other older cases that scratched or even crushed the cameras \) this one seems to be an improved model it does not need to have handles because you are supposed to use the strap on the camera highly recommendable	1
1	the magnetic clasp is weak very weak making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it 's own i keep this camera case inside of my purse i would n't recommend this productthere has to be something better	1
1	what a pile of junk three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture if you move at all during that three seconds the picture is a blurred mess even if you do n't move the pictures turn out blurry and dark and if you use the flash you get a lovely white picture of nothing i ca n't believe they sell this thing	1
0	this lens has extremely fast \( and quiet \) focus and is razor sharp what more could you want when photographing wildlife up close	1
0	i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas and he is absolutely in love with them the distance it can handle is slightly above average but the clarity is really where this thing shines its very easy to use and has held up reasonably well i would recomend it to the casual user	1

0	the part is definitely up to nikon 's awesome standards i bought it for future use as i do n't currently have the lens yet but when the price becomes affordable i will purchase it too	1
0	i bought this product almost a month ago its sleek its reliable and has all good features a good digital camera should worth the money for a sony camera this camera has the usualy seen high quality for a sony product	1
0	i needed an extra battery this whole kit was cheaper than the price of the battery alone in addition to the battery you get a standard camera case \( retail 10 20 \) and a very nice shoulder bag intended to carry 2 cameras accessories and the portable canon printer there is absolutely nothing not to like about this deal	1
1	i purchased this along with a sony dcrhc21 this carry case was listed as an accesory so i expected it to be appropriately sized \( as other sony cases i 've purchased fit like a glove \) this case is entirely too large to hold a minidv camcorder the camcorder rattles around inside it if you have extra attachments and lenses maybe you might need this one otherwise i suggest you look at the product specifications note the dimensions and then look at your camcorder 's size	1
1	i purchased this bag because i did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my canon rebel eos digital camera i only have 2 lenses but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables batteries etc i think this is a great unit for the beginner \( like me \) or the pro	1
1	we ownded this for around 10 months but used it for just 5 7 hours it stopped working all of the sudden \( no power \) sent it for warranty \( part no labor \) 160 labor fee just to know what was wrong with it would not but another camcorder from panasonic \( they even wanted me to pay for having it sent back \)	1
1	the photoshare digital frame is a classic example of poor engineering the plug and play ability is aggravating at best freezing two of my computers requiring endless reboots to transfer images photoshare provides zero customer support or technical assistance when you have problems interpreting the very poor operations manual the expensive battery is almost impossible to install the power cord has to be super glued to stay in place and the frame is sloppy and dangerous very easy for unit to fall out buy another brand or just put pictures on disc and use a portable dvd player instead	1
1	i just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid 's indoor soccer games the light was low but not that low you should be able to take a picture without the flash when i took the flash off the picture looked fine on the preview but came out completely black yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level ! what a disappointment i am going to try to return it	1
0	very nice bag and well made however i bought it for the canon dc100 dvd camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment \( cords and charger \)	1
1	there is currently a known issue with many of the sony camcorders this is being called the black screen of death what happens is that the camera works great for 1 2 years then the ccd goes out like a light the camera will not take video again sony is evasive if not downright deceitful about this issue when you call tech support the fact is sony does not stand behind their product if this happens to you sony will not own the defect and you will be out hundreds of dollars there is a lengthy thread on cnet on this issue search for sony black screen wishing you luck in the purchase of your \( not sony \) video camera scot	1
0	bought this remote about a month ago it does what it says you can even use it from behind great little device for the price	1
0	easy to learn takes very good photos in well lighted areas but you do need to use the flash for dimmer environments its low light capabilities are n't that great very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera a bit slow to recharge from a flash though and there 's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken \( not so great for fast action shots even though it touts a sports mode \) it 's a good beginner 's camera a good pocket style camera but certainly not to be mistaken for a high end unit	1
1	the camera \( canon s 80 \) barely fits in the case and there is no room for even an extra storage card much less a second battery pack or the charger i ended up using my old tamrac case that has an extra zippered pouch for accessories total waste of	1
0	nice portable background support kit stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution easy and quick to put up i put it up by myself with very little effort all rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting	1
1	this product link needs to be corrected as the battery contained in the kit is not the same battery which is used in the dcr dvd7 do not purchase this accesory kit if you intend to use it for the dcr dvd7 camera	1
0	this is a great lens for any user professional or amateur this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive clean results a slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm \( 16mm cropped \) but this is easily correctable with software in addition the very fast and absolutely silent usm is a huge plus i highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door architecture shots \( especially realtors \)	1
1	made the mistake of taking this camera on a trip to the pool ! ! pictures were horrible eye piece is the biggest pain ! ! don't buy this piece of junk if you want great good wonderful pictures buy the fuji quicksnap camera kodak could have done much much better	1
1	you have listed this battery as an accessory to the camera and now that i have purchased it i discover that this battery does n't fit this camera it is listed wrong	1
1	in my experience this camera takes great pictures but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate	1
0	i bought this camera owning 2 more digital cameras one kodak and another canon \( a70 \) amazing product pro almost everything cons no audio on videoi definetly recommend the product for the price	1
1	bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error \( appears like the shutter never opens \) and will not record video spoke with jvc and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in will update my rating after i see what is wrong if they can fix it if they will stand behind their product watch for more details before it failed only complaint i had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price	1
1	i was looking for a pair of roof prism binoculars like this for hawk and bird watching i had looked at swarovskis but they were way out of my budget nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution these binoculars are crystal clear with sharp focus the 42mm lens lets in lots of light lots more than the 35 's i 've been using i wear glasses and the twist up and down eyecups are a blessing there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm nice because i always used to lose them for the price these ca n't be beat	1
1	i only got about 2 hours of run time per charge out of this battery so i returned it for my money back and picked up a batterygeek universal dvd battery which is now giving me 7 hours of run time per charge	1

0	the lens adaptor threads on very easily and i 've not seen any loss in color or light from using this filter	1
0	when i had seen this camera on net i had anticipated to be quite big but this one is really small handy except for the lcd panel which is cumbersome to open always its a great camera the zoom is amazing and so is the image stabilization to go with it	1
1	if you can actually get the picture to turn out right it does take pretty decent pictures most of the time the photo is either over exposed or too dark and grainy it also only holds about 5 pictures so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot i was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost 40 dollars and it does n't really seem worth it	1
0	i am extremely happy with this purchase ! i love the 10x zoom when taking pics of my kids	1
1	review unit had a very large defect in the field of view it 's not one of the usual spots from the intensifier tube those i am aware of as i have other night vision devices this goes about 1 4 of the way across near the center had to return it poor quality control update the new one does not have any image defects it also does n't focus as sharply as the first one did \( or my other one does \) but it is n't too bad	1

1	i bought a sony icd mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named digital voice editor sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box you had to buy a new one only patches of the software are available to download the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post sales services think twice before making your buying decision	1
1	i just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the c743 camera the battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger i think it 's odd as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock i'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery i do n't know whether the dock works okay because i did n't get that far this is my second easyshare camera and dock and i was very happy with the first one now i have to buy another battery	1
1	this kit is just junk the quot deluxe blower brush quot is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size there is a quot tweezers quot that is just folded aluminum sheet metal there 's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution the quot lintless cleaning cloth quot is an about 3 quot x 5 quot piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you 'll use about three times and then throw away this kit is not worth buying at any price because it 's not worth the shipping charges	1
0	it is a great compact camera with a good zoom i can now leave a larger lens on my nikon dx 70 and use this for closer shots you do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want i really like it for most general quick shots carry it wth me most of the time	1
1	i bought this camera a year ago the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light but for using indoor \( with flash \) is very very bad when you use flash the photo are not good but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice if you can bought another camera	1
1	i have had this camera for about a year and a half i got so fed up with it that i just bought a new one i admit this camera takes decent pictures in good lighting when the zoom is n't used however this camera takes horrible pictures if the zoom is used i would only recomomend this camera to someone who just wants to take pictures of of thier surroundings or to a younger person who is getting their first digital camera	1
0	i have had this camera for about six months and i still find new features to play with one of my favorite mode is the sequence shots i love its sleek design and its durable shell i carry the camera in my back pocket even in my tightest jeans this is a great camera	1
1	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned i'm not exaggerating i'm so upset for wasting money on it the only pictures that turn out are outside in bright daylight it takes horrible pictures in low light there 's a high level of noise in the photos the video mode moves in and out on its own ruining the video i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos my friend 's 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing it just plain sucks	1
1	not impressed at all with this product you are better off just to plug in your camera in the usb port and let windows process it at least you will get a chance to indicate where you want your pictures saved i suggest you do n't use easyshare software windows pic and fax viewer is far superior to this software if you decide you will use it you will find that all your pics on the hard drive will be set to use easyshare the solution to this is to uninstall easyshare and all pics with revert to windows	1
0	this is a replacement for an identical battery pack that i lost works great long life no problems	1
1	if you are looking to take high quality pictures then look elsewhere it is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what have you but not much else \( or for a beginner in photography or a child \) you have to hold very still if you do n't want your pictures to come out blurry also the flash makes images far too bright and if you do n't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark the only thing i like about this camera is it 's size it 's great to just keep in your pocket or your bag anyway i'm buying a better one soon	1

0	i so love the size and shape of this camera this one takes some good pictures and appear to be quite clear it 's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone this camera may seem like it 's taken a poor quality image but when you transfer them onto a pc they seem so clear ! however it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory as this camera was a gift to me i 'd have to say it was the best birthday present i have received	1
0	very good rechargable battery pack holds charge for a long time even if camera is not used much capable of taking many shots with plenty of review time very pleased with it	1
1	i purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine when i saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images i was embarassed that i had given such an inferior item as a gift perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels i would not recommend this item at all	1
1	i only wish i could return this camera its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants \( what i do most \) and its manual focus is difficult \( very difficult \) to use my much cheaper and lower resolution old minolta does a much better job in low light conditions i find i have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus in addition photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so called high speed memory card do n't buy this camera	1
1	the camera worked fine however after six months it stopped working i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism my use was in no way abusive i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage until i gave it away i guess i should have stayed with canon i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it	1
1	i 've owned this camera a little over a year it was my 2nd digital camera it always had focus issues in low light i thought it was me but after working extensively with the manual after i finally had some time i discovered that it was the camera you really need a tripod for those low light shots i was n't able to return it so i 've taken hundreds of pictures with it it takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen however the lens will no longer contract and i get an error message that is unresolvable unless i pay at least 170 i'm just going to get a better quality camera i will not buy sony again	1
0	this case is great for the quick day outings it is rugged and keeps the camera safe my wife can throw it in her purse and i do n't have to worry about it getting banged up and she does n't have to worry about it being too bulky everyone should have two batteries with any of the canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead	1
0	i had a chance to compare it with a tokina glass canon is better on a contrast and better on a distortion same or even slightly worse on a sharpness and complete looser on a build quality if you are ok with 12mm get tokina	1
0	i bought this camera for my teenage son the only problem we have found so far is that the battery life is too short other than that it is a good camera the slim design is nice and the camera is loaded with features	1
0	solid construction good optics nice sound as mentioned by others the output for the usb transfer is found in the handycam console and not the camera itself a minor annoyance all in all this is a good camera that is touch pricy but you do get what you pay for	1

1	i wish that i could review how well this charger works but unfortunately i ca n't the reason is because it was dead on arrival i essentially bought a 20 00 \( with eek technology 's outrageous shipping \) brick it never worked ever and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit ! at least i have the 4 batteries it came with so it is n't a total loss do n't make the same mistake steer clear of this piece of junk	1
0	this fugifilm padded soft case is strong durable and very attractive it was more than i expected it is very professional looking	1
0	i have looked everywhere for this charger everywhere in town wants me to buy something else that might work it was great to finally find the actual charger that comes with the camera it 's just the right size and plugs right into the wall the prongs fold down and can fit nicely in a carry on bag thanks so much for having this item available	1
1	i just got this printer dock with a camera and the printer feature is a real pain ! the paper will almost never feed no matter what i 've tried when it does feed it ends up jamming i only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone i'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back	1
0	i am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera i 've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots the winding mechanism is easy to use finally i have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember it 's even suited for kids over ten to use mine had lots of fun with their own quick snap	1

1	i have had both the s5000 and the s5100 i was disapointed when my s5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months but i was happy with the picture quality i replaced it with the s5100 it has a slightly better feature set over the s5000 \( in particular shutter speed choices \) while on a trip to niagara falls i was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt \( and i mean slight \) after that it would n't power up i am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable	1
0	this is a good padded case for your camera but the back pocket shown in the picture with a phone stick out was not deep enough for my phone with antenna attached it measure 4 x 3 5 but other than that i enjoy using this bag	1
0	this lens is outstanding speed and sharpness are top notch i use this lens for a wide array of situations and it has always delivered impressive results best lens in it 's class at a reasonable price it 's well built sturdy and not so heavy so it 's relatively easy to carry around canon really impressed me with this lens i use it with my eos system \( traditional and digital cameras \)	1
1	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
1	this bag is very small my canon 20d fits nicely with a small lens but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body we kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag	1
1	panasonic offers a usb driver however no video driver this means that anyone using windows xp will be unable to transfer video to their computer when talking to panasonic they just said they didnt have a driver and were not developing one they offered no suggestions or alternatives	1
1	i got this for my s70 first off in order to use it you have to set the s70 to radio control \( about 9 button pushes \) then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so \( and only in front of the camera the remote does n't work from the rear ! \) oh and if you want to adjust your framing forget it the zoom is immobilized if you need a cable release i strongly suggest simply using the self timer built into the camera it gives you 2 second and 10 second settings and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time	1
1	nice look good feel turns on fast takes great pictures really great with ridiculous depth of field and resolution you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the lcd back which is huge so what 's my beef \? slow pictures double flash slow slow follow on shot slow okay say cheese one second two seconds i only got thiis camera because i thought that problem was solved yes my battery is charged no i do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye \? slow i hate it ! ! ! ! ! ! still its awsome slick and a fair price	1
1	should have listened to the reviewer before me unit arrived dead neither ac power or car charger worked tried replacing the 4 batteries that came with it with my other known batteries and unit still did not work	1
0	i really enjoy this camera mine has the carl zeiss vario tessar lens it works grewat be sure to use the memory stick pro media a great reasonable priced camera	1
0	the camcorder compact power adapter workedvery well i was given great help in finding theright one for my canon camcorder which in itselfwas amazing 5 stars to the product and to the helperswho helped me locate the right one	1
0	this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer basically it 's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed the white box is for general use also available are the green omni bounce for florescent lighting and the gold omni bounce for a warming effect pros inexpensive solution for better flash photography a quality product that works cons non	1
0	i owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f 2 8 version overall i was very happy with the f 4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses and the f 4 can provide plenty of background blur if you are shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend the f 4	1
1	it looks great genuine leather much better than synthetic like a brand named leather wallet but there is no where you can tie the case to the camera hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos there is no where to put the essential accessories \( battery and another memory stick \) there is no way to clip to the belt will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost bought another handy synthetic case afterwards	1
1	i'm giving this a 2 stars only because my daughter also had this camera onher wish list if not i would of been upset having recieved the wrong camerathat i ordered	1
0	this filter is an excellent cost efficient way to protect your valuable lenses	1
0	this is a great back pack ! if there is anything i would change it would be the logo on the front it 's brite and shinny and i 'd rather not advertise that i have a camera in there ! i colored it in with a felt pen and it works great overall i love the backpack ! !	1
0	i got a nikon laser rangefinder for chrisymas and it had an 8x magnification i found this to be to powerful for golf i could not hold it steady on the flag the 6x magnification on the bushnell yardage pro scout was much better also it is very compact and stores easily in my golf cart the price from amazon was well below i could find anywhere else	1
0	i purchased the axion 10 4 frame for my wife to replace a defective polaroid frame from a different source the axion stacked up quite nicely to the other more expensive frame the axion is viewable from more angles than the polaroid frame with a cheaper price tag quality of the display is better on the axion and we have not had any technical issues pros brightness controlcolor and contrast of displayease of setup and operationgood sound from speakers on music playbackcons slide show transitions are from top to bottom only different transitions would be a nice feature remote does not control volume of music overall the advantages of this frame outweigh the disadvantages we have been very happy overall with this purchase	1
1	my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800 my intent was to put him in the shade that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000 tried new batteries tried bluffing even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500 600 yards my opinion is this product is not worth the postage anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product	1
0	purchased as a gift and well received seems to handle larger chips in a timely manner runs everyday all day and no problems encountered displays vacation pictures clearly like that it is big enough to view across the room frame is more compatible with decore than the 7 model previously purchased	1
1	i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over exposed i have n't changed anything or done anything i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera but given the price i'm pretty annoyed and amazon com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	1
0	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day they are comfortable easy to focus and a great choice for the price these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel concerts sports etc	1
1	the en el3a is a works fine and with no problems however amazon is misleading its customers by putting a lower price from a partner company as the primary price of the item amazon should market the item at it 's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner the 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon 's misleading advertisment	1
1	i recently ordered a kodak camera from amazon com with that i also ordered this battery the camera bag everything was delivered as expected except the camera over 2 weeks later i was notified the camera is not available now i'm stuck with a battery camera bag that i ca n't return because they came from another seller the camera i bought from a different seller came with the bag uses a different battery now i'm out the cost of the battery the bag the shipping charges ! thanks a lot	1
0	i have used this lens for over 6 months now and have over 1k shots through it it is as fantastic as others note herein the 2 8 through the focus range is really great superb the vr function is really a neat trick it is super fun to play with the drawbacks are size and weight after a 1 2 hour of shooting your arms will get tired remember to be careful and hold the lens and not the camera this lens is definately heavy enough to bend warp the camera body	1
1	the title says it all one month the warranty expired the zoom feature on the camera broke making a horrible grinding noise if you attempted to turn it on the camera is all but useless the fuji shop said they need to replace the lens assembly at a cost of at least us 120 for that price i'm buying a new camera but not another f10	1
0	this camera case is great it 's very small and fits my coolpix 4600 perfectly there is enough room to fit an extra memory card and some batteries \( but the batteries make it tight \) i originally purchased the camera case listed for the 4600 but it was a little bulky and the zipper could scratch the camera if you are n't careful this camera case does not come with a strap like the other but that is something i would never use i highly recommend this case for those who want a small sleek case to protect their camera	1
0	i used the product at victoris falls and was very pleased at this time i have not gone under water with it	1
1	my frame freezes after displaying a few pictures the remote does n't work there is no website for contact or support	1
0	was pleased to receive the kodak schneider kreuznach xenar 1 4x 55mm telephoto lens and at a huge discount compared to other merchants i do freelance photography and purchased this lens to use with the kodak p712 the kodak p712 is a great camera and takes excellent pictures by adding the kodak schneider kreuznach xenar 1 4x 55mm telephoto lens to the p712 it makes already great pictures even better and what clarity i recommend this product to everyone !	1
1	careful this cable may work for most digital cameras but it does not work with canon digital camera	1
0	i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned really nice camera has a nice dslr type feel 71 of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 \( as of today \) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20 buyers may be on the more megapixel bandwagon you can do a lot with 5 megapixels i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr	1
1	i purchased this camera for my 13 yr old daughter as her first digital camera it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase the flash stopped working the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light i would not recommend this camera	1
0	other than the months of waiting for nikon to deliver them to amazon for shipping the battery itself in a good deal they work well charge up easy and hold their charge nicely priced well they cost less than the same type battery than canon or sony i bought them for a d80 and the older en el3a would not fit of course i had 10 of the older batteries for my d70s and was rather surprised when they did n't fit the d80 basically the same size and shape but keyed differently i was also surprised to find the 3e would fit in the d70s meaning they are backward compatable	1
1	beware of assuming that the uv filter recommended by amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that i purchased is the correct size it was n't even close no size was given for the lense diameter i returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping all the hassel of packaging it	1
1	bought the camera charger and the kit as part of the deal every thing looks good except the missing npf 50 battery requested for a replacement in the replacement kit also battery was missing returned both the items 59 99 for a carry bag and 3 dvd sis not worth buying this item	1
1	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably where you ca n't even tell what you have taken if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did on this useless piece of crap	1
1	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned i'm not exaggerating i'm so upset for wasting money on it the only pictures that turn out are outside in bright daylight it takes horrible pictures in low light there 's a high level of noise in the photos the video mode moves in and out on its own ruining the video i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos my friend 's 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing it just plain sucks	1
1	i ordered the camera case for the canon digital elph 450 and i was given a completely different one prices sound great but they do not deliver what you buy had a bad experience with them	1
0	i purchased this for my canons500 i have it for over a year now and it is still as good as new good quality construction and a great look feel	1
0	i purchased this kit primarily for the extra battery which retails for about what i paid for this item having the backup battery is great but i was pleasantly suprised by the soft case it protects my dsc p200 without being bulky or heavy with the camera being so small it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money the case for the memory sticks is nice as well it is easy to lose a stick if it 's just floating around and the case keeps them securely all in all this is an excellent value	1
0	this kit is a must have for any of the compatible canon cameras digital camera rule 1 always carry a spare battery the kit is almost worth it for that alone the leather case is great stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera the neck strap is quite strong and looks good too it may not be everyone 's cup of tea but i like it it comes in handy when i need quick access to the camera and do n't want to fumble through pockets or bags	1
1	i made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely the lens is for a variety of canon cameras but the adapter only works with the a6xx series my adapter arrived and it does n't work with my camera kinda misleading and now i have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately bummer also captain jack is correct about the vignetting this lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built in zoom lens if you zoom wide angle you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned if you stay zoomed in it works ok disappointing	1
0	everything was excellent the digital camera the delivery thank you a lot ! ! ! !	1
0	2 years of heavy use not even one little bitty problem they 've traveled well under harsh conditions and they still function wonderfully there you go	1
0	i love this flash i just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly i still do n't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual i would definitely recommend this flash	1
0	very compact light and easy to hold full marks for design buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to but ok once mastered main downside for me it only takes dvd r rw and not dvd r rw bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones ! also can be a problem taking it abroad i had issues charging it as it would take a standard us to uk converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal us plugs	1
1	this is absolutely the worse digital device i have ever owned the manual is worthless and the web site even worse i try to delete the included photos and nothing happens i ca n't download photos from my mac if your digital memory card has many photos good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame	1
0	this lens does ok at magnifying about 2x max on full zoom the magnification was not as sharp as without the close up lens	1
1	poor focus blurry awful optics do n't waste your time with this one ! ca n't compare to the little pure digital camcorder that this device was to replace because of its additional features	1
1	camera worked great for us for 6 months easy to use decent pictures and good software the battery life was fine for our use it quit working at six months and would no longer focus and is now useless for a six month disposable camera its a little expensive	1
0	i am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera occaisionally when i turn it on the lense doies n't slide out which is a little disconcerting however if i tap it or turn it off and turn it o n again it comes out to the operational position i enjoy using it amd would n't hesitate to purchase another one	1
1	have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid instructions worthless only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and error after getting best possible settings main problem is still picture quality using high quality jpg files as input photos display with about the visual sharpness of the sunday funnies individual dots very noticeable even at some distance not at all like what i have seen in other digital picture frames just arrived from amazon and intended as a v day gift \( tomorrow \) for my wife big disappointment guess i better make a dash to the florist	1
1	i bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my rebel xt amazingly i find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit i find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance \( 8 10 feet \) to be under exposed unless i correct the exposure using the menu would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430ex are better but i cannot recommend this one	1
1	just for the record my lens has frozen as many others have complained on this and earlier casio models presently in iraq i do want to have a camera with me but am not inclined to send it back in view of the reports of poor customer service sad it looked to be a great camera	1
1	i bought this over the sony and i regret it i get a tape eject error every time i try to rewind i can only rewind at 10 second intervals before i get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again that 's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape many canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item i will never buy canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem	1
0	amazon is selling this at nearly 50 off ! the eyepieces are great for a beginner and the great case has room for more when you add them the filters are really cool	1
0	this lens is great i 've been doing portraits and just random snapshots and it makes every picture beautiful ! the only downside is the lack of ability to zoom other than that it 's a great lens	1
0	love my new jvc everio the original model just used compact flash cards but the new everio gz uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year 's worth of video on it ! tape is definitely dead and dvd camcorder 's 30 mintues a disc does n't hold a candle to the everio the only issue i had was that the software that come with it was pretty basic but all the other video editing software programs did n't recognize the everio video files \( mod files which contain mpeg2 video and dolby stereo audio \) i did finally find adobe premiere elements 2 0 which supports this new file type natively it has made editing a breeze	1
1	i love my nikon coolpix 5900 however the lens failed in less than one year service took 6 weeks to repair the lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair why is the lens failing to open again \? i absolutely hate the inconvenience of returning this item again for service although i do have a paid plan for it why ca n't warranty be fast local and competent	1
1	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon it was in my opinion not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i'm not satisfied in this case i did not have time to find another camera case thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion linda sutto	1
0	not only is this beauty wide i have found the lens is very sharp to on my d200 ! it is built solid and focus 's fast and i do n't have any problem with distortion because i use dxo optics software and it cleans it up automaticly ! buy this lens it is cheap for what you get	1
1	they say 100 compatible but is not because is not an info ion litio so is not a eqivalent battery dos n't work do n't expend your money on this stupid batter	1
0	i bought this together with the sony alpha \( very good deal from amazon \) the lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older km 18 70 images are very sharp and the lens is built very well great for wildlife imaging the other reviewers are right the af is n't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera the end of the lens does rotate while zooming it may not be good for some filters	1
0	from all the reviews i read i expected certain pros and cons from this lens i was not disappointed pros very sharp lens with very good colorscons vignetting at wide open and a little too contrastyfor myself the pros outweighed the cons for the price it is ideal for the 1 6 multiplier cameras where it becomes a 38mm lens	1
1	if you are looking for a still shot digital camera ok but why buy this monster for that \? i have a t1 that does the trick there and gives 5mp ok so maybe video \? ok but then why do i want a dvd with nothing but raw footage \? cant edit it without a lot of work \( where is the firewire port or even the ability to edit an mpg file \? \) geeez anyway i am taking mine back it is totally useless to me as i already have a still shot camera save your money dont do it	1
1	i bought this item for 40 online and then found out my canon camera didnt need a cannon brand charger and i could have bought one for 10 instead in total i spent for this charger which included the shipping and handling not worth it go to another store and by one for 10	1
1	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective	1
1	i loved the camera absolutely loved it i was using it one night and it died i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying the second time i used it i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures as i was looking at the pictures it just shut off i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine	1
1	i had high hopes for this battery for my nikon camera it promised more mah than the oem battery that came with the camera unfortunately it must be leaking electrons all over the place since a charge in this model does not compare to the original i would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original nikon battery the price was cheap and you get what you pay for if you are going to purchase this one get two since you 'll need to keep one charging while using the other cheers	1
0	yes this is a very good first camcorder i am a first time user of any cam corder i have olny had mine for a month or so but i have made several films with it and it is very inersting but the software is harder to use that movie maker but if you are a first time buyer then i would go for this becasuse 20gb is engough to use but the battery life is short but u wont need to make a feature length film ! ! ! it is just fantastic enjoy do	1
0	of course it had to be kodak no matter what people say i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera i 've found this camera to be a real warrior last one i had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better photo cuality its very good and colors are great no excesive blue or red in your pics night photo taking its excelent in close shots 4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater but its nothing a 25 batterie charger can`t solve sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje	1
0	after setting booby traps for zombies i like to whip out my bushnell waterproof scope and wait for the oncoming herds to trample on in this scope is just great because it cuts down on glare and is also waterproof it is good to have some foreward advancement of options when dealing with the zombies so when you are set up this scope can give you good range in spotting them on your trail ! !	1
0	i was able to use the canon ef 1 4x ii extender for some nature photography recently in wyoming i shot elk in low light conditions so i was shooting pretty much wide open the extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all you could see the hairs on the animals heads it 's fantastic	1
0	great camera only bad thing are the batteries die very quicklyit takes great pictures and has some good features	1
1	for nearly 100 this adaptor provides very little \( 1 5x \) magnification it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor which is used infrequently by me but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance it is lightweight but cumbersome and does n't accept filters for real telephoto capabilities get an slr with interchangeable lenses i sent this product back	1
0	this product is good for its price the mini tripod inside the switchgrip looks very good and holds my canon pro perfectly the travel bag is also very useful	1
1	a close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera honestly olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for 400 i 've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10 if you 're going to spend that much on a camera get the d70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with the pictures are better and it offers more mp	1
1	in my opinion this is not a marketable product the cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work there is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix when it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit as for hd possibly at high noon in the sahara but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing	1
1	i purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend i will start out by saying that when i first purchased this frame i loved it the display contrast and brightness were great however after 5 short months the display 's pixels started acting funny they get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it 's back to bad pixels myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue in conclusion it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons	1
1	doesnt work even though the lenmar website says it does i thought it was a pretty good deal for 26 i wouldnt even give it one star coz it plain doesnt work	1
1	canon 's 28 135mm with is \( image stabilizer \) is a far better choice for the money	1
0	the enclosure has a solid feel to it i dove with it three times with no problem at all it would be nice if the weight does not cost extra the only compliant i have is that the enclosure is a tight fit so it is very difficult to fit a desiccant into the enclosure	1
0	i bought this sweet little thing because i am planning a day in nyc and do n't want to bring along my regular camera which is bulky this camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket it has 5 mp and a 3x optical zoom which is great for the price the pictures i took outside turned out outstanding inside pics were a bit pixelated but i may have had the settings wrong the camera is easy to use right out of the box perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case	1
1	these glasses should not have the bushnell name on them which misleads one to think they are good quality i bought them for my son and by the time i got around to sending them i discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in so the lens was misaligned it was past the 30 day return date so i glued the crack and kept them for my own use they are still not right but i keep them in my car for occasional use my advice spend some extra money and get a good pair	1
0	we just got this camera after much research the camera is easy to use and we like it but frustrated that it does n't do some of what was advertised for the most part tho for the price and all it is fine just read all the directions and do n't be to disappointed if it does n't play your old 8 mm tapes and a few other things like that i wrote to sony and they said that this model does n't do a few things so main point here is read and read and know what it is i liked the service we received thru amazon no problems ther	1
0	after waiting months for an order to be filled and then getting screwed by customer service returns i decided never to buy from amazon again go to an electronics or camera store you 'll get better service and the fresh air will do you good	1
0	this is a great buy if you are just wanting to have some fun with no real investment although it does go beyond 17 feet and that is not as far as you may think but i used it while snorkeling and the pictures turned out great and i am sure a few were more than 17 feet	1
0	i was really happy with the telescope it was a good buy too i bought one for a friend als	1
1	the battery is half the side of the battery came with the camera an last half the time an number or not the same an it s not the same battery do not buy any thing from them because lying about what they are selling	1
1	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably where you ca n't even tell what you have taken if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did on this useless piece of crap	1
0	my first digicam bought it 2 years ago simple to use great pictures and a year ago \( and hundreds of pictures ago \) i dropped it \( no in its case \) on a cobblestone road no damage have never seen the need to replace it i like the common batteries it uses and the sd memory	1
1	this case is good for protecting your camera from nicks and scratches caused by storing it in purses briefcases or luggage but do n't count on it to protect your camera from falls dirt or dust it looks good the powershot logo gives an authentic look to it	1
0	i just got this camera a month ago and i am satisfied with it it has a lot of features despite its size and for point and shoot i can say it 's a great buy comparable to other power packed cameras it even takes better pictures sometimes but i just had to give it a 4 because i thought i could do more with it but you ca n't do much with the settings since it has it 's own default settings for certain conditions but over all it 's a great camera if you 're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek this is definitely a good buy	1
1	this tripod seemed to be very nice until we tried to extend the legs all of the way two and a half of the legs worked well the third had a section that would not stay extended the locking devices are pretty poor they are made of a cheap plastic and i believe that even the ones that do work well now will not last very long with even moderate use next time i will try to find a tripod with a set screw type of leg extension lock	1
1	my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800 my intent was to put him in the shade that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000 tried new batteries tried bluffing even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500 600 yards my opinion is this product is not worth the postage anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product	1
1	the look and feel of this camcorder is very good unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities for example evening party indoor school activities kid drama and orchestra this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 which was way better than this camcorder this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light i do not recommend it	1
1	i had jvc product and some of my friends too these are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly price may be less buy its not worth for long run i feel sony and canon are better than jvc even hitachi is good	1

1	this magazine comes with lots of advertisements 70 or more plus articles \( less than 15 articles in every issue \) in the magazines are not very useful i subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers now i realize i made a mistake	3
1	first off i subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years and enjoyed it but the main guy robert kennedy is someone who offends me both personally and politically he assumes that every girl women reading that magazine is tiny for his information some of us work out 5 6 days a week and eat well and are still heavy set his comments on heavy set people are offensive thoughtless and sometimes even downright cruel nonetheless the pictures articles were inspiring to me and it is a decent fitness magazine	3

1	i started reading this magazine because i needed something to read but i stopped right away thr articles are pointless because you can buy another magazine and see the same information and same with the pictures the editors of this magazine put exclamation points basically after every single sentence none of which were exciting at all maybe i just hate pop star ! just because i do n't care for celebrity magazines or maybe not but the only people i would recommend this magazine to is children under 10 years of age	3
0	i absolutely adore elle decoration as several other reviewers have noted unfortunately the american version ca n't compare the spaces are gorgeous and infinitely more imaginative and vivacious all of my american magazines \( with the exception of interior design \) get ripped apart with a few pages pulled out and the rest tossed elle decoration always gets saved in its entirety i highly recommend these magazines are eye candy and they are truly worth the extra cost of an import	3

0	i 'll agree with everyone else and say that this magazine probably does need a new name however i love all the other features in the magazine ! it is cooking light but there is so much more always an article on a travel destination an article on beauty and an article on a sport as well as other constants the theme of the magazine is total healthy living incorporating health issues and exercise as well as healthy food though i do think that it is mostly a food magazine i gave it four stars because while the recipies do look good some of the ingredients are a bit too sophisticated for everyday and too expensive	3
1	i subscribed to this publication expecting to read reviews of various fiction non fiction books what it turns out to be is a series of editorials premised around virtually all non fiction all very high brow and frankly quite boring the one item worthwhile is the classifieds i think i 'll ask to cancel my subscription and obtain a refund i anticipated something that would help me in finding great books to read but after 4 issues i have n't seen anything of interest	3

0	the american spectator is a must read for anyone considering themselves an intellectual not only are the articles witty and well researched they also provide well articulated arguments to the most pressing \( if sometimes slighlty out of date \) controversies of the times well worth the subscription price or even the cover price	3
0	i always enjoyed going grocery shopping with my mom while she shopped i hung out in the magazine section reading mad cracked and fangoria now 25 years later i finally got my own subscription and unlike retro video games nostalgic 80 's cd 's and members only jackets this is just as good as i remember it gives the inside scoop on the up coming major studio horror releases the low down on independent if not underground extreme horror dvd 's and as always has awesome pictures of rocking special gore effects any fan of the horror genre would love this magazine it is a great read and a lot of fun	3
0	i like paula deen 's cooking and find that i prefer to order my magazines through amazon because they send me an email update when my subscription is really about to expire so i can choose to renew instead of flooding me with 6 months' worth of letters in the mail saying renew now or else you 'll miss an issue invariably i never missed an issue but i certainly overpaid too soon by sending in subscription cards and renewing too early when i may not have wanted to	3

0	agree with the other reviewer nothing like this in the states no country kitch no traditional just straight modern clean pretty rooms homes it 's expensive that 's the part that stinks i buy it at 7 50 an issue but it 's worth it b c it 's modern there is a lot of minimalism which you very rarely see in u s magazines i keep every copy of this they are always good for reference i read them each dozens of times over	3
1	the pages of men 's journal used to be an escapist weekend getaway in themselves they brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9 11 since that time mj has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be which might have been fine for one issue this is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas	3

1	to be honest i do pick up this mag from the newstand 4 to 5 times a year but i can hardly call myself a fan if you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag wired is not for you it tries too hard to be hip and trendy but it 's group of left lib nerds too often come off as being lame and borish wired needs to be rewired to meet the needs of the modern tech community	3

1	i 've at various times subscribed to stuff maxim and fhm magazines stuff was the only one i ended up not resubscribing to it has its moments and the photography is fine i would describe it as maxim 's younger brother it 's whole attitude seems to be like the younger sibling of the popular kid in high school and this kid then tries to be hip by being just as funny etc but it is forced and very juvenile it just is snarky and predictable after awhile on the other hand i'm not 21 anymore either and maybe if i was in my 20 's i would find this the height of humor	3
0	i purchased this subscription for my 13yr old nephew who just loves it it is wonderfully informative reading matter that really has something for everbody in it now only if he would put it down so others can look at it	3
1	i was going to buy this and then stumbled on it in the doctor 's office i love instyle lucky and other shopping mags but the tone of this is mean and snooty there are too many ads and very little content there 's a q a section about sex after baby that 's just mean threatening that if you do n't jump back in one of you will start sleeping with the girl in marketing way to put an anti feminist tone on sex after baby yuck	3
1	i purchaced this magazine thinking that it would be the next step from the amateur photo magazine level to the serious pro level in fact it is not really either	3
1	big publication little unique coverage the mag is very repetitive and lacking almost no womens coverage gee are they not very hard working cycling athletes as well \? the same big name riders are always mentioned definetly a us publication not covering an international sport may have done more harm than good to cycling with the covers and article structure in 2005 having a lopsided somewhat sensationalized view of the doping issue i would n't subscribe again there are too many other good to excellent choices available	3
0	if you are looking for the quality of an apa journal this is not one but if you love the field of psychology as i do it 's a fun and relevant periodical kind of a enquirer of psychology i find it a fun read when i'm relaxing but be careful of their interpretation of research you know how that can go it 's also got a flavor of maxim or cosmo type topics sex relationships dating what do men women like as well as diet nutrition overall recommended	3

0	this past summer i picked up two issues of this magazine and they sat on my shelf for a few months before i finally got around to reading them i was impressed the quality of this magazine is higher than any other photographic magazine i 've seen the image quality the paper all top notch this is a fine arts magazine and does n't \( at least from what i saw \) spend time with articles about the technical side of the art rather it focuses on individual artists and shows samples of their work there are more great photographs in here than in any other photo magazine i 've read i intend on subscribing	3
0	this magazine does hold my kids' interest and i feel it was worth the money for one year the articles and photos are meaningful and have helped get my kids interested in a variety of world subjects however i probably wo n't renew because i feel the regular national geographic magazine is also suitable for kids and better in the long run i guess it would be good for parents to screen and limit use of the regular magazine with regards to the very young but for the most part kids are exposed to relevant current issues at school and in the media anyway so the issues and photos of national geographic magazine are not too adult or inappropriate	3

1	calling all brighton mums ! this magazine presents a relatively contrived viewpoint on contemporary interior design smothered in advertising for crisp white bed linen and pressed quartz bench tops a pretty lousy effort as australia 's top selling interior design magazine though designed for the wealthy mainstream brighton market vogue interiors will satisfy anyone who does n't quite know what the colour brown will quot work quot with vi 's current editor is david clark art director is anna utzon and interior design editor is matt page	3

0	if you want a magazine based on fashion but merged with stories and interviews of top celebrities then w magazine is perfect for you this large magazine is not only interesting but beautiful it has pages and pages of high quality remarkable photos not to mention tons of beautiful fashion ads if you live for fashion or if you simply admire it you will get latched onto w celebrities such as kate moss mary kate olsen lindsay lohan have graced the cover of this magazine pick it up even if you 're the slighest bit interested you wo n't be disappointed	3
1	i got this magazine as a gift starting a few months back i really ca n't say i'm impressed admittedly i'm much more left leaning than this conservative \( sometimes very very conservative \) magazine dispite my bias i can still recognize good writing and well made points this magazine generally lacks both this is n't to say that i 've never seen a good point or anything they 're just fairly rare if you want to read a well written well argued conservative mag this is n't it	3

1	i subscribed to this publication expecting to read reviews of various fiction non fiction books what it turns out to be is a series of editorials premised around virtually all non fiction all very high brow and frankly quite boring the one item worthwhile is the classifieds i think i 'll ask to cancel my subscription and obtain a refund i anticipated something that would help me in finding great books to read but after 4 issues i have n't seen anything of interest	3

1	elle used to be a great fashion magazine but no longer ofcourse there are too many adds \( but then that 's what pays for the mag \) i just wish that elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles \( the hard hitting type \) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical i buy elle for the fashion beauty advice not to read some pseudo intellectual writer 's hard hitting political agenda for hard hitting news items i read the wall street journal atlantic monthly and watch fox news	3

0	having been a bw subscriber for more than two years i found bw is one of the best business magazines in the us it is funny to see some readers accused bw to be biased granted bw criticized many policies of current administration because they were against long term growth of the economy some of them were pure political manipulations such as steel tariff those policies will do no one 's good business is business for those party faithfuls who spring to defense anytime their party being criticized regardless the causes they do n't need to read anything intelligent and balanced fox news will be suffecient	3

0	entrepreneur magazine is an easy read that allows us working professionals to have access to fresh ideas and interesting articles i consider it a bargain given the amount and quality of information i receive for about a buck there are a lot of ads and subscription offers to deal with but that seems to be the case with most media i do not consider this a substitute for reading books on business it is a good complement however	3

0	this mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality it 's an icon all over the world the editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism she and vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent without vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi billion dollar industry	3

0	this is an excellent magazine but i would have saved 7 00 on an annual subscription by buying it with the enclosed postcard rather than through amazon also i have to wait 12 weeks to receive the first issue ! ! my bad	3
1	laptop mag can be best described negatively it 's not a really serious computer magazine it 's more or less like consumer guide which is basically paid advertising this means you ca n't really trust the article here because you do n't know if they are not written by unbiased writers in the end i feel this is a waste of money besides you can get all the info for free on the web from cnet or zdnet anyway	3

1	this is probably the best music movie magazine out today however you can go to borders books or barnes and nobles and get it for 8 95 or something this deal is bs	3
1	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out every 10 year old 's top priority right \? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span better off with american girl magazine this one 's to mature for younger girls	3
1	vogue knitting does not have customer service strange as it sounds i 've bought subscription through amazon and received 1 issue i since moved to another state and all my magazines followed me except vogue knitting all pleas e mails and other attempts to communicate with magazine failed its been over 6 months and 2 missing issues and i still dont have my magazine probably wo n't on the other hand why would vogue knitting worry about lonely subscriber whose money they long spent	3
1	we paid for a 12 month subscription and i got the magazine for about 4 months i could n't get anyone to answer why it stopped and basically they just took my money i did n't get a 12 month subscription i got ripped off plus when i did get the issues they are very poor paper quality and the covers and some of the pages were always ripped and bent up very disapointing	3
1	change can be good however sometimes change can be very bad earlier this year pc mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers before the change this was a magazine that i would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content now i can skim it in 5 minutes and do n't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time as a longtime subscriber \( 20 years \) i will not be re subscribing to the magazine i wish them luck but i believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them	3
0	great magazine they got good tips on everything eating building muscle sheddin excess fat all that recommend this mag to body builders i get it every month good stuff	3
1	i found this magazine very unrealistic in terms of fashion \( not clothing you would actually see people wearing on a daily basis and definitely not clothing that most people can afford \) the whole magazine is one big ad if i wanted that i could just turn on the tv	3
0	just got this in the mail if i allow si to charge my credit card now for a subscription that is n't due to renew until 12 24 2007 they will send me 60 issues for 39 00 or 65 per issue i have the right to discontinue this automatic billing at any time so there is a very slight savings somewhat offset by the fact that they will use my for an extra 9 months or so \( recognizing that at the typical bank interest rate of 2 that interest is worth about 50 cents so i guess it pushes the per issue rate up to 66 \)	3
0	my 4 year old according to my wife ca n't put this one down ever since the stories started coming it has been non stop reading this is the type of books that i want for my children	3

0	unlike a lot of craft magazines for parents teachers this magazine contains projects that are easy for kids to do that do n't take a lot of expensive or difficult to find materials and that are very attractive when finished i also like the fact that most of the projects allow kids to take an idea and run with it very important when it comes to encouraging creativity	3
1	at one time southern living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas over the past few years it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food in a sad attempt to re arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook only the christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now we cannot speak to its information on gardening just the cooking part if it were not my mother 's habit of reading southern living we would have cancelled this long ago if you are a serious cook get the cookbooks from years ago the current magazine is well beneath you	3
0	this is the intelligent fashion magazine that does n't treat fashion lovers like idiots ! great in depth articles on screenplays celebs charities politics and of course fashion duh !	3
1	they allowed me to try one issue before i paid for the subscription after i read the first issue i decided to cancel there are a couple of good topics but the articles were poorly written for example you could n't see clearly what the conclusions or recommendations are the rest of the magazines are all advertisements which you can get for free from the internet \( or just anywhere \)	3

0	i like this one better than cosmo great info on beauty and the like	3
1	liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money thought it 'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else but instead i 've paid and never received it i have n't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else so this is the first chance i 've had to even say i 've been ripped off they may eventually send it but it 's not likely at this point it 's been a couple months now	3
0	i have been getting this magazine for a year now i have a few new favorites i make on a regular basis the pictures are pretty the prep times have been accurate for my cooking speed the ingredients are all easy to find in my local grocery store there is detailed nutrition info available for the dieters so if you are looking for some nice new things to make this is a great way to find them	3
0	as a renter of a new house that is completely empty i needed some ideas for decorating every room i'm thrilled with home magazine ! it 's got creative ideas for everything from table lamps to kitchen remodels and they always list websites for where to buy the products right on the page by the product ! it does n't get much easier than that	3

1	bad journalism and plenty of adds if you like to exoticize black people then this is your mag nothing to be gained here except maybe the cost	3
0	this is a magazine i frequently get confused with foreign affairs magazine the primary difference is the longer well written essays by leading experts in affairs whereas foreign policy has a more frequently published more up to date and more direct version of the other it would be great to have both since policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail if you do n't have a lot of time to read policy is the one you 'll need and enjoy	3
0	with its weekly distribution there is almost too much information articles are balanced and cover a wide range of topics quickly responds with articles about new concepts and ideas	3
0	this is not my favorite fitness magazine this is the size of a reader 's digest but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover they share reasonable and attainable goals and suggestions for us normal people the magazine seems to cover a wide age group with information that is good for both young and old they do offer recipes workout suggestions and much more the magazine takes little time to read and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase	3
1	i made the mistake of subscribing to this magazine sight unseen i received a very good offer to subscribe that i did n't want to turn down i thought this was going to be like a better homes and gardens or country living but it was n't this appears to be a good choice for design professionals i was just not very impressed	3

0	touchstone is one of the better magazines journals to discuss and debate the meaning of the mind and heart in the contemporary world by standing on the shoulders of those who have struggled with this perennial question in the past the editors numerous in number are orthodox roman and protestant christians who take seriously the creeds and scriptures of the church in other words they realize that tradition is the glue that holds the church together and by extension sanitizes and sanctifies culture first things is also an excellent journal that you will want to check out as well enjoy !	3
1	i got a choice of a free subscription to either parents or child magazine since i already got parents i chose child i will not be renewing when my free subscription is up the magazine is boring the articles irrelevant and there are too many kids fashion pages if you want a magazine about parenting kids go with parents	3
1	i read rolling stone for the music and those who make it not for some guilt ridden agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics \( and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate \) is something we should all read about at nauseum when they stick to music it 's good when they parade their shreiking political views it 's boring	3
0	i'm a beginner and this magazine came highly recommended by experts at the yarn store at first i was amazed at the amount of advertizing i enjoy the variety of patterns offered it still may be a little too advanced for my stage of knitting when reading pattern instructions overall i look forward to future issues	3

1	i loved this magazine in 1995 until a few years ago they have changed editors a few times and now it is not even worth reading the ads no new information glossy pics of models with bright red lips what is about health here \? get life extension magazine and alternative medicine magazine they 've changed too over the last few years but still a far sight better than this one	3
1	was very dissapponted with this magazine they go unread and get thrown out just waiting for our subscription to run out it is really for older kids and of very little interest to younger kids	3
1	i ordered kiplingers and us news on march 25 and was immediately charged for both subscriptions today is october 12th and i 've never received us news i 've complained several times and been given a variety of excuses and promised a refund and free subsciption which of course i have n't received when i requested a refund of course i was given the wrong amount if you want to order magazines i agree with the last reviewer go to another site because while amazon is great for books that have n't got the magazine business straight also the customer service phone numbers are wrong and this is a total mess	3
1	many of us who have contibuted years of creative expertise to our field feel quite insulted by publications of this sort that attempt to take a ride on the creativity of others my advice do not purchase read or advertise in this third rate publication there is little more credibility or validity than watching jerry springer please do not embarass yourself or your clients ! save this one for the bottom of the cat box only	3
1	i bought the magazin on november and i do n't recive it yet	3

1	i bought this magazine as reading material for my flight home from ruzyne airport in prague to nyc this was the first time i ever purchased this magazine terrible choice first of all this magazine was not worth the 10 usd i paid for it it was way too large to do anything with on the airplane and the content was for the lack of a better word boring ! every other page was some chic ad who buys this magazine \? well i will not be buying it again	3

0	i have been reading health off and on since i was in high school in the late 1980s and overall i love this magazine ! the articles are usually rather interesting and there is always at least one long article that i find relevant to my life or curiosities however there are times when the topics articles border on resembling cosmo and glamour rather than really being related to health overall i recommend health as a great read for entertainment purposes and a great reference for health related issues but do n't always expect nobel prize winning research data in every article	3
0	this is a great travel magazine wonderful pictures and stories it is also much cheaper than the equally wonderful travel leisure so that makes conde nast traveler a better deal be aware though the items in this magazine are not very cheap unfortunately go with another magazine \( arthur frommer 's budget travel \) if you want to find travel baragains	3

0	i only got the first issue but it seems to be focused more on poets than other writers \( hence the name \) i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction they might do well to keep the two separate especially the contests and events it 's an attractive format and very upscale high quality literature reviews and advice the stories are well written and enjoyable although i think writers digest offers more for fiction writers	3
1	i was ecstatic when i received this magazine subscription as as gift two issues into my subscription it stopped i was really anticipating the december issue because i had many guests coming and could use some of martha 's helpful advice however it never came and neither did january or february i have called martha stewart living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic i still have not received another issue when i asked to cancel for a refund i was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up being that it was a gift this is useless very clever for martha and very frustrating for the giftee consumer	3

0	smithsonian says it like it was albeit short and sweet without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship especially if it departs from traditional concepts their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh without cut and paste from the time honored sources their article on gavrilo princip the assassin of archduke francis ferdinand shook me to the core thanks smithsonian	3

0	vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous i think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90 10 it still has wonderful fashion tips but the ads are becoming burdonsome in style has replaced vogue as my 1 fashion mag but i 'll always be a vogue reader	3

1	the editor 's gratingly smug and breezy monthly letter sets the pace for this vapid lifestyle magazine which you 'll enjoy only if you 're like her rich creepily entitled self absorbed and interested merely in the accoutrements of opulent dining but not really food or actual cooking itself	3
1	it takes too much time to receive the first book i have n't received the first book yet	3

1	i started my first subscription to this one in 1980 81 it was excellent ! ! it had all kinds of great advice and help on real issues relating to preventing ailments conditions now it 's a little advertising manual for drug users and fad dieters ! wow what a change now i'm not interested in paying to read ads i 'll get my motivation and information on more reliable sources besides i got tired of all the little order forms that kept falling out on my lap while i rode the stationery bike ! what a waste of trees	3

0	my wife loves this magazine so i bought her a one year \( 6 issues \) subscription through amazon com for 25 60 that turned out to be a foolish and impulsive move on my part when i found out that i could have subscribed directly from healthy cooking for 14 95 for one year or 19 95 for two years although i have realized significant reductions on book costs clearly this magazine subscription is excessively priced i will shop more carefully in the future	3
1	this magazine used to be thick fun to read full of information but that was about 5 years ago now it 's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non sense the editorial is almost always filled with political opinions i wo n't renew my subscription	3
1	i 'd always heard about interesting articles in this magazine but the mess of ads and people magazine gossip that lands \( with a big heavy thud \) on my doorstep every month is the most worthless magazine i 've ever made the mistake of purchasing it 's pretentious tripe aimed at a small group of nyc media insiders self regarding movie celebs and those people who 'd like to be part of that world even when they occasionally hit on a compelling subject the writers are so narcissistic as to be truly repellent it 'd be more accurate simply to cut fair out of the title	3

0	with its cheap pricetag and thick size fantasy science fiction is definately one of the best it splits it pages into fantasy science fiction stories and novellas with a few common columns between \( book reviews and strange facts \) if you write fantasy or science fiction pick magazine up	3
1	it took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to 2 weeks after the magazine is already on the stands what 's the point of having a subscription if you get the magazine later than everyone else \? i will never order a magazine from amazon again i 'll go through the actual magazine company instead	3
1	this magazine seems most interested in promoting books etc that it has a financial interest in most notably lately the south beach diet prevention and it 's website are now full of misleading banner ads promoting irresponsible dieting techniques and fads too bad because more than ever nowadays we could use a nice little magazine about nutrition weight loss exercise and natural remedies that is n't influenced by it 's publishing partners and advertisers skip this one and try self or health for a more well rounded look at women 's heath needs	3

1	during the 1970s bicycling was a great magazine with lots of in depth articles about bike tours bike racing and bicycle technology the magazine zoomed downhill through the 1990s into the worthless rag that it is now the articles in the current version of the magazine are very superficial and lifeless many are thinly veiled press releases from various advertisers if you really want to learn about road bicycles and bicycling a much better magazineis cyclingplus for mountain biking try bike or dirt rag	3

0	i have subscribed to business week for two years now i suggest that people accusing them of having a liberal agenda reread their past issues bush was receiving criticism for not being republican enough ! his deficit spending is the most clear example other fiscal conservatives such as george will have criticized the president does that mean they are following a liberal agenda \? i think not	3
1	this magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than 100 on babya outfits etc it is not a magazine for most of america but rather for the elite or those who wish to pretend they are there are way too many ads and insignificant articles parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category	3

0	as a reader i become totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of books that come out each month i usually rely on friends' recommendations and more word of mouth advice but that 's never been enough for me reading a book is an investment to me and i want to make sure my time is well spent bookmarks gives me the confidence that i'm choosing the books i truly want to read i also find that the author profiles in bookmarks are timely and relevant to my broad tastes \( such as the ones on mario vargas llosa and the very interesting japanese writer yukio mishima which also shows that bookmarks looks globally not only regionally for classic authors \)	3
1	when you watch commercial children 's television you have to accept the commercials because after all the programs are free but when you pay to subscribe to nickelodeon magazine i do n't expect for it so be so full of alluring ads targeting children these ads appear similar to the editorial content it seems like 50 of the pages are advertisements ! i was disappointed and wo n't be renewing our subscription better to look at something from the highlights magazine series	3
1	i was very disappointed with this magazine the tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them most articles are rather pretentious and boring in the 5 issues i have received so far only the may 2006 issue had any thing interesting and it only had two articles which were worth it the first was robbed blind which was about rfid chips and the second article was diy ways to go green	3
1	i have n't recieved a single copy so i ca n't really review it all i can say is the amazom service is terrible	3
1	i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i could n't have been more disgusted at the vapid innocuous 'insights' it offered this magazine has no redeeming social value	3
1	the magazine is supposed to be for girls 8 and up it is not an 8 year old girl does not need to have information on contracting herpes being sexually active and kissing i am dissapointed that society thinks 8 year olds are ready for this material and thinks getting this info from a magazine rather than a parent is appropriate	3

0	as a straight female i offer a unique perspective on this magazine i think it 's totally hot i really like the fiction and the guys are such cute young hotties ! some of them look a little mean for my taste they look so challengingly at you instead of invitingly but then again a lot of guys in porn look this way to me this is normal for porn i guess very few if any of them are over beefed \( too muscular \) and some of them are n't muscular at all which means nice variety the fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags i 've looked at lots of first times nothing really bizarre or violent overall a cool magazine	3
0	running times true to its roots is focused on performance worth the price alone for pete pfitzinger 's lab report series and the owner 's manual sections if you want to be a better runner at any level this magazine is invaluable if you want to understand physiology and kinesiology you 'll find no other resource like running times and if you are interested in the sport of running the stats and biographies are crucial and are a much needed spotlight on our sport 's heroes like a true athlete running times eschews junk and filler for focus	3

0	i used to read the online content for this magazine \( i still check out the blog \) but i have to say that there is even more content in the magazine than there is online and it 's really worth subscribing the articles are well written and usually change my mind on issues i may not have realized i had a mind to change on i would recommend this magazine to anyone	3
0	i know it takes eight weeks and maybe longer but i do appreciate the information that i 've gained from store bought maximum pc magazines i do n't build computers but when i do order one it is nice to be familier with the workings and attributes of the new computer yes you can find much information on line and generally faster than the amount of time it takes for the magazine to reach your mailbox however is great to kick back away from the computer in your favorite chair and 'read' about it \) a very good magazine but 'adult' language used at times does not appear to me as professional use of the english language thus the 4 rather than five stars	3
0	the whole dog journal should be mandatory for anyone that loves their dog the information found in this magazine is the best i have ever seen regarding the health and happiness of any dog the editor and contributing writers are the best in the dog world they tell the whole truth about dogs that you will not find anywhere and this information can and has been lifesaving you will not find better information anywhere	3

1	for some strange reason i began receiving this magazine in the mail never ordered never paid for my conclusion based on reading the last three issues you 're kidding me how can time inc still publish this rag \? what 's the point	3
1	where are the critiques \? the articles lack any critical substance whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed it does n't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype vibe will go along with the flow on top of that there are more ads now than ever before even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space	3
0	american spectator mag is an oasis of true conservatism in this jungle of liberalism ! mr emitt tyrell has got to be the coolest guy to ever put together a magazine the information is fantastic the intellect captivating i highly reccommend it to everyone	3

0	there 's a lot to like about lenswork the selection of images the quality of the printing bill jay 's end notes but the thing i like the most is that there is almost no discussion of equipment brooks jensen \( the editor publisher \) does n't appear to care what camera you used to make a photograph or how many miles through a raging blizzard you hiked to make it all that matters is the image and after you 've finished looking at the images you 'll find a lot of wisdom and practical information packed into each issue too highly recommended	3

0	very simple i do not give perfect ratings for anyone or anything	3
1	the pages of men 's journal used to be an escapist weekend getaway in themselves they brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9 11 since that time mj has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be which might have been fine for one issue this is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas	3
1	gee i guess i really ca n't rate it i ordered it on august 9th and still have not recieved it as of november 3rd guess i 'll know better then to order through amazon again	3

1	loved the magazine but after two years of it the onslaught of mostly bare chested men both in the mag and on the cover was too much where are the women \? if it is targeting the gay audience please say so each month i 'd count the number of men vs women photos and there are very few women just unshaven boys not my cup of tea so my subscription has n't been renewed	3
1	at one time southern living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas over the past few years it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food in a sad attempt to re arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook only the christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now we cannot speak to its information on gardening just the cooking part if it were not my mother 's habit of reading southern living we would have cancelled this long ago if you are a serious cook get the cookbooks from years ago the current magazine is well beneath you	3
0	i love paper i always buy it along with the village voice to find out what to do where to go in the city i find it perfect for daytripping it 's got fun fashion too ! \( i'm a professional artist book lover and former new yorker	3

0	this is by far my favorite magazine the pictures are excellent the articles are informative and hilarious it gives information on movies years in advance and the reviews are reliable the best part about this magazine however is that every time i look through it i find something new	3
0	i am a big fan of this magazine but even more so of the free cd when it is good it is very good so i finally subscribed despite the stiff price two issues came i was happy then a third without the cd and then no more after many calls and complaints amazon finally secured a partial refund not exactly what i wanted here 's hoping that the delivery problems can be worked out maybe an opaque wrapper	3
0	stupid that for bad supply side business i havent gotten the magazine and wont get it for at least another month and yet i am asked to write a review for it boo amazon wheres my magazine	3
0	real simple is exactly what the name implies there is no clutter on the pages which is fitting because this is the best magazine for people combatting clutter it 's excellent for those individuals that ca n't multi task well and never throw anything away	3
1	i ordered this magazine thru amazon three months ago and still have n't received a single issue i 've emailed their subscription department to no avail they have my money but i do n't have a magazine	3
0	perhaps this is not the magazine for moms on a tight budget who do n't want to even daydream about designer items but it fills a niche that the big magazines such as parents or parenting does not as a previous reviewer stated this is similar to instyle you may not spend 200 on a pair of designer jenas in size 2t but it 's fun to look at and maybe get one in a similar style on sale and quite frankly some parents do have the money having expensive items does not make a child spoiled raising a child to believe s he is entitled to it does there are spoiled children across all income levels	3
1	once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover unfortunately they 've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising as the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual content in about an hour the rest is advertising and bs this magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago just let it die already like it 's supposed to	3
1	this magazine should be free since there are so many advertisements also it is strictly modern decorating unlike the editor 's claims if you like extreme modern style try it out otherwise invest in something else	3
0	my impression of mainstream american food magazine is that they focus on mostly hearty meals and thick dense and rich desserts which is not what ij 'd like to include in my diet delicious magazine is different it has a lot of refreshing and light dishes it is more expensive then the other magazines probably because it 's being imported and printed in australia \( instead of printed in china like other books nowadays \) you should try to see if your local bookseller carries it because the cover price is only us 8 99 per issue month when i am writing this review amazon is selling it for us 126 for 11 issues you do the math	3
1	i admit they have some good recipes but most of them are not simple and very time consuming there is always a million ingredients in each little recipe if you are a stay at home housewife and absolutely love to cook buy this but if you are just normal you wo n't find many recipes in here for you i suggest you consider 'cuisine at home' before you buy this one	3
0	just received my first issue and it is just wonderful great ideas and recipes which everyone can enjoy looking forward to more issues	3
1	this is definitely the inferior rag of the big trio of science monthlies filled with poorly written articles i actually went back to home depot once to get a refund for this magazine it is indeed worth the gas and time to get a refund if you actually pay for this magazine this magazine promotes commercial products and no i'm not talking about the advertisements but the actual articles themselves the magazine is not a news magazine it is just one big advertising rag where manufacturers have paid to get in if you like paying for ads go for it	3
0	i love entertainment weekly this is a magazine that has everything current outline of plot reviews for movies music tv dvds books it keeps you current it is the one magazine that i go through from cover to cover	3
1	our library has just finished its magazine usage count and to my surprise the american spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues and yet our patronage here is very conservative perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all or maybe as a couple of reviewers suggested with bill clinton out of office it no longer has the same appeal you can change my rating to five stars if you like for the sake of ideology but you still wo n't read the thing just like i do n't read the nation anymore	3
0	i got a subscription for my father on father 's day and he really likes it recommend it	3
1	when i bought this magazine subscription i was under the impression that is for the cosmo that is sold printed in spain i was wrong when my first issue arrived i see that it 's nothing more than the united states english version translated into spanish these 2 magazines are very different in content while i 'll read this i will not renew just a heads up for anyone who wants to purchase this magazine	3

0	i was in the travel industry for years and found cn to be an excellent albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations and all other aspects of travel whether upscale or backpack yes it is not encyclopaedic and yes it is chock full of adverts however the latter brings the cost of publication no doubt and the former allows cn to cover a wide array of topics in each issue their travel product ratings are next to none and shortlists the selection process allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions	3

0	i love this magazine and am on my third year the recipes are interesting healthy and easy to make after a day at work they do n't use fake ingredients which was my complaint with cooking light i 'd rather use real yougurt than fake sour cream for instance and the recipes do n't take all day and 24 7 access to a gourmet supermarket like the ones in gourmet the nutrition articles are interesting and walk a sensible middle line between the low fat and the low carb camps real food for real life	3

1	i just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one i bought for my 14 year old grandson for some reason ziff davis marketers think that full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for pc magazine \( dec 27 2005 p 122 if you want to check it out \) previous issues had partial page ads selling sex pheremones which i could almost overlook but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line	3

1	like a reviewer below said this magazine was good a while back try back in 2002 it used to have better tips and less filler now it 's all filler seriously there are maybe 5 quizzes which do n't say much a dream decoder which is complete phooey and yes the many tweeny posters that i 'd be embarassed to have on my wall even if i were 11 i grew but sadly this magazine did not let alone stay the same nothing is serious in here it 's like the magazines that tweenybopper brats read age reccomendation 9 12simply put this magazine is like m magazine but not as infantile	3
0	less traditional more imaginative worth the extra	3
0	this is a light and colorful newspaper i remember when it first came out the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country the reporting itself is clear and very readable the paper lacks weight and depth it has a lot of variety in its features and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable it 's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers	3
0	golf digest is the best magazine covers great players have standard lessons from top golf teachers and schools and allways very useful tips however it only has one thing against too much advertising or too many advertisers ! !	3
1	after reading the reviews and description i have ordered intermezzo for a relative for two years they were too polite to tell me that they have only received four magazines \( one a duplicate \) in that time period and have n't been able to get the magazine 's customer service to correct the problem it does n't feel good to give a gift that ends up being a pain to the recipient and they still do n't have it take a pass	3
0	i absolutely love this magazine ! it is a wonderful motivation for anyone who wants to be healthy and strong i will be 38 in a few weeks and am considering competing in a fitness competition because of this magazine i read it from beginning to end and my husband even reads it he always asks if i saw the article on this or that which is an indication that the information presented is useful and engaging if you are serious about your health want to get in shape or want to take your body to the next level this is the magazine for you	3
0	i have been a subscriber of shop etc since its debut when i heard that they were going to publish a magazine for familes i ran to subscribe and i have not been disapointed yet ! i love it	3
0	the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic it is one of two magazines i subscribe to \( the other being the new yorker \) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you it is not gourmet or martha stewart \( not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different \) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice	3
0	this is one of the best sources for ideas on home improvement beyond the great ideas they also give you detailed directions on projects along with a good number of pictures i have learned how to do a great number of things i used to hire others to do because i thought i did n't have the skills they make most projects around the house seem accessible but not by oversimplifying the process some may argue that they give too much detail but this is essential for anyone new to a project and can be breezed through for those that are more experienced the only downside is that they give you ideas for things you never knew you needed !	3
0	i subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to woodworkers journal since 1990 each magazine has a character of it 's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents this magazine is a bit more complex than say wood magazine it should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified i have one of woodworking journal 's projects in my living room it is perhaps the most beautiful piece i have ever made if you have become an advanced amature \( sp \? \) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others	3

1	i know apr is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there and i think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine but it 's more of the national enquirer of poetry magazines it 's a large newspaper style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles you 'd be better off subscribing to poetry the hudson review the texas review tar river poetry or any number of other journals	3
0	this is a magazine i frequently get confused with foreign affairs magazine the primary difference is the longer well written essays by leading experts in affairs whereas foreign policy has a more frequently published more up to date and more direct version of the other it would be great to have both since policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail if you do n't have a lot of time to read policy is the one you 'll need and enjoy	3

1	actually we love the game very much but are very disappointed with pressman toys here 's the scoop our game came with only 20 pegs of each color the box clearly shows at least 40 of each color we 've called the company 1800 800 0298 x 186 several times but they refuse to send us additional pegs just bad business practice in my opinion as the saying goes when you love something you tell a few people when you 're not happy you tell everyone i 'll be sure to check that i'm not buying items from pressman toys next time so instead of returning the game and paying for shipping we 'll just have to win in fewer steps sigh !	5

0	my son received this as a christmas gift and thoroughly enjoys it this is not a regular dvd it is designed to go with the read with me dvd system \( a separate remote control that works with it on your tv \) a previous reviewer was not aware of this so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error	5

1	as far as i know there is only one tempo and one type of dance sequence on this mat no matter how much we play around with the different buttons it does not do anything different this was a big request from my 6 year old daughter for christmas and now she hardly plays with it it entertains our 15 month old twins more ! resist any begging by your kids for this item and buy something else a cd boombox maybe	5
1	this toy was so frustrating the pieces would n't snap together properly and it was messy and my son ended up walking away from it he was so fed up this was after a half an hour of me attempting to make the pieces fit together properly in the end it looked like a pile of cloudy lime jello with plastic bones sticking out of it i would not reccomend this toy	5

0	i bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased it is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all the corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on it will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with the price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products	5
1	my daughter was very excited to receive this for christmas until she tried to change the thread that came with the machine it literally would not work anymore i tried everything maybe it 's defective but from other reviews i read i think it 's just a really bad attempt at a great idea too bad she is very disappointed	5
0	my 16 month old loves her new groceries the produce amp amp sandwich parts are plastic amp amp each piece has a wonderful texture the canned goods are very interesting to read they are actually labeled by a supermarket in the uk so they are a bit different from the groceries you would find in the us i put the cardboard frozen food items away until she is older she has been entertained at length because each piece is so intricate this was a great purchase	5

1	my sons received this for christmas and it 's already out of commission the quality of the fabric \( more like paper \) is such that the polls very quickly poked through leaving the folding elasticated sticks to stick out it 's a great idea but if it was a better material so that it would last more than a couple of weeks here 's hoping that i can sew up the holes without tearing it more	5

0	these coins are nice and heavy they have a good feeling when you hold them or keep them in the pouch my son uses them like jack sparrow does in the movie so he does n't die in our play battles however they seemed rather expensive after buying them and having them shipped it would be cheaper to use silver dollars or other real us currency that is large and heavy	5

1	big disappointment cheaply made t rex model does not snap together can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded microscope less functional than a magnifying lens volcano is ok the plaster does work but you must provide ingredients for the eruption weather center very very flimsy and breaks i was quite surprised a name like smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product supplies for crystals subpar for what is required was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons	5
1	it 's a cute little set and i mean little wayyyyy over priced \( \) just did n't live up to expectations	5
1	the only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet but the real promise of this kit to see a model volcano erupt may not be fulfilled we followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base \( above mentioned cheap plastic sheet \) that is extremely difficult to balance on 4 ill fitting stilts a poor experience for the kids the eruption was more of a fizzle waste of money and time	5
0	this was a great buy from amazons sale rack at five dollars and 29 cents plus free shipping my just loves puzzles and we are certainly fond of melissa and doug products we normally purchase them from tuesday morning or our local hobby store because they are usually cheaper this puzzle has made my toddler happy he fits it together then dumps it repeating the process several times a day the drawing is realistic and there are no pegs so it gives a little more grown up feel to the piece	5
1	the controller range is less than 40 feet this car is much too fast for the short range it is very easy to outrun the contoller there is also a delay between control input and vehicle response all batteries were new and fully charged checked with a meter a scanner verified that nothing was causing frequency interference the older tyco turbo cars had a 100 foot controller range and no delay tyco apparently changed the design to the new digital control to allow multiple cars to run at the same time	5
1	this game is for people to play if they 're drunk or mindless or in some cases both it 's completely pointless and uninteresting if ur just going to play bunco to see if u can get 21 snake eyes you either love to waste time or are just stupid sorry but i mean think about it \? why pay money for this when i can just use dice from other more interesting board games i already own \? do not waste your money ! even if you manage to make the game interesting by being creative and thinking a little you still should n't buy it b c like i said before just use dice from other board games you already own !	5

1	i bought these skates for my almost 3 yr old who wants to be like her big sister the skates are good overall they are easy enough to put on and take off the padding inside is nice the only drawback i can find is the the adjustment lever that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting 1 changes by itself to setting 2 which lets the wheels roll i am not sure if i just got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of skates i will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have to keep putting them on the correct setting	5
0	we have the original quot super mastermind quot which is the exact same layout it 's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache it 's fun to watch others work at it too the pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it it 's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts	5

0	our whole family loves this game i like this version because it includes the history and rules of the game on the inside cover i also like that you can close the cover and not lose the dice the construction is a little flimsy and there is not enough felt on the board which makes the dice rolling a little noisy we added a piece of felt on top of the board and it is much better	5

1	purchased 2 pairs for my 8 9 year old daughters for christmas the shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic the box includes bunches of black elastic bands that you need to really s t r e t c h onto the shoes to provide the bounce the more your child weighs the more bands you use but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks they are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them once assembled the kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored they have n't played with them since do n't waste your money	5

1	the idea behind this toy is great ours has lived up to its durability claim my husband did not complain about adding songs to it so it could not have been too bad batteries this eats through them like crazy and we used duracell volume the idea of volume control is good but the highest volume is way too low i ca n't even hear anything until i get it to the mid setting my 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones we probably should not have bought this until next year maybe fisher price will have improved it by then	5

1	i was very excited about this game until it came out of the box it looks great for my 3 year old but as in other reviews the spinner ruins the entire game this should have been obvious at design and this game should never have made it to stores with this defect it is particularly frustrating because the concept seems so good with a lot of thought put into the educational value i think ill will is going to be the result of this penny minding in construction leapfrog could have further enhanced the brand with this product but fumbled	5
0	my 9 year old son just started to understand this game we bought it when he was 7 he would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships he would say where his ships were this game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are it depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game	5

1	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard and i 've thrown most of them out already it does n't take much to crush them there are much nicer sets out there and there are separate pieces sold on ebay that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better not worth the money	5
0	i bought this for my 3 year old daughter she loved it in the store and i thought it was cute i also agree with the other reviewers that there should be instructions for the stickers but you don't need to be a genious to figure out where they go i chose to not sharoen the pencil because she is 3 and i didn't think it was necessary for twenty dollars it is a good buy i know my daughter loves it and is having a lot of fun with it	5
1	this kit is very poorly detailed and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close there 's a much better model of an x wing out there do a web search for a company called fine molds it 's a japanese company that makes a finely detailed 1 72 scale x wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures including parts to build different ships from the original film 's death star battle including standing seated pilot figures different droid types it 's a bit more expensive than this kit but you get what you pay for	5

1	do n't waste your time on this thing until they fix the bugs we bought the bratz one it thought it was a pawz when we took it online after 10 or so total hours \( yes i know what i'm doing \) fighting it i gave up took it back tech support is a joke there 's nothing in the manual or online help only a link to tech support who sends the exact same auto response every time and none of those responses addresses the issue	5
0	her favorite toy she loves the microphone keys light up to prompt her to press the keys and play a song this thing is great	5
1	at first this case seemed like a good idea but after the 3rd use the zipper broke since the case does not stay open on its own there is tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart after fixing it a couple of times it is now permanently broken bad design maybe velcro would have been better	5
0	i was pleasantly surprised at the quality and size of the pool the price is quite reasonable and i was not expecting such a great deal	5
0	bought this one recently for my eight year old \( and myself \) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it more challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games i highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing thinking spatially understanding the consequences of a move or moves and introducing the concept of strategy	5
1	my 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon and so did i initially however during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder the problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy my son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when i saw what had happened personally i would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented otherwise i would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product	5
0	my 2 5 yr old son loves this puzzle i help him put it together and he just loves the challenge and the construction equipment i like how tough the pieces are they have held up even when stepped on and chewed on by a baby very nice	5
0	a retooled mold brings this 60s sci fi kit back to the hands of today 's kit builders ! not quite accurate to the sets miniatures of the original show the passenger compartment should have 2 more seats the control yokes are not included with the pilot 's console plus the top dome is round instead of teardrop shaped but these are all true to the original aurora model would n't take much to fix the mistakes as there are plenty of references replacement decal sheets out there or just build it as is for nostalgia value	5
0	my son \( 5 year old \) chose this toy as his reward and was so excited when he received it he and his brother and dad enjoy countless hours of pretend play as they are all star wars fans it has a realistic appearance and the sound is not irritating as are many toy guns highly recommended	5
1	this game was not engaging my son did not find it interesting he has not asked to play with it again you push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself if you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance try what 's gnu it is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults	5
1	these balls did not retain there round shape from the minute my 2 1 2 year old daughter played with them the balls have that smashed in appearance and you cannot get them back to the original shape i purchased these balls to add to the ball playland made by the moose mountain toymakers ltd that i purchased for my daughter for christmas the balls that were included with the ball playland have retained their shape unlike the balls i purchased separately	5
0	we purchased this for our 5 year old along with the spy goggles he immensely enjoyed both as a matter of fact the adults were quite taken with it too	5
1	i bought this for my 2 yr old at a rummage sale he loves it ! but it 's very flimsy the microphone gives constant feedback adn the volume repeatedly resets to a dangerously loud level it was worth the 6 i paid but i would n't recommend buying it new	5
1	i was also discouraged by the reviews but bought it anyway it was a lot of fun ! while it worked we experienced the same symptoms as the other reviewers here i appreciate the info on how to fix it but should we have to \? it 's too bad because it really is a cute toy and my 2 year old loved it i would not buy it again if you are considering purchasing this toy make sure the company has fixed it first	5
0	this is a very pretty doll i waited until this year to buy her and got her for only fifteen dollars in my opinion that is the only way to buy these fancy dolls on sale ! otherwise they are just too darn expensive i give this particular doll 4 stars she has a pretty face and i like her hair i think the dress is a bit overdone but that is just me i have very simple tatstes	5
0	i love this doll i only saw her in the store and when i did i fell in love with her i cant wait to get her ! but i do think its a bit pricey but its worth the money	5
0	i bought this kitchen for my 18 mos old and she really enjoys cooking and working in it it is a nice compact size that does n't take up too much space she can work at all the different stations and not get frustrated another bonus for me was that it came fully assembled and ready to use straight out of the box my only complaint would be that the doors are somewhat difficult for my daugter to open but i know as she gets older it will become easier i would definitely recommend this kitchen to anyone who in interested in purchasing one for their child	5
0	the shout about line of dvd games are a great way of getting people together we play teams \( at least 3 5 people on each \) and it is always a noisy and fun crowd	5
0	i bought this set for my son who loves to draw and paint he absolutely loved this set the colors are wonderful and the different types of pens paints and crayons make drawing alot more fun for him the case is sturdy and great so he does n't lose anything the price ca n't be better for everything you get	5
0	my son has played with these from 6 months old and still likes them occasionally \( 18 months now \) the small car is nice for babies to shake they do n't do much but they are cute	5

0	my son has really enjoyed this however after marks are made with the washable markers it actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do come out eventually	5
0	my son loves this instrument but i think he likes another saxophone that plays tunes when you press buttons better this one relies on the child to blow and press the keys like a real instrument but does n't sound like a saxophone	5
1	my 2 year old son loves to cook and to serve mommy and daddy meals from his kitchen my only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor it is n't very sturdy but i'm not unhappy with this purchase	5
0	my little granddaughters loved receiving this especially after they figured out the sandbox works best when not dumped on each others heads and the lawn	5
1	i got this for my eight year old unfornately i read the reviews on amazon just before he opened it not before i bought it this is a great idea very poorly implemented i am completely dissappointed and if i had not bought it at a final clearance sale would be bringing it back my son 's previous method of holding a piece of paper over what he wants to copy and then taping them to a well lit window is much better and cheaper	5
0	this figure of the great wayne gretzky is a must have for those who collect hockey memorabilia the figurine is life like with gretzky 's expression looking just as it did whenever he scored a goal what i love most about this toy is that you can purchase gretzkys that wore different jerseys to represent the eras in hockey his playing career spanned if you are like me and collect gretzky memorabilia \( pictures cards jerseys etc \) this is an artifact that will fit quite nicely in your collection	5
0	i purchased this for my daughter a bit before christmas and she loves it it is a great item for the price and does what the bigger brand names does thank you	5
1	a one star rating for this toy is way to charitable the car does nothing but jerk and thats only when repeatedly hitting the button disney should be a shame of themselves for marketing this toy ! surely they had to have an idea about their product 's poor performance my advice is everyone should print off the reviews from amazon and all like it with this in hand march into disney stores and demand \( 1 \) their money back \( 2 \) an apology the only thing less reliable than this was my 1991 gmc jimmy	5
1	there is no magic in this wand what appeared to be a thin wooden malfoy 's wand turned out to be a poor replica made of plastic my son was very disappointed he used his own hard earned money to purchase this item	5
1	i bought it for my 1 and half son he likes it but seveal days after he had it it broken i dont know why just no music he doesnt like it any more	5
0	i work at a daycare and have an 11 mo old and can promise this is a great toy ! my baby loves it and she usually gets bored with toys fast all of the babies like to open and close the door and crawl through it also has a doorbell that rings and a light that turns on it plays several different songs and really keeps the attention of older children as well as babies i highly recommend	5
0	the test of a toy is if the child loves it this toy was perfect	5
1	the description did n't say that the board game was sold separately i assumed a game pack had all the necessary materials it should hae said expansion pack it did n't so i had to go buy the original game it should n't be called wb 50th anniversary it should be called scene it friends version we played one full round with 2 teams and literally half of the questions had to do with the friends tv show all in all i was very disappointed with this product	5
0	i love the loop to hang elmo up to dry and my now 14 month old enjoys drawing with the soap crayons and chewing on them unfortunately not her favorite toy but enjoyed	5
1	want a sure fire way to kill your party \? \? put this dvd in turn the music off make people sit down and play this game it was not fast it was not frightening it was not fun your guests would have more fun watching the paint dry in your basement	5
0	this product is fun for the whole family i hope my kids have as much fun as i did with them when i was young	5
1	i bought this toy for my sons 3rd birthday he likes it but the bean bucket is really light and only takes one or two beans to tip it he does not seem to mind because he is so young but as he gets older i do not think this will be one of his favorites i have a feeling this one will be sitting in the closet	5

1	this playhouse theater is an excellent way to spark your child 's imagination my son received this as a christmas gift last year and it has not only been a theater but a house cave secret hideout restaurant and schoolhouse very colorful and the front chalkboard is excellent for strenghtening writing skills ! the only downside i have with the theater is that it is not very durable the theater is made of some sort of flimsy plywood and it is not secured with screws etc it slides together and a child can easily disassemble it the front panel that the child rest 's his her arms on broke after two weeks of having the theater other than the durability factor great product	5
0	this set of crayons is very durable colorful ! it comes in a cute organized pouch which has 4 zippered compartments that fold togehter and velcro shut the crayons are excellent quality comparable to crayola young kids and adults will enjoy hours of fun with crayons create things to your hearts desire highly recommended product and great for travel too !	5
0	these are really cute and a great alternative to the standard numbers and letters version of these foam tub toys my 2 and 3 year old sons enjoy playing with them no complaints here	5
1	i do n't know why this is but when i put on the dale sr shell for this car it started to understeer on left turns and would always crash into walls	5
1	the toy is a good idea but it needs to be more user friendly instructions are hard to follow even for adults maybe not quite so much activities at one time could simplify some for younger players	5
1	our grandson is barely four years and of average size for his age yet the batmobile is much too small for him for a kid who loves batman it is intriguing and he did try to use it as he pretended to be the batman of his imagination but after just 2 or 3 days he gave up and returned to his tricycle as a result except for the initial 2 or 3 days of limited pleasure he got out of it the batmobile has been a waste of money on the other hand for a child of 3 it should be fun i think for at least awhile	5
1	i recently purchased this computer for my twin granddaughters who are four i have returned them because the screen is too small additionally i thought it would have a word processor it does not it is game oriented	5
0	i bought this for my 5 year old grandson he is very active and i thought it would be a good way to burn up some of that extra energy ! not only does he love it but so does his 2 year old sister my daughter tells me that they both dance and dance until they fall down laughing this was certainly a good buy	5
1	i have since seen other similar complaints on several websites and have written to polyconcept i have to date gotten no satisfaction from either crayola or polyconcept the lines are blurry there is no focus to begin with but the real problem is that the projector detaches constantly from the base whenever you move it touch it etc the dry erase markers do n't erase from the board and the light stopped working after the second time my son played with it i ca n't fathom buying a new light bulb at 4 95 s h after a total hour of use in two sessions i think it 's probably wiring who knows but it 's a disappointing flimsy cheap piece of garbage	5
0	well this is the expansion for settlers of catan and a lot of things have changed the ability to build military forces adds depth to the game as does the city improvements the abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone the expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours my only complaint is that in several games the barbarians have not beaten us once they are way too easy however this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own all in all this makes a great game totally awesome	5
0	this made our 6 year old so happy ! great colors great markers	5
1	the pixel chix 2 story house was suppose to intertwine with other pixel chix products i had bought my granddaughter the car that you were suppose to hook up to the house so that the person could come out of the house and get into the car and vise versa did not work returned this item	5
0	this is the perfect size swimming pool for my 21 month old she loves this pool i love the fact that only the top ring has to be blown up then once you start filling it with water it stands up less risk of tears or holes ! the only thing i would recommend would be some sort of cover for it since it does not come with one	5
1	even though i purchased this watch for my grandson for christmas from another store it was not worth the money it does nothing and my grandson abandoned it soon after opening it i picked up few pieces from under the sofa last night i did see on one toy store 's website that there is a deluxe model that is probably better i wish i had known that before i spend 10 on this piece of junk	5
0	my girls love the sandbox ! the only thing my husband and i do n't like is that you cannot move it once the sand is in it we thought we 'd be able to but the walls are just flimsy enough that you ca n't otherwise a great purchase	5
1	my son loved the toy and could n't wait to get it opened but the problem came when we tried to close it back up the treasuer box would not close back up easily i had to work at it very hard my son who is 7 could not close it by himself he got pretty frustrated	5
0	i give this toy low marks for educational value for two reasons first humans were not contemporary to the brontosaurus and second the egg is too big to have been laid by the adult dinosaur included in the set my mother sent this toy as a gift for my son 's first birthday the package suggests this toy for ages 2 5 and in typical fashion my son found the box to be just as interesting as the toy itself but my three year old daughter was immediately and completely enchanted with the toy she began role playing with the dinosaurs right away i love you very much said the mama dinosaur to her baby supercute	5
1	i ordered this for my 7 yr old grandaughter for valentines day upon receipt it was not operable the user is supposed to ask the love ball a question and then turn it over to see the answer under a clear glass window the answer would not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark liquid	5
1	my daughter received this as a gift we all found it extremely difficult to use i was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out it was not at all easy for a child to enjoy there were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand play it is too advanced difficult to use for the ages listed the screen on the monitor was low graphics poor lighting quality as well this is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter	5
0	we purchased this game for our son for christmas he is a chess lover and we wanted to get him something a little different chaturanga was perfect since it is the precursor to chess he has enjoyed the game all of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition it is an attractive box we are very pleased with every aspect of it	5
1	it has a lot of background noise so you have to set it high to hear the baby	5
0	the game is fun we played it when we lost electricity during hurricane isabel and was kept entertained ! i dont know if i would take everything in the game as seriously as everyone else is writing bad reviews if you look to a board game for truth in life youre not going to get far ! this game is fun and makes you think and re think what you think you know ! i suggest it for teens	5
1	we bought this for our kids for christmas of course we open the box on christmas eve at 10pm to put it together and there are no instructions ! it looks easy but without instructions we are not sure about the pins etc could someone post the phone number of the company so we can call them tomorrow morning should be interesting ! merry christmas	5
1	i agree with the other people who wrote a review ca n't figure out the sequence of events or maybe stylus does not work child not happy and tired of hearing shortcake say the same thing over and over save your money and buy a good book for your kid ! !	5
0	my daughter \( age 13 \) really enjoyed this game it provides more options than scrabble which sometimes frustrates her because her mom and dad are better at that	5
1	my 4 year son is learning about the fragility of life the hard way with this tank two goldfish two flushes if i take the struggling fish out of the tank and put it in a fish bowl it seems to come around but they wo n't last 24 hours in this tank i 've followed the directions to a t adjusted the ph tried lights on lights off pump on pump off even used bottled water but the fish just do a slow fade when in the tank	5
0	the is one of the fastest and easiest to learn games i have ever played the first time we played was on christmas day we had 10 players that ranged from 16 years to 77 years and everyone loved it we played for over 3 hours and decided we had to stop to eat it is also a great way to break the ice i would recommend this game to anyone whether you are a big game player or a beginner this game ca n't be beat	5
0	the game is fun to play even if you 're not a nascar fan ! love it	5
1	this thing just does n't work do n't bother it wo n't stay upright no matter what you do so there 's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it looks like it would be fun if it worked the most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason	5
0	i bought this as a halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004 he loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house he does n't really use it much anymore but now my 18 month old loves it ! he can actually follow the whole progression turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time this toy has been great for our family it is pretty durable some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore but considering what it has gone through it has performed amazingly well	5
0	if you know the movies inside and out this game is fun for the dedicated fan i play with my son that knows so much more star wars trivia than i do but find the game enjoyable the only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times the dvd portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck not sure why they could not load up more questions on the dvd but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old mom that answers so many questions wrong	5
0	this playset is great my son loves it you do have to be careful with the open sides it is very easy to fall off my only complaint was puting it together the instructions are horrible and have no words only pictures the parts are hard to tell apart \( the color coded bolt caps all look the same in the instructions \) and the pieces are hard to handle give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get a couple of friends to help also a power screwdriver should be a required tool to get the screws into the plastic	5
0	when i ironed my 14m son wanted to play with it he helps with the house cleaning i bought this toy iron that really has an on and off switch sprays water and pretend buttons he loves it and pushes it around the carpet like he is ironing the carpet we play iron with the water when i have time this is one toy that i can take anywhere and he stays busy for quite some time sigrid manon blake ramire	5
1	falls over constantly fustrating for everyone only good thing is the sleeping bag that comes with it	5
1	wow i have never seen anything like this it 's worse than bad it is virtually unplayable from a technical perspective at the very least amazon should refuse to carry it	5
0	my 3 year old son received this as a christmas gift last year and he loves it he explores outside and collects things from the yard and hauls them around in the truck must say the truck is durable it stays out on the deck and the weather does n't effect it we hose it down to clean it no issues there highly recommend	5
0	after reading other reviews i too purchased this to use to practice agility with our dog i was n't sure it would be large enough she is an english setter it works perfectly for this size of dog she is approx 35 lbs med size dog cind	5
0	this is a very handy product to have around for our 3 year old if the batteries happen to die while traveling the ac adapter is a life saver for long car trips just as an aside note the adapter does not look like the one in the picture it is gray and orange like the adapters you seen in the store	5
1	this toy is a terrible disappointment it falls apart immediately is very poorly designed and ridiculously difficult for a child \( or adult \) to put together	5
0	the wagon is great as expected 5 stars for the wagon no stars for delivery it arrived with a dent though and when we called they told us a replacement would n't be available until mid february plus we 'd have to figure out how to re pack the thing which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent so we gently banged it out and spray painted the spot and the recipients probably wo n't care but it was a pain in the butt and there did n't seem any way to deal with it that would n't have been too much trouble	5
1	my five and half year old daughter asked for this particular barbie doll she was so happy when she opened her present and found mermaidia elina doll she took it out of the box and started to play with it soon enough she lost interest however the wings are large so large they are actually a burden placing the doll inside the mermaid tail is not easy for little hands either all in all this doll is just make up if you see what i mean pretty but not easy to play with and easily forgotten she is on a stand in my daiughter 's room and has n't been touched or played with since christmas morning not worth the price	5
1	well this game is fun but i ca n't believe some people thought that it would actually take you into space ! well its kinda stupid you just take apart a house puzzle according to some stupid card but still the game is really fun delane	5

0	the item arrived in perfect condition and right when i was told it would be here i am very happy with this product and seller would have no problem doing busy with them agai	5
1	the toy is a lure to a social networking website for little kids they play games against friends who are strangers on the web they chat but only with preapproved messages there is always a reason to come back to the website tomorrow and play some more i do n't think teaching little kids to keep coming back to a website is particularly healthy i really do n't think teaching them to interact with strangers on the internet is a good lesson no matter how sanitized the interactions might be on the webkinz site	5
0	i bought this game for my mom for christmas and we played it right now it is in my game closet because i introduced this game to my poker friends and now we have pit night instead of poker night we can not stop laughing when we play this game we bring this to all get togethers and everyone loves it i had to buy my mom a new pit game because i take it all the time this game is soooo much fun the more people you play with the more fun it is ! ! ! get this game ! !	5

1	with five kids under the age of 9 and four leapsters in the house there is rarely a time when someone is n't playing one \( if not all ! \) of them we have about 10 of the cartridges and this was the most disappointing \( followed closely by spiderman \) there simply is n't enough for them to do with it the beauty of the leapster is the ability to interact with the games and learn while they do it watching a video on a 2 inch screen just does n't cut it	5
0	my kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with renaissance paintings they 've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them i realize this is not the typical situation i was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck it is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid 's knowledge i had hoped for a game like famous authors which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players nonetheless the game is well presented it 's on the expensive side but the book alone is worth half the price looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones \? i recommend this	5
1	paint doesnt load or expel easily waste of money and time my daughter is happier with a bucket of plain water and a brus	5
1	i purchased this for my eight year old niece we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive	5

1	the slides are awful and repetitive my son had to keep asking me what they were pictures of and i could n't even answer him i think the only thing he liked was when i turned the unit on without any slides and the light projected onto the ceiling he thought that looked more like a moon that the acual slide did huge disappointment ! ! ! and the base of the unit is worthless	5
0	my son got this game as a gift i brought it into my junior high classroom to use on a game day the kids love this game and request it over and over many other teachers have asked to borrow it for their classes it is a great vocabulary builder i also made my own cards with letters of the alphabet on them i use these when we are studying parts of speech they have to come up with a noun \( adjective verb etc \) that begins with that letter this is a great game and a good way to make a rather dull subject more interesting	5
1	i bouht this object and i think i would of rather bought a doll or something i brought it home and it didnt work at all so we returned it and the next one was worse ! ! we folloed all the instructions and the sugar that we poured in didnt stick to the stick even worse the store wont let us return it because they say thats how they all work	5

0	my 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it he plays with it just about everyday everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too they all love trying to make baskets the flaws are that it is loud and i wish the baseball and football did more or made noise they do n't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises overall it 's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained !	5
1	i am not too happy with this item it has a handle yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot it is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out and the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use other than that it is attractive looking and constructed well	5
0	this toy is awesome i am a starwars fanatic so i 'll get anything starwars but not cheesy like the darth vader voice changer overall this toy is great	5
0	i purchased the game to play at a christmas party it was a lot of fun thank yo	5

1	this is the cutest furreal i have seen it could have been much better if they would have made it where it would open it 's mouth why did it come with a bottle \? all ir does is grunt and beg does n't walk and it 's eyes do not close so you ca n't pretend it is asleep i ca n't return it cause it was a valantine 's present but at least it is cute as just a stuffed pig	5
0	i bought this for my grandson for christmas he was 8 months old this has been the best learning toy for him along with entertainment he has learned how the shapes work and took this on soon it has also helped him in walking it is entertaining for me to watch him play with this toy he has to push the button and play the music before he pushes it i would actually buy one more for him to have at home with mom and dad this is well worth the money	5
1	our son received this toy for his first birthday it has a lot of good features teaches colors numbers farm animals and their sounds several songs but the music is awful the singer is off key on every single song \( either that or they did a bad job of matching up the music to his voice \) as someone who appreciates music i cannot tolerate listening to this especially since there are far better toys out there since our son already has 2 leapfrog toys which teach the same concepts as this toy \( the learning table which has much better quality music and the fridge farm \) we will be exchanging the vtech discovery nursery farm for a different toy	5
1	i would not suggest the purchase of this product as you will only get a few laughs before it starts falling apart to a useless stage if you have the money and you want to buy it go ahead maybe it 's a great product and i just got a defective one but still not a good show of product to me on their part	5
0	great game for all ages lots of fun if played with many people very intertaining	5
1	unfortunatley i am not very techno savvy i purchased this thinking we could use it on the original hyperscan unit wronge my boys told me otherwise when they opened up the unit and hooked it up this being ben 10 and the original unit being x men did nothing i felt so bad for my son he loves ben 10 and could not even use these cards	5
1	this paint brush globs out the paint does n't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint we went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you ca n't get the brush in it to suck the paint up i am so disappointed	5
0	my son likes this item the cars also fit his train set from imaginarium the only thing i did n't like about putting this together was the elevator very tight fit and does n't like to go up or down easily but everyone likes playing with it from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds	5
1	i agree with the other reviews my four year old received the ranch as a birthday gift none of the pieces stay together at all how do you explain why the gate wo n't hold together why the horse wo n't stand up why the barn doors keep falling off and what do i say to the gift giver when they see it	5
1	i purchased this for my 8 year old for christmas and thought i would be able to store more than just a few songs but the memory capacity is actually only 109m and will actually only hold about 8 10 songs no where near the 2 hours promised i would not recommend this purhcase to any child	5
0	more track is the first thing you 're going to want to buy after your first geotrax train set it will seem like you never have enough straights and curves to bring the track design to reality the switched pieces work out better as the child gets older \( 3 4 \)	5
0	my son got these blocks when he was 2 for christmas he is now 4 and 1 2 and still playing with them it seems no matter what new toy he has gotten every morning i hear him carrying out his bucket of these megabloks i only wish they came is a larger quantity	5
1	my mom says that coffee is bad for you and it makes your teeth yellow why would you want to teach your kid to drink coffee at the age of 3	5
1	i bought this identical bed at toys r us for 175 00 this person is ripping people off do your shopping before paying their mark up and shipping costs	5
0	i 've been thrilled with the car so far super fast and super cheap at this price it could be a little more responsive when turning but otherwise great lasted about 25mins with long fast runs using a generic 9 6v pack by newbright as other person said works better on packed surfaces vs loose dirt and grass i bought it to bring back memories of my old tyco turbo hopper from childhood and it did a great job at that	5
1	i purchased this coffee maker for my 3 yr old son who loves to role play with the real coffee maker we have he was very excited about having his own coffee maker however after only a few days it quit working the lights and sound still work but the water wo n't run anymore he was very disappointed as this was his favorite part of the toy he still enjoys playing with the coffee maker so i will probably not return it because i think it would just break again and he has already accepted the fact that the water does n't work !	5
1	these were purchased for my grandson for christmas they are hard to get on clumsy and do n't have the effect they would have you believe he never really used them and a waste of money they were useless and also very dangerous defintely would not recommend	5
0	my toddler and all of her friends love this play house it is great no assembly required	5
0	my daughter received this loom as a gift for her 6th birthday even though the box says for ages 7 and up and even though she 's not the most nimble fingered kid she has no trouble using this loom with just a little help the materials seem to be high quality and it comes with a good amount of thick colorful yarn the loom has been keeping my daughter happily occupied for long periods of time she enjoys watching me knit but does n't have the dexterity yet to knit herself so she 's thrilled to be able to weave herself scarves and the like	5
1	i am very disappointed in the construction of this toy the picture on the website and the picture on the box made it look like it was made of a more durable material it was made mostly of styrofoam and cost way too much for what it 's made of i have no doubt that this toy will not survive until next christmas i would have sent it back if it had not been from santa	5
1	i would n't waste my time buying anything from this company we purchased the train table for a christmas gift and while assembling it on christmas eve there were quality issues several drilled holes were not drilled in the proper position and the table surface had several deep scratches i called and e mailed the company several times to try and obtain replacement parts and never got a response most companies want you to contact them when you need replacement parts rather than returning it to the store but not kidkraft	5
0	this is a great lego set my 1 1 2 year old son loves them he crashes the truck and caravan all the time and they never break he really likes the bob and cat that come with it these are also the right size to use with the bob click brick sets this truck fits in to the parking thing with the talking click brick trucks	5
0	my really likes this train puzzle he knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it it goes straight across and is over 10 feet long there is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter he will say q quail or n nut when he is putting the piece on the pieces are easy to attach thick and very sturdy the pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off this would make a really nice gift for a 2 4 year old the box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in	5
0	even though i dont have this i think is the most cutest thing i have ever seen	5
1	ok maybe that 's a bit strong but this is hands down our most hated toy \( by the adults and the kids are plenty frustrated too \) we received it as a gift \( and wow whoever would pay 35 for this is crazy \) our son is nearly five needs help to load the truck which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming a time consuming procedure since the dominoes have to be loaded one at a time the dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end and are prone to easy collapse after the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear and that 's something i 've never even contemplated before	5
1	the batmobile itself is nice and stylish for a boy who adores batman but this same boy gets extremely frustrated trying to shoot the coin shaped projectile that it comes with you have to insert it just so to get it to shoot when you press the button and my son does n't always do it then i have to get a butter knife and pry it out so i can put it in for him for 10 dollars it 's worth it so long as your child does n't absolutely want a shooting batmobile ps my sister bought the same one for her son this christmas and is having the same problem so i do not think it is unique to mine	5
0	both my 4 2 year olds love the wedgits my 4 year old however really gets into it she loves to try and make what the pictures tell her i was surprised at how good she was it it really holds her interest	5

1	i was so excited to get the time tracker and am now so frustrated with it the first one that i got did not work at all they sent a second one and this one worked for less than 5 minutes \( we tried 3 different sets of new batteries \) it is such a great concept but unfortunately is very poorly made i was also surprised at how cheap looking the whole thing is in real life	5
0	i bought these for my 5 year old son who is a huge car 's fan he was using matchbox cars and pretending that they were lightening mcqueen and friends but when he recieved the set of these he was so excited these cars are larger than matchbox cars and are heavy for their size good quality ! ! great for the car 's fan in your life	5
0	my daughter \( 15 months \) literally started running in place with excitement when she opened this baby doll which was a gift from my best friend i 've never seen her react like this to any gift my daughter has continued to bring this baby doll around with her everywhere usually she just ditches her toys and plays with the tupperware the doll has a soft squishy body that makes her cuddley despite the fact that she has as my husband is constantly saying a hard plastic head	5
1	this machine does not work i will be returning it to find a better first machine for my daughter the stitiches do not hold every instruction was followed to the letter it is not worth even 4 cents much less 14 dollars i would have paid more for something that acutally works i 'll keep lookin	5
0	we got this as an 11th birthday present for one of my daughter 's friends it was the hit of the birthday party all the girls went home with new yarn belts and my daughter who can already knit a little asked if she could have one too the colors of yarn are bright and the texture is easy to work with for our purposes this was a great birthday present	5
1	i bought this basketball hoop for my son who was two and loved to shoot hoops great height for a small kid but difficult to adjust latch always got stuck also after a few months the latch broke right off now i have a hoop that is too low for the basketball to be any fun for my son now it is just a 30 peice of trash	5
1	i only ordered this because my child was begging for the swimming mermaid i compared amazon 's listing with the manufacture listing and ordered we did not get what we ordered we got a barbie dressed in a mermaid costume not the swimming one ! this was from santa and i'm sorry but seeing that type of disappointment in a six year old 's eyes just breaks your heart of course it was after the packaging was torn apart to get her out and into eager hands for the first time in my years of shopping i feel robbed	5

1	i bought this toy for my son \( the boy 's version \) for his 2nd birthday it was fun for a few days until he went head over heels on a very small slope in our yard the toy landed on top of him with his neck rolled and pinned under the toy he was so terrified of it after that he refused to get back on it has been stored in our basement and will be sold at the next yard sale save your money this toy is too tipsey for toddlers and way too fast for them to control the steering	5
1	bought at toys r us for 8 year old had fun puttingit together and like i said it looks cool however you barely touch it while playing with it and it falls apart even frustrating for a kid i would expect better quality for 40 probably will return	5
1	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard and i 've thrown most of them out already it does n't take much to crush them there are much nicer sets out there and there are separate pieces sold on ebay that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better not worth the money	5
0	this is a great item theres alot going on in such a tiny little space the detail is great from the kraken that can make a boat disappear to the bone cage there 's a collapsing bridge a collapsing building a trap door runaway mill and a cool magnetic boat race and more it comes with jack will norrington and the cannibal chief but no davy that was a little disappointing but anyway its a fun item for all ages	5
1	this was a gift for my 2 year old last christmas the screws they provide to put the wheels on are no good as soon as your child starts walk his new dog the wheels completely unscrew which can be a terrible choking hazzard we have tried everything to keep them on plus the leash tore off from around poor spot 's neck and no type of glue seems to keep it on i'm afraid this cute little toy is going into the trash it was good idea and a cute toy but not worth the money you 're better off buying a plastic already put together one	5
1	my son loves to drive cars i saw this and thought he would love it it is totally unrealistic doesnt make much noise \( which for some parents that would be a but in this case its not \) and it is not entertaining at all paid entirely tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at all i have tried letting some of my friends children play with it and they dont seem to enjoy it either	5
0	my 21 month old daughter received baby pooh for christmas and plays with him every day she loves diapering pooh when her baby brother gets a diaper change and bathes with him nightly he comes with a duckie and bottle of his own the high chair back does not stay attached to the chair but pooh still sits upright and has enjoyed many meals with my daughter pooh is made from hard plastic and sadly his arm broke off when dropped by my husband this weekend my daugher is handling the trauma ok but we are getting her an new pooh for her birthday because she loves him so much i recommend it	5

1	i recently purchased this pad set for my 22 radio flyer wagon but had to send them back if you check the radio flyer web site you 'll notice that the 22 wagon sides only have two wide slats when i received this pad set i noticed the picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats the loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to the center slats since my wagon only has two slats and they are wider the loops were in the wrong spot and were n't big enough to fit around the slats on my wagon i'm only guessing but i think these might be for an older model of wagon	5
0	the girls liked this doll the wings are velcro so they can make her into a princess or play with her as an angel they like that great buy from amazon	5
1	i thought this toy looked fantastic as i was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew the versitility of this one looks great well i liked it more than either one of my children did as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom ! the black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that it just got taken apart and lost its interest no matter which way i arranged the peices infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads	5
1	looks great but not worth the money my son begged for this toy and it was a big dud almost impossible to fly i think once out of 50 tries were we successful made out of flimsy material it chipped and scraped right away do not buy this toy ! ! ! ! !	5
1	ok my kid loves it but after seeing it in person i cant believe how much i was charged for list little plastic toy cost is way over excessive strongly suggest saving your money unless money is no object	5
1	my son received this car for christmas it worked the first time we used it but we noticed that if we forgot to switch the car to the off position when we were done the batteries would die each time my son wanted to use the car we would have to replace the betteries ! the last time we tried to use it we changed the batteries in the car and the remote and it wo n't work so now it 's garbage !	5
0	my one year old son had a great time playing with these blocks he loved the colors and shapes he really enjoyed knocking down my block creations we had such a good time playing with the blocks that i decided to go on line to buy him some i was shocked at the price i cannot believe what these blocks cost for thirty two foam blocks \? ! \? ! \? ! \? ! forget it it 's too bad that these blocks are cost restrictive they 're great fun but not worth the price	5
0	i originally bought this for my husband an emt ff i wrote a poor review of company based upon my entire experience w this storefront and the other items i had purchased i was n't terribly pleased with the pen but my husband took it to work and loved it said it went off several times from pocket while driving and the entire er loved it overall it is fun and writes and does what it 's supposed to make you laugh	5
1	battery is way overpriced contact battery store near you ! i did and found this same exact battery type \( 2 6volt batteries \) for much less while there they told me i could use a low amp 12v deep cycle battery instead it did take some time wiring \( fused link is a must \) but is well worth it lasts all day and you can charge it at a 2 amp trickle charge with a amp selectable car battery charger all told it cost me less than 60 for everything it now longer just takes up space	5
0	i bought the bean bag toss as a christmas gift for my 22 month old son he had played the bean bag toss the first time at the halloween carnival at the church it was all he wanted to play that night i wanted something that would be easy to pick up at the end of the day at just three pieces it is simple to put together and take apart although it says it is for 5 and older it would probably get old fast for a child that age	5
0	we stretched it across our pool but we have a stoper in the line so you fall in the pool we just used some special clamps and a high compression spring the kids love it because they can fly right into the pool	5
1	the figure was sent back for a replacement because the legs did not fit into the body it was defective the same problem with the replacement and it was returned as well	5
1	i bought two of these trikes for my 19 month old twin sons within the first 10 minutes of use they both tipped over numerous times they tipped over when they were trying to use the pedals and also when they were just using their feet on the floor definitely not a sturdy trike my husband and i were very disappointed and returned them immediately in reading other reviews i see that our experience with these trikes is not unique	5
0	i received this for my 3 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it the price is great right now especially with free shipping she loves to dress the doll and use all the accessories more than worth the low price i'm going to stock up on a few more for misc gifts the package is large and comes with a lot of accessories	5
1	it makes cotton candy in 30 minutes because it has to warm for 10 minutes then it have to put put the suger in the middle then wait til becomes webby then wait agian to turn it off parents this machine dosen't work only made with suger thats all it is and also it takes forever \? think before you buy your children will get cavities you will also spend your money on this instead of food or other need	5
1	this is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child there are only two working buttons one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker there is some padding on the top but not enough the manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added overall not a good value at all for the price	5

0	bought this for my boy who just turned 11 let 's just say that he totally loved it and it was the first present he played with two blinking lights on weapon one light on helmet which makes the eyes glow a little pricier than other bionicles but worth it not too hard to put together just make sure you put all of the tiny pieces in a bowl or some such thing so you do n't lose them while assembling the guy the folks at lego are geniuses sure it 's a franchise but they 're doing a great job keeping it interesting	5
1	i would n't even give this toy one star if i was n't forced to mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product with 1980 's graphics and even worse sound it sounds like my husband 's 1985 casio watch the only thing they did well with this product is market it i gave this to my daughter from santa and i am still going to return it	5
1	i cannot believe radio flyer put this bike out ! every single time my 2 year old got on this thing it toppled over ! i actually called radio flyer they denied ever hearing any complaints about this model \( then i found out there are plenty of angry parents out there ! \) after some resistance they agreed to refund me and they did the back wheels are too close together making it very easy to tip over plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable i tried it too in the store on smooth ground but on the sidewalk forget it ! please save yourself the trouble !	5
0	this toy is the coolest toy i 've ever used ! when i have slumber parties i always play music and my friends always say that i have the coolest boombox some of them are even thinking about buying one i love listening to music on my brand new bratz lips boombox and this year at my birthday slumber party i'm gonna play music all night this toy is just so cool ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	5

0	i recently purchased this game using a gift certificate my little boy loves it i think it 's quite interesting as well but there were several typos on the game cards frankly there needs to be better proof reading was this game assembled and printed in another country other than the usa that would probably account for it	5
1	this toy ca n't be unsed unless you go online and update it we have spent countless hours trying to update this toy and ther is always a problem the website is down or some other technical problem then if the website is up you go through the whole process and the toy still does not update so it is unusable ! it is a complete waste of money	5

1	this is a cheaply made over priced product it did n't last a week and i paid over 30 dollars for it and since i ordered it early as a christmas gift i ca n't return it because it has been over 30 days ! ! the drawer to pull out to get the coin rolls out will not go back in all the way therefore the coins fall to the bottom get stuck etc total waist of money that i now cannot get back !	5
0	i think that this was a great gift and definitely worth the money i gave this to my 3 1 2 yr old niece as a christmas gift she loves the wizard of oz she is a big fan of dress up clothes and i also have two more nieces that roughly the same age so there was an outfit for each of them	5
0	i bought my son this toy after reading all the bad reviews i agree that you cant reach all the buttons in the time allocated but he loves it and watches it move round the room i recommend this product for 9 month olds	5

1	purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren this is boring and absolutely no fun no matter what your age i guess for almost 40 you should n't expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting does n't even deserve the one star i gave it	5
1	i ordered two soccer ball kits for my two young sons they were unable to inflate either soccer ball on christmas day because neither of the accompanying pumps and needles worked if there had been no accompanying pump and needle with each kit i would have been better prepared ahead of time to have my own pump ready i had to go out and buy new needles the day after christmas we 'll try again another day to see if we can inflate the balls with a different pump	5
0	i love the upstairs it is so fun because it has an upstairs you can move up a level twice as fast it is more fun to play when you also have the love 2 shop malls \( quoted from my 10 year old daughter	5
0	muffet vs spider ! this is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as muffet makes it a kick butt scene again the turn is to the s m pink black leather bondage look similar to the spiked outfit of red riding hood this is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it 's a great display piece the downfall from five stars is that when setup muffet is almost obscured by the spider both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures	5
1	cheaply put together and does not include the things listed on the editorial review i am extremely disappointed the sides fall out when you close it making the crayons dislodge and roll around it is obvious that hinges on the box will wear out quickly i just cant believe it is such poor quality coming from crayola	5
1	my 10 year old received the massively mini media player for christmas and she and i both are very disappointed in it there is simply not enough memory and this product does not seem to be compatible with our napster files \( at least not readily perhaps i could burn them to cd then rip them back to my computer and then transfer them to the mini media player but i have not tried that yet \) folks 128mb is a joke even for a young child there are much better players out there in the same price range i own the sansa e250 which is a solid little mp3 player and i am seriously considering buying the same model for her as well	5
1	this suduko handheld game was not user friendly i returned it for a full refund	5

1	remember spirograph by kenner you played with as a kid \? this thing hasbro sells under the same name is not that toy it is obviously of cheap quality parred down to a handful of gears and designed so poorly that it doesnt really work ! stick with the original which means purchase it used on ebay but do not buy hasbro 's spirograph	5
1	i was disappointed with the quality of this item little tike is a name i have learned to trust and this was a bummer the front broke because of it 's poor design and flimsy plastic parts so now it is just a broken dump truck also you have to push the button for the sounds to work it is not motion sensitive	5

0	the kit was great i thought it was soo much fun to paint the puppies different colors ! this toy is really cool because you can hang your puppies put magginets on them or just play with them ! this toy is pretty durable but if you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally break if you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this one	5
1	i ca n't wait until i get the movie barbie fairytopia mermaida when it comes out its going to be a great movie for kids and even for the whole family i do n't know if i will get the dolls i think the movie will be funer to watch than just play with the doll	5
0	i think this a great item for a child over 3 1 2 since there are 4 puzzles in one box our son who just turned 3 has a hard time keeping the pieces separate they are symbol coded on the back so i think once he gets older it will get easier he loves the pictures and i love that the pieces are sturdy and how much he is learning highly recommnde	5
1	this product reminds me of thick slightly mushy sand that you would play with at the beach except it comes in colors playdough is much easier to work with if you want to build items objects shapes my daughter will play with playdough for hours but with this product she lost interest after 10 minutes	5
0	just purchased this for my 7 year old son that has cerebral palsey he only has use of his right hand this cartridge is perfect game does not allow mistakes and can play this cartridge with only one hand and not both since my son has use of only one hand he has trouble playing the other vsmile games he 's hooked is very engaging also where some of the other games fall short	5
1	this is the first time i have been truly disappointed in something i have gotten through amazon much smaller than it looks in picture if it was five dollars it would be too much too late now to do anything for christmas just not worth it at all	5

0	we love the accessories this item comes with but the doll itself is we have mixed feelings about her my daughter 4 loves her hair because it 's so different from all her other barbies but she hates her feet her feet are way too big even bigger than ken 's \( my daughter tried making her wear ken 's shoes but it did n't work \) another thing we love and hate about her is that her hands can move like pregnant midge \( good \) and she has a bigger body than most barbie dolls \( bad because she ca n't use the other doll 's clothes \)	5
0	our family played this game a lot during the 60 's we had a blast with it i did n't think much about it until this year when my son turned 6 it 's a blast for family fun	5
0	this is a fun version of battleship and the nice part is being able to play against the game	5
0	this toy is great for many reasons ! ! tengamo are collectible gaming magnets with funny characters you get 6 in a pack and really cool stickers ! each character has point value and rarity if you 're lucky you might get one of the very rare tengamos and sell it for on ebay ! you can also play hundreds of games with the tengamo magnet special design and little steel ball that comes in the pack hurry to collect all of series 1 before it is retired for series 2 highly recommended	5
1	last summer we bought two of these cruisers and both of them broke after only one month of normal use the water squirt function quit working after only a week my kids loved them but for the price these cruisers are they need to be built to last	5
1	my 10 year old son got this for his birthday the screws are so deep inside the ball we finally got so frustrated we just ripped off the foam covering the battery holder to be able to see where to place the screwdriver to get the screws out \( the ball wo n't bounce anyway ! \) even then the screws would not come out ! the lightup goal is great but the ball is ridiculous use your old nerf balls and then it 's okay	5

1	i was very disappointed with the quality of this product i had to request a second kit because the scented oils bottles were empty in the first kit the second kit also had the same problem both kits had to be returned it is difficult to determine how fun this kit would be when it is missing items within the kit	5

0	this emperor penguin puppet is a real hit with my 5 year old we almost never use it as a puppet but rather as a plush toy pal this penguin looks round and pregnant but to my kid this penguin is a perfect friend he has pretty much outgrown all of his plush toys but for some reason this one has a place in his heart and in his imagination	5
0	purchased the batman laptop computer at target for christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old he was totally drawn in because it is batman but the games kept his interest the entire family enjoyed trying the different games dad a musician enjoyed the music game graphics are super i love the way batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even worth the 38 99 i paid at target on sale for sure	5
0	we recently purchased this toy storage unit for our 22 month old son and we could n't be happier it is sturdy and durable a hard combination to find these days looks great but most of all is very functional and user friendly ! ! it only requires 14 screws to assemble and it looks great our son ca n't wait to get up and play yelling toy box and jumping out of bed to grab a bin i will purchase more of these for the different toy areas of our home and would certainly give it as a gift	5
0	i bought this doll on ebay for my daughter for christmas because it wasnt available in stores my daughter who just turned 6 yrs old loves this doll doll speaks both english and spanish the only thing i dont like is that this baby keeps going to sleep after meals but if your child wants to keep it awake you can press the bracelet or put the bottle in the mouth its a good thing if you dont want to run out of batteries soon or to give the doll some rest	5
1	i bought this toy last year for me son he really did not care for the toy at all but he loves elmo the crayons were way too messy and melted really fast	5
1	we bought this toy and returned it as it is poorly designed because it is tall and narrow once a few blocks are in it it is nearly impossible to get any of the shapes in the lowest holes as the space inside the building is filled with blocks already this was a frustrating not very fun toy for our then 12 month old son	5
0	the children in our after school program love this puzzle the colors are beautiful and they are learning about different sea creatures at the same time	5
1	this was a cute product but only lasted a day perhaps my preschool boys' punches were just too much for this bag a patch was included but it seems that air is leaking from the seams oh well	5
1	i bought this for my daughter when she was 2 i agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product it is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over i still let my daughter play with it but only when she 's being supervised around it and i have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground there are other good shape sorters out there i would n't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard	5
1	my child loves geotrax and plays with them everyday however big city lights makes your track look good but does n't have much for a child to interact the crane has a crank to turn but the bricks are hard to get to stick in the clamp and besides a button for sounds that is about all this has to offer unlike other pieces with geomotion this one is a bore my child rarely plays with this piece except to watch the rc trains go under it	5
0	this is a very beautiful doll i love dolls barbie and i also love angels unfortunately this doll is also veryyyyy expensive ! i woudl love to have her but not at this price i will wait until the price drops or i will look for her on e bay i will not pay over 40 dollars for this doll no matter how pretty she is ! i do giver her 5 stars though very nice doll	5

1	my son was excited to get this for christmas after we opened it and put it together it just never worked the way it was designed the arrows launcher never held the arrows as soon as you tried to load them they would fly out the shuriken launcer was cumbersome and difficult to use he pretty much gave up on it after a few days and now it 's gathering dust in our closet	5
0	i purchased this train case for my son last christmas \( age 6 \) it is very sturdy with handle i like that all the trains can be put into one place and carried away simply easily those moms like myself when your child has finished playing there is now a place for them to put their trains in the 'metal' case is a great added bonus the trains have the magnetic ends and they easily go into case next play time the trains are all in one spot thomas come up with a place like this for the track i need it	5
1	i bought two bionicles for my son 's stocking at christmas he is 5 so i had to help him put them together it took forever to construct this sad little robot and within minutes of playing with it it began to fall apart the instructions are not clear and the overall durability just stinks if your child just wants to construct them and display them then this is great if your child wants to play with them forget it go buy a preassembled action figure and move on with your life	5
0	this eeyore is so much fun i gave it a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose but if mom and dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach baby to keep them together i think there is also something to be learned with this plus the fact that he is so darn cute and the little voice is sweet and soothing good night baby just precious baby quickly learns that eeyore only works with the butterfly rattle i thought the ears would be easy to break but they have taken a lickin' from my grandson and still work nana ka	5
1	the board for this game is a pain half the time the tiles that cover the letters stick it takes forever and a day to look in the book locate the letters' locations and uncover them too i love wheel of fortune but you 're better off playing a computerized version where you do n't have all the hassle	5
0	we had a simpler and earlier quercetti marble run this was an upgrade add on and well worth it the motorized elevator keeps the action going a five year old will need help setting up but can operate the final run easily safe pieces easy construction and good directions fun even for the adults	5

1	this product kept my 5 and 3 year olds' attention for ten minutes tops it does not look like the pictures in the ads it usually got stuck in the molds instead of sliding out effortlessly as it would appear in the ad it makes a mess gets all over the place and truly does not seem to be much fun it got put away in the cabinet and my childen never asked for it again my money is better spent on modeling clay or other arts crafts types of activities	5
1	this vehicle is nothing but junk it does not move well on the driveway and does not move on the grass at all my grandson uses his feet to push it which is not what i expected from a 100 00 toy very disappointed i would like to send it back for a full refund	5

0	this is a must have for your little sweetheart ! my daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes it 's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next \) the accessories are cute but she 'd rather use stuff from mommy 's purse \) the purse is oh so cute too and durable my daughter is 21 months old she received this on christmas and has been a favorite since	5
0	everything was great ! great bed easy to assemble my son loves it though he still wants to sleep in my bed but he does play in it that 's a good sign huh	5

1	i got this to for my daughter for her birthday i opened it and put the bubble solution and batteries into it and it worked fine later that night the bubble blower was n't blowing anymore so the next morning i changed out the batteries and still it was n't working i returned it the next day it was really cute and i wanted it to work but it just would n't start and it also kept leaking every where i put it the sticky soap mess was there after i picked it up this was not a good toy	5

1	my son received this car for christmas and i was appalled amazon only says that it requires a 9 volt battery which was no problem getting but as for the 9 v turbo battery and charger good luck finding that i bought it when it was on sale for 19 99 and the original price said it was 59 99 so i thought that i was getting a deal huge mistake ! i did n't know that i would have to purchase an additional 20 battery no wonder why it was only 19 99 ! its a piece of junk i also got the batboat but i'm afraid to see what that might need my advice dont get it	5
1	the idea behind this is n't too bad and my 4 year old really enjoyed them for a short time but it has some really ridiculous quirks the shoes are not on any type of timer so they will stay on indefinitely unless your child turns off each of them individually so what ends up happening of course is dead batteries within a day or so the wand and the tiara both work fine so maybe that set would n't be too bad but it annoys me that they would even release something as ridiculous as this	5
0	my son got this for christma when he was 10 months old from day one he loves to push it around the house he 's 13 months old now and he can get on to ride it his friends love it also	5
1	there are many significant shortcomings in this interactive dvd game i do not recommend it at all it is not at all like the real feud the most frustrating shortcoming is that you must get the answers in the right order since it reveals them in order or you lose no steals no strikes sadly i ca n't return it since its a dvd game	5

0	i bought this game based on the reviews on amazon and i am not disappointed even my three year old enjoys this game and is capable of understanding the concept the beginner puzzles are right up his alley and the expert puzzles are challenging enough for me	5
1	the gates and fences are hard to set up and they fall back down easily best for modeling not play	5
0	i think i missed the boat on this one i bought it for xmas for my 13 month old and the only real play it gets is when my daughter and her 3 year old brother take off the play top and sit inside it ! they think thats fun but thats about it	5
1	this is very small it 's too small for a play kitchen and you only get one not two like is pictured	5
0	this little toy is cute my 11 month old son loves blues clues and loves this toy he will hold him on his lap while he watches his favorite show ! its really cute	5
1	while the kids love it it 's a headache for parents it takes forever to inflate even with an air compressor thanks to many individual air chambers as other reviewers noted it 's best not to leave it outside \( the manufacturer recommends against it due to potential sun damage \) but it 's far too big to leave up inside the house not worth the time involved to set it up and take it down i gave ours away	5
0	my 2 5 year old border collie just loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week since the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey i decided to try this more affordable kid 's tunnel instead it 's not as heavy and robust as the official agility tunnels but it has been serving me great for just about a year there 's just some minor wearing around the rings and small toe nail runs in it but it 's still very usable my ratings would change a bit for kids though probably a 3 for educational and 5 for durability	5
1	this item is cheap and i do n't mean the price it will not stay together the plastic frames do not attach well to the mat because it is held with velcro that keeps coming undone the arched bars are not bent enough causing one side to pop up off the floor i tried bending them myself but they always return to their original shape pay the extra money and get a better mat	5
0	we wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06 we bought a lot of m d toys and this by far was the better of their toys even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out like other said the sound is very appropriate i like this toy and definitely recommend this to others the only reason i gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful	5
0	excellent product ! i really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve after playing all 50 you can just start all over again ! fun fun fun game ! thanks	5

0	this toy was an instant success with my son who is six he figured out how to put together the track in minutes unlike other construction toys skyrail is not limited to one or two designs my son can create endless configurations including loop the loops that really work this toy is also easy to disassemble the track and connectors seem a little flimsy but so far after many many uses none of the pieces has broken	5
0	we purchased the item hoping that it would be of reasonable size meaning the food would be closer to real size rather than miniature it was we also hoped it would be made well and stand up to hopefully more than one generation of use that remains to be seen but the stuff is made well and i cannot see it breaking unless you deep freeze the plastic pieces and hit them with a hammer nice texture nice flexibility pretty realistic looks the child it was intended for \( age 4 and a bit \) plays happily with it even the older boys \( 10 and 13 \) have had a few moments of goofy fun with it	5
0	it is a magnificient item ! so simple and beautiful yet full of really small details and hello here is johnny cash ! looks really great on foot with his guitar just like real i strongly recommend it to all cash fans	5
1	this is more for a kid who is 4 or 5 years old not 8 11 as it states talk about a waste of money i returned this the next day for a refund as my 10 year old daughter would have been so upset with me had she received this under the christmas tree this year it was a shame the description was n't more accurate because i was not refunded my expedited shipping costs i paid for this toy thumbs dow	5

0	the tool everyone needs for the car you never know when you will need it	6
1	this item performed as expected reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with obd ii connector easy to use only 2 buttons ! you might be able to find it 10 cheaper at a local store on sale but even at the price i paid it was a bargain ! cost of tool 1 diagnostic visit to local shop	6

0	this carrier worked well on our honda pilot it kept several large suitcases dry we used several large bungee cords to secure it the only problem was that it made noise but we taped them down the fabric kept them very well protected i would recommend it for anyone needing the extra space in their car	6
0	easy to install and reliable even dropped it in the water and no problem still working even immersed of course i had to dry it but it was easy to disassemble	6
0	this is my favorite wash to use on my car it suds extremely well holds the suds well and the smell of it is quite pleasant i was tired of car washes that would develop suds effectively but only hold them for a few minutes leaving you with a bucket of dirty water obviously not too good for your car ! with meguiar 's nxt everytime i finish washing my car the bucket is still full of bubbles i highly recommend this product	6

0	i found the product to be very useful myself wiring diagrams are better than any books i had seen and now i know why the information here comes from mitchell1 most of the pro technicians i know pay good money every month to use it the vehicle has a leak near the tailgate area and there were some honda tech bulletins here that i never knew about it was worth it just for that and details of the surprise third fuse panel under the hood true some of it might be over your head but overall i found eautorepair to be a great deal for a car savvy do it yourselfer	6
0	living in central texas is does n't rain a lot but when it does you 'll be glad you used this product it also works well when you need to clean your windows with the automatic glass cleaner featuere that comes with most modern cars i suggest using a decent micro fiber towel when using and of course cleaning the glass before you apply rain x also the 16oz bottle will last a very long time	6

0	i bought this product for my husband he tried it out on one of the hottest days sunny and 90 degrees he is very particular on how he washes our vehicles and it usually takes a few hours this really works not only did it cut the time it takes to wash the cars but it is amazing it looked as if he did the vehicles the old way there were no streaks the truck looked like it was polished unbelievable i would recommend this product to anyone buy it ! ! ! ! ! !	6
1	absolutely useless do not buy this product you are wasting your money learn from me i wasted on two ! they are tiny tiny fans that move hardly any air at all also they do not work on tinted windows trust me save yourself some money and just crack your windows it works 100 better	6

1	sticking the solar module on the side of the garage door opener like they instruct does n't work the solar panel has to be right next to the lightbulb to get enough power to work i was able to mount it close enough to the lightbulb and make a small cutout in the cover to get it to fit you might not be able to depending on your garage door opener also the bracket that holds the laser module has too light a hold on the module it does n't hold it in rotational position	6

0	overall i am satisfied so far i have not experienced creep but i move my car into position very very slowly so that may help my one suggestion is that it could be wider it is easy to slide by if i am just a little off line i have yet to try it on my boat trailer so that will have to be covered later	6
1	this product does work but it has to face the sun so if you put it in the window that faces east it will work in the morning not in the afternoon it needs to be put in a window that faces southwest to work the way they claim in the tv ad also they are hard to place with powered windows	6

1	the oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case and the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil maybe you 'll find this product wonderful and a cost effective alternative what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine \? a small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil	6
0	this cushion is very comfortable and retains its shape without being too firm it does n't come with any straps or any way to secure it to the seat so it does move around and fall forward when i get up otherwise i'm happy with it	6

0	it does work very well once you decide on the best ceiling mount location i had to remount move once to get the laser beam to hit the spot on the car dashboard that we wanted it to when the car was at its desired parking position the forward backward adjustment of the laser after mounting the unit is helpful but not being able to adjust the laser side to side after mounting scored it a 4 instead of 5 star rating from me	6
0	i am a traveling songwriter and just finished a 6000 mile tour from nebraska to florida with this on the top of my subaru and i must say it was great thing to have everything stayed bone dry and secure but i would recommend usuing a couple of extra bungee cords across the top just as an added measure plenty of room and solid construction for the price it ca n't be beat	6
0	this is a great product for mirrors and windows ! love it so much i buy in bulk and the delivery was fast	6
0	1st of all i am sure that everyone has hated how ugly the winter wiper blades are they are bulky and just do not look good now the icons are sleek and small they look great ! they perform awesome in all weather conditions \( i have used them in rain sleet and snow and in a blizzard \) they handle everything perfectly no annoying streaks and they sweep everything away the do not miss anything ! ! sure they are more expensive than other blades but you really do get what you pay for ! awesome wiper blades i would recommend them to everyone	6

0	comfort beads will change the way you drive your vehicle it 's almost like you 're floating on air i 've been using them for over 15 years i sure am glad there 's a company still manufacturing them awesome product ! i highly recommend it	6
1	as other reviewers mentioned the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings it may be accurate but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several minute guessing and waiting game calling it a racing gauge is ridiculous	6
0	this is simply the finest tire gauge that i have owned or come across	6
0	product is just outstanding really deserves the 5 star rating it has in amazon my vehicle had tree sap mist all over its finish i tried many diffrent waxes even tried compond and nothing i was begining to lose hope until a little research on the net about clay bars and ran into this product it took me about 3hrs to do my entire car and although it was plenty of work i could not belive the result its a mirror finish the paint looks gorgeous highly reccomend this treatment	6
0	my mv 50 just arrived tonight and it worked fine it would have made sense if it had a cigarette adaptor than having to use the battery the gauge starts off from zero and increments by 5psi so it is off by 5psi ! the gauge reads 0 5 10 15 20 25 at 20psi it is showing 25psi the only confusion is what i found on the internet for some people paying only 25 for this and not 70 plus shipping charges the connector is not useful for tight spaces like a rear motorcycle tire on my yamaha 650 maxim i think it is going to perform to my racing needs	6
1	loved the price but i never actually received the item it shipped to the wrong address and i never got it back	6
1	i have not used this product our local news did a test on it they found that in 2 vehicles \( exactly the same \) that this device only lowered the temp 1 degree again i have not used it i am just throwing the test i saw out there their call sign is wcpo so look it up from there \( not allowed to include link \)	6

0	its a great product it coats when it rains when you just put it on you dont even need to use the wipers but it does take some work to make sure its not smeared looking clean your glass good with windex first then apply and polish off i dont really buy any of those as seen on tv items but this is the first one that really works well also if you side windows squeak this will help with that as well since is a slippery it will help with weather stripping remember this works best when over about 40mph and you will have to keep reapplying a few times a yea	6
1	i thank goodness did not buy this product but was very tempted i want to thank all the honest people for their reviews it saved me money and time thank you	6
0	i received these for christmas from my boyfriend \( note to girls only put things you really really want on your christmas list \) they work we were able to change the oil in my volkswagen golf w o scrapping or having any other catastrophic emergency the only bummer is that you ca n't stack them within each other for storage	6

1	a tire pressure gauge only has to do one thing well that is to accurately measure the air pressure inside the tire my accugage was reading 5 psi high when tested alongside a calibrated pressure transducer that 's why i give it only one star	6

0	several people here have mentioned that the clips are made of cheap plastic i'm happy to report that mine received march 2 2007 has all metal clips that seem to be quite sturdy ! they have definately updated the design	6
0	this unit works surprisingly well with the following caveats 1 you must replace the cheap cig lighter plug with aligator style clips designed to be hooked directly to your battery the cheap connector becomes hot to the point of melting this is due to the high current demand placed on the battery your mechanic or local car electroncs store should be able to do this for you also it will take approx 5 min to inflate your tire it is a bit slow 2 you should run your car engine so the battery doesnt run down the product has a built in fan that seems to keep the unit cooler while running i liked it for what it is	6
0	it 's what i will need if the car battery is drained i hope i never have to use it	6
1	the description of this product is not accurate these lights are not bright i have 6 mounted under the cabinets in my very small kitchen and all 6 on at once add up to the equivalent of a night light it is a pretty color of light but very dim	6

0	this unit works great i bought it for my father and it works like it 's supposed to it has enough juice for a regular size crt tv and has been used to jump start a few times the first unit i bought had a problem with the generator part and would not power anything up i notified amazon and in no time flat ups was back to pick it up and i got a new unit the next day ! great service from amazon ! ! ! and a great product too	6
0	i bought this compressor with the intent of airing my tires back up after a day of 4 wheeling for this purpose it works amazingly it comes with an awesome carrying case and everything else you would expect with a portable air compressor it will air up my tires quickly the specs state about 4 minutes to air up a 35 tire when running the compressor is pretty quiet and does n't vibrate and bounce around the built in gauge is quite accurate once the unit is turned off in short buy this air compressor if you have any use for it at all it will easily beat compressors which cost over 3 times what this unit does	6

0	this is a very good duster i have owned one for 5 years and now i have to replace	6
0	the unit does everything it promises i 've only used it once so far but i'm happy with it	6
1	this product works great for draining your car 's crankcase oil it has a screen to catch the drain plug however the large diameter plastic lid that seals the unit after draining is a piece of crap you are supposed to tighten it down then open the small plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal the large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half inch too far makes no seal at all it falls off when you tip the unit to drain emptying two to three quarts of used oil on to your garage floor this is a product that needs a bit more engineering to work well	6
0	this item is easy to use the codes were easy to read and could be transferred to one 's pc via the usb cable provided i do not have much experience with other code readers but ca n't imagine one easier to operate and erase faults with than this one for the price i could not be happier my only negative comment was with the pc software it did not allow for saving the list of codes downloaded from the reader in other words if i wanted to keep this info for future reference i would have to print it out a minor inconvenience to an otherwise great product	6

1	to turn off your check engine light on most vehicles with your vehicle turned off pull out and hold your trip odometer reset stick and then start your vehicle in most cases the light will shut off if there is truly a problem with you car the light will either not stay off or come right back on you do not need this device to do that the second problem is if your car does need attention this device wo n't really properly diagnose or certainly wo n't fix it and you 'll still have to go to a mechanic so i'm left wondering what good this is	6
0	only minor drawback is the long time it takes to fill tires with the air pump otherwise i'm very pleased with this product	6
0	it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness but that aside it works well right on the money easy to use bright colors easy to find the price is about right no real bargain at less than 6 each but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each no regrets	6

1	this product does not cool down the car it is too small i would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks if you buy this please do not leave your pets or kids in the car and think that it is safe	6
1	easy and clear steps to follow in installation although the universal remote is really bad feels very cheap tachless mode works great but finding service and tech support is almost impossible good luck contacting them	6
0	for ease of use the deltran battery tender is an excellent way to charge and maintain the battery on your motorcycle snowmobile or even a heavy duty vibrator not that i would know anything about that ! the kit includes a bmw type plug for machines so equipped and an sae adaptor with alligator clips you can also wire the sae adaptor right to your bike 's battery and have easy access to the plug in the battery is maintained in a peak state of charge with no worries of over charging	6

0	i am pleased with this frame no logos and has a clean stainless steel look about it my only issue is the bottom part of the trim is a little tall and so oregon plates which have a registration sticker tag that goes at the bottom of the plate is hardly visible	6
0	i tried the rack without the fairing the noise and turbulence was tremendous once i installed the fairing the noise and wind buffeting dropped to a point that i forgot the rack was on the car excellent product well worth the price	6

0	i am a car fanatic and have used one of these dusters on my cars for the last decade or more as long as the surface is dry it works wonderfully once some contaminants start to build on the paint use the duster then some quick detail with a microfiber cloth to get the paint really clean my cars always look new with these things i just traded in my 2004 rx 8 after 2 5 years of using the duster and it still looked absolutely new i now use it on my 2006 lancer evolution and again the car looks brand new \( which it is \) i love them	6
0	i have n't purchased one of these but i'm curious if this is as reliable as as a traditional set of jumper cables \? or are there some jobs that jumper cables will do that this will not also how long does it take to jump start a car \? thanks in advance	6
0	have always used the regular california duster time to replace the one i have had for years thought i would try the extra large duster this has twice the dusting surface it is faster and does the same great job i have a black town and country which shows dust ! this does a great job in just a few minutes a great product	6
1	i would have purchased this ridiculous item if not for the comment above thanks for alerting me to the misleading information	6
0	tool is very easy to use just plug it into your obdii connector turn the key and watch it record the fault codes then plug it into the usb port of your computer and your done software is intuitive and defines all codes captured by the unit and then allows you to create a printout one use and it 's paid for when compared to the hassle and expense of taking the car to the shop also prevents fraud since you can tell the shop what is wrong	6
0	this is my second item of this type and in the wintertime it is indepensible with no garage to keep my suv in this cover fills the void it is easy to put on just takes a few minutes and saves many minutes of scraping ice the next morning ! this particular one is large enough for my suv with some room to spare	6

0	i really like using this product because it cuts the drying time of car washing to almost no time at all i hate spending a long time drying my car so it is perfect	6
0	this is a much nicer seat cover than i imagined it would be \( especially for the cost \) the only complaint i have is that with it in place i ca n't extend my head rest \( i'm tall \) but other than that it 's very comfortable and protects the car seat under it very well i wear suspenders and without something to protect the seat the car seat gets cut by the buckles	6

0	i recieved the mr clean auto dry system for fathers day im usually skeptical about products that are new to the market place and one with the incredible claim that this product makes that it will give a spot free shine without using a towel well quite frankly i was very skeptical about this products claim i used it today and was very impressed it took about 10 15 minutes to dry but when it did my beautiful silver car looked better than when i used a shamois it was very easy and it saved me the elbow work and the 20 minutes i would have spent drying the car i am a big fan of the auto dry system and will never towell dry again	6

0	this holster provides good protection for the device and has the sturdy swivel clip for your belt the flap is secured by a magnet making it easy to remove the device it does just what you want it to do	7
0	car charger serves it purpose it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter the design is basic with no hidden features you just need to make sure you plug the connector in the right way i would have liked some type of label that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device otherwise a perfect gift !	7
0	younger brother just got the verizon chocolate he 's been know to show it off and got his hold phones all scratched up its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but i digress the screen protect works as described it comes with a polish cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator the film has some kind of electrostatic polymer there 's no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen squeegee help to get out 1 air bubble that formed i would recommend	7

1	when i first got this item i was very pleased it was so cheap and it looked great it snaps so easily on and feels really cool however after about 3 weeks the duller not so shiny coat that i liked on the cover started to come off beneath it was a very shiny black coat i was so disappointed i took it off and went with my original cover it looks really bad and just looks like something i 've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks i am very displeased with this item	7

1	the software that comes with this is not the right software for the vx8500	7
1	the external antenna is a plastic decoration only and does not do anything functional false advertising	7
0	this case does what it is supposed to do it protects your palm treo phone it is very nice looking and durable the only negative comment that i will make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit that is why i gave it a 4 5 amazon has the best price for the case and it is well worth the price	7
1	does not work with verizon v3c when i plug the phone in it says unauthorized charger and refuses to charge at all it is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a charger i give it one star only because amazon does not have the option for no stars if i could i would give it zero stars i suppose that would be bad for business but it is what it is avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing maybe it works in china but not in north america	7
0	i have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great i mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good i have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces this phone i dont have that problem it is really made good i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine	7
0	very well thought design i just wished i looked up at the pictures on here again before i pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first i thought it was weird but after i looked at the pictures again man how brilliant ! they should 've provided some sort of user guide on how to put the case on and the leather is of a very high quality too the seller is awesome very amazon like shipping \( i e fast \)	7
0	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
0	i recently got this phone and love it t mobile 's service may not be the best but i have had no problems with the phone itself for all the people saying that it is n't really magenta it is the pink razr offered by cingular is a pale pink the t mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown i looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades	7
1	the case and ear bud are fine but the car charger i was sent does n't even fit my nokia 6230 that was the main reason i bought this package	7
1	i got this phone cause i thought it would be a nice little phone wrong yes it plays songs yes it is little too little ! ! ! ! this phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers the voice dialing does not work ! it is hard to use i returned the phone after only 2 days ! i got the samsung t629 totally better does almost everything the nokia does but is better looks better performs much better if you are a teenager this phone may be good for you the samsung even sounds better get the samsung same price more phone	7
1	please read ! ! ! ! this cases does not fit the lg env dont bu	7
0	this was a great price for this battery with twice the capacity of the standard battery the only thing i do n't like is the lack of a rubber strip on the back of the battery door to keep the phone from sliding around all in all this was a great deal	7
1	i bought this phone at the same time i bought the i870 i 've dropped my i870 a couple of times and it 's fine my husband dropped the rugged phone once and the antenna which sticks out like a thumb snapped off nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards what army \? do not buy this phone ! \( unless of course you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months	7
1	the battery was not accepted by my motoraola phone it was a pirate product and worthless unfortunately i discovered it after the expiration of the amazon return date	7
1	this phone could quite possibly be the biggest piece of technology crap its useless the software on it is very cheap and childish not professional at all the camera is pitiful and the keys are too small for anyone who does n't have 10yr old hands just because it has a qwerty keyboard that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is a waste of cash purchase a different phone this one is not worth it	7
0	i agree it 's a waste to get sizes you do n't need here 's an idea to do a public exchange i do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage i just need the small sizes	7
0	the whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with cingular wireless customer service to port over my number from verizon the treo 750 was a snap to figure out setting up my email took only a few minutes i 've owned it for three weeks now and i am still discovering great phone pda features i bought a 4gb mini sd card \( samsung memory \) from ebay for 39 99 combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs i also bought a shure tec3 earbuds for 110 they 're about the best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2 5mm jack	7
0	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
1	i got this items for my palm tx it ncame in the same week that i order it that was great ! plug it in it did n't fit so wigle it in windup pushing the tip in i manage to pull the out the tip i tryed again this time i grip the base tightly the base split in two one more time this time the coper piece got smashed i straighten out the coper plug it in it work bearly i threw it away k p s not good purchaged do n't bu	7
1	a very basic phone with not one good ringtone display or wallpaper did not recieve the usb cable i am going back to the nokia 6102i	7
1	do n't waste your money after 18 months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life instead of updating to a newer phone accompanied by a new 2 year service agreement i opted to purchase a new battery waste of money ! the new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means i must re charge nightly that was the same predicament i encountered with the original battery nightly re charge	7
0	this is the original and at half the price of the newer charger this is a really great buy fully functional and provides all that it should as a charger for the v188	7
0	i could n't believe how small it is compare to the pictures i saw online however one bad thing about that is that i lost it already now i have to think about buying another one anyways it 's a cool headset i would recommand it to anyone who 's thinking about buying one	7
0	durable thick does n't interfere in any way with the touch screen i have n't had to wash it yet so i have n't tried out that feature but i highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these it 's been totally worth it to me \( hey after spending hundreds on your treo what 's a few dollars \? \)	7
0	the compatibility with nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in bold letters within the title it says quot universal 2 5mm jack quot universal meaning all 2 5mm jacks not all cell phones know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review great product	7
0	when i ordered this item i already knew it did n't come with the driver software cd but minutes after i ordered it dln sent me an email telling me that i was able to download the software for free from samsung and event sent me the link that was nice of them i'm kind of bummed that that charge feature does n't work on my phone \( d807 \) but that 's just an issue with my phone i guess and nothing with the product	7
0	i recieved good customer service and excellent help from these guys thanks for allowing me to keep this phone with my network i have so many acessories for this phone i did n't want to give it up just yet and you allowed me to get another phone just like the one i had thanks	7
1	this worked for only a couple days although the belt pocket clip held my treo securely it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way after a cople of days the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time after a couple more days it was useless save your money on this one	7

0	this 3 piece combo is a good purchase the chargers might feel a little light weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality for the price you can not beat it	7
1	motorola one is far better in quality as well to use	7
0	i am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone i would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed	7
0	it worked well with my vx8300 however i already had a driver that i knew worked so i did not use the disc so i cannot comment on the driver disc	7
1	design is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound mic is not clear or muffled find an alternate hands free piece	7
1	do not buy this item ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i havent even dropped my phone or hit it against anything and its cracking on all corners	7
1	good case functional charger headset not compatible with the nokia 1100 ! ! ! completely different connector type look closely at the product photo	7
0	if you have a cell phone you need a charger you do n't have to get a car charger but it 's a good idea if you have a car this works well	7
1	the latch is pitiful the phone fits nicely but that latch is not secure with in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hit the tile floor at a customer 's house tons of fun watching your 500 pda hit the ground and the battery come flying out phone is ok but the case is getting replaced asap ! ! do not get this case !	7
0	the original battery never lasted an entire day if i talked very much with this replacement battery i never run out of power anymore i do charge it every night the battery is a little bit thicker than the oem but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip the new battery comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly	7
0	the pack is quite as described any one of the three itemsmight justify the small expense	7
1	the charger i got did not fit the motorola v188 wrong connecter i was offered a full refund	7
0	if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing ! ! ! do n't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that \? \? ! ! ! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it ! ! ! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn t have a chord jeez !	7
0	got it for 20 bucks on cyber moday easy to configure and use nice sound quality only con being a loose fit around your ear and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly	7
0	great little item charges phone and second battery at the same time it is nice to have it on the desk and i can use the speaker phone on my desk no complaints about this charger at all	7
0	treo 750 one of the best and coolest phone i am in love with this phone because of windows os it is very easy to use and understand functions slim and light weight love the touch screen function i ordered this phone on sunday evening and got it on wednesday amazon offers two day free shipping on all phones also i ordered two phones \( family plan \) there was some problem in other phone i requested the replacement and amazon first sent me the replacement of that phone through free 1 day shipping and they gave me 30 days to return problem phone i am so impressed with amazon 's service	7
1	cool concept and everything but when i tried to install the driver my cd rom drive wouldnt even pick up that little cd	7
0	when i first got this it did not look like it was big enough for my phone but as soon as i opened the package and put my phone in it i could tell it was a perfect fit i really like the clear window which i did not have on my previous case now i can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time	7
0	i 've had this case for under a month but it 's working great when i first got the case i thought i was going to have to send it back because i thought it was too small for my phone \( i have an lg cu500 from cingular \) it was a pretty tight fit but it worked the case has since seemed to stretch a little so it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out	7
1	thanks god that the phone can survive a moderate fall the case pops open very easily and despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case its all loose after that another disappointment the circular 'knob' that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing again you guessed it falls	7
0	i had been using this product for 2 weeks now no problems discomfort quality stuff	7
0	this is a great basic cell phone i bought one and received another as a gift unfortunately i opened both so now i have \( 2 \) if anyone needs one for twenty five plus shipping that has not been registered with net10 \( still has bonus 300 minutes and no number \) is new and has all original accessories \( open package \) or for ten extra you can get an oem car charger leather case and earphone \( all unused \) please email movieshop \( at \) hotmail \( dot \) com	7
0	a perfect fit for my l6 i love the protection for the screen it covers all of it so you do n't need those plastic screen covers do n't be afraid if you drop your phone because it 's protected	7
0	the mp3 player is simple to use accessible while the phone is closed and sounds great you can use any headsets or earbuds you prefer and the radio makes it the device of choice for gym rats or runners alike sturdy fairly easy to figure out and fine reception a great phone if you do n't need smartphone features	7
1	i never got my order even after a month after i placed it they reply to you email with false info always saying its on the way one item that i did get was the wrong item you have been warned be very careful from these guys	7
0	the device works fine and i do n't feel i over paid sure there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable	7
1	the phone may be fine but i will never know because my virgin mobile service never really worked perhaps it was the phones fault i never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account overall their customer service is awful days of waiting and receiving no information i had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right i spent hours on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed now i have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service i plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone its garbage i went with the t mobile sidekick and already am way happier	7
0	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	well the only good thing one can say about the treo 680 battery is that it 's thinner the battery for the treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day as the treo 680 battery only lasts a 4 5 hours under business use the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are deplorable distressing lamentable unsatisfactory and unsuitable i'm really dissapointed that palm delivered such as lousy battery with the treo 680 but happily there is a quick fix buy 1 2 more batteries and keep them charged and do n't leave home without them	7
1	it did not fit my phone and i was forced to go out and but another one	7
0	this is a good solid phone so far other reviewers are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual my biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory despite having something like five meg of memory on the phone and a micro sd memory card that 's it the size of the text message does n't seem to matter	7
0	this battery saved me from renewing the contract thus the battery was a contract killer i thought i was going to get a new phone as this battery is 49 99 at the verizon dealer but you guys saved the da	7
0	i would like to buy two or more shells do you offer differents colors to choose from \? wich colors are there \? this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee please answere asap	7
0	i purchased the cable for my nokia 6255i the cable came faster than expected \( i find amazon fulfillment of orders very slow \) the cable came with the software driver \( although i did not need it \) and worked great with my already installed nokia sync software electro island had the best price by far and the service was excellent i would definitely use them again	7
0	i recommend this phone to anybody i absolutely love it i have had it for three months now and not a problem so far the music player is great and i swear the camera looks alot better than 1 3 mega pixel the handset is wonderful and so is the headset included with it if you buy this phone it will last you a long time but yeah so far no problems whatsoever i love it	7
1	i bought this case to protect the best bar phone on the market the sony ericsson w810i within 2 days the case already started to crack and chip i dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case the case also scratches easily too the only good thing is that it looks nice and stylish but i have a feeling that i am going to have to replace it pretty soon bottom line this case only protects against scratches i was actually looking at the clear silicone cases	7
0	i switched to this phone from verizon e815 some of the details i find different pros sleek designgood battery lifecompact2mp cameracons choppy voice sometimes hard to listenscreen and buttons little smallworks for me as i do n't use the phone for internet email or use lot other features	7
0	i bought this for my sanyo katana phone which is a bit thicker than the razr the fit is snug but not too tight my only problem is that due to the design i sometimes accidentally push the buttons on the side of the katana when i take it out of the case	7
0	bluetooth cannot be accessed when the phone is in the pouch phone cannot not be charged while in the pouch	7
0	item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised charges the phone in about 15 minutes of driving	7
0	what can i say \? it works very well i keep this in my car so when i travel i do n't have to worry about my palm tx 's batteries	7
0	i was very happy to see that amazon shipped me palmone brand stylus 's and not some generic this is a great deal and i'm going to order some more thank	7
1	totally impractical this model smartphone is already fairly bulky this just makes it as lot more so even worse you cannot attach it to your belt or pocket because there are no clips and or loops in the design !	7
1	i got this as a gift its too thin for me i m not into the credit card sized phones picture quality sucks its hard to manage it the menu buttons are inconviently placed such as the my content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone !	7
0	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7
0	fast service good price look forward to future business dealings	7
1	i ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life after about 1 2 months of use the thing shorted out and would n't work any more i decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured i 'd give it another chance the thing did n't even work out of the box this time i only wish i could give it zero stars spend the money on a motorola brand charger instead	7
0	this case was a perfect fit for my mot v180 phone the top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately then snap together so they stay in place on the phone so it ca n't easily fall out \( a problem that i 'd had with a different product \) the part that slips over the top of the phone has a built in see through window that lines up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case the quality of construction looks to be pretty good too	7
1	these cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in asia with that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped the software being aftermarket too has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone despite what the descriptions say this software and cable are not compatable with mac at this time	7
0	i 've had my snap on case for about a month and i love it the magenta color looks very much like the original pink razr phone the bottom case could fit a little more snugly but it 's not a problem	7
0	this belt clip was exactly what i was looking for and the price was great	7
1	the good news is they fixed a lot of the things about the treo 650 's interface that were clunky and it seems to crash less but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience so much so that i wish i had never upgraded to the 680	7
1	my office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract no person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance battery life is terrible out of the box the interface is clunky and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance if everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you it will give you something to complain about for the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your nextel sprint network contract	7
0	the product came promptly and i am happy with the quality however fitment was n't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo not a huge problem but something i would feel everytime i reach for the stylus but the pen works pretty good and it feels sturdy in my hands i would definately recomment this product to others	7
1	i purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr l7 it does n't fit the case is not wide enough to fit together over the phone do n't waste your money	7
0	i think this would work better with a money type clip however since verizon does n't carry anything like this in clear this works	7
1	i must live on the edge of cingular 's \( and everyone else 's \) coverage area this phone ca n't hold a call at my house and i have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength part of the problem is the coverage area but part is the phone too i have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem if you live like i do in a pothole on the information superhighway avoid this phone	7
1	the gel inserts on the jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me it 's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this also the insert comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert sound quality is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noise from my end i'm not happy with these	7
0	i just bought this battery at a sprint customer service store and i paid 64 64 with tax in california i can buy 4 of these batteries here at amazon i'm going to return it today and buy it online here should have checked first	7
0	i'm very happy with this case i was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my treo 700p but would allow complete access to the treo when i wanted to use it in other words i did n't want something that was attached to the treo permanently this did the trick it 's simple but looks good seems to be solidly made as well	7
0	the headset works fine people who i talk to says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well but i doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk time also it is not too easy to put it in your ear as other headset	7
0	great for the price vs buying it from your cell phone company	7
0	i 've had my tracfone for about 5 months now the reception has been generally good once i got the phone activated i have n't had any problems tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes all you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral my email is debsclay gmail comthank you	7
0	this cover is so hot i get tons of complements on it it's a great color and the screen protector helps a lot too i would deffinetley recomend this to any one	7
0	this similar unit is 1 4th the cost of the official phone belt clip that verizon sells for the lg vx 8300 and it is just as good verizon sells it for 19 99 taxamazon vendor sells it for 01 4 99 shippingbottom line it is just a piece of plastic that gets the job don	7
1	after hours upon hours of trying to get this cable and software to work it eventually allowed me about an hour of connected time and then never worked again my opinion is to stick with the oem cable the extra money 's worth paying to avoid the headache	7
1	label states that it is for a 600 it doesnt fit a 650 as well as i thought i	7
1	i received this item and the blue illuminated cap is not present on this item there is a less expensive product in the marketplace w a mere blue led that looks similar and that product costs about 10 less best buy while certainly this product works satisfactorily and the price is decent you should realize that what you 're going to get is not what is pictured unless eforcity fixes things that is	7
1	yes the cable fits but the cd driver is just for the 8300 i was not able to get it working	7
0	i love these eargels my ears are a funny shape and i ca n't wear regular earbuds but when i add these gels they fit great and do n't fall out they block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound isolating earbuds sometimes i need a small and sometimes i need a medium depending on the day the weather and how long i use them \( i gave the large size to my boss and he loves them too so do n't say you ca n't use all of the sizes guys	7
1	it was broken in a few days of use you should buy a hard cover instea	7
0	compared to the face out belt clip i had previously this face in version has proved to be a bit more stable and sturdy so far hopefully it will remain so for the price it 's not too hard to appreciate	7
0	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
0	this product was a great deal these can be found other places for over 20 if you are like me and drop your phone constantly then this is a great product for you	7
0	i really like this case it keeps my phone from getting scratched up and it 's really cute good price	7
0	i really like the fit and function of this cingular 8125 case all the holes are in the correct location and the belt clip is comfortable \( no sharp edges to irritate \) i ordered 2 other cases elsewhere that did not fit properly and i sent them back this one is a keeper	7
1	the darn thing broke almost immediately when i tried to switch gel covers \( it comes with 3 different sizes \) the entire earpiece came off in my hands ! what a flimsy piece of crap i just sent it back to amazon i'm never buying a jabra product again	7
1	junk junk junk mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working	7
0	saves time and up downloading pics tunes to from my phone	7
1	this product does not work ! ! ! ! ! ! it is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cell phone to computer i wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer no way ! the cable comes with a id number on it and you have to get the driver off the disk that comes with it i have tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work i dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong number or what the problem is the disk has 40 files on it i dont know if one of the other drivers would work but i am very frustrated	7
0	when i lost my stylus i had a difficult time finding a replacement the others i tried were n't the same these are	7
0	top part of telephone gets loose very often elastic band apparently looses its elasticity easily	7
1	save your money the eargels split in two days i used regular ear buds on the large size they did hold the buds in the ear better but no gain in sound quality if you want the small and med i 'll send them to you for shipping i have no use for them	7
1	it was really cute when i got it two days later the color started chipping away the stones started falling off as well i was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when i got it i do not recommend buying it	7
1	i bought this product to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer the description stated that it would work for my selected model phone however it does not ! ! the software needed to download the pictures is not correct when we called the customer services they were of no help they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem apparently i am not the only person to have this problem with the product again the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are not accurate it does not work	7
0	the headset is great works really well with my samsung phone the only problem i have with it is sometimes its hard to make it stay in my ear but its really great and i would buy it agai	7
0	the holster that samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster how stupid is that \? why would samsung supply this type of holster to their customers \? however this holster has solved that problem you can now flip open your phone when using this holster thank yo	7
0	good purchase although i have not used the headset yet the case and charger work perfectly great savings amazon is the place to shop for a discount	7
0	the cord appeared to be pretty messy but the product is just fine good quality sound accept hang calls volume control i do n't think i want more the connector is a pop port connector it 's showed just as big in the product 's image if you have a 2 5mm jack and still insist buying this after look at the image then what the h is wrong with you \?	7
1	the product broke the first day i used it i'm going to have to be more careful i think they are all cheep	7
1	i bought these adaptors to use regular head phones \( 3mm \) with my cell phone mp 3 \( lg cu500 \) player once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound you only can hear the music through one ear whoever started the whole 2 5mm adaptor in cell phones should be put in jail it makes it impossible to use a regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone i have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base level they all have some type of flaw the volume wo n't get loud enough cord to short poor sound etc	7
0	i did a lot of looking before purchassing a krusell and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch it was a great investment the krusell case holds the blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use cosemetically it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing ! the pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards ! this is an excellent product	7
0	first of all fast shipping and second of all what a great product it is ! i absolutely love it and so does everyone who sees it ! thanks	7
1	i got this phone in january and i had to take it back the day i got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls they gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone but it was n't the one i have now is n't as bad as the first one but it still loses service and drops calls constantly do n't buy this phone	7
0	this is a must for anyone that is 'mobile' i am never home always at starbucks or libraries studying and this added safety is necessary to protecting the player	7
1	i ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarette lighter splitters i got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind not at all like the ones shown the shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so i am not going to pay to send them back i never got an e mail about the substituation or response to my calls or e mail to the company i will not buy any thing else from them	7
1	i have had this phone for about six months i replaced a kyocera that i disliked because it was so big but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems the menus are very poorly designed they are difficult to navigate and it 's hard to do anything the ringer speaker is inside the phone so when it 's closed it 's almost impossible to hear i almost never hear it ring i usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on but if you turn the phone off the vibrate gets turned off so you have to remember to turn that back on ! i hate this phone and will be replacing it soon	7
0	i was completely satisfied with the phone clip i purchased it`s sturdy and well constructed i would recommend it i will use this site again	7
0	great product exactly as advertised thinking about buying a couple more in different color	7

0	ive always stayed away from the flip slider phones because im good at breaking things ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong the mini sd port is awesome	7
0	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
1	we 've had 3 of the lg1500 in our family plan for nearly a year very inconsistent service when calling our son i would get a message that his number was blacklisted after calling cingular several times we demanded new phones not lg1500 we were told it was like for like exchange but that policy is not in writing so we 're getting a different brand if a phone does n't work the company needs to get rid of them !	7

1	you have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract the wire is very thin so i'm thinking it will not last long	7
1	this thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you do n't ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo	7
0	this item came with the other item i ordered at the same time it 's quality is good but does not stay on the phone when opened as well as i would have liked	7
1	the usb cable and software did not work for the sony z525a phone purchased through xcingular the phone will not connect to the pc the phone does indicate that it is charging through the cable uninstalled the software and tried again with firewall shut off same result connecting a usb device should not be this difficult	7
1	the cover does n't fit snug with the phone the stitching broke after two weeks and the release button is triggered from the bottom it also falls off from the clip today it fell off in a parking lot when i realized my phone was missing i retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car this is a poor quality product and i would n't recommend it to anyone	7
0	received the product on time and its working fine but its a bit harsh on the ears	7
1	when i started charging my k750i it didnt charge at all no matter what this is a load of s dont buy i	7
0	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
0	the touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice the onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen \( easier sad than done \) if anything does attach it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer	7
0	i am very surprised how well this case fit my razr v3m it fits very well and looks very nice	7
0	my tracfone has good reception i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id if you have n't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral it 's a win win ! thanks	7
0	comfortable easy to put on fair to good sound quality full charge lasts approximately 2 3 weeks fully compatible with blackberry pearl and motorola razr nice style with black and alloy accents some callers claim to hear echoing not the best sound quality \( i like logitech better	7
0	i was a little skeptical about buying this case for my phone i wanted a holster that was n't a sloppy generic model that did n't fit i was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and i tried it on my motorola v180 it fits like a glove and looks good no complaints here so if you have a v180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you that you wo n't be disappointed the added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cell phone dealer	7
0	this product is great i'm glad it came with the cloth too	7
0	wow i have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever clear sound great range and most of all its gorgeous turns heads all over the place man i feel high tech with this thing on i payed 30 00 off of ebay but that was a rare deal still amazons price cannot be beat buy it youll love it	7
0	this case is superior it attaches easily and i especially like the screen cover most cases do n't have this \( if you drop the phone and crack the screen you 're hosed \) the only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belt clip it 's bulky and impractical just a simple tension clip would have been fine	7
1	i bought this product about a month or two ago and i still have n't been able to figure out how to use it i had other phones in the past and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use this product seems to be a lot harder unless it 's the wrong data cable which it should n't be since it 's advertised as an env data cable	7
0	i have had this motorola v171 for a year now and i absolutely love it the features are so easy to understand the customer service reps for net 10 wireless are very hard to understand this phone is a net 10 wireless phone net 10 wireless is a subsidiary of tracfone i would this phone to anybody looking for a prepaid cell phone plan i love it because only for a limited time you get 300 minutes free upon activation of your phone i would also strongly recommend that if anybody purchases this motorola activate it on its a whole lot easier than calling	7
0	we were deperate for a charger the local stores seemed to be out of them and we got it overnight as requested unbelieveably fast thank you thank you thank you !	7
1	i owned two of these earbooms the fit was comfortable and the sound very good however after a month or two of use both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece i imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which put strain on the plastic the plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress	7
0	it 's not rocket science it works or it does n't the device works fine my only complaint is that the cord is a bit short but that is of lesser concern considering the price the short cord is the only reason it did n't get a 5 star rating it 's well worth the money	7
0	this is really cool phone and has many features unfortunately you could not use some of these features in the u s one thing i do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the us and retailers charge much more price its price is just 429 99 on the nokia 's web page the phone gets 5 stars but the retailer 's price gets 2 stars	7
1	i didnt got the car charger i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it wrong item	7
0	excellent sound quality noise cancellation really works the button on the headset string lets you automatically place a call and end the call very nice works much better and more reliably than any bluetooth set i 've tried and i 've tried almost all of them	7
1	service is terrible no good ringtones my missed calls list is always mixed up on the dates dont get it ! you will end up paying the same if you have a plan	7
0	srudy phone during all scenarios mp3 player is great no compatibility problems the software supplied lets you replace your pda with this phone the camera is more than decent \( much like the 1 0 2 0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past \) no problems what so ever the design is rather smart and simple without the lack of elegance the flip phone factor lets you talk comfortably and safely with the antena safely away form your brain the surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches tiny design details that make it a sony product amazing battery life surprising for an mp3 phone	7
0	this is a great product it actually fits into my ear properly and i can hear clearly through it it is easy to operate and the charge last for many days i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size	7
0	my v180 is through cingular i never have a dropped call and reception is excellent long battery life very easy menus wayfinding and small size no frills like mp3 player or camera however just a very good phone	7
0	if you 're the type of person that does n't spend hours on the phone and want a good basic phone this phone is for you i bought this phone in the uk at the carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks and it works great i would say that the only gripe about this phone in the us is the price i would n't pay over 40 bucks for it it 's a nice basic phone the screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones	7
0	the battery was ship within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly will do business again the battery make 's the phone last 2 days even with continued use	7
1	i had to change 4 phones in one year with cingular not worth its mone	7
0	i bought one of these extended batteries on e bay and was really sorry it did n't hold a charge i was reluctant to try again but i was glad i did this time i got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery	7
1	while this is a functional holster be aware that you may like me find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster i know i know you can turn off the answer phone when opened option but that is not preferred by everyone you may also find that the phone does not stay in the holster securely	7
0	my tracfone has good reception i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id if you have n't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral it 's a win win ! thank you	7
1	for a good price of approximate 4 50 \( as i recall \) plus shipping i ordered the bargaincell brand new ikross retractable car cigarette lighter adapter it did not work i suppose i could have packaged it up and sent it back \( at a cost to me \) and probably received a replacement but for the cost of the unit it was not worth my time i 've resorted to using a standard car recharger	7
0	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
0	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
0	good battery life \( certainly much better than the old one it replaced \) for the most part it is indistinguishable from the original however it does n't fit quite as snugly in the dock style charger that came with my phone \( not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly \) that is a little annoying that it tends to fall out if i'm not paying attention i 'll wake up the next morning and my phone wo n't actually have been charged but it still works	7
1	the krzr is a really cool looking phone but it has 2 huge issues a very short battery life \( 1 day \) and sllloooowwww reaction time push the menu key and wait for it to come up i would explore other options	7
1	i agree with most of the others it worked okay for a couple of months now not only does it not charge my phone but if i plug it into my phone it immediately loses all charge ! it 's also always falling out of the lighter plug i do n't have that problem with any of my other chargers and i carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets	7
0	products exceeded my expectations the charger was n't very fancy but it seems to work fine and the price was very reasonable i was n't interested in the case but after i got it i found it to be very useful and the best part of the deal	7
0	my friend from hk just got this phone and ask me to buy her an eforcity screen protector she loves it ! !	7
0	the item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from scratches it fits like a glove really nice the delivery from eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked after 5 days of use it was n't hit or treated carelessly i 'll order some more because they are really cheap and it 's better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days i had to dump it	7
0	i'm happy i receive my cable it fast service i 'll still keep buying from this seller thank	7
0	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7
1	the other reviewer could n't run much power through his splitter but thought it might be ok for cell phone chargers etc i wanted a splitter for my radar detector and my cell phone charger so i thought great i ca n't get any power through mine at all the little light goes on but the radar detector does n't go and the cell phone charger does n't go i 'll probably take it apart andd see if i can rewire it it is n't worth shipping back i really ca n't recommend buying one of these things from this manufacturer	7
0	my tracfone has good reception i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id if you have n't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral it 's a win win ! thank you	7
0	product is great for products such as samsung cell phone models a630 a850 a950 a970 a930 a990 a645 and a870 the thin adapter makes this charger very easy to plug into crowded outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phone at home or office	7
0	these work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking say in a grocery store of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound but they 're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping the only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying	7
0	the skin is very useful but can be improved on ways to put it on and take it off	7
1	i would n't recommend this product to any one the phone cover really sucks i just used this product for a month and the clip cover peeled off really disappointed with this purchase	7
1	this disk is truly as bad as nitin 's previous disks were wonderful take any previous nitin disk throw in some alpha a bit of craig armstrong some predictable eco freindly american diatribe mix until extremely smooth and you have a prophesy as with most prophesies there no good news about it my prophesy is that anyone who buys this wo n't ever buy another nitin dis	9
1	i agree with the other negative review below uninspired simply forgettable radio trash cliched lyrics \? check muddy simple riffs \? check boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks \? check thank god i got this in a box of cd 's from a dj buddy of mine for free awhile back if i actually paid for this crap i 'd have to kill myself judging from all the positive reviews however it seems some people at lava records or possibly the band themselves \( if they 're still around i hope not \) have been trying to plug this sorry excuse for music	9
0	if you are looking for true hip hop this is a must for your collection four of the best lyrist in the game is all on one cd quit buying those fake ass hip pop albums and get the real deal from the production to mcing its all there matter facts get 2 albums so when the first one is used up you 'll have a fresh one in the stacks	9
0	i am a lover of greatest hits compact discs but this one by far is the best one i have purchased recently this compact disc has almost all of the best tunes that joe walsh made and i highly recommend it to anyone who loves to rock !	9
0	top to bottom this album has it all makes you laugh makes you think makes you want to dance i ca n't wait till mainstream finally catches up and the music industry finally recognizes what a gift todd snider is and the talent he posseses his music will inspire you to move something whether it 's your brain or your bottom ! check him out	9
0	i love jazzy hip hop of the early '90s and if you do too this is the album you must listen to ! all the songs are wonderful but there are some of these which are something of supernatural like the famous \( and the most beautiful of the entire cd ! \) award tour steve birko \( stir it up \) and midnight enjoy this pearl of real hip hop ! ! !	9
1	boney used to be the man but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him anyone who thinks this cd is good should listen to his older stuff like seduction trust or backbone you will quickly realize that he has not been living up to his full potential cmon'boney lets get back to multi dimentional stuff that you used to be the master of peace	9
1	their new stuff is even worse but this is still sexist boring annoying music at its worst there are much better artists out there so why listen to these two untalented rappers	9
0	too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on cds like this john rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting the music overwhelms the senses and the joy of christmas overcomes you as you listen this is one of the most peaceful christmas cds i have ever heard wassail song is incredible and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble this song is a must to perform you will not be disappointed when you purchase this cd	9
1	ok i 'll make it short but sweat great music singing sucks this guy is flat every song and he should go back to the honk tonk and get away from rock if you think i'm lying listen close how can anyone listen to this voice he can't hold a note and sounds like he has a mouth full of mush he sucked atcountry and has no place in rock home boy go back to texas andget back to branded some cows cause you suck	9

1	blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit elefant 's lyrics i personally like interpol and the strokes i resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs	9
1	a terrible terrible waste of money all this cd serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle head paul godfrey is face it no one gives a sh t about morcheeba anymore we 're not interested in who 'inspired' them \( poor annette peacock has anyone told her \? \) the next time we see paul godfrey he 'll probably be asking that age old question quot paper or plastic \? quot	9
1	after souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums \( a feat achieved by only a handful of bands \) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc the bunnymen built their reputation on moody psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in ocean rain for this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory eschewing album wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach unfortunately these lightweight songs do n't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned if you 're new to the bunnymen you 're probably better served by checking out their first four albums \( crocodiles heaven up here porcupine and ocean rain \) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts evergreen and flowers	9
0	this ancient jazz classic never sounded better rudy van gelder did an excellent job remastering this one with the 24 bit he proves that it does matter who takes up the task of remastering this wonderful jazz classic just keep them coming rudy	9
0	i admit when i listened to this album i was blown away by the powerful content of kenny g 's music i was moved by the story line and also by the music that was used during the movie kenny g 's music is perfect for this kind of movie not only that it adds flavor to the movie by his sensual playing of saxophone but also adds mood to the entire show this is the perfect soundtract for the movie dying young because it just simply shows the real mood in the movie	9
0	i saw her perform most of these songs on austin city limits i must admit i had n't paid much attention to her since her debut album back when i was playing in country bands much of this material is kinda introspective but hey on the plus side you get great vocals well crafted songs tons of sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who does n't have to pretend she is anything she is n't and these days that is pretty refreshing ! i think i am becoming a fan	9
1	hmm sounds good jazzy and chic this should only be played in lounges the only tracked i liked was amour the rest i wanted to close my ears too much noise	9
0	i first heard this album in the late 6o 's when it was originally released starting with the first track quot blood of the sun quot i was hooked leslie west was and has been a vastly unnoticed guitarist treasure his throaty singing and driving band featuring felix pappalardi made this band one that should be placed on the list of quot great ones quot probably due to the many other better publicized bands like led zeppelin and the like leslie west and mountain seemed to get shoved away into the closet open the closet you guitarists out there and give this cd a try i do n't think you will be anything but delighte	9
1	these covers are pretty bad some good ones have been done cameron mcgill the uncommon ground tribute big sir 's everybody here wants you is good but this is bad no matter what entertainment weekly 's review might say avoid buy a real jeff or tim album	9
0	i just love lynch mixed with dooms production it is what real is	9
0	to start off i am a huge grateful dead fan and i have prabably about 150 cd 's that cover many years of there carrer this release is very good and worth buying it has some great music on it and the price of the album is worth the eyes of the world with branford marsalis on the sax alone all and all this was among my first bunch of grateful dead cd 's that i got and it got me hooked so do yourself a favor if you are thinking about listening to the grateful dead and you want to hear something from the 1990 era buy this cd but i would also get something from the 77 era too	9
0	trip hop and lounge lovers need to have this cd at home bajo fondo tango club is not as pure tango as piazzola 's nor as chill out percolated as gotan project 's which makes them a band for all publics nor even one single person in my office could n't help download at least one song of this cd into their ipods three of them already bought their copy	9
0	originally released in 1972 this was can 's fourth record as well as their follow up to 'tago mago' \( see my review \) some really superbly written and played cuts here to fully take in \( might take several spins \) are pinch liked michael karoli 's \( r i p \) stellar guitar solos the somewhat stunning vitamin c and this reissue 's lengthiest track the ten minute soup first rate german progressive kraut after i listened to this cd a second time i realized that 'ege bamyasi' may have very well been a heavy influence on later bands like gary numan pere ubu public image ltd and stereolab silly cover do n't you agree	9
0	this album is great but i'm looking for a song that i think they sung it goes pressing on we 're pressing on \( repeat \) waiting on jesus to answer our call we 're holding on \( repeat \) pressing pressing pressing if anyone knows the name of the song or has any suggestions on who sings this song please email me at udeebear1984 yahoo com thank you and have a blessed day !	9
1	i ca n't say i liked this cd jessica simpson was good when she started but as her popularity has grown her talents have declined she commited murder the day she recorded senatra 's song for the dukes of hazard movie	9
1	from the twang of his guitar to the cowboy hat perched on his head george strait is totally and completely revolting i mean for goodness sake the man 's like 100 years old ! how much longer is it going to take for everyone to realize that \? if you like this kind of music please go to charter before you 're beyond help take this as a warning do n't buy the cd	9
1	someone suggested i listen to this because i was at the time into what lame beret wearing record store dips would call creatively aggresive music then it was death metal \( which i prefer without cursing or filth you understand \) since then i 've found the ascension into gabber and then full on unmitigated hardcore anyway mr bungle tepid uninteresting bland stupid gives the chin strokers something to fascinate over let them someone 's got the fuel the economy	9
0	juice newton is one of the best counry pop singers of all times a great energetic voice and some real unforgettable songs my personal favourites include the beautiful angel of the morning the rollicking queen of hearts and the strong and sorrowful it 's a heartacheafter all these years her work is unforgettable catchy and full of energy and vibe	9
0	this album is absolutely beautiful the full musical sound and talent of calexico together with the soothing warm vocals of iron wine make the perfect match it 's almost unheard of that i love every song on an album but this one makes the cut each song wraps you in a warm trance a coccoon of well being it has a really positive emotional effect on me it creates an ambiance of gentle strength wonderful i really hope to see a these two bands getting together for more albums	9
1	the main problem i have with this cd is that it seems poorly mixed there is no sonic depth to it all the sounds are flat and hard to distinguish from each other	9
1	i bought this soundtrack in 1984 when the movie adaptation of george orwell 's book came out simply because it was attached to the movie i 'll try not to use any non family words here but this soundtrack sucks muldowney 's original score is available on cd and simply imagining it used as intended adds a whole new dimension to the movie as far as this soundtrack goes though skip it	9
1	mississippi and sugar baby are great songs up there with the best dylan has done however the rest of the album while listenable is n't all that memorable still i suppose it 's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still after over 40 years performing and recording the same cannot be said for '60s peers like paul mccartney or the stones overall time out of mind was better although that too was a little overrated with only not dark yet standing in the doorway and trying to get to heaven truly belonging to the canon of great bob songs	9
0	i recently purchased this cd again i once owned it on cassette keith is a real smooth old school type singer and his music andsound has sustained very well since it was released in the early90 's if you are building an old school collection with greatsingers this is a good one to have it 's great for romance orwith that special lady jaye pricebeltsville md	9
0	this cd has tons of power and soothing energy it really shows off how well part understands the human voice	9
0	the ufo space travel theme of astonomy domine is continued on let there be more light saucerful of secrets and set the controls rick wrights two songs are real good remember a day is one of the best on here seesaw has interesting percusson corporal clegg floyds first ww2 song is upbeat syds song jugband blues is one of the best early pink floyd songs saucerful of secerets is a good early pink floyd cd it is an important part of pink floyds history	9
1	i bought this cd only yesterday the recording level is too low and i could not listen to the performance even with the volume cranked fully up rather than going in for another high wattage amplifier i decided to return the cd ! !	9
1	this album had two good songs at the most ralph was good with new edition it 's apparently obvious that he ca n't stand alone bobby should have been the lead for new edition then we may never have seen this terrible album ralph is n't that good of a singer this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group does n't mean you are the best ralph is miles behind bobby	9
0	we really liked the cd of music from the sound track of the movie elf it was what we expected and we appreciated getting it promptly since it is christmas music and we we able to enjoy it all through the holiday season	9
1	there is now no trace of delight left in this band all songs are either moderately slow and somewhat self indulgent or frightfully slow and quite self indulgent i do love this band and pronounce praises upon them whenever i receive a doe eyed look saying their name but this cd and the cd previous \( which did have 1 tune apples with which one could smile \) does for the first time take away any anticipation for their next collection of chopfallen tunes first we loose the roses then the ned 's disband following that swervedriver breaks apart and velocity girl is gone forevermore now my charlatans have become charlatans of the great band they once were	9
1	i have to admit that even though i am a big fan of diesel boy this cd was very boring the beats are too similar on every track and the cd as a whole just has no quot feeling quot to it if you want to hear him at his best by 97 octane	9
0	there are plenty of reasons to get this dead album one is the fact that this is probably the best recorded psychedelic cd of all time it was the first rock album recorded on a 16 track in fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology the remaster is splendid another good reason is the great bonus tracks almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your suv to the record store can you dig it	9
1	well i like the song i shall believe and that 's why i purchased this album but it would have been better to buy just the single	9
1	there 's always the argument that if bach had had a modern piano he would have composed for it let 's consider another possibility if some style insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to bach 's doorstep he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the high baroque composers for listeners who understand what bach meant by equal temperament it 's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what bach was trying to demonstrate in these pedagogical compositions in other words the point is lost	9
1	i found the music rather annoying it was not what i expected at all	9
1	this was o k nothing more nothing less this album was hard to review beacuse no songs really stick out i mean the guy is a mediocre artist with mediocre rhymes laced over just above mediocre beats i have heard better sesame street singalongs for yappy kids in the back seat of a mini van i mean what does the album have that sticks out \? saturday to saturday \? bloody horseshoe \? or the multi faceted boo we ai n't forgot about you none of the above or none on the album sorry and please all angry people who think that this is a bad review remember it 's a review i can say what i want	9
1	after reading her excellent halloween book i figured her halloween cd would be worth owning i always search for different halloween cds but this was filled with the same old stuff chains moans and spooky laughs then more chains moans and spooky laughs very dissapointing	9
0	i just love this cd over 8 years ago my much older coworker turned me onto this album it is definetly not just for st paddy 's day this is an album you can listen to over and over the sinead songs are a bit whiney but she does have an excellent voice you can not get better that mic and sting sting 's song is just incredible	9
0	love this album every song is awesome ! this is the kind of album you play over and over because you feel great after listening to it my favorites are in a moment and know half past forever rocks !	9
0	wandering through the dorms in the 1970 's this was one of those albums that was in everyone 's collection it was usually very near the front of the record stack every time i hear that opening guitar riff from reelin' in the years i glide back to a very nice place in time if you hope to understand the evolution of us pop rock music you need to become intimate with this recording !	9
0	blue note was on the mark to re release this classic tina brook 's style of blues laced jazz is a sound that will bring joy to your soul a must have cd for any jazz collection	9
1	i 've never written a review but i just wanted to let you know if you buy this album you are a complete idiot and you 're killing hip hop stop killing my music	9
1	lou reed rocks ! ! ! dude ! ! but methinks this collection dost not the tunes are all good but there are n't very many of them and the sound is deplorable in that inimitable rca first cd edition sort of way \( fans of the jefferson airplane and harry nilsson know what i'm talking about \) a much better jumping off point would be quot different times lou reed in the 70 's quot or even better check out quot transformer quot or quot rock 'n' roll animal quot	9
0	ok good cd im not suprised ok jaheim may not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will with the voice that he has yes yall this album does use profanity but the songs actually have meanings i like that daddy thing song and like a dj this album looks at issues from a mans point of view ya know we 've heard the angry woman and how the man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it well also this is a break from that that is played on the radio	9
0	this is a very well done record by 3 of raps most elite personalities cube dub mack definitely knew what they were doin when they made this record the beats are amazing on all the tracks this is one you can listen to straight through and not feel any need to hit the skip button for me all these songs were hot from the first time i heard them if you 're a fan of the whole west coast gangsta rap thing you gotta have this ! my fav tracks are all the critics in new york do you like criminals gangsta 's make the world go round westward ho ! hoo bangin' although like i said all the tracks are badass peac	9
0	the debut release entitled breathe by artist called blue stone is one of the best new age albums that i 've heard in years ! i would even go as to say that it is even better than any of amethystiums albums i am is heavenly and contact is an eerie number that is destined to be a future classic !	9
0	for those who have watched the movie jaws \( ask yourself who has n't \) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score john williams did for it this cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film the linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information which gives the overall package a nice touch the overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent a highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music	9
0	this album came out about 8 years before i was born all the years i still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play wbss or billie jean now i know all the lyrics and music videos from this album this is mj in his prime unfortunately we will never get another epic like this again michael is sadly a target in the media but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not every song off here is a classic one song i thought was unneccesary was baby be mine but otherwise it 's excellent if you starting an mj collection get this album first trust me	9
1	listening to the standards being sung by rod stewart is like listening to classical music being played on a kazoo ! if you 're new to this music try out some sinatra cd 's he 's the guy who sets the standard when it comes to singing the standards	9
1	i opend the cd filled with joy till it started at the beginning i thought there should be some kind of mistake but no there were no letters not even one word we could n't sing at all we just had the letters printed in very tiny letters but no guide to sing	9
1	perhaps it 's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations but i was really disappointed with this recordthe songwriting is weak the singing is weak and the arrangements are dullsomething kicked all the life out of the music the songs are not all the same but for some reason they all sound the same and embarrassingly you can sing most of them after one listen they are so simplistic and cliched	9
1	i have to admit i expected a lot more from mr setzer the first track was ok then it proceeded to go down hill from there not much rockabilly happening then it all comes clear with really rockabilly when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fans world wide he even gives us aussies a serv even though i do n't think he has ever set foot here if brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing jazz rock or whatever then go ahead but why slag your old fans \? it 's the last time i buy one of his cds without listening to it first	9
1	a friend of mine turned me on to spoon and at first i listened enthusicatically but then i got bored although spoon 's songs may be catchy at times they are empty and deviod of any alterations the same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so but in the end i do n't think i 've ever listened to an entire track if this is 5 star music today our culture is severely lacking depth	9
1	this disc is bad ! ! ! right at the 2 mark the sound of the rock water is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub this sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour other discs of this type that i 've heard do n't do this	9
1	people this is easy listening at it 's easiest every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years that is if it is n't allready i do n't know anything about what they have done in the past except for a song i remember being played on the radio a few years ago must have been on the album prior to this but that song sounds just like two tracks on this one not only that but if there was n't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests i could n't really tell any of them apart horrible music with no feeling or soul not even creative do n't waste your time with this	9
0	i saw this band open for placebo in tampa fl i had never heard of them before that night i bought the cd immediately though it 's a bit plain it 's a great cd it 's a comforting kind of plain it rocks i played it in my cd player for about a month straight the lead singers voice is unique this band definitely has much potential to become a well known group a great debut album if you ever get to see them live do it ! their live show definitely makes the cd come alive	9
1	the kidz bop series is the ultimate travesty in music and do n't think that it 's good just because your kids might love it kids also like to eat mcdonalds but do n't try telling me that their food is healthy there is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children and surprisingly a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children even with the expletives deleted there is no reason on earth why these records should exist excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish i agree with the person who suggested the beatles as an alternative seriously do n't buy this !	9
1	pls tell me tat tis boxset is a joke ! ! ! ! classic rock reo romantics bangles \? \? \? its more like classic new wave only thing good would be the price pls who ever the a amp r people are pls pls design something bette	9
0	this album sparked the so called neo soul movement years before it was adopted by other artists back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and prince broke the music back down to its roots this concept was later used by tone tony toni brand new heavies and d'angelo	9
0	what a great album this is not only is the music a real pleasure to listen to but the lyrics are a hoot ! wayne is not afraid to experiment he skillfully combines old school elements with new in such a natural way the songs pull you right in as if your listening to an old favorite you have n't heard in a long time this album instantly became one of my favorites i bought two more to give as gifts	9
0	i wonder if the two reviewers who said they were disappointed in this soundtrack watched the film \? my guess is that they did not the film was enhanced by the james horner score and it would have been hurt by anything that was not light and subtle it is a unique and amazing film and the score is a perfect match by the way the bigwigs at universal nearly died when they heard it and then were equally stunned when they asked horner for the written score and he had to admit that none existed ! wonderful music	9
1	the most untalented producer in the business honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with biggie and black rob 's only one hit the rest of this is trash especially those chickenheads total and once again puff tryin to eat off biggie carcass dont give this bum anymore money just listen to biggies two gems and f the rest	9
1	knuff respect to public enemy they are one of the few groups in hip hop history who 've provided fans with ill beats and consciouss lyrics with that said this single blows it 's trash the beats are trash chuck d and flavor flav do n't rap the dvd is just them hanging out in some clubs it 's a shame legends such as public enemy are far above this remedial single if you want to hear their best worx go and buy fear of a black planet or it takes a nation of millions to hold us back you wo n't be dissapointed	9
1	i thought it would have nice soft songs but it is riddled with annoying sound effects and strange instrumentation	9
0	sweet brazillian jazz piano combined with guaraldi 's 1960 's hit quot cast your fate to the wind quot throw in a coupla classics like quot since i fell for you quot and quot moon river quot masterfully interpreted by vince and you have the perfect album for unwinding loving or waking up	9
1	i am a huge fan of btnh but even i will admitt this is not a good album the worst being home which uses samples from phil collins the whole thing feels kind of empty with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works there are a few songs worth listening to most notably is clevland is the city which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any harmony to it other songs worth mentioning are what about us not my baby and pump pump the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage it is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released	9
1	just another cd of the awful awful techno crud that has infested goth industrial clubs while real artists like cinema strange and knifeladder get the shaft worthless on every level	9
0	if you think yer gonna puke everytime you have to suffer through a country song from nashville these days and you happen to like classic rock you would probably appreciate what shooter 's trying to do here folks this is the real deal i do n't mean real country or real rock this is a hybrid i mean he 's making music that is honest and down to earth a flash in the pan he 's not he 's going to be around for awhile	9
0	sorry ya just ca n't replace michael hutchence this is a great overview of all of their greatest hits i am not a huge fan of greatest hits cds b c people tend to buy them and therefore miss all of the excellent songs that were n't released as singles all inxs cds are worth buying separately but if you must this will work	9
1	when merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from switchblade syphony one can only be disappointed in diva destruction 's music the positive aspect is the better production on this cd compared to their debut	9
0	wonderful instrumentals and lyrics a shenandoah lullaby is simply beautiful i love the way the ending segues into brahm 's lullaby his version of arkansas traveller is refreshing teddy bears' picnic is a quaint song that few people have heard there ai n't no bugs on me is my two year old daughter 's favorite judging from the way she belts out this song and giggles from time to time i like all the songs on the cd a breath of fresh air for parents who prefer real instruments to synthesized pop	9
0	the guitars are n't loud enough and neither is the bass for that matter which is so true but it 's still a great album seeing them live makes up for this cd no doubt stand out songs the city sleeps in flames the world as we know it just a taste my darkest hour empty glasses the only medicine'my darkest hour' 'empty glasses' are my favorites i know those songs by heart	9
0	i did n't think it was possible for the delays to top their debut release but they have while faded seaside glamour is more immediately catchy and refined you see colours comes at you in a much more intense manner the songs are more mature the musicianship is top notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom end and soaring harmonies the high points for me are valentine and winters memory of summer but there 's honestly not a bad track on this release the delays put it all together great songwriting strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre bending mix that has something for everybody it 's a shame these guys do n't get more recognition here in the states buy it	9
1	i 've been down for monica since the beginning but now i am finished i love monica 's voice but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers wtf ! ! ! i want the soulfoul monica from the first cd sideline ho are you serious ! ! ! again wtf ! ! could someone please come out with a soulful mature cd cause this one aint even close	9
0	this is a fantastic holiday christmas album doris day 's beautiful voice singing these terrific christmas songs make for a beautiful sound that will bring all who listen years of enjoyment a must have for those who enjoy hearing terrific christmas music over the holidays	9
0	a friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago i listened to a few minutes of it and was like what is this crap \? and i shelved it for a couple months i then picked it back up and gave it another listen to my surprise it was really catchy to me the music \( and lyrics \) are simple but thats what i like about them theyre simple ! this is a great college rock cd i plan on checking out more teenage fanclub and i suggest you do the same notable tracks are sidewinder what you do to me and is this music \?	9
1	i first heard the song on the radio en route to work i enjoyed it immensely and wanted to know who did the remake no doubt 's redo of the 80 's hit brought back good memories of the new wave era but of course it does not compare to the original talk talk version	9
1	i just purchased my sacd player and picked up boston and billy joel 's the stranger at the same time after listening to the stranger my mouth dropped billy 's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction then i put in boston and could n't tell a difference from the cd version i already own i think it 's one of the best albums but if you already own it on cd do n't bother upgrading there 's nothing special about the sacd version	9
0	if you are a fan of oscar peterson this belongs in your collection	9
1	i just sold this back through amazon i was so disapointed with it it 's an all cover record and while greg duhli does add an interesting twist to the covers all of the music feels too subdued too flat duhli is lacking the usual passion he brought to the whigs and the first twilight singers recording	9
1	this whole post crap grunge is crap if you want real rock check out gnr acdc and any band pre grunge i know this is a review but how does this grab ya oh and i wo n't mention the thousands of stupid bands that sing like their trying to go to go to the bathroom quot oh how did we wind up like this \? quot exactly what i'm trying to figure out tesla 's got more talent then all these bands and they ca n't get any airplay give me a break	9
0	this is a wondrful cd and quite a bargin two discs and the very best of nancy wilson i liked so much i bought two and gave one to a friend	9
1	i tried to listen to samples of the songs and you have them all wrong i click on one song and get another from on the list what gives anyway	9
1	jonny 's conversion is fine and i hope he is happy but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums if you want christan rock maybe this could be for you but he missed the mark with me big time	9
0	linkin park are still together and they are making their next album it is due out eairly next year mike just did this for fun look into things a little more buddy before you start saying things oh yeah and if you like good hip hop you 'll like this album give it a shot you dont have to be a linkin park fan to enjoy this record since its nothing like lp peace	9
0	i had first bought the here and now hoping to hear the original recordings but was slightly disappointed that on that cd the older songs were live performances only if you want their hits as you remember hearing them on the radio or your old album that may be trashed this is the cd for you	9
0	for someone who knows little about bach and wants to learn something you could n't do better than to give them this cd ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra give their signature warm plush sound to the work of the great johann sebastian bach making him sound very nearly like a romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer this is not a bad thing some complain that bach with his mathematical leanings leaves them cold that is n't possible with the inviting material on this cd	9
1	look as music goes variations on a theme is part of any genre this album however yells out quot leave well enough alone quot a remix of sgt peppers lhcb might thrill a person born in 1986 but when you hear the real thing you ask why change it \? this album is a total waste of a truly great disc like gipeto said to pinocchio quot stay wood ! quot	9
1	i do n't want to hear any more of their music on the radio it is all just nonsense and none of it should have ever been made they are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory	9
1	ok let me preface my comments by justifying the 2 star rating it 's rodney dangerfield he was a class act as for the cd if you 're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone 's cheesy clavinova then this cd is for you i bought this because of the last track rappin' rodney and boy was i disappointed it sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette do yourself a favor get all of rodney 's dvd 's with his standup material and remember him for what he was a comedy legend	9
1	this is the perfect cd for taking a nap to it 's mostly full of slow pop and rock if you 're a fan of this type of music i recommend this cd but if not do n't buy it there are only a few good tracks all star bad reputation i'm a believer stay home and i do n't enjoy buying a cd that only 1 3 of it is good so i would n't buy it if i were you	9
0	i love this album the best of phil collins i believe every great artist always delivers their best stuff when they are in a rut i know he wrote some of the songs on this album bases on his bad times suffering with his ex wife he did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and moment is captured very well he is a great composer too bad most of his new songs 2006 times are different and so is his life i do not enjoy them as much once an artist becomes more self actualized much of their best work becomes just that a memory	9
0	this cd was beautifully sung by the cambridge singers a boys mens choir mostly a' capela it 's the first christmas cd i 've bought that really tempts me to crank up the volume so i can revel in every note	9
1	i bought this because a few people had put it in their amazon lists i just did n't like it at all it is one of those albums where you play it and you do n't take notice of it until the cd stops playing it is very old and the music is simplistic cool cover though	9
1	i'm an avid tony yayo fan but this album just did n't cut it maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure i do n't know but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them hopefully his next album will be way better a few songs are good to listen to i would think coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about but so seductive being your first single \? \? come on i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean rating c	9
1	i'm mean i know these guys do n't have a shred of originality afterall that make some of the same crappy beats you can put together on piano 's and they just got to mess up classic songs also he 's about as good of a musician as he is an actor this country is just too unoriginal these days	9
0	incredible follow up to rated r which i did n't think could be equaled and they did flat out incredible songwriting amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best if you grew up in the 70 's as i did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you go with the flow is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you wo n't be skipping any songs on this disc baby boomers rejoice rock is back	9
1	roni griffith has just come out with her new release only you its great ! ! ! ! ! she has come back so much stronger check it out evi	9
0	very essential music the arrangements amp styles work very well he has great depth amp feel here it 's classic ellington he was always constantly changing music	9
1	i gave this a good listen but did not find it all that funny or memorable	9
1	well unless you are a hardcore collector like myself \( had it originally on vinyl all those years ago \) stay clear of this album if you want to hear noise that you your wife girlfriend boyfriend could do yourself then forget this album make your own noise the best track on the album is the bonus track that tells you that this album has nothing to do with beatles music i give it one star for being terrible one star for the packaging \) search judemac forever on msn	9
0	this cd is dave bromberg 's best effort playing solo allows his guitar playing capabilities to be clearly demonstrated	9
1	i am wondering when this plague will be over and when we 'll be set free to listen to real music we all are so tired of her	9
1	i like the music but the sound quality is terrible i bought this cd because it was released in 2003 but there is zero improvement in sound quality from previous older tracks	9
1	there 's nothing outrageous about the title song it 's a lame mind numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the in the zone album imagine breathe on me touch of my hand or shadow on constant radio play or running on mtv and no we 're not apparently going to have that because britney 's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it like we know ended up in britney 's injury for nothing fortunately for this single it 's got the already legendary toxic and a marvelous vocal mix version of everytime another star for that	9
1	just saw the video for this while flicking the song talks about london bridge going down and everything but the bridge is fixed it does n't go up or down with the video showing tower bridge so bit of a mix up there petty maybe but just thought it should be pointed out	9
0	this is some great music from a litte know movie you wo n't be let down	9
0	chandos' grainger edition is a significant contribution to modern art this particular volume \( vol 14 \) features grainger 's settings of various folk and popular songs which he made in the first quarter of the 20th century the accompaniments are set for small ensembles and grainger utilized the harmonium on many of the song settings on this disc sound is 24 bit	9
1	sorry bill ! poor lyrics and only fair production have made this a most disappointing purchase the guitar playing is adequate but not good enough to save this material i hope bill spends a little more time on the thought process before bringing out his next material	9
1	sucks if you like this album you are a poser that means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal one guy i know that listens to norma jean as i lay dying and unearth called me emo for listening to acid bath how stupid can you be \? you posers need to wise up and listen to real metal such as morbid angel darkthrone amon amarth old sepultura and dissection	9
0	bo diddley is one of the most underrated rock and roll artist such gems as quot bo diddley quot quot say man quot and quot who do you love quot are just the tip of the iceberg add in the blues like quot i'm a man quot and you have a truely outstanding set the set also includes a very informative booklet that includes a bio pictures and discography do not settle for less than what is offered here	9
0	this cd is perfect for driving the downtempo beat driven ambient feel and overall togetherness of this cd is a perfect choice for easy electronic listening overall very pleased with mr schnauss' contribution to the genre highly reccomende	9
1	i'm a huge fan of christopher lawrence 's stuff but i aboslutely refuse to buy this cd because of the copy protection i do not pirate music and should be allowed to copy music i purchase onto my mp3 player of choice this is just sad	9
0	its just realy sad that hip hop dont sound like hard to earn anymore gang starr still gets daily airplay on my stereo and im glad i support these guys	9
1	i am a huge fan of thomas newman but really this cd presents nothing new it comes across as merely a re hash of the airy atmospheric melody free cues from his other recent scores it has none of the originality of american beauty or road to perdition frankly as much as i like his scores i do n't think this warranted a cd release it 's just got too bland and ordinary no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds a pity	9
1	one word generic terrible boring \( well they are all one word \) people must learn to have a better taste in music granted there is at least one good song a few others are decent but only because there are no vocals if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years you have heard pulse ultra my friend likes breaking binjaman \( another uber generic rock band in my book \) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said thats enough do yourself a favor and buy a good cd when will people learn !	9
0	ethereal rhythmic haunting eclectic wake best of dead can dance is a collection of songs that will move your soul and spirit the haunting combination of modern and ancient tunes combined with phenomenal vocals and instrumentals make this album one to cherish and listen to over and over each time you hear it will lead to new discoveries and emotions	9

1	while i like some of these songs i cannot understand a single word he sings i even heard him interviewed and i did n't understand a word when he sings he spends all the time looking down so you ca n't even lip read i do n't think he has stage presence and i think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who ca n't form words he does n't sing clearly and i just ca n't get into his music completely i think i 'll stick to r b	9
1	this album is dull and without any emotion the only reason this guy is even known is because of his backgroud	9
1	i absolutely love charlotte church 's voice but i could n't stand even 1 song on this cd she 's lowered herself to a brittany spears wanna be monotone songs horrible bass every song sounds the same i am extremely disappointed in this collection of music buy this one and you 're just wasting your money would the real charlotte church please come back \? \? \? \?	9
1	there used to be a time when rap was not synonymous with the likes of hillary duff no longer is that true if you call this rap puff was n't that good to begin with and i never owned any of his cds but i knew of him anyway by the time i heard he changed his name to pdiddy i about laughed until i pissed myself \(	9
1	i am a cellist of 15 years on the breakthrough of becoming a renowed cellist this cellist tone is so powerfull and clear she tells a story this is so clear to understand because the music speaks alisa should watch the slurs from the f to b and be more gracefull the apres un reve was ok i guess she really should of tooken more time like floating on a dream cloud when i play this piece i take the music from the begining as a fuzzy dream and play the pitch so the music tells a story and becomes more clear every measure the elgar is somenthing she might not want to touch because no one plays it better than du pre	9
1	nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst and how dare him to diss krs one he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on number 1 he just added to why he sucks lets face it all his songs are basically dumb and and really don t have much texture involved and how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable if you buy this album you throw away good money unless you like bubblegum rap this is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool but lets face it its played out	9
1	i have all 5 volumes and this is the only one i do n't like the selection of music is just plain bad there are a few songs that are ok but most are just dull dull dull i recommend going with one of the first 4 volumes instead	9
0	this is mood making sexy great music neal adds a slight rock edge to some beautiful and familiar melodies this album is great for background music \( we play it in our store \) party music or just for listing one of the best guitar players of all time 'sings' with his instrument buy it now	9
1	being a huge blondie fan i want to rate this one higher but sadly i cannot it 's just a sad mishmash of bad songs it feel very negligant too i love the way blondie contributed to rap and disco but their calypso number on this one is so awful they had lost it here check out thier truly great albums instead like paralel lines or eat to the beat	9
1	this album is disgusting no musical talent this people are the farthest thing from musicians if you enjoy overproduced music and a rip off of fellow label mates fob and p ! atd buy this it is boring and it is a weak attempt at a record shaant ca n't sing either go back to buffalo	9

0	at the end of the day when you come home from school or work one ca n't say quot i feel great quot rather than great we are stressed and tired the sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this cd captures it it almost perfectly i too am always stressed at the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling rain and it does work it would also be helpful to listen to while sleeping with quiet natural sounds it will have a soporific effect on its listeners and relax you	9

1	blues singers should n't try to go mainstream if they do try and succeed fine that means they 've stayed true to their roots when they try and fail \( as susan has done with hope and desire \) one would hope they 'd try to get back to where they started for me that was just wo n't burn i guess when one is happily married with children it 's hard to sing the blues since you 're not feeling them you 're faking them	9
0	i 've had this cd since it came out and it continues to be my favorite it 's a cd that i can put in anytime and thoroughly enjoy this would be my pick for the cd to have while stranded on an island it never gets boring and made me appreciate just how good schon is unbelievable if you like this you 'll like eric johnson 's venus isle album too two of my all time favorites	9
1	after chancing upon galactic 's rather remarkable live show at a local bar i jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc was n't worth the effort i'm afraid velveeta on wonder bread dull collection of acid jazz duds not bad as background noise for your next dinner party but captures exactly none of the blood and soul that make galactic such a great live act a pass for all but galactic completeists if such an animal exists	9
0	the rosary is very well produced a powerful tool to crush the devils head	9
0	this is a cd that everyone should have ! there are four great voices and they do country music the way it should be ! lorrie morgan is the best and i like everything on this ! ! buy it and enjoy ! chery	9
1	i think they should place a disclaimer at the top advising would be buyers that rosemary clooney does not perform on this cd it lacks the romance and magic without her i wish i had read the reviews of this cd before purchasing it but i was so excited to see the white christmas soundtrack on cd that i just one clicked it	9
0	this album is hard ! e 40 always come sic wit it if you do n't got it ya betta git it it reminds me of his \( my fav \) quot i a major way quot album sluppin' from intro till outro he is the bay area 's finnest please belave it	9
0	always loved this group own several of their cd 's and this is by far my favorite darryl hall 's phrasing of his songs are superb	9
1	is n't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of al jolson \? the problem with so many new traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience hippies and white liberals love it but where does that leave those that are living it \? far better capturing the latina experience are julietta venegas south of the border and east la 's lysa flores north of the border	9
0	the beats is cool but you understand his lyrics ! amp its not bout all that pimp trash ! snoop not a pimp but this is a bangin c	9
0	this record is one of the best that has found its way out since the new millenium i am partial to good songwriting and bill 's particular folk country alt emotive sound the tracks to me all over the place and take it from someone who has been there and back it was well worth the trip	9
0	i found this cd by browsing amazon and decided to give it a try i am happy with all of the tracks some tracks remind me of beatles a little but not all so the band does have a unique sound even though from the 90s the sound is like many bands making it today i like it	9
1	first of all floetic was a brilliant album and after i heard superstar on the radio i thought flo'ology was going to be a classic too i was wrong this album lacks originality its inferior to be precise the first time i popped this cd into the system i found myself being friends with the skip forward button the length of the records is despicablethis cd is not worth having the only track that stands out for me is superstar and i think common is amazing	9
1	i ca n't believe the other people giving this high marks i love the wheel but darn if this is n't just terrible there is n't even a single on it i ca n't believe the studio released it thank god i got a promotional copy and did n't have to go buy it in the store the catherine wheel needs to get back together quick	9
1	jj the name of the song you are looking for is like you like an arsonist by paris texas	9
0	this is the best album band noones ever heard of this is the most underrated bands ever \( including fm static \) and they deserve some appreciation this cd is a great rock cd and it has a bit of seemingly hip hop bits here and there in just about every song almost every song on this cd rocks so buy it	9
0	this was not a waste of brad 's time or mine good job !	9
1	this cd is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical a better alternative would be to listen to either a \) the original artists who influenced this bandorb \) someone at least trying to do something new with music to enjoy this cd you 'd have to really want to like this band either because you liked dig or because you 're attracted to their super cool reputation if you 're afraid you 're missing out on something by not owning bjm 's back catalogue do n't worry you 're not	9
0	i originally purchased this cd at a local store so many of my friends and family loved it that i ordered 4 more from amazon at a fraction of the cost it is a superb cd and i recommend it to all	9
1	flcl is the worst anime of all time and possibly the worst thing to come out of japan since the pearl harbor attacks and the soundtrack is just as bad if not worse its nothing more than j pop mixed with bad japanese rock bad guitar playing boring drum beats and inaudible bass you 've heard one pillows song you 've heard them all only otakus with no life love this s \( like matthew g salisbury \) if you want good japanese music go for king 's evil ps that album cover is possibly the worst ever made	9
1	i like funny rappers who have some talent at least i do not think that his songs or the man is funny at all and even the people that i know that enjoyed this the first couple times say that they do n't like it at all by the third time truly bad pointless music that makes all rap music seem like a joke avoid this one	9
0	i love this album but the other review from anonymous is wrong this cd is not remastered i baught this cd because of that review and got burned the cd even says right on it aad in other words analog recording analog master digital playback i will say this much though the transfer is better than mca 's version which i own however if you want a remastered version of the song monster look to the all time greatest hits original recording remasterd cd from mca it also has move over from this cd i love this cd and want it remastered if you gotta have this album \( i do \) than this version sounds better than the mca version	9

1	i love this band and have all the rest of their cds	9
1	i have been listening to military band music for years and am rarely disappointed however this compendium of music by the u s navy army and marine bands and associated choral groups is not to my taste many of the arrangements are strange and there is much too much vocal music when what i want to hear is the bands play i would not have bought this album hhad i known beforehand what i know now	9
1	i found a supposedly new remastered edition of sade 's diamond life on sale for less than 10 bucks oops ! great mistake ! when i tried to return it the cd store was already out of business and the copy is one issued in the netherlands which is marked into the booklet as 2000 digital remastered version the whole album has been re recorded with new arrangements ! the digital sound is quite good but the new arrangements made for 'smooth operator' really sucks ! !	9
0	fournier plays exquisitely imbuing each note with an elegance of its own and keeping the piece lyrical yet still rhythmically precise although his interpretation is romantic the spirit is all bach with no egoism on the part of fournier there is both serenity and tension in these recordings and fournier 's smooth interpretation is one of the most moving recordings available	9
0	one ca n't go wrong with this one a classic which according to the well written liner notes was recorded 3 days after opening night and a pit orchestra that sounds like a pit orchestra before the days of electronic music	9
0	this is the first of alison 's album 's that i bought many years ago i 've watched her career blossom she was an unknown when she recorded this album but in my opinon it 's her best ! true bluegrass beautiful voice wonderful music ! i 've had the opportunity to see her and the band in concert several times and their music never leaves me disappointed	9
0	i was at the brighton concerts that these recordings were mostly taken from and as a reminder of two stunning nights of music they ca n't be better standout tracks include the two by martha wainwright the two by teddy thompson perla batalla 's bird on a wire rufus' chelsea hotel and \( from the sydney concert \) antony 's if it be your will two major disappointments though the inclusion of u2 as backing band for leonard cohen 's own version of tower of song seems done for purely commercial reasons and does n't work and the nonsensical ommission of linda thompson 's sublime take on alexandra leaving here 's hoping it 's included on the dvd release	9
1	i listened to this cd and unless you are into the whole barking dog sound of a band i did n't like this one one bit but than again it was also for my husband i definitely would not recommend unless you have heard of the band and like that style of music	9
0	this is a fantastic album the fact that 5 star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its release \( and they 're not the beatles or u2 or anything \) should speak volumes i have played this cd countless times over the years and i am amazed that i am not sick of it i am a pretty constant consumer of new music get this cd you wo n't regret it ! \( ps i 've never done an amazon review before but the fact that this has had only 22 motivated me \) it is melodic catchy uplifting and cheeky in short a little piece of musical bliss	9
1	amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of brahms' music with a few exceptions the moto of this cd can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius' the choice of music is also quite perfunctory there are many brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose buy at your own risk my only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of brahms from this cd	9
1	this album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2 right before female rappers \( there 's a few exceptions \) i hate all little kid rappers even when i was a kid i do n't like anything on this album i still got the tape and it has n't krossed my mind to even cop the cd if you like this kind of stuff or you loved jump back in the day then i guess this is for you	9
0	this is one of the truly great handel opera recordings of the last twenty years as usual nicholas mcgegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest handelian conductors of our time the singing from beginning to end is first class this opera is known for the famous largo ombra mai fu but the music in this entire performance is a sheer delight	9
1	etta never fails to deliver in the vocals gutteral bombast sweet soul gospel blues the lady is a living legend but this album like the last album produced by her son is a nightmare chessy arrangments tinkly bass poor sound all around she is a fierce mother and i'm sure she thinks her kids know best but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer should etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck she would n't need the novelty of some of the song choices ps 200lbs lighter and she remains the best live performer blues r b soul whatever in the world	9
1	this a great priced cd but the content is why it is so cheap it 's a true amateur album beethoven lover is over her his head this is the real world not a fantasy everyone likes every type of music world deal with it and agree with me it is n't so great	9
1	i was misled and thought i was buying the entire cd and it contains one song	9
1	i ususally like aguilera and i need a song to practice for dance so i bought this one for no other man figuring i would like the other songs as well i was so wrong i hate the rest of them	9
0	i'm not particularly familiar with sonic youth and the bits i 've heard from their other albums have n't really grabbed me this does the rhythm section would n't be out of place in pseudo tribal funk the guitars are dissonant jangling sometimes hypnotically repetitive and just plain weird and the vocals are distant airy lazy some of the best music i 've heard in a good long while	9
0	stephen stills for what it 's worth is of course a classic song burned neil young 's strongest effort for this album is another classic song the rest of it is all very good i would say that it does sound a bit dated however and that this one is mostly for fanatics of 60 's music your average artic monkeys fan is not going to find this a good match for their musical sensiblities better was on the way from buffalo springfield their next album buffalo springfield again is an all out rock masterpiece that everybody should own whatever your age or inclinations	9
1	this young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice albeit a little underpowered but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture there is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties in fact i suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short shorts once again sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art	9
1	this lifts your heart to god as you listen beautifully done	9
0	a great series concept highly significant artists performing material which taken individually or collectively represents a major section of the american music library ofcourse the originally withdrawn w new at the time funky people quot talkin' loud quot by jb \( i bought it retail ! \) is the highlight along with the live quot it 's my thing quot by marva whitney \( yes i saw mw sing it l i v e at madison square garden in july 1969 \) the prev unrel bobby byrd track and vicki anderson 's contribution to the quot cold sweat quot session also reinforce the value for listeners	9
0	i absolutely loved the string music on track 3 i remembered it from an old pc rpg called quest for glory iv i was disappointed to find out that track 4 was only a minute and a half long because i grew up loving that song from the various places i heard it \( fantasia and a kid detective pc game from the late 80 's \) overall though grieg 's greatest hits is a must have for collectors of classical music grieg is revered as norway 's greatest composer of all time and he certainly has a knack for creating imagery of bustling fjords and majestic mountainsides with interlaced river ravines	9
0	this has to be one of the most beautiful cds ever recorded damien 's vocal range is vast his musicianship excellent but it 's the crafting of songs at which he truly surpasses most artists haunting sensitive flowing crashing \( if i have one criticism it 's the mixing levels at times his vocals are drowned in concert when he lets rip you really feel the power of his vocals music which unfortunately does n't come over quite as well on the album \) a truly magical album	9
0	this is the soundtrack that led me into the wonderful world of glam rock ! it is outstanding and i could just play it again and again it is certainly one of the most brilliant albums out there and probably my favourite soundtrack of all time	9
1	i bought two copies of this sacd both had glitches and would not play in my player correctly be forewarned i dont have any other problems with other sacds so i assume it is in the production somewhere they would lock up for no reason this is right out of the box both copies	9
0	i 've always been a terri clark fan but this is the first cd i 've purchased by her i was surprised at how much i really enjoyed this cd ! terri has an amazing voice and the songs kept me listening to the cd over and over again	9
1	this album is pure crap ! just a marketing move to capitalize on the sales from straight outta cashville until he can make a real new album not this microwaved crapola if you like buck get straight outta cashville an beg for mercy than wait for his future release with actual new tracks i strongly advise you not to buy this it is a total rip off i wasted my time downloading this	9
0	i just want to say that this record blows my mind ! only the japanese could come up with this musical hybrid that defies definition only miss minekawa could inject such beautiful innocence into this thrilling aural rollercoaster of breaks samples and guitars cornelius and dj me dj you are brilliant	9
0	this album was so good to hear when it came out i like every song on here but my favorites are still dre the watcher xxplosive what 's the difference and forget about dre those are my favorites but there a lot of other songs that people will like recommend this album highly to rap fans buy this album you have nothing to loose because its dre one of the best producers in the game right now so click on add to cart and be happy you hearing this classic	9
1	great recording but if you want to actually use it like load it on your ipod it has sony 's stupid drm meaning you ca n't don't buy sony products ! !	9
1	whilst leo kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and john fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers robbie basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs that this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by kottke or fahey \( or peter lang \) is puzzling to say the least but credit where credit 's due it 's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant	9
1	this cd is garbage juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album he was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one if i was you dont listen to the retards who tell you this is a good comeback album instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend welcome back by mase that is a good comeback album the only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of mannie fresh juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats a shame they could n't go to ja rule whose cd sucked with his beats he has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow	9
1	thr pros about this album s that there alot of tight rappers and beats the cons about this album is that clue calls himself a dj but he 's a dumb phony who does n't know when to shut his mouth all he does is yell out throughout the whole album saying stupid stuff and giving shoutouts while the rappers rap he nees o shut up an lets us hear the song if u want this album still go copy it off the net cause the is not worth the money ohyeah he dose n't even scratc	9
1	i mainly bought this album because i was going to see them on this tour in fact the gig i was at was the opening show on the tour again the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again i find most of this album to be very average actually after listening this album is not very good at all the majority of the songs are clich ridden in both music and lyrics there are a couple of catchy tracks most notably safe in new york city which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic probably one of the bands weakest efforts	9
0	all i want to know is when is the next album going to be released \? i ca n't wait ! this album is fantastic	9
0	i have seen phantom on stage twice and regularly listen to this cast recording it is a different approach to the classic leroux novel one that is gentler and more romantic but still intense and passionate the lyrics and music are excellent even if you are an alw pto fan do n't miss this production if it plays nearby	9
1	do you love on eagles wings \? if the answer is yes then do you know the words to panis angelicus \? the answer is probably no i do n't blame you for liking this cd the problem is that it is n't catholic and it is n't classic you should ask yourself if you are willing to entertain the songs that catholics have enjoyed for thousands of years if you are willing to look beyond the guitars at your local mass start with sacred songs by bocelli or simply baroque by yo yo ma	9
1	i think someone forgot to tell molotov that rap metal rock rap was dead had potential but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me	9
1	except for the song mother mother i did n't really care for the rest of the cd i bought it for mother mother so i guess i got what i wanted i had hoped to like other songs as well but oh well	9
1	i was so disappointed with this cd at least 6 of the songs were recorded from very old albums scratches and all ! they were so bad i play two of the songs over and over the only two i liked when i read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs i assumed that they meant doubles of the same song i was wrong i do n't know why they had to add the scratchy music a filler \? i would quickly skip to another song only to have to skip many times !	9
1	this industry is goin down u call this an album \? \? \? lo	9
1	agreed the fan is there but i must admit they are actually singing well in the actual solesmes style \( based on these samples \) i have heard superb chant and frighteningly bad chant this is not as bad as it gets i assure you try to find something from a seminary or monastery	9
1	who in the world called this ''hard rock'' \? ! \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? ! ! \? this is a bunch of self pitying mainstream jibberish nothing interesting at all i shall dub this as ''alternative whine''	9
0	alvin lee is a genius with a guitar nowhere is this more evident than in his mastery of the blues he was and is a great rocker but his true calling is as a bluesman this is a great album	9
0	immerse yourself in the incredible genius of mark o'connor and his amazing chameleon like creative ability to tease so many different moods and styles from his violin if you like cajun music this is for you if you like western swing this is for you if you like foot tapping fiddle with a celtic slant then this is for you ! classical \? jazz \? blues \? country rock \? then yeah you guessed it this is for you ! this is an absolutely fantastic album a brilliant collection of melodies that bring together some of today 's greatest violinists pure genius	9
0	two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith there are so many good tracks on this set that it 's hard to pick out some over the others a couple of superb standouts are jolson 's swanee and rock a bye although every track is just excellent the sound quality on the set is outstandingly great i hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by jolson and crosby	9
1	i like meav 's voice and this cd is ok if you like this kind of stuff think slow and somewhat depressing i think irish music has moved on so much since bill whehlan of riverdance brought it into the modern times and came up with this vocal sound i guess to hark back to earlier times which worked well because riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music this is all a bit samey and dull i would say saved by this lady 's fine voice though	9
1	and what 's the point \? all of these songs \( minus a few \) are on the anthology along with countless others the beastie boys did n't put this out their record label did it 's just way for corporate to make money if you consider yourself a real beastie boys fan that is you 're interested in all the other music they made that was n't put on radio then do n't buy this if you occasionally heard them on the radio and fight for your right is your favorite song then go ahead the beastie boys are much more than just their greatest hits to fully appreciate them you have to listen to an album all the way through	9
0	nice cd cool beats songs like welcome to atlanta pick it u	9
1	not what i expected it was n't as 'manly' as i had hoped	9
1	ok so the song playing when brian goes and we see mia for the first time is a song called deep enough \( urban remix \) by live i have the other songs written down including the one played between the two buildings so i will find them and tell you if you all want only the songs that were actually in the movie rent the dvd and take about ten minutes to watch the credits and write down the song names and artists that 's how i have only the songs that are in the movie	9
1	might just be me but this is one of those cd 's that the song they play on the radio is the only decent one maybe i'm too old for the rest but wish i had kept the crystal so i could sell it on ebay	9
0	i 've been waiting for this one this disc and this group period was funky movin was one of the baddest instrumental jams that i 've ever heard period can you see the light is a tight jam as well one of the many bad groups from back in the day	9
1	when mike the mechanics ushered in the `madchester' scene with the living years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon if you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads ! verdict do n't waste your money	9
1	this air supply should 've been cut off a very long time ago whenever any of their songs comes on the radio i immediately shut it off bad ear candy is all they ever recorded mindless sappy garbage even bread 's music was more interesting than this	9
0	robbie 's flow corses through your veins causing a feeling of total ecstacy and rejuvination to have a cd that has the power to lift your spirit and your soul is something i feel so honored to have in my possesion hats off to robbie	9
0	like louis jordan his less well known contemporary jump jive artist cab calloway fits into an area much beloved by americans who recall the boggie woogie era or simply love the jumpin bumpin scufflin shufflin sound of that pre rock and roll music though in truth i do love jordan more and think he was a truely protean genius who was the grandfather of r amp b calloway was the consumate showwman whose jive jump music ca n't help but bring a smile to your lips and a lift to your heart	9
1	ignore the big word karaoke on the cover and the microphone shown this is just a music cd it does not display anything in a karaoke player	9
1	when john cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist gary duncan were in the groove there was no better sounding group than qms cipollina 's talent was awe inspiring unfortunately one of quicksilver 's overbearing and domineering members ways led to cipollina 's departure without cipollina qms sounded like just another mediocre rock group despite the talents of duncan freiberg and elmore i saw them at the hollywood palladium 33 years ago and can verify this if you want to hear them at their best buy the 1st album happy trails or lost gold and silver	9
1	ashlee 's recent face lift and apparent nose job is proof that 's she 's all plastic and no talent she must of asked the dr to make her look like her sister very sad cause she 's unrecognizable now better looking maybe still ca n't sing or dance	9
0	low tech and brilliant music that seems to have channeled zappa winchester cathedral and god knows what else incredibly funny and then suddenly sad mr pink is a genius you betcha and he explains what it is and how it is to live here in this strange quasi city in the shadow of the industry in the curiously full and fun wasteland of other people 's dreams	9
0	i first heard joe playing in that urgent style of his on horace silvers' quot song for my father quot album the thing about him is that his playing has always sounded mature and developed like he was born to play on this cd felicidade in particuliar he simmers builds to a rolling boil and simmers again so nicely as he takes you to brasil also the straight ahead playing on triste' is nothing short of marvelous playing by the group ! the whole is cd is great go 'head joe	9
0	very interesting cd some of the vocals are distracting but the music is driving modern psychadelia as i said think syd barrett 's floyd mixed w melt bannana i highly recommend	9
1	this great underground master dj deservedly gets a release on a major record label but there are too many rappers not enough personality in the production and obvious restraint in the sampling \( surely the result of copyright clearance issues \) compared to z trip 's amazing and audacious uneasy listening with dj p and live at the future primitive with radar this is just a bore yawn	9
1	am i the only ones who actually liked nelly 's first album i thought it had charm style grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance you thought it mean something but this is just a lame gimmick from the start i mean there are some moments and some good songs \( including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer \) but the rest are just horrible there is nothing else about this album that i can engage with nor cared about and who cares \? country grammer was funny and good this one 's an utter disaster one of the worst albums of the decade	9
0	i am just writing this review to correct alexander from russia who cites this album as a christianity peddler leonard cohen is a jew who unlike bob dylan \( on john wesley harding \) embraces his sense of jewish heritage and religion within his music alexander you 've brought your own interpretation to what is a distinctly jewish artist and his work	9
1	this collection of 15 great hits of nicola di bari in spanish is missing one of his most \( if not the most \) important and popular song quot lisa de los ojos azules quot i would n't buy this cd without that song	9
1	gonzalo is a fantastic pianist this cd however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side however it is languid and the tunes do n't stand out it is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments if driving later in the day i have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste but it is exciting not here there is barely a hint of any cuban influence in this music as well now some will like the gentleness i suppose but with weak material and not much diversity it sits pretty flat with me	9
1	yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs girls cars and jewelery i tell you juelz really came with an original formula with this album the stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset lol ! ! ! ! these guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat save your money	9
0	very different very cool ! an awesome cd that all ages in my house \( from 13 to 68 \) really enjoy listening to	9
1	and im happy about it ! i think i might cry if'n it shows up again fareals if albums where 3 dimensional this wouldn e'en make the c side ! i love me some roy but bruh hurt me with this one i forgive him tho cause he done gave me much much pleasure up til now um hope that came out right pimp struts off stage pounds chest with gorilla fist machismo free flowing m'out yall peace !	9
0	you definetely gotta own this after an 11 years break from the music scene seger 's back full force already 400 000 copies sold more info on bob at	9
0	pablo is definitely the babe ruth moses of these pieces however tempo cadence clarity consistency and emotional projection are much better here starker is at least the michael jordan of the bach suites and compared to pablo \( i heard the naxos one \) the sound quality on this disc is the right hand of god starker is the dog 's balls big ones like a great dane	9
0	while i am not a big fan of john mclaughlin or mahvishnu orchestra i cannot deny that they really had something with this album it is something new not just an extension of miles davis they were breaking new territory there is a cohesiveness amongst the band members of course abounding with improvisational talent this is fushion but first of all it is music	9
0	the best r b band ever ! ! ! i know some will disagree with me but this is the band that really rock my boat i mean they were awesome and it was n't forced or fake the rawness of their funk is sooo addictive that you will never put this cd down i am in the process of getting all their cds but this one is a great way to be introduce to their music	9
1	i bought this cd for one song quot walk away quot which was one of their best known songs i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems there was n't the rest of the album is like an anti climax i would suggest a greatest hits instead if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away	9
1	bought this cd based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums i like and man what a mistake this cd borders on unlistenable with no discernable melody talent to be found i'm hardly some ignorant pop music lover i consider blueberry boat to be one of my favorite records but this is just horrible	9
0	this album is a classic but its really short dead prez are the best duo in rap in my opinion i highly recommend this and all of dead prez 's other albums	9
1	man can she get anymore stupid and talentless she needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits all the songs on this album are totally unlistenable ! she completely lacks power vocal range and versatility jennifer lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today she gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career just because your a great actor actress does n't necessarily mean you can sing too some actors actresses were able to achieve it but not jennifer lopez she needs to quit the music business while she still can please stick to acting oh wait ! i forgot she ca n't do that either !	9

1	usually jerry 's scores for movies are priceless \( i e the other score for quot legend quot \) but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too quot forced quot for my taste it 's ok as a weird sort of comedy album i suppose but from the main theme i was laughing because it 's meant to be such a serious experience but is n't ! i think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd \(	9
0	i have listened to this wonderful soundtrack and i think it is superb ! ! i now know that the alien movies rock ! the tone of the music fits the movie i especially like quot ripleys them quot because it reflects on what has happened with ripley through out the movie the cloning learing remebering and also meeting her clones i would also like to say that the movie was excellent aswell the cast did a great job acting their hearts out jean pierre jeunet should be proud of the music and his film so if you are n't an alien fan you sure as heck will be after you listen to the soundtracks ! jenna	9

0	joe cocker has one of the most distinctive gravelly voices in r b history he 's always stuck to his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties this collection is another classic with great covers from the beatles elton john and gary wright his interpretive voice has always been the focal point of his songs but in dts 5 1 you are surrounded \( as if in concert \) by his presence the completely adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more atmosphere without taking from his performance imagine hearing him in live in a theater and you 'll know what to expect from this warm and heartfelt album	9
0	i wo n't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended being that i never heard all of her albums so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin' however for me who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me some of the tracks i love a couple i do n't like at all and the rest i just like my favorite ones are in order eroticaray of lightbeautiful strangerthe power of goodbyedeeper and deeperthe prodution is excellent and i love the vocals if your new to madonna my opinion would be to start here but a true fan can give me lessons	9
0	jodeci 's forever my lady has a problem that most nineties r b releases had at that time if the fast songs were tight then the slow songs suck and vice versa jodeci 's first cd had some of the finest slow songs to come off of one cd in 1991 stay forever my lady come talk to me u i and i'm still waiting rank with the best but every single fast is hot trash	9

1	i can understand that robin felt a need to include some of the biggest bee gees hits to appease the fans but the ones that were sung by barry are below wretched here robin frequently disappears in the sound mix becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony that 's fine for a group concert like the bee gees but inexcusable for a solo effort his stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act they should have kept this in the can it seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for robin do n't do him the favor	9
0	this is one of my personal favorites i bought this cd when my daughter was 1 month old we would listen to it during those late night feedings to create a peaceful environment i'm pretty sure it was a benefit for her it was definitely a benefit for me	9
1	chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again fftmc and bts were lush and beautiful productions nicks latest attempts have been pathetic from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint even his older 'pop' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he 's doing these days no we 're not saying recycle the older productions but instead it 's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality' in the profuctions a signature if you will and hey it does n't have to pigeon hole you if done with class yes how the mighty have fallen oh brother	9
1	i love to hear old standards and such but i like to hear people who put their own take on it i ca n't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some frank sinatra wannabe where are the male versions of nora jones \? tone down the cheese ! we need more people like sophisticated shirley horn and betty carter \( not hams like buble dusk or boring singers like diana krall but what can i expect from the music industry \? rarely do the best song stylists get lots of attention so hmmm nevermind i guess it 's always been that way	9
0	i usually do n't do album reviews but i gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and i was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine i call quot the sauce quot so many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings word of mouth is bliss a g 2 a ke who came out on rap a lot has n't come out with a cd since this classic i'm salty they did n't quot make it quot because this was heavily slept on	9

1	vote this one off the island 19 overproduced prog tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping chanting and grunting sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by phil collins it 's all supposed to convey the drama intrigue and relevance of a tv show \( survivor yell mud bath chase race tally the vote i can see it buzzed \) with no drama intrigue and relevance a desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television	9

1	do n't waste your money this album is cheesy sounds like a million other pop rock songs and is nothing compared to their earlier work with donnie van zant and max carl on vocals all i have to say is they need the old lead singer back ! the guitar work is ok but the classic 38 special sound has definitely been lost	9
1	right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i 've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks do n't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble	9
0	we bought this on cassette in washington dc on our first day of honeymoon in september 1997 having flown from northern ireland it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from washington to nashville along the skyline drive down through south west virginia across eastern kentucky to berea and down to smoky mountains national park in tennessee we are from an ulster scots scotch irish background and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that our forebears had settled in so many centuries before bringing thier fiddles and folk songs with them creating what was the core of mountain old time music and bluegrass from the carter family right through every song is a classic you must buy this	9

1	lol ! some people cant be serious these days the lyrics on every track are straight garbage so he failed bad lyric wise production wise some of the beats are pretty good but a beat doesnt make a song good ! nor does it make horrible lyrics good ! ! so i think some tracks where he gets deep are worth the try j kwon but the game aint for you i think this album is garbage	9
1	many albums including this one have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting except for the first two tracks the use of many poetry elements in their lyrics ca n't save the blandness of the music what about everything and life less ordinary are good songs the rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep	9
0	now i know what you 're thinking why are there two releases of xx \? well after they switched from eclipse to universal records they re released the album xx but they also re recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals \( big mistake ! \) the original album is by far much better than the universal release in december of 2001 if you 're not sure which one to go with go with this one !	9
1	this album was one of my biggest mistakes \( bought it 3 years ago \) it 's childish songwriting and really not good enough for an alternative rock band better you buy instead up the bracket \( the libertines \) orsome strokes stuff	9

1	gerry marsden and his pacemakers are great i just want to point out that the double cd 'best of' import has 15 extra tracks and sells for about the same price there is just no reason to buy this compilation instead of the import	9
0	excellent 24 track compilation of this surperb psychedelic dutch band each tune was a single sometime between 1965 69 these guys are not to be confused with a u s band from the same era of the same name cuts that make this cd a true keeper are sun 's going down the tripping feel like i wanted to cry keep on trying the familiar sounding touch and ballad of john b this is yet another band i 've heard at least one or two tracks on the rhino release of 'original artyfacts nuggets ii' 4 cd box set should appeal to fans of pretty things q65 early beatles creation and the action a must have	9

0	yes the beatles by which i'm not comparing supergrass to them no supergrass are riding the road built by not only the beatles but other british rock'n'roll greats like the kinks david bowie the zombies and many others but the exploding energy of supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000 's this will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of british rock'n'roll of the 1990 's and 2000 's and without doubt represent the bohemia intellectual hard rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since circa sgt pepper an intoxicating and highly addictive album 100 recommended for anyone any age	9
1	this band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now but i'm just not feeling it the single wolf like me is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album it is a great song but everything else is just blah i think the band could use a different singer the guy they got does n't sing very well or very soulful the music is good very original and the only reason i have n't sold the cd yet i really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy do n't be fooled by these 5 star reviews just listen to the cd before you buy it that 's my advice	9
1	do not buy this cd the first two reviews said this is a good cd nope i 'll tell ya the real about this cd i believe this was 305 's first cd and i do n't see how this cd was ever in mass production while it does have a few decent cuts most of this cd belongs to a different artist 305 got much of the material for this cd on techmaster p e b 's masterpiece bass computer any one who has both cd 's can tell if your looking for bass you 'll find it here but you can find knock with any bass artist i give this cd one star for biting techmaster	9

1	many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know but to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds this is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music another double ambient album seti pharos is a real masterpiece it is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning but you know never judge the cover by its album please if you have any feedback to this write to carlogiova yahoo it i would be happy to share thoughts	9
0	that nigga 's crazy and bicentennial nigger both surpass this album in laughs but it would still rank high if it was n't for the poor sound quality there 's a few audience members who can be heard a lot more clearly than pryor himself half the time but some great classic bits and believe me you 're never bored	9
0	i do not own this cd but i recently saw the doctor at a local jazz club and was blown away he had a good sense of humor and was very worldly he would ascend and spiral upwords untill every one in the club 's heart rate had spead up 100 notches and boom he was back to being relaxed old lonnie at the break i met him and got an autograph he was very insightful musical and with spoken words i would reccomend seeing him live aswell as buying his album	9

0	as always opinions vary in terms of who is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these bach cello suites starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of this cd that this edition the 4th recordings of these music by himself is not technically perfect but in many ways his most mature interpretation you can spend hundreds trying to find a mercury copy of the perfect rendition or you can appreciate the little imperfections of an aged artist at the height of his humanistic understanding of music and of life	9
1	i had this when my daughter was first born it worked ok but she seemed pretty curled up in it when she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped luckily i had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything i was able to return the product but i bought the snugli carrier instead i would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles	12
0	i use it while my daughter is lying down she loves being in the tub this just makes her float it 's great as the get bigger to use like the ring would buy for a friend and totally recommend !	12
1	the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place i would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected	12
1	the one star is for the bag it comes in you can take these things along with you but honestly how many of these things will you really need \? maybe just two of them the nail clippers and the bulb syringe i have the set given to me as a gift i say just buy these things separately it 's cheaper and then go out and buy a simple bag to take along with you it 's more practical than buying this whole set	12
1	my husband and i recieved this as a baby shower gift and were initially really excited about it until we started using it and realized that the motor and other mechanisms that keep the fish moving and lights going are very noisy the noise the toy makes running is lounder than any of the music to sooth baby we were greatly disappointed	12
0	this crib is beautiful and exactly what we were looking for our first shipment came in damaged but after a short phone call a second one was on it 's way great customer service the quality of the bed is outstanding we purchased it for our first child but should also be able to use for the second when that time comes	12

1	i got so excited when i saw this tummy time mat my enthusiasm was hedged when i read that the water pouch needed to be emptied daily if had known that little detail i would not have registered for this mat i must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together bummer honestly now i am skeptical of any tummy time mat i think my boys prefer a brightly colored patterned blanket toys within reach and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs better off spending the money elsewhere	12
0	the fastest way to know your plastic baby wares are clean ! i love these bags note i use two bags simultaneously in the microwave to knock out my cleaning faster since there are limits to how many items you can put in each bag without warping you do need to get any smudgy or residue like material off the plastic item before steaming it for best results overall i would highly recommend this product it has been a lifesaver to me	12

1	i bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago a week ago it just stopped working i really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore so i went out and bought the exact same steamer i used it for 2 days and then on the third day yesterday it would n't turn on anymore i'm taking it back today and getting something else	12
1	it 's not just the most icredible piece of junk i ever seen it is the most dangerous piece of junk i ever seen on the market for kids the plastic is very thin very weak and bends every each way my daughter weighs 35 pounds and the step almost collapsed under her weight is slides off the toilet bowl and the seat itself also bends down under the child 's weight which really frightened my girl there 's no way a child should use it without an adult actually lifting it and putting it on the seat i feel soooo stupid to have bought it \( \(	12
0	i purchased the sesame beginnings walker and my daughter loves it there is a mirror in the middle of the toy bar and she loves to look at herself it also has big bird and cookie monster figures on each end and she loves to play with them this walker makes noise and lights up there is n't any paint on her walker and i do n't know what the other writer was referring to but this walker is very safe and enjoyable for my daughter	12
0	this is great for young babies once my son became more active \( which is when it 's safe to use a regular crib bumper anyway \) he would put his legs on it and it would scrunch down since it 's very thin unlike the big padded more sturdy bumpers that come w a crib set i think that is the only flaw but i will definitely use it again for my next infant baby	12
0	my daughter got this toy when she was 2 months old and she still loves it \( at 8 months \) it was the only toy that would keep her entertained on car trips at first i took one star off due to some minor problems 1 \) it is not machine washable \( unless you do n't mind loosing the barking sound \) and 2 \) the battery ca n't be replaced	12

1	this thermometer is totally worthless it does n't read the correct temp on myself husband or baby when my little one was sick at 3 months old this thing read 96 7 degrees on all three of us i picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm works great cost me 3 i ca n't give this one away	12
1	this is o k if you 're using it as a restraint only if you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart forget it i thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars wrong it hardly covers anything i went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything i wish i would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat	12
1	i wish i had put storage bags on my registry instead they work okay as a multipurpose container but my freezer is full of these things moreover i got the 8 oz ones so they are only 1 2 full as my newborn only drinks 3 4 oz right now one of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately plus you need an adapter to fit the pump something i didnt know i needed and did n't get another waste of money from avent	12
1	i bought this item despite the review that said it was too small big mistake it is small ! it 's not big enough for my 21 months old i'm very dissapointed because i liked the infant version	12

1	i was very disappointed with this pump it was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks and i only used it once a day even more disappointing was the companys return policy you have to ship it to them at your expense wait for them to send you a new one and return that one to the store do not waste your time	12
1	i thought this would be great for the size the changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic it provides no padding at all the case itself is padded why did n't they use the padding on the changing pad instead of the case \? very uncomfortable for baby \( it is basically like laying out a piece of paper \) i 'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags	12
0	i bought this for my twin girls and i love it i had them in september and they fit it in all winter it was so much easier to get the girls out to the car then using winter suits and trying to get twins to wear them or even put them on without screaming using this i was able to just dress them in something less constricting and put them in their car seats before they gave me any hassle once you 're in the car and warm enough all you have to do is unzip the sides and there 's no fuss	12
1	this monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our tokyo apartment although the monitor is sensitive and clear moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal	12
1	for the price of this cradle swing i 'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than i got first the stand seemed a little wobbly you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they do n't lock into an optimal position even worse however is that after less than two days of use the lights sound and mobile stopped working calls to customer service were a complete waste of time and i ended up returning the item while the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable i 'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive papasan cradle swing	12
1	i ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail 3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements they said it would take 2 to 3 weeks its been 3 weeks when i called again they said it would take another 2 weeks how hard is it to get replacements \? \? my baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces would like to get the nursery done preferrably before my child goes to college we purposely ordered it early to give us time but apparently that wasnt enough i tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it	12
1	i have no idea why these itch but i have tried on multiple occasions to wear these pads and found myself wanting to claw my skin when they are in use ! i have n't had that problem with any other brand and will not buy these again i'm not continuing to wear the ones left in the box i have but they make fine sponges for mopping up small spills	12
0	i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help \( after she was diagnosed we were given zantac but still used this as well ! \) it 's a true godsend we 'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto she was content ! ! ! this works far better than mylicon it is expensive but it is completely worth the price we called it 'liquid gold' in our house	12
1	this was the worst monitor we have ever had and we have had several with our kids it says the range is 600 feet but it does n't even reach 200 our cordless phone reaches twice the distance the light makes it very annoying at night it beeps loudly for no reason and cuts in and out frequently !	12
0	i really like this it takes what seems like no time to read the temperature	12
0	this gate us a lifesaver not only do i pets i have a very adventurus toddler this gate is sturdy and very durable it is very convienent because it is designed to fit in an area that isnt straight my living room has a curve to it so it fits great a wonderful item thank you	12
1	same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review they sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set and will not honor the same price for the bedding set i have to send it back and they will give a refund what a hassle	12
1	i 've contacted the manufacturer for an alternative way to hook to crib they were less than helpful i am thinking about returning the entire set i'm so disappointed	12
1	first the adhesive velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least second it is opaque so the kids could n't even take in their surroundings since it resembles a parachute the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the stupid thing would n't stay attached to the stroller the kids probably would n't have had fresh air go for hats and sunscreen protective garments instead	12
0	what a lifesaver this pillow has been for my 2 month old daughter when my son wants me to play a game puzzle or play on the floor i just lay her on the pillow so she can watch us and feel apart of our play time i have also found it helpful when i fold laundry i can lay her down right beside me and she can watch what i am doing it props the baby 's head up just enough better than just laying flat on the floor the lounger also cradles the baby i wish that i had found this when my son was a baby i recomend this lounger to every new mommy	12
0	after months of sleeplessness i received this pillow as a gift from my mom it is wonderful but not for the reasons i thought i thought the big deal would be a nice wedge support for my growing twins \( which it is \) but the real relief is that i barely wake up as i flip from one side to the other since it is nicely wedged between my knees	12
1	the bumper was very cute and colorful and i was excited to put it on the baby 's crib until i put it on no matter how i tried to fit it onto the crib \( it is a white spindle jenny lind crib full size \) it fit very akwardly and never quite right there were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib i was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts	12
1	i bought this to take my infant 's temperature since she does n't like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm i decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate and it never gave the same reading twice first it was 95 5 and then 98 5 and then 96 2 etc i tested it on myself my daughter and my husband then i gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe i just was n't doing it correctly and he had the same results i have taken it back to target and am trying a different brand do not waste your money on this product	12
1	i was very disppointed in this product i found it great that the containers would easily stack in the freezer but this was the only good quality i had to throw out all of my containers because they leaked and the plastic was obviously leaching you could smell the plastic in the milk i'm not going to expose my baby to extra chemicals especially when her liver is n't developed enough to fully detoxify them i really wanted to love this product but leaching plastic that leaks is not an acceptable option	12
0	i love these cups and better yet so does my baby ! they are easy for her to hold and the soft tip makes it easy for her to drink she has no idea that it 's not a bottle it has made the transition away from the bottle so much easier thank you	12
0	as i am not personally using this i can only pass on what i have been told it does a great job of trapping odors and making terrific sausages which are easily thrown away	12
1	this was the second pump i purchased i was hoping that it would turn out better than the first brand i bought this pump is a pain in the neck to put together and the pump that is not hooked to the ac plug in is much weaker than the other side the motor died out after 2 weeks of use this pump is not meant for everyday use i just bought a medala and i hope to have a better expeirence with it	12
1	i bought the set thinking that it was similar to the newer edition of the nurser which i already had but needed more bottles for convenience i was very disappointed the lids leaked and the nipple rings leaked and the bottle plastic seemed cheap i used it for about a week and then got rid of it	12
1	we bought the bumbo seat for our five month old baby by her fifth month she fell on her face with it still attached to her bottom she was hurt pretty bad no way this seat can keep the baby in place with its own weight please beware of how unsafe this product is not at all what is advertised	12
0	this 2 in 1 is amazing the scent is wonderful too bad they do n't make it for adults \) a very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike it actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully i love mustela products so much that i got rid of every other product that i had that was n't mustela fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products try them and you 'll see why	12
1	very useless pants i bought them and tried them on my toddler twins and they did not work at all on a boy or girl and i did buy the correct size they even leaked when used over diapers at night they bascially do nothing	12
1	this bra is very comfortable once on getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head it rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body as far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed which with a baby is all you usually have to work with the star rating is only for comfort 0 stars for function	12
0	finally found this item ! i could n't find this anywhere locally it is easy for the kids to use and it is easy to clean	12
1	i will not buy these again they are tiny thick and do not tapper on the edges this means you will see the lines thru your shirts the adhesive is n't enough and the pads shifted durring the night i highly recommend the lansinoh or medela they cover more are thinner and stick better	12
0	i reccommend this item to anyone using disposable diapers ! i had a generic diaper throw away system it was awful ! this is so easy to use once you get the hang of it and it really keps the smell away ! try it you'l like it	12
0	my daughter recently had her second child and spends alot of time breastfeeding this product allows her to pump at her convenience she can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child the product works very well she said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her but it is an excellent product she previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer and heard how good the medela brand was from a friend this brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive noisier pump she had before we would highly recommend this product and the product is well worth the price paid	12
0	i purchased this despite the reviews i read out of desperation ! but have been very happy with the fit on my eddie bauer morgan gingham playard bassinet it is a little thin however i use a carter 's mattress pad underneath anyway so i am not concerned with absorbancy it does the job as a nice surface to lay my son 's head on and i purchased one more in navy to switch out when it is laundry time	12
1	we could n't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker unfortunately after countless times of putting in new batteries we realized that the toy did n't work i immediately contacted kolcraft and they are sending me another toy i also wished i had gotten the one with the mirror instead i have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it and to add to that she only stays in it for about 15 20 minutes other than that i really like the walker ! lol i think it will be better once we get a new toy	12
1	this is a very cute bouncer chair however i feel it was poorly designed it sets the baby almost laying down so it is difficult to play with the toys in addition our baby has acid reflux and it was not a good chair for him because it sets him back too far we had to find one that set more upright	12
1	i would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all ! this seemed like a good idea but my little guy was kicking and moving all over it barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath it also says that it is for 0 months on up but i definitely would n't use this if your baby ca n't sit	12
1	the quality of this swaddle blanket is very good i'm not complaining about that the problem we 've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks this triggers his newborn rooting instinct which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger i recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item we own two of them and they keep our baby very cozy and warm	12
1	i purchased this bed online last year it looks great and as we all know our daughters love dora however the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy you would problably give up the rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months 60 br 62 what a waste of money invest a bed that your child can growth with and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child	12
0	i had my doubts when we first used it b c it closes with just some toggle like buttons and i was worried that the wind would slip through but my baby comes out of this stroller sleeping bag wrap warm every time and we 've had a few days this winter here in the northeast that have been way below freezing with a wind chill strong enough to sting your face	12
0	you do n't need the whole kit only the loop and latch is needed if you use the plastic it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing this way you can use the softfit breastshield too	12
0	i had a hard time finding a play pen for my grand daughter there are many pack n play items but i wanted a larger square playpen like they made years ago this one was exactly what i wanted she has room to roll around and play with toys and it 's easy to set up and take down	12
1	the first one of these i had came apart at every seam the first time i washed it i returned it and got another i was pleased with until about the 6th washing and now it is starting to fall apart they just do n't seem to be well made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure	12
0	good baby monitor overall sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and i ca n't find where the interference is coming from	12
0	as im sure all mothers can relate my 9mo old son is always trying to eat the shopping cart i looked at a lot of local stores for a cover i couldnt find one that fully covered the front back and sides of the seat that wasnt 80 this one is great ! its reasonably priced wonderful bright colors and holds up well after several washings i just wish it wasnt so bulk to carry around but i guess thats the price you pay to keep him from sucking who knows what up off the carts ! !	12
1	well the women that was selling this product decided that after she had already sold me this car seat that she was'nt makeing any money off of it so she decided not to sell it to me so i never got this car seat i really do n't understand why i need to write a review on it	12
1	i use this at work where i have infants up to toddlers we have to repeat the process 3 times before we ever get an accurate reading the under the arm old traditional thermomaters are better	12
0	i bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son and we never had any problems easy to clean and firm yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months when we were surprised at the news of a second i bought this from amazon on sale the fabric design is different \( blue and white checks \) but otherwise it seems the same to me but one comment if you do n't get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around 20 it depends on what you 're willing to pay for convenience	12
0	this product definitely saves space but i 've had a hard time cleaning the tray yes it 's dishwasher safe but it takes up so much room in our diswasher that i end up hand washing it there are so many little nooks on the underside of the tray that i'm always finding places that i misseed washing trust me the baby will manage to get food there too ! this product would be greatly improved if there were a smaller tray insert that popped out for washing \( i 've seen this on some highchair models \)	12
1	this product serves its purpose but does not need to cost almost 30 ! basically it 's a foam wedge with white mesh fabric over it i'm sure you can find the same product that performs as well if not better if you take the time to look	12
0	i had this for my daughter when she fit into the baby carrier car seat it was awesome i never had to worry about blankets falling off or if she was warm enough they did tell me at the hospital however that if you put anything between your baby and the car seat it voids the warranty on the car seat this goes underneath them so it probably does but i figured it was probably safer than putting a blanket over her anyway	12
1	looked nice at the store thought the adjustable head rest was a nice touch until we got home and tried to use it the head rest will not stay stuck down on the mat the velcro is not strong enough i would not buy this product again	12
1	i found all of the avent cups really hard to clean ! i could n't get the stopper out of the top of the cup the playtex cups are way easier to use !	12
1	this pump was refered to me by the hospital where i had my first son so since i got it and used it my breast hurt worse using this pump then when i was engorged it was one of the worst experiances i was under the impression that this was suppose to help with day to day with a new baby i connot recommend enough to not use this one i am know expecting again and looking for a pump i know that i will not go by hospital recommendation again	12
1	i 've contacted the manufacturer for an alternative way to hook to crib they were less than helpful i am thinking about returning the entire set i'm so disappointed	12
1	i like the music but we have to have it on auto to play because i have a mirror in the seat to see my son \( he is still backward facing \) i ca n't move the seal up farther so that he can reach the part to kick and make the item turn on also i have never been able to create bubbles like the instructions claim so just music plays there are plenty of other smaller items that can do that this thing also eats up batteries like you would n't believe i am changing them every couple of days and we are n't in the car much what a disappointment ! ! good concept but does n't work well at all	12
0	for all new and expecting mothers it 's good to get a little help	12
0	you will need this extra base ! ! i ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have the day after it arrived my mother in law was sick and could n't come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up i had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened	12
1	we got 2 of these and had the same problem with both the cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package after washing it as directed it has gotten even worse it has strings hanging all over it it 's a very useful item but the quality of the fabric is terrible ! a friend of mine had the same problem and she recommends the especially for baby brand \( less expensive and better quality \)	12
0	our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old my husband enjoyed them more at first but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these ! he probably could n't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier at 10 months he still enjoys playing with them they have lasted through both children i would highly recommend these blocks for infants and so far even into the toddler age he enjoys playing with them	12
0	my wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old we feed our daughter with bottles \( mix formula with breast milk \) and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref \( my wife did breast bumping \) and mix with formula we use this warmer all the time also when we travel out this one is quite useful generally with only a little small amount of water the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag \( well not compact bag though \)	12
0	this is a very useful item it looks great and holds a lot of stuff you can also carry it around from room to room	12
0	its definitely a practical way to carry the essentials for a baby or a kid or whatever	12
0	i purchases this basket for a friend i was very pleased with its usefullness style it arrived in two days of ordering	12
1	unfortunately you are correct these are not the same premium heavyweight cloth diapers that used to come from gerber when i called the company \( i use these cloth diapers in my business \) to ask they told me this was the same product it is not they quilt and wrinkle after one washing and just do n't hold up their shape in general amazon needs to update their site because the packaging has changed as well i miss the old diapers !	12
0	the sweet pea bedding set is a good buy the quality of the workmanship is excellent has a high end look for a low end price	12
0	any easy to use lightweight booster carseat highest scores from consumer reports made it our first choice	12
0	i have used several monitors in the past 7 years and chose this one due to the walkie talkie feature it works well and has a great range the vibration is a nice feature so that you can turn down the sound when you have company and are having a conversation no one else has to hear your little ones settling down for their sleep	12
0	the item is so much cheaper than the alternative which is 200 it was easy to use and easy to store when not in use	12
1	recieved the gate with parts missing when i notified amazon they indicated repair replacement parts were not available and i would have to return and reorder the product as my wife needed it this was not possible this is not a reflection of amazon but on hte manufacturer	12
1	i was so excited to find a portable potty b c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training well i opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment ! my son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time it 's too small and pinches i tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable no positioning worked if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it otherwise skip this one	12
0	i purchased this booster seat with the intention of using it on our upcoming vacation only but it has come in very handy while visiting family and friends as well it is easy to set up and take down and is very compact when folded my son weighs 16 pounds and my nephew weighs approximately 25 pounds both have used it and neither one seemed uncomfortable in any way we 've only used it a handful of times so far but i ca n't think of one bad thing to say about it we 're very pleased with our purchase	12
1	i have had nothing but problems with this company i was missing bolts for an item i contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me they then told me that i need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty took care of that but still waiting on bolts order the piece in december it is now april and still not able to assemble	12
1	we bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived we had previously used a diaper genie that we no longer had it worked fine but was expensive we decided to buy the diaper dekor because of the odor free guarantee do n't buy it the guarantee or the pail ! it stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it we have kept it in the garage and also outside not convenient refills are expensive and worse yet my one year old can get dirty diapers out of it through the top or get the bag through the door in the front ! ! ! who designed this thing \? \? \?	12
0	i got four of these sleepsacks two fleece and two cotton i found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes but it did n't effect the product they are wonderful if you are buying for a newborn get the 6 12 month size since it 'll last a bit longer i ended up giving away the 0 6 month size when my baby was only 3 months old as it was getting a bit small	12
1	i'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump now i'm looking for another one it 's difficult to pump if you have large nipples you have to buy extra sheild which costs extra it 's noisy it loses suction the milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy i clean the parts everyday i have contacted medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor \( great customer service \) it worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening i guess it works for some and not others now i'm in the hunt for another pump since i want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year	12
1	sometimes it works ok sometimes it stops swinging for no reason sometimes turning on the mobile will instead turn on the music it always makes a gringing noise when swinging if it worked like it should it would be a great product i like the stars projected below when they work	12
1	just a note to thank all of the parents who take the time to post their opinions i find the customer reviews a tremendous help when trying to make decisions on grandma needs ! i also advised my pregnant daughter to check them out before making a final decision on anything ! thanks to all of you again !	12
0	i ordered this at christmas with the free super saver shipping the crib arrived within a week assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable it 's attractive but my only complaints are 1 \) it did arrive with about five different chipped gouged areas in the white paint \( this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint \) and 2 \) the bolts are exposed on the crib it would have looked better if they had provided caps overall i'm very happy with the crib and the price ca n't wait to use it for my little girl who is due in may	12
0	that 's just it i love this product and i am so happy that we purchased it it saves time and space and is very safe for my children we bought 2 one for each of my children and they have been wonderful	12
1	i 've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week old son i just ca n't get it to work so that he seems comfortable he usually cries when he is in it he fell asleep in it once but he looked so contorted it 's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way and the pocket is so deep it closes over his head and i know i got the correct size i 've given up and am looking for a better sling right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day and he loves it but it 's a little cumbersome and i want him to be able to recline	12
0	i love this gate one because of the height it is high enough to even keep my three year old out of trouble i also like that i can operate the gate with only one hand that is great because like other mom 's my hands are often busy with something else i would and have reccommended this product to anyone who is looking for a gate	12
1	i think the mobile is very cute but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly i tried attaching it in several differnt places i am going to return it	12
1	for some reason the product was not delivered ups returned it this was send for charity after many emails and phone calls the company refuses to respond or refund the money shipping was more than the product	12
0	my son is going through potty traning and he hates those toilet covers he just wont sit in them so this product was our solution for him when we are out it is small but my son \( 20 months old \) fits fine in it ! the problem is i ca n't find the liners anywhere	12
0	a good friend has this for her daughter i fell in love with it when i saw it completely adorable and works like a charm bought one as a baby gift as well but i 'd kinda like one myself	12
0	i was looking for something for my darling 1 year old daughter to enjoy in the bathtub she loves this toy and helps her with developing her gross and fine motor skills the only down side is that the crayons get a bit mushy after a bit of time in the water but it the baby einstein crayons are a good replacement which are inexpensive as well i look forward to many van gogh s from her	12
1	the idea is good but it does not sit well on oblong toilets the adjustable step is a great feature as my sons feet could not reach the other step stools we have used before we bought this apparatus would recommend with round toilet only	12
1	do not purchase this product if you plan to use your play yard with the bassinet the tent snaps on in the same spot and you can not use both	12
1	i bought this product as i was going on a long trip i put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work i put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work all that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you could n't even turn it off without taking out the batteries waste of money !	12
1	the shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small do n't waste your money it 's not worth it !	12
0	my daughter is just learning how to self feed and these placemats are great i 've always been weary of those restaurant tables and how clean the cloths they use to wipe them are this product solves that problem the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because sometimes the corner does come off however i do not find this to be a major problem also i tried the tip from other moms who fold the bottom half over the edge of the table great tip thanks this is a great product for kids learning to eat	12
1	i really enjoy the colors that this cover comes in however the quality of the material is less than desirable the cover snagged in the washer and shrank quite a bit in the drier i expected some shrinkage but it seems excessive i still use the covers but am disappointed overall the material is not very soft so admittedly i will look around for other products	12
1	we cannot get the refill bags into our diaper dekor plus are there different size bags depending on whether you got the regular or plus unit \? the lady in the store said no so we bought 3 boxes of extra refills now we cant use any of them what should we do	12
0	this was a gift and in shopping for a pack n play it seemed the best value for the price	12
0	i ordered this stroller to take my 16 month old daughter to florida on vacation it is absolutely perfect folds small has room for storage you can even carry a small diaper bag under the seat on the cross bars it really is perfect for travel actually it is perfect for anytime	12
1	i ordered two of these cots for twin 4 year old grandsons to use when staying at my home i expected the cots to be fairly sturdy perhaps along the line of a porta crib instead the frame does n't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily the twins tried them out after being cautioned not to jump on them the cots did n't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them i returned the cots to target	12
1	leaking slipping ca n't use over the kitchen sink horrible design	12
0	this is so much better than any potty chair and it is never in the way ! very easy to put on and my daughter loves it ! she ahs been potty trained for a year but my nephew who is just now potty training loves it also ! !	12
1	there are so many other sling out there do n't waste your timeor money on this i hated the padding as it was bulky constricting and hot it was also impossible to adjust i got a couple of slings from www equanimitybaby com and one from www peppermint com and love these bottom line check out the other options this one is a waste of	12
1	i bought two for my kids' seats they constantly bunch up and slip around now i have to lose money in shipping to send them back for a refund do n't bother with these just fold up a towel it will be cheaper and just as convenient as these things	12
1	we bought this travel system because it is light to be lifted and comfortable but the chest clips are so uncomfortable to close and hard to open specially the one that goes between the legs it is so hard to buckle and unbuckle that i'm afraid i'm going to hurt my baby every time we have to close or open them and is complicated to align them to finally buckle in fact i had an emergency with my baby and took a lot of time to open these clips	12
1	the seat is fun to play with but that is also the problem my son was so distracted with the features and songs he never sat still long enough to go to the bathroom	12
1	i own these bottles they seemed nice but there is a design flaw with the nipples there are two pin sized holes on each nipple over time filth and germs built up in these holes they are imposible to clean i didnt notice until one day i started seeing filth floating in the bottle im thowing mine out	12
0	we bought this to replace the one that our infant son destroyed by kicking the edge relentlessly this one has curved sides and the ends are open to prevent such a thing from happening again i also like that the surface is taut and easy to clean	12
1	when my daughter was tiny she enjoyed being in this sling on the one or two occasions i managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes the cotton fabric does n't offer much support for the baby 's weight and i found it became uncomfortable very quickly it also did n't feel as secure as some of the padded over the shoulder style slings i actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times which defeats the purpose	12
0	i received this monitor as a gift and it has been a life saver how nice that i can monitor my baby 's every move and sound without being in the same room every minute ! the are two different channels so this usually cuts out the extra static or the alarm going off sometiems it 's also just a matter or re positioning the monitor to resolve the noise we were suprised one evening when we picked up what sounded like a phone conversation between two girls but switching to channel b solved that i 've used the evenflo whisper connect for about 3 months now and am quite satisfied	12
0	we 've used this since my daughter was about 7 1 2 months old she 's now 2 1 2 and we 've never had any problems with it this is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall park etc the sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too we 've never used the rain cover so i ca n't comment on that it does n't have a storage basket but i do n't know many umbrella strollers that do for longer trips we just take our full size combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option i would definitely recommend this stroller for a light quick outing stroller to keep in the car	12
1	i have had this swing a little less than 2 months i bought it for my 5 month old because she would n't sit in a traditional swing and i thought this looked like a comfy place to nap it was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up i called fisher price and the part is on backorder til mid may i guess i just got a lemon because everyone else 's seem to be fine i am truly disappointed in fisher price they usually exceed my expectaions i paid 150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it	12
1	the suctions are pretty weak dont stick well to the tray also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up the arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face when i was able to get the suctions to finally stick as soon as my son would touch it it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face they should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time i took this back the next day i bought the sassy fascination station instead it has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose even i had a hard time pulling it off the tray	12
1	this is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice i thought ooh what a nifty idea a head bumper ! the whole idea was great but if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine then the head bumper guard is a waste i actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers do n't ask me how he did this the good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib	12
1	hard to install ridiculously confounding installation directions and when you 're done it 's flimsy do n't waste your money	12
0	we finally broke down and spent the money on the jumperoo and were happy we did we have to limit the time our son spends in it because he 'd jump for hours on end if we did n't limit him to 5 10 minutes a day the jumperoo has sturdy construction and the 4 settings are useful i was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because i was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it but he 's been fine he does n't play with the toy attachment i think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame	12
1	leaking slipping ca n't use over the kitchen sink horrible design	12
1	do n't buy this humidifier ! it is much too loud	12
0	if you need a shower gift this is it ! i got one and i love it the gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing ! mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it i keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great ! the lotion is good smelling but you ca n't beat johnsons and johnstons pink stuff also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom to be !	12
0	i buy a lot of stuff from amazon this bath tub is a good purchase but as soon as i bought it the price reduced on amazon this had been a constant problem on amazon and i think somebody should do something about it i think i should get a refund \) thanks shobhn	12
1	the third time i wore it as i tried to zip the bottom most compartment with one hand \( other arm is carrying my 14 month old \) the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable i do not recommend this product because of its poor construction	12
0	the best bib around ! wash and dry and large enough to catch everything i will never again use another bib	12
1	as a nursing mother i researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition i read from so many sources that soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies i bought a starter kit and several other bottles i was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that i purchased only one did not leak i tried repositioning the nipple and i tried to tighten the lid nothing helped my son was soaked everytime we tried to use them i switched to another brand and now we are very dry	12
1	i swear this is the crime ! the worst product in the western hemisphere never never buy this piece of garbage	12
0	this is such a versatile chair love the way you can fold it down compactly yet it 's incredibly sturdy with the wide base when being used the tray stores on the back legs when not in use nice touch for the reviewer who complained that the thing that separates the legs is attached to the tray you can use the harness system to keep your child in place while removing the tray plus it 's easy to remove the top part of the tray and leave the base to keep the child secure while you clean up my 6 month old loves to sit with us at the table with some toys on the tray terrific product to keep babies happy and parents sane during mealtime	12
0	we bought this for our son \( now two \) and he grabs his keys and phone whenever we are going in the car it gives him something to play with and they are n't too noisy for long trips	12
0	i only occasionally feed my baby and my apartment does n't have a dishwasher i usually decide right before going out that i want to take a bottle so this disinfects everything really quick in 3 minutes as opposed to boiling it in a pot of water for 20 minutes and i do n't use it every days so i do n't see the point in keeping everything sterlized cuz i would have to sterilize it again right before using	12
0	i had this highchair delivered to my new great grandaughter so i am reporting what they said about it great	12
0	i love this bath tub ! we were not happy with my son 's infant bath tub so we were anxious to move into this one ! it fits so nicely in the big tub and offers my son the added protection he needs when you 're done with it it just suctions to the bathroom wall to dry the best part is that we 'll be able to deflate it and store it easily it 's also great for traveling	12
1	our 4 month old loved this toy at first but we have had to replace the batteries so frequently that in the end it did n't work more than it did runs through batteries much too quickly also unable to start it from the remote control so we had to reach over the carseat and push the button to begin but now it is in the trash because i touched the straps holding it up and they disintegrated into blue dust not very safe very disappointed	12
1	the item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve i ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completleydifferent diaper these are thicker better quality and have blue stitching and gerber stamp on them that distinquish them to be the diaper service diapers the diapers i got were thinner plain white and had no stamp buyer beware ! you will not get what you see in this current photo	12
1	i am returning my roxy safe seat ! it was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door the material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat at a grocery store the seat just fits into the whole cart and i have no room for groceries its not worth the hastle i admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy the seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place sorry graco the idea was good but the carseat is awfull	12
1	i have 2 wipes warmers one for upstairs and one for downstairs at one point i had this particular wipes warmer and it just does not work mine took forever to warm the wipes and would only warm the bottom section same as previous reviews the lid would not stay shut and the wipes would not pop up properly i have two other different brands of wipes warmers that work fine do not waste your money on the munchkin warmer	12
1	this is very cute but my baby is chubby it gave him a cut and bruises on both legs the seat is n't big enough for chubby babies so it cut his legs off i wish it was bigger cause this is really cute so if you have a chubby baby avoid this because it can cause bruising and cuts	12
0	was a snap to put together very soft for baby moves with ease takes some getting used to on putting the carseat in the stroller but that 's the only problem	12
0	even though this costs a bit more its worth every penny ! it is so easy to put in the buggy ! my son is comfy and fits in it very well !	12
1	i have the safari tt dbl jogger from in step and i bought this shade because the shade on the stroller is non existent i have seen this product work well on single strollers but it keeps blowing up and back from my canopy with the slighest of breezes so it is not doing such a great job of keeping the sun off my kid 's faces i 've used a binder clip to keep it in place but it still blows back more than i think it should	12
0	we had a very fussy baby and we used these and blankets and just about anything to keep him propped up or positioned i was forever reaching for these because of their reliable size and shape i considered it money well spent and carefully packed it away with my newborn clothing so i could use it over with child number two	12
0	we are using this bather for our son who is one month old what we like most about this bather is that the water drains away from the baby the fabric is also very soft quick drying and removable for machine washing the model we have does include straps that can be adjusted around the baby 's waist to keep him warm we pour cupfuls of warm water on him throughout his bath since we do n't fill up the tub with water slippage has not been a problem	12
0	i love this bra ! i have 2 so that one is always in the wash it is the most comfrotable thing i have ever put on i bought it a week after my son was born and my milk came in it was so much more comfortable then my other nursing bra i felt so much better after i put it on for the first time i felt like i could breathe again	12
1	i bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all we have the britax roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow i returned it	12
0	i too was given this pump by a lactation nurse i pump at night after my baby goes to sleep i think the pump is great ! it does what i need it to do and it very comfortable the only drawback is that is is kind of loud i would recommend this for a mother who needs to pump occassionally	12
0	in terms of pre natal resources this is the best i have found ! the positive results are proven i can not think of a reason not to buy this product every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child this system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born you will even notice a response from your baby ! it 's very exciting	12
0	this is the single best new baby item that i purchased ! ! i was a mom who swore that my baby will never sleep in my bed needless to say that did n't last 3 nights i got this co sleeper and it was just perfect felt much more secure with him in there very portable too i took it everywhere for the first three months	12
1	heed the bad reviews i think the problem may be medela 's definition of occasional use i used this pump about once every other day or two for a month and a half and apparently that is deemed more than occasional because the pump yields very little now about half of what it used to so this is yet another review that leads to the same conclusion i should have gotten a different pump	12
0	our 3 month old was maybe a little too young at first but now that she 's 4 months old she loves this toy ! we recommend it !	12
1	the tubbly bath dispenser fit our spout just fine but minutes later it would work itself off we tried everything to get it to work with no luck fortunately the company that sells it agreed to let us return it weeks later without a receipt or packaging do n't even try it it 's not worth it ! look for something else there are other faucet covers out there	12
0	easiest purchase just love the crib and the price was unbelievable including shipping cost	12
1	alas we have the entire locomotion set but the cute little mobile wo n't fit our sleigh style crib i called babies r us to see about some sort of conversion kit but there 's no such thing i 'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead	12
0	finally ! the joovy is the best double stroller out there it was just missing one key element a cup holder organizer for parents well here it is ! i would imagine these will eventually be included with the stroller but for now if you buy the stroller this is a must	12
0	this is a well constructed cute bounce seat and my baby loves it i am very pleased with the purchas	12
0	the pack and play netting is a must have if you intend to ever have your pack and play outside the netting keeps the bugs out ! it is very light weight so you can easily pack it in your diaper bag it also fits easily over the graco pack and plays	12
1	this toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move it ends up moving all around and i can not see in the mirror the plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat	12
0	the wedge along with a vaporizer helps my three month old sleep better at night sometimes she slides down but she used to slide around before the wedge too most nights she stays on the wedge just as i positioned her and i think it helps with winter 's stuffy noses it 's easy to use and not that expensive	12
0	if you 're going to get the baby bjorn potty chair you 've got to get a matching stool ! i love how the stool has a rubbery grip top to prevent slipping my son also uses the stool to read his books on while sitting in his matching potty chair you 've gotta get one now	12
0	this is one of the best on the market looks good and holds tons of toys and the 2 drawers on the bottom are really nice for holding books a must buy	12
1	do not like this productit is very hard to get rail under bedpops out of rails track and it is sooo hard to get back in trac	12
0	i was surprised at what a good size this rug was it matches the bedding perfect the only negative thing i can say about it is that it tends to scoot around a little bit when you walk on it i put it right in front of my son 's crib and by the end of the day half of it seems to have scooted under the crib it could probably use some kind of gripping material underneath it to keep it in place	12
1	i also had the older diaper champ and it broke so i got this new one new and improved ! i do n't know if they 've ever tested this product it 's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the diaper champ it 's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips ! it 's absolutely horrible product new or soon to be moms do not buy this ! !	12
0	i was really nervous about this product after reading the reviews but once i put the organizer up it was great i use the top four slots for thing like mittens and cotton balls and the next two for wipes and larger lotion and bath items the bottom is really good for several diapers i love it ! ! !	12
0	i bought this w the hippo travel high chair it worked great and kept things cleaner unfortunately it was in the case w the chair when it was stolen out of our truck	12
0	tip ! ! ! you can push a 4 oz baby juice bottle that juice for your baby comes in at the grocery up into the playtex nurser bottles to extract the air from the liners this will prevent punctures from your fingernails be sure to remove the juice bottle before feeding baby	12
1	i though it was just me but after reading several other reviews i see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble disassemble the locks are impossible the items do not quite fit right and it would be impossible to get this thing into its travel bag the mattress is thin and very lumpy each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps i bought this product thinking i could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co sleeper aspect but there is no way i recommend you avoid this product !	12
0	i just received my travel set today and i already love it ! the bottle pod is more than big enough for the biggest bottle i have the pacifier pod holds my daughters pacifier perfectly and the diapers and wipes pod is just too perfect for quick trips to the store or a friends house i highly recommend it	12
0	very cozy great for wrapping up after bath to get warm but honestly it 's usually in the laundry and since swaddling lasts for a short period of time it 's use is pretty limited however when it is clean i like having it around	12
0	this carseat is a good value the pad in the bottom of the seat secures my 4 month old quite well and is removable as well as the head pillow i did have to add the infant head support for her neck but that 's expected in a 4 month old it reclines far enough that her head does n't fall forward and it 's so simple to adjust the straps overall very nice carseat for the money i spent	12
0	for all the reviews that have written that this product has been recalled that is incorrect it was the original hip hammock and all those that were in the stores were removed from the shelves so unless you have an older model that was bought before 2 2005 you should have nothing to worry about this product is great when your baby outgrowns the front carriers like the baby bjorn i have had no problems with it and it is easier than using a sling with older babies	12
0	we tried three other brands and types of gates on the market two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing 66 ! the two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install this evenflo gate was put together installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs have n't been able to budge it one inch plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls great product at a bargain price we 're ordering three more	12
0	this pillow works ! sleeping in the car used to make my son crankybecausehis head would painfully drop to his chest making him fuss cry now with this comfy pillow he naps peacefully wakes up happy	12
0	use this gate for our 9 month old son we have an extra wide opening one minor drawback is the screws seem to get a little loose and have to be tightened every once in awhile all and all it is a very good product	12
0	this jogger is great i love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it no complaints in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w mo	12
0	we looked at a lot of different baby gyms and this is by far the best we 've found i love that the arcs are easy to put up and take down it stores flat and that you can add as many toys as you want our baby has really enjoyed it there is plenty of room to roll around and we can set baby in at all different angles so it can be like a new toy every time	12
0	i would like to ditto \( and thank ! \) the reviewer who suggested the cvs brand covers after reading her review i purchased the covers from cvs com then i thought about checking at walgreen 's and sure enough they carry them \( same price as cvs 40 for 5 99 \) i just picked up a box today so i will soon have a bunch of covers but i do n't care i just love this thermometer i actually have the one with the light on it outstanding product	12
1	had to return this item it was way too small forewarned when you order that it wo n't fit an average baby up to six months i would say it would fit up to 6 weeks at most ! ! it is very cute and would be a great addition to a bundleme \( cover \) but the company needs to reanalyze their sizing more disappointing was having to pay shipping return on a 9 item	12
0	i bought this extra car seat base for my mom to use in her car and it works great ! now i do n't have to switch the whole seat when mom takes the baby i am very happy with this purchase	12
1	these do n't fit my cabinets because the width between knobs is too large i'm not sure how but if possible verify the width on your cabinets against what these offer	12
0	this new maclaren stroller is fantastic ! we just returned from three weeks in france with this great stroller it can roll down an aisle on an airplane and negotiate the rocks and bumps of any street it is very light and we love the new shoulder strap i have 3 kids and this is the best stroller i have ever used	12
0	i am sure this is a good stroller \( that 's why i bought it ! \) my review is more of a word of caution this thing takes forever to arrive do n't be fooled usually ships within 24 hours really means may ship sometime as of 2 8 06 our stroller has not arrived it was ordered january 1 2006 it is not even slated to ship for another week \( we 'll see \) meanwhile the local store has several in stock my advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion go to your local store otherwise be prepared to wait a very long time	12
0	i had to return to work after my second daughter was born and had no place to pump i bought this and pumped in my car for several months great	12
0	i brought it when my baby starts to know how to open the closet the suction is good and my baby now unable to open up the closet i going to buy more for my other room	12
0	when our first child was born my wife purchased the lower model from medela with the second child and her having to go back to work sooner we decided to go with this pump and are very satisfied she uses it everyday when she is at work the price might be higher than others but think about all of the money you will save on formul	12
0	i have been very impressed with every avent product that i have purchased i have found these pacifiers to be so nice they are completely clear and you are able to see smiles around them my baby loves hers we ca n't live without them	12
1	we got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock but lo and behold it only lasted a week our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib so when he kicked this the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib where it could have posed a choking hazard ! pass on this and get a fisher price one ocean wonders or the one we got flutterbye dreams which he loves	12
0	i need a gate to keep my dogs out of my guest room it 's used for an office and playroom and it 's the coldest room in the house so i like to keep the door open my daughter 's friend broke her arm climbing over a wooden pressure gate that we had when it fell so i bought this one it took 7 minutes to install it 's not going anywhere and it 's very easy to open and close my dogs ca n't climb over it because the bars are vertical i love it am very pleased and plan to buy another one for my 8 year old daughter 's bedroom	12
0	my daughter loves to cuddle with the soft sleep sheep and i love this product because it puts her right to sleep with the calm soothing sounds ! i love the rain ! even i fall asleep listening to it i had originally bought the sleep sheep because my neighbors upstairs have squeaky floors and they are walking around late at night and wake up my daughter so i block out their squeaky noises by turning up the sleep sheep noise blocker \) i am happy and so is my daughter who is sleeping like a baby ! ! ! ! ! ! !	12
0	this pillow is the best ! after sleeping with it the first night i new i could n't be without it my husband bought it for me and i am so thankful i left it at my mother 's house one night and i could not sleep i keep waking up the night after getting it back i slept like a baby again if you are having trouble sleeping you have to buy this ! its very soft and you can take the cover off to wash it	12
0	my daughter plays with this toy at grandma 's house theses quot instruments quot are usually the first toys she pulls out to play with the bright colors and different noises definitely interest her she loves to shake them and make noise they are great little toys to throw in the diaper bag when you 're on the go	12
0	we live in the cold rainy northwest part of the country this product has been essential since our little boy was born in december it has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital we never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat he stays warm and protected in the bundle me this is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby it is a must for winter babies it is well worth the money	12
1	my 2 1 2 year was interested in this seat right away much more so than his small potty however he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard he gets wet the floor and his step stool are all wet clean up is a nightmare it 's in the trash now	12
0	no more worries about being too short and missing the bowl yea ! ! !	12
1	this was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about 5 00 at any hardware store it cost me a total of 23 00 after shipping for this product it does n't even look like the picture it is n't black with angelcare written on it it is literally a normal brown piece of board it 's blatant false advertizing i feel sick not to mention a total idiot for thinking i would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor if you have the angelcare movement sensor monitor and do n't have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard do not buy this it is a disgrace	12
1	this is a great product for a few weeks then the velcro gets really weak and your child will be busting out ! i go in to find my son with both arms out and one leg out no matter how tight i make the blanket the velcro comes apart i encourage you to buy their other swaddleme blanket with the larger velcro flap	12
1	our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed \( and i'm an industrial designer dad so i should know ! \) it can hit the door frame easily the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height he 's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it he has fun in it at first but it always seem a disappointment in the end save your time and money and get the baby einstein excersaucer that is agreat toy and better for development skills	12
1	product is not worth the money made the bassinet very unstable	12
0	i had wished that i had bought this potty chair from the very begining i bought my son the royal potty throne from fisher price it ended up leaking i never could find the place that is was leaking so i purchased babybjorn green potty chair my son loved it the moment that i took it out of the box he wanted to use it in the family room i love it because it is only 2 pieces it 's so super easy to clean and it is green my sons favorite color great price and great size i recommend this item	12
0	so far i have n't used much in this kit just because my son is only a month old and most the products are for older babies \( also we have n't run into issues to need it \) but i have used the nose aspirator and it 's great it 's soft and i do n't fear hurting his nose ! i'm very excited to use the rest of the products	12
1	after spending over 30 for this item we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across a seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong would not purchase again or recommend to others	12
1	i used these pads when i first started nursing they did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes however my nipples were incredibly sore when i took my baby to her first appt the pediatrician suggested cloth pads what a difference ! yes they did cause me to leak through a little but that was needed when all the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms do n't use these buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath \( i use the imse vimse \)	12
1	nine days from mn to pa seems too long perhaps target direct got process problems i am not satisified got the same three pack of bottles which i bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local cvs for 1 50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it	12
0	we took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at disney world it was great ! ! it held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses monorail etc i am very pleased with this purchase it was great to have it in the airport too the only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked but we can get a replacement	12
1	the ideas for the bottles interchanging is great but unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas when they 're using the bottle you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips every time my little girl uses them it seems as though she just ca n't get comfortable with them i would recommend dr brown 's or playtex ventaire bottles over any of these ultimately the convenience and features are n't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause	12
1	i could n't wait to get it i got so excited when it finally arrived ! so i used it right away ! sooo disapointed ! it did not get anything out at all it is soooo weak ! the one from the hopital is great but broke from using it so much and then we got one from target and it works ! but this nasal clear is no good do not buy it	12
1	this product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins we had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless unless your child 's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators	12
1	bought this crib tent after reading all the fine print about returns besides toilet seats etc which allegro medical does not allow for returns due to hygenic reasons allegro medical made it appear that you can make returns within 30 days not when i tried to return this allegro medical said all returns were up to their discretion they would not allow me to return this despite the fact i did n't even open the box very misleading will never buy from allegro medical again	12
0	i bought this pump because it did have a hard plastic breast shield i had a double electric breast pump from first years that was soft plastic shields and i was n't able to get a drop out because the shields did n't stay in place if you have biggre breasts i would suggest using this pump	12
1	not wide enough for the shoulders of a 6 month old when in recline position the wheels have a mind of their own the handles make it hard to go up curbs hard to close up need both hands and foot but can fit a graco infant car seat compact fold and light	12
0	this is a great potty for boys we had some problems with accidents with some other brands but this one keeps what should happen in the potty in the potty easy to clean too	12
1	i used these through out my daughter 's infancy largely because i bought a whole set of them the milk storage contraptions the breast pump and the pacifiers plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she would n't take any other kind but the bottles routinely leaked ruining several diaper bags clothing and nighttime feedings apparently you have to screw the cap on just right which is really difficult at 3 am ! my daughter did n't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months all in all i think the paci 's are great the rest of it i could do without	12
0	this is the most wonderful and handy kit i have ever had everything about it was perfectly made from the iteams inside to the case it is just wonderful ! ! ! !	12
0	great buy my daughter loves this stroller i like the option of the back padding that you can fold during hot season so the air can go though your child never gets hot or sweaty at their back i would recommend this stroller maneuver really well i can do it with my 1 hand fold one hand great great stroller	12
0	bought 2 different monitors this one has great features such as the motion sensor auto and scan settings the night vision is weak but daytime looks great better reception than the other video monitor i bought but not having good night vision is a drawback i really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom none of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear it is the best one that i 've found on the market	12
1	we received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago \( i was registered at babies r us \) my first child used it for a little over 2 years my second child has used it for nearly 2 years neither child is big \( in fact one is rather petite \) even though the mattress was not abused it cracked and ripped in numerous places i'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from kolkraft i do n't recommend this mattress	12
1	the idea behind these bags is great you can pump straight into the bag and store them the execution however is lousy using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying i prefer the lansinoh bags with the double seal even though you ca n't pump straight into them sealing them is quick and easy	12
0	i bought elmo underwear from ebay with a sports theme and was done training in a couple of weeks the real underwear incentive did the trick so then i bought more underwear as a reward i got wiggles thomas the tank and nemo underwear from ebay	12
0	my granddaughter was 6 weeks premature and at 4 lbs she had no problem with the soothie bottle the pacifer she loves the bottles are easy to clean and love that the cap snaps on the bottom of the bottle while feeding like the little cups to hold the powder formual have n't had a problem with the bottles leaking love the ones with the designs of winnie the pooh on them wish they came in the 3 bottle set also wish you could buy the little snack \( formula \) containers seperately not just in the large sets would recommend for any baby	12
0	it took no time to figure out how to use this seat my daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements so i am moving here from a 5 point harness britax to this booster in a second car the seat is easy to install and remove and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding i can definately see using it for travel on planes as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry my daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water they are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat highly recommended	12
0	i installed this today though i have n't used it that much yet but the quality seems very good and it seems very sturdy i was afraid it might not be sturdy and safe from looking at the photo but after getting it and installing it it seems pretty sturdy and safe to me it also comes with a seat beat to keep the child secure in the seat i'm giving the chair five stars because i ca n't think of anything negative about it	12
1	we had the fisher proce sound and lights monitor and decided to go digital this was the one we picked in our price range we had it for a few weeks and absolutely loved it until there was some weather changes every time the weather was not clear the monitor could not find a signal and made a terrible beeping sound ! buy the sound a lights for 15 and save the extra money ! !	12
1	i did n't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter 's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated ! i figured it out sort of but to this day when i push the diaper in the film rips then when it comes time to change the film the top does n't cut the film so i have to use scissors my sister in law told me to register for it why did i listen to her ! do n't buy it ! dont register for it ! it 's not worth it ! i want a refund	12
0	i own this blanket and just bought another ! i brought this blanket to my playgroup at the park it was perfect on the damp grass and big enough for me my daughter and all of our stuff a few of the other moms liked it so much they bought it too my baby spits up quite a bit especially during tummy time so i decided to buy another one to use in the house it cleans so easily with a baby wipe or a damp cloth great investment	12
1	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it i love the theme but the mobile was a big disappointment it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it also although the mobile matches the theme i found that the colors were n't very stimulating we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it	12
0	this chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son 's only high chair i love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair however i bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything i thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair if you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you do n't have a climber this is the chair for you but if you have an escape artist this chair is no better than typical high chairs	12
0	my husband and i just had a wonderful baby girl \( apr 9 2007 \) and i simply could not live without this item my daughter loves sleeping in it it is light therefore it can be easily moved from one room to another as needed you could easily travel with it from hotels to the grandparents house it can be folded compactly and easily stored and there is also a handle for carrying the light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co sleep as well obviously do not leave your child unsupervised in it ! it is excellent and i highly recommend it to all parents	12
0	we were downstairs one night watching tv and kept hearing crickets turns out her bedroom window was open and we were hearing the crickets through the baby monitor this thing is so good i can hear crickets in the backyard from one story up there is no doubt i can hear anything my daughter needs i can tell from her cry through the monitor whether i need to prep or bottle get a diaper ready or its time for play	12
0	our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old my husband enjoyed them more at first but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these ! he probably could n't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier at 10 months he still enjoys playing with them they have lasted through both children i would highly recommend these blocks for infants and so far even into the toddler age he enjoys playing with them	12
0	it 's so difficult to carry a huge diaper bag while having your baby in a carrier this product solves that problem ! and it 's cute too i was shopping at babys 'r' us recently and the sales girl asked where i got my super cute diaper bag carrier i told her and she insisted to her manager that the store start carrying the item \( no word yet on whether or not they will \) i have recommended this bag to all my friends and bought two as shower gifts it 's the ultimate in convenience and fashion	12
1	i ca n't get it to stick ! i might be able to get one or two of the cups to hold but as soon as i put toys in it it falls	12
0	this is the greatest product they stick to every restaurant table i have ever secured them to are lightweight easy to pack and fun for my daughter to look at every time i pull one out of the diaper bag she says elmo elmo elmo they keep the germs away from her and the clean up is so simple i would n't do without them they are great	12
0	i think this product is fantastic the adjustable volume works well and the sounds are very soothing the timer is also a nice feature this is a great present for anyone in your life that is having a baby the sheep is cute and surprisingly cuddly in spite of the digital box in it 's tummy	12
0	we have 3 of them and have no complaints i keep one in my car one in my husbands and have another for travel it 's super easy to snap the carrier onto it and very easy to install in any car i just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars i could use the latch or just use the seatbelt for older cars i was worried that i would need my husband 's help with the installation but i was fine on my own just reading the directions i recommend this for everyone	12
1	first of all the diapers get stuck in the lid and then the room starts to smell like baby poop yes you can use reg bags for it the only about it first day after changing the bag it smells ok but buy the 2nd wow it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable	12
0	i am very pleased with this product it arrived quickly same as pictured keeps baby in place insuring a goodnights sleep im glad the headrest was not elevated elevated positioners make baby sink into bedding and could cause suffication again im pleased would purchase for any future children i might have	12
0	i have a 10 month old baby and i have tried every bottle i used the avent with my 1st baby these bottles are the best ! why \? because they do not leak no bubbles and the design is fabulous once the baby holds it her himself the angles top is great for little or no air in baby's tummy the little rubber seal disk you put in the bottom is a cinch ! do n't wast time or money on any other bottle	12
1	well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem cause i mean when you buy it you already know that ! lolmy daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not every time i would put it on her she would scream and beg me not to put it on it was really heartbreaking on the plus side this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me lolwe used it a couple of time and put it aside she really hated it and i felt that it caused more tention than it is worth	12
0	heats milk and food esecially when frozen i use a clean baby food jar to heat frozen baby food i 've made	12
1	too big and bulky to sit easily on top of the canopy it may be my stroller \( maclaren quest \) that it the issue but i wish i never bought this product my baby hates it too because she ca n't see where we 're walking to	12
0	if you are going to get a manual pump get this one i got a medela from the hospital and it was sooo slow and killed my hand but this one is way better it takes 5 10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the medela and it does n't hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals and because you use it for less time total i have never used an electric pump so i ca n't compare it to one of those but as far as manuals go this one is awesome	12
0	there are a few things that i liked about my simple round about better such as the latch system is more difficult in the decathalon overall though very impressive car seat safety system the fabric for the cover is wonderful and plush and stylish i always feel safe when my little ones are in a britax well worth what may seem like an exorbitant amount of money you cannot put a price on the safety of your child	12
0	this is a great light shines stars all over the room constellations are n't quite right but they 're close the different color options are great for the price it 's a great deal	12
1	i thought that this bathtub would be the best thing because of the shower and spa feature but the shower is so hard to use it 's so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time you also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling beacause it 's just not positiioned right it sits too high up and she just looks uncomfortable on it you also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit it was n't worth 40 the sling and the spa and shower unit is n't useful or helpfula t all	12
1	loved the car seat until my daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps i would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat that is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat	12
1	i bought the baby einstein sea crib toy based on its look i brought it home put batteries in it and it worked for 5 minutes before it quit playing sounds i was also disappointed that the ocean sound only played for a few seconds i had thought it would play for 12 minutes like the music i took it back and purchased the fisher price aquarium and it is great it plays every sound for 10 minutes and seems more durable	12
1	i would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks the walker seemed great for the price it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it unfortunately the design is terrible on the sounds n'lights feature it began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it after much frustration trying to get to the battery compartment to replace it we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all the internal battery is soldered in place once it loses it 's original charge you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby	12
1	i bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier this bag was ok to start and fit my britax \( a feat in itself \) but 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it broke i would not buy it i emailed the company and have yet to hear back	12
0	our 21 month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it ! it does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys the sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or i need to use our regular tub	12
0	unfortunately the baby i bought this for already had one ! but i got to see it in action and listen to the parents rave about it ! it is really neat almsot to the point i wish i had kept it for myself ! !	12
0	i originally bought this bag for a trip to disney world it held everything great stayed in place and was less cumbersome than a full backpack although i was not using it to carry children 's gear i carried an umbrella 3 bottles of water granola bars sun glasses cellphone keys wallet a baseball hat and small souvenirs and it always stayed put and fit great ! i am looking forward to using the bag as a diaper bag it has held up wonderfully as a vacation bag so far	12
1	i agree with several others about it being very difficult to clean there are so many nooks and crannies i used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when i had my son and it was no different my son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that i do not want to let him practice because i dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal i went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great ! now i have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair	12
0	my son loves this toy although i think the version we have is an older version as it is a different color he is 10 5 months old and gets really excited when he sees this toy a good buy and will keep them busy	12
0	i loved this ! he was always right next to me but in a safe and separate space it folds up smaller than a pack and play takes up very little room next to the bed and has a netted tent cover for the summer to protect from mosquitos \( or your cat who is dying to sleep with the baby	12
1	we were so excited to try a jumper for our son but were very dissapointed in this product first of all he tipped himself right out of it ! with the three strap design it 's unsturdy in the back which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor he seemed pretty intent on jumping so now we 've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he 's nice and snug but it 's still unstable and wobbly i do n't recommend this product and in fact we are going to try a different brand	12
0	i heard about these blankets from a co worker and had to order the mommie blanket for me and the pink baby blanket for my daughter they are the softest blankets i 've ever felt there 's a reason this company 's name is cloudb ! the only reason i gave this blanket 4 stars is because of the quality of the sewing the mommie velboa blanket arrived with lots of loose threads hanging off the edges not a big deal i just snipped them with a scissors but still disappointing to get such a beautiful blanket but have it look a little unfinished	12
1	the monitor was terrible ! it would only pick up our baby 's voice when she was screaming it had a metallic sound to it and the different volume settings did not seem to make any difference it is going back to the store and i am looking for something else i wish i would have checked ratings first ! choose something else	12
0	this item is worth more than the cost it is a most have at home with a new born baby expecially 1st time parent like me i can get to do other things once my baby is asleep and i can even hear my baby 's heart beat when am somewhere else in the house worth more than trhe cos	12
0	having only used it once as my baby is just now able to eat table foods when we go out to eat it worked wonderful having a clean place to put her food on was nice as you never know just how clean the tables really are	12
0	i agree with the above reviewers this rug is large and very well made perfect in any little girl 's room	12
0	this baby gate is ideal for the size and price i had shopped tons of stores and websites before i had found this gate the hardware mount eye hooks are not the sturdiest but this gate definately gets the job done	12
0	this is a thin sheet but it fits my full size pack n play bassinet perfectly i would recommend getting 2 of them because my son wets through it often	12
1	this carrier did n't survive one airline trip the bag was ripped and the wheels torn off upon our 1st trip this carrier is junk waste of my money	12
0	i'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about the product installs on the bowl and secures the lid and toilet seat it 's easy to install and works great	12
0	i shopped around for a cabana to take to the beach for my sons first visit i found this one and let me tell you it was perfect ! it was so easy to set up and take down and it was sturdy enough to stand up to the high beach winds i saw a lot of other tents cabanas on the beach and this one by far was the best both price and durability wise excellent find and buy	12
1	i had a few of these covers in lilac and sage and i cant use any of them anymore they all shrank so much when washed that they wont even stay on the contoured pad i am now using a white cover from especially for baby which fits and washes great unfortunately dirt shows and it stains easily and they only have white blue and yellow and my daughters room is purple pink green and white	12
1	i got two of these as shower gifts i thought that they would be so handy wrong ! the velcro kept slipping and sounded as if it would fall off of the changing table the openings that are shown holding the powder and lotion are very small they will only hold the travel size or the next size up it was made cheep the quot shelves quot are not sturdy at all save your money !	12
1	after seeing the latest consumer reports article on infant car seats i immediately replaced my britax companion with a graco snugfit the britax had previously been highly rated but the latest test trashed it we were surprised becuase it is the first seat we have owned \( on our 3rd kid \) that really was rock solid snug once installed i bought a graco snugfit and i have nothing good to say about it no matter how tight i got the straps attached to the latch in my 2006 honda odyssey i could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort for now i'm sticking with the britax	12
0	the only reason it is not a 5 is because they leave my nipples linty otherwise they work really good tara boyc	12
1	this product is nice at first but you 'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you do n't have to put anymore holes in your home i 've bought 5 of them over 4 years we have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking do not buy buy something better and higher quality so that you wo n't have to replace in 6 months please listen to this review it will save you	12
1	i bought this product for my 3yr old at first i thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times at first she did n't want to sit on it again amp she cried when i took her to the bathroom but i told her i would sit her on it amp i would lift her off since i have been doing this she has n't been pinched but it took me a while for her to trust me if you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched	12
0	i love this simply designed sturdy potty my son loves it which is most important he has no trouble sitting down on it no pinching no crampedness no tipping over the well sized arm rests help him up down the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over ! having only 2 pieces no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on read books ! great product great price i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother 's	12
1	alas we have the entire locomotion set but the cute little mobile wo n't fit our sleigh style crib i called babies r us to see about some sort of conversion kit but there 's no such thing i 'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead	12
1	did not work at all ! had to return it ! we prefer the tinkle toons potty with a moisture sensor the motion sensor on the royal potty did not work	12
0	this item is a great idea for people on the go like me it has removable slots so that you can place a larger bowl in it plus your baby food jar	12
0	we 've used this since our baby was born three months ago it has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own it has two small external pockets for extra bottles and a large inside pouch where we keep most of the diapers and larger gear \( as well as inside compartments \) it also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use the bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but i have seen it used on older children we 'll be getting these as gifts for our friends who are expecting	12
0	i bought this pump when i was going to a concert and knew i would need to pump while i was out to avoid discomfort and leakage this pump fit in my purse and was easy to use i just slipped out into the bathroom and pumped it was silent and no one even knew	12
0	our grandson reciently came to live with us nearly 2 years old and he refused to even sit on a potty the day our 1st pott arrived i opened the package and set the potty up in our bathroom next to the adult version hopeing this location would help about 15 minutes later i noticed drake had been very quiet as i searched the house for him i discovered him not only sitting on the pot but he had actually used it ! he is now doing very well with his training ! the product is well constructed easy to to set up and easy to use	12
0	i bought the 100 pack thinking it was all the ultra thin kind which i love come to find out only 60 of them are ultra thin some of the women on here complain about having to change their pads often you really are supposed to do that because otherwise you will get an breast infection especially if you live in the south where it 's warm and humid i recommend the ultra thin pads the other ones that come in the variety pack are just ok	12
1	i really was disappointed with this product our tub has rounded corners and tile above and the cubby wont stick to tile	12
1	it worked great for a few days then as i got to the bottom of the batch of wipes they were totally dry also the whole thing flooded my changing table not sure why but i am returning this unit	12
0	my son is just so excited about his sponge bob bed he climbs in and out every second thus showing how much he likes it i like it because it is low and no accidental falling off and hurting himself	12
1	the size stated 3 6 months the baby was 2 months old and the hat was too small anyone ordering should consider it runs very small then because i used my credit card to purchase it i was unable to return it and get a refund	12
0	i love this item it has soothing music sounds and animation easy operation baby loves it too arrived quickly and well packaged instructions on manufacturers box thanks fisher pric	12
1	do n't buy this sheet ! ! it is not much thicker than a piece of tissue paper ! spit up would go right through it i have a much better solution for you buy a couple of sheet savers to use in your pack n play they are a couple of less and are sold as especially for baby \( which is b r us house brand \) they are great i use them for both my son 's crib and for the pack n play they come in a number of colors so you should be able to match them to just about any pattern	12
1	an ok gadget but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well it does not have an automatic shut off so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this	12
1	i bought this stroller for when we had our second child my children are 19 mo apart i had the aria single stroller for my first and loved it this one is definitely not the same for one thing it is very hard to steer and get over bumps the wheels are always getting stuck second it is hard to close the most frustrating part is the steering issue also my aria decal fell off as well many months ago i 've only had the stroller for nine months one more thing the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun	12
0	i got this as a gift on my baby shower was so happy to receive it ! this playpen is so wonderful very colorful sooo easy to set it up i'm pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it i received great reviews on this gear also so do n't be dissapointed to grab one like it ! ! ! awesome playpen ! !	12
0	i did plenty of research for a car seat for my firstborn and the snugfit got the best safety reviews and we just loved the pring perfect for a boy or a girl i had heard how hard car seats were to install in the car but it was a breeze i had it installed in the backseat within five minutes my car has the latch system and it has worked great my daughter loves being in her car seat and i have always felt perfectly safe with her in it i was surprised to read the other reviews since i have never experienced a single one of those issues with my car seat i would highly recommend this seat to any parent	12
1	i recently purchased this gate as i needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide i was so happy when i found this and for the price ! well i installed it with no problem at all but it is not secure it actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break awful and very unsafe ! ! ! target com was very helpful in sending ups to pick it up	12
1	after only 2 months this toy fell apart my daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail 's threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams 20 is not cheap for this toy and i think the quality should have been alot better	12
1	my husband and i purchased this set with my first son but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son the difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks sometimes more than that it is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling i hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings	12
0	this stuff works wonders for my son 's sensitive bum and fast ! we usually see results in just one application usually by the next changing the irritaion is gone or nearly so it also has a very natural herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams it may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison but i 've found that i do n't need to use as much which makes that argument mute	12
1	why bother with a boppy cover when it does nothing to protect the boppy from spit ups and poop accidents \? it 's not practical to throw the boppy in the was each time this happens i can only imagine how stinky this boppy will soon get	12
0	the booster works great does not slip on a chair and is easy for my 2 year old to move around on her own i highly recommend this product	12
1	i inherited this product from my neightbor last week i have attempted to wash and clean it thoroughly before using it i cannot get the seat apart and it is incredibly dirty and moldy inbetween the seat and the swivel part other reviewers have noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried to take it apart i would love to try this product but as long as it is dirty and cannot be cleaned properly it will not be used what a shame baby products should be made so that they clean up easily	12
1	the suction on these bowls is so weak that the baby pulled it off the highchair and dumped the contents in a few seconds flat they do come in lovely colors though	12
1	we bought this item because we could not find what we were looking for anywhere else we had it about 3 weeks and the piece that holds the nipples caps broke off and now everytime we go to set bottles on it we have to attach it back on not very durable	12
0	i ordered this shade hoping that it would cover all of my baby when we 're out strolling in the sun it does a pretty good job only my son 's feet and ankles are exposed when he is reclined \( my only beef about the product \) but i can cover his little piggies and ankles with sunscreen or shoes with no problem i like the fact that the shade protects from uv rays and is easily adjustable i leave it on my stroller all the time and can still fold up the stroller with it attached i think the side pouches are an excellent plus i am very pleased with this product and will recommend it to my friends and family	12
0	we purchased this because my newborn was having trouble sleeping she always woke up congested and strangled since we started using the wedge she has n't had any problems at all she is 5 months old now	12
0	the floppy seat is a great item no more worrying about baby 's hands and mouth touching filthy shopping carts and restaurant highchairs i recommend this to all new moms and give it an a	12
1	we are training and really were looking for a useful aid it did n't work for us allowing the entire car seat and straps to become saturated we will continue to use it with our younger child in hopes of avoiding a diaper leak through accident	12
0	its a little hard to adjust but its definitely worth it we 've used it on our double jogging stroller as well as our double umbrella stroller folds away easily and does n't take up a lot of space i also love the pockets on the sides where i can store my keys phone water bottle etc	12
1	this machine is not loud enough i have 2 machines this one that is in the babies room and a different machine \( made by lifewise \) in my boys room my boys sleep through anything the dog the door bell whatever it is but this machine just does n't cut it unless you live in a sound proof house	12
0	my wife and i bought this item for the usual reasons we washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding they 're just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them if not a little softer for the record we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes they went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting anyway i'm just writing the review to offset the bad review there was nothing wrong with the pads that we received and they do what they 're supposed to do get between the warm baby and the cold changing table	12
0	this boppy slipcover is super soft and wears well we 've washed it in the washing machine several times and it 's very durable if you 're looking for a soft simple durable boppy slipcover i 'd highly recommend this one	12
0	i love this blanket so much let me count the ways \( 1 \) certified organic \( so hard to find \) \( 2 \) large enough for a good tight swaddle \( for a good night sleep \) \( 3 \) darling drawing showing how to swaddle baby sewn to blanket \( even my husband can now swaddle like a nurse \) \( 4 \) soft soft and softer with every wash ! i just love this blanket and i feel so good wrapping my little bundle in the ultimate and i know he loves it too	12
1	with the rear facing infant seat in the recommended middle seat of our sedan this mirror limits driver visability when the mirror is positioned so the driver can see the baby in the rearview mirror a large section of the back windshield is blocked i'm glad we kept the box so we can exchange it for a different mirror	12
1	i thought i 'd try this monitor since it was a 900mhz and had a far range well i have problems similar to sara 's when i used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps i would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used when there was no beeping or loss of signal it 's reception was clear that 's why i gave it a 2nd star this product is going back to the store tomorrow and i will continue my quest to search for the right monitor	12
0	i am a mother of 6 and this works you can put a few baby neccessities in it i use it for a few diapers baby wipes desitin and the bulb syringe i can move it around and it does not take much space	12
1	okay maybe i should have read the laundering instructions which say to machine wash and then drip dry but who makes baby items that ca n't be machine dried \? how many parents have the time to line dry delicates \? the upshot is that this fell apart melted in the dryer and got fluff all over everywhere the first time we ever washed it if you need something you can throw in the washer dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting this is not your product grrr	12
0	i like this because it is a nice construction i bought the white and it blends in nicely i just wish it was a little higher we have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now	12
0	i love it ! this is probably one of my most used baby items it is so handy to use while we are out and so easy to clean i 've bought this as a shower gift for several of my pregnant friends	12
0	i have been using two gates for the last year to keep my 2 year old off of the stairs the gates are attached to the walls i have not had any problems with the either gate for those of you searching for a gate for a dog the gate works will with by 70 pound boxer	12
0	i had checked out booster seats on the internet and in stores and this was by far the least expensive it 's a bargain well made and easy to use my grandkids seem to like it better than a high chair the seat arrived minus the safety straps used to attach it to a chair when i wrote customer service about the problem they sent a whole new booster seat	12
1	this is by far the worst sling i have ever tried ! the padding is bulky and hot it is impossible to adjust total waste of money i bought a pouch from www equanimitybaby com and it was perfect ! easy to use and very comfy the bottom line is there are many other options out here besides this peice of junk if you ca n't use this sling its not you its the sling	12
1	this monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it also it beeps out of range even when at distances much less than the stated 800 feet \( from our daughter 's bedroom to the kitchen \) i would definitely not recommend this product and had i not lost the receipt i would have returned it	12
1	i received this after much debate about the prior review had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer so i bought it and sure enough had the same problem amazon was great they sent me a replacement and still the same problem my baby is due any day so i am keeping the first one but sending back the replacement it doesnt come as described no blanket included and i dont see how you could adjust the wedge i am very disappointed with the product but happy about amazon 's willingness to assist in the issue	12
1	i waited months for this game to come out i ca n't add anymore than what has been said by others i wonder how hands on sid was with it could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out if ever	13
0	i have been a fan of this game ever since playing against my buddy on my vacation in colorado last year whether you 're interested in pure speed and competative racing or taking your opponents out in road rage it 's all fun ! in addition you can just cause unbelievable mayhem with crash mode where the whole object is to cause as much destruction as possible this game lasts a long time so you have a lot to do it never gets boring i mean there are like 50 cars and trucks waiting for you if you can win them	13
0	this mic is very durable and is wired good have n't had any problems and is much better than the headset	13
1	do n't buy this it will crash your entire xbox learn to play forget the cheats	13
0	no way should children be playing this game it is for mature players as the subject matter could confuse younger players the goals of harming people picking up hookers breaking the law can be a blast as long as everyone knows it 's just a fantasy many people go into the details so i 'll make this short have a good time while pretending to be a bad guy who does unforgivable acts but there 's no way i would consider this game for anyone under 15 and then i would have to know that the teen can handle the fantasy	13
0	this game was a lot of fun the microphone headset works great the only downside is i wish it had more songs but i guess that is what sequals are for overall a good product fun to play with friends or family or even by yourself	13
0	the introduction isn't boring it isn't long and it is one of the best introductions to a game made by enix se if you do n't like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111 ! ! ! 1 then do n't buy another rpg for as long as you live rpgs are supposed to have stories and this one is no different if you do n't like it take it back and get a refund do n't play rpg 's like this if you ca n't stand words go play some gta or something oh wait theres words in that too	13
0	nothing bad to mention it this control is the original works very well good price	13
0	i 'll admit i was a little skeptical about this game as it turns out this game rocks ! arena football fans do not pass this one up ! hopefully when they make the sequel \( yeah i said sequel \) they will include the new afl2 teams tennessee valley vipers rule	13
0	with nintendo riding very high on the handheld gaming market with the game boy advance they 've also shown their stuff with the success of the nintendo ds as well and a newer recently redesigned version of the ds called the ds lite these stylus pens are specifically for the nintendo ds lite only and work very well for all gamers they are simple to control and play around with for games like magnetica new super mario bros tetris ds and many others the control of these pens are easy to use and handle for all gamers this is a absolute must for ds lite owners price aconvience aoverall	13
0	the memory cards came exactly as advertised and they worked great no read errors very noticeable increased speed of load time compared to other card types would recommend to anyone looking for a value pack of memory cards because this was well worth it	13
0	wow that 's all i can say all the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this 'game' just got it a few days ago and am so impressed with all that 's packed into it ! ! ! it also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises this is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen people of all fitness levels can enjoy this this technology \( interactive virtual trainers serious home workouts \) has got to be the wave of the future ! !	13
0	these are the best memory cards you can get for the ps2 only get this one or the sony playstation 2 1pk memory card rumors spread that non sony memory cards can damage your ps2 and lose saves on you memory cards	13
0	i do not own the headset yet but i have already ordered it from amazon and it is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit so i will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes my impression is that it will be a very good product because it is logitech and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make and it is fablous the price \? great price i got mine for somthing like 25 \( buy from abuy4u \) but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset yes 6 hours can last me a weekend	13
0	for the price is a good deal i only use one card i have the other one for backup nice product good pric	13
1	i bought this from best buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my xbox360 a longer life and keep it 's insides cool when i plugged it in my xbox360 did n't turn on at all after trying it several times i took it off and plugged in the ac adapter back on to my xbox for a while the xbx would n't turn on i thought it was broken i gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that intercooler nearly broke my xbox don t buy it	13
0	my son has had many happy hours with this game it came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy	13
1	seems like they just huried this game too much running around to get answers the phone did not even have web acsess actually i did not like it at all	13
0	my kids really like the memory cards because they can keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it	13
1	people i do n't know what you see in this game it 's not really a bad game it 's just an average arcade shooter more often than not i ca n't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly i pop out from behind something and i'm dead meat pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good time crisis game	13
0	this is the kit not just a card a previous review indicated that bestbuy com was selling this for 49 99 that is not correct they are selling the card for 49 99 this kit comes with the card plus several other components thus making it 20 more you may find this kit cheaper elsewhere but not significantly it does what it intends to do	13
0	my son loves this game ! we rented it first from blockbuster and now he wo n't let us take it back so i ordered it from amazon com so i can take the game back soon to blockbuster ! i have to help him through some of the areas like when the penguin is fishing but i do n't mind because it 's fun	13
1	we recommend not buying this game unless you do n't mind a buggy version that is not supported by hasbro and ca n't be fixed hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available save your money and wait for the next one hopefully bug free	13
0	i 've read in some other websites that this are gonna be compatible with the ps3 since the ps3 originally only comes with the traditional wires \( av cables \) im wondering if this cables can deliver an hd signal \( hd pic quality \) or im just gonna have to spend some extra bucks in the hdmi cable since i alredy have this component ones	13
1	i hate this game its the worst game i 've ever played	13
0	at first playing a star wars game made me feel very nerdy but let me tell you if this is what nerdy is then it rocks ! ! ! ! ! this game is incredible ! ! ! it is very very fun basically you choose what side you want and destroy the other what with gaining the several checkpoints that are throughout it buy this game and put your blasters on full	13
0	this is a really nice remake of a great classic \( ffiv \) they improved the dialogue and added in a lot of great items the challenge level however was bumped up significantly the game was originally paced so you did n't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up a few of the bosses surprised me this time through \( i 've played the snes version multiple times in my day \) the story is unchanged however a must have for any ff classic rpg fan ! as a bonus i finally got to play chrono trigger	13
0	will you people stop wining about witch is better the psp and the ds both have ups and downs they are just as good they just have differnt prices trust me i own both	13
1	why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can \? these memory cards are way over priced i love ps2 it 's one of the best systems i have ever played and owned but this memory card stuff is a scam i already own 2 cards and i need more	13
1	this is without a doubt the worste game i have ever purchased it is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat they could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from as it is right now it 's just a really really really crappy version of zelda orcarina of time if you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it	13
0	i used a linksys media center extender to play and view my music and picture collection through my home theater this product completley replaced the need for the extender was extremely easy to setup \( wep enabled \) and works flawlessly i do not find it overpriced at all given the capabilities for games and interacting with a media center pc the music streaming is every bit as good setup was as simple as plugging in the adapter and entering the security code well done microsoft ! tom las vega	13
0	if you enjoy the series you will love the game as simple as that very entertaining do n't miss it	13
0	when i heard that square was going to remake final fantasy iv \( originally final fantasy ii in the u s \) i was very excited this game is considered to be one of the greatest final fantasy games of all time all in all i would recomend this game to anyone who is a final fantasy fan	13

1	ok most people have more then one system i have a ps2 which plays copies and the 360 hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the 360 version \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? or should i go for the free copy i can download for the ps2 \? some people might say better graphics hmmmmmmmmmm dont care and many don	13
1	now before you say anything i have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster \( grudgingly playing it though \) and now for the unbaiased opinion i think that this game is so completely stupid it and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion	13
0	this game is truly worth the wait it really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting the gameplay is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the gta games this is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome this probally the funnest open world game i have ever played to drive in the cars handle great and are a blast to drive the graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome this is a must get game	13
1	ok let me break itdown for you the game is n't all thatb great infact it sucks on ice but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year really you really ca n't blame them that made this game the fact is 2006 is one of the worst years there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great we see about 90 of games and movies arent doing that good so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the ps3 and the wii comes out i promise you that year want disoponte so dont buy every thing in 06 wait till 07 dont waiste your mone	13
0	whatever product sony brings to the market you can always be sure that you are buying a top quality product and these sony memory card for ps2 is just the perfect exampl	13
0	you can go wrong very good equiment lots of fun easy to carry the console with most games plus has a great pric	13
0	i dont know what everyone else 's reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome ! the graphics are out of this world and its very suspenseful there 's a murder or dead body around every corner and you get to firgure out who did it ! the ending was the best it took me and my brother at least 24 hours \( not all at once of course \) to solve this mystery it 's a really great buy ! andre	13
1	not as much fun as i remember maybe better if they had a better selection of games \( one on one hardball etc	13
0	the incredibles is a fun 1 player game that puts you in the role of being the incredibles even though it is short pros amazing characters great graphics intresting plot footage from the movie can be accessed through the game as well as artworkcons short only 1 playeroverallif you loved the incredibles on the big screen you will like the game as well the same plot and characters and great visuals are there but much it is not very lengthy	13
0	this mic is very durable and is wired good have n't had any problems and is much better than the headset	13
0	spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played it was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating there are alot of xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old this game was not meant for an adult gaming audience i was surprised when i realized this game is no longer in production there should be more games for the 5 10 age bracket my son loves this game he literally wore it out i have to find him another copy of hero 's tail to replace his old one	13
0	unfortunately xenosaga i der wille zur macht is never come to europe but as the second xenosaga \( jenseits von gut und b se \) was released in germany in november i was very happy so i played it and was impressed of this cool story and gameplay ! i became a big xenosaga fan after that i imported the first part of the series from america now i am playing it and i must say that the first xenosaga is much better than the second ! ! ! ! it 's a great pity that xenosaga episode i never will be brought out in germany and europa ! ! you americans should be very happy that so many rpgs come to your country	13
0	this is a well done game especially if you liked the movie characters voices and behavior are consistent with the movie and there 's a cute storyline to the game there are a number of stages that you follow in order completing one to move to the next there 's a pretty small age window that its good for i 'd say about 6 to 10 under 6 the stages are too hard over 10 they 're sort of easy and not that engaging you can fly thru pretty quickly it would be a bit better if you could jump around and play the games that you enjoy instead of having to go sequentially but it 's still well done and worth buying	13
0	i would be 5 on this one all the way because i enjoyed the game immensly \( the general idea of the game \) but because of personal preference i stopped playing it because of excessive gore sexual debasing themes and leud art if you like this game but do n't want all the questionable material \( yes i know that it 's nothing compared to other games \) then may i recommend fate by wildtangen	13
1	i bought this from best buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my xbox360 a longer life and keep it 's insides cool when i plugged it in my xbox360 did n't turn on at all after trying it several times i took it off and plugged in the ac adapter back on to my xbox for a while the xbx would n't turn on i thought it was broken i gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that intercooler nearly broke my xbox don t buy it	13
0	this is a vary good game one of the best on the ps2 these are my top ten favorite fighters1 \) asuka kazama2 \) christie monteior3 \) ling xiaoyu4 \) kazuya mishima5 \) jin kazama6 \) king7 \) eddy gordo8 \) nina williams9 \) anna williams10 \) devil jinthe only bad thing is jinpachi mishima cant be unlocked which sucks the devilwithin mini game is ok arcade is ranked overall the games is awsome and addicting you 'll be playing for hours on end later	13
1	if you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360 this will do but it wo n't operate a dvr dvd vcr or cable box if you 're really keen on it i 'll sell you mine	13
1	i have a pretty decent computer \( athlon64 3000 radeon x550 \) but this game does not work at all even after i download and install the patch from aspyr \( though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box \) spellforce exe just sits there and sucks up 99 of the cpu until i kill the process aspyr support is unable to help that said despite other reviews here this game does not install starforce but maybe that 's why my version wo n't work	13
0	i 've got to be honest this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games i 've bought not that they were bad though the funny thing about these kind of games \( so long as you 're using a light gun \) is that they improve your accuracy with firearms it 's no substitute for real shooting but then again how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games \? now on the game itself the graphics are good enough but the arcade style makes it look well not real but then again that is part of what gives the game it 's charm buy the game and a light gun	13
0	just great all around nice work from microsoft and their newly launched marketplace will really put the push on the other manufacturers xbox live really is a great gaming experience	13
1	you get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot with all of the free stuff out there to download for the sims the stuff pack is not very worth it maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny	13
1	this game was originally released for 10 dollars almost everything about it is pulled straight from diablo and is not quite as good though this game has a few things about it that are interesting and can be enjoyable to some people i would just skip this game and go for diablo 2	13
1	i hate this game its the worst game i 've ever played	13
0	i bought a nintendo ds so i can play super mario brothers for ever like i was when i was a kid its amazing that they brought the villans back from the first 3 marios when we were younger my 4 5 year old cousin even was hooked on it and i had to buy him a ds along with mario so he could play it after i left to go back home	13
1	the games faults have been well covered already so i 'll just say if a roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for ceasar iv afer playing the demo i can say that this will be a far superior game than civcity on every level it seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably	13
0	i guess this is a good buy especially when corporate vice president and chief xna architect of microsoft says so i just thought it was interesting when j allard gave a review of this product on amazon co	13
1	i waited months for this game to come out i ca n't add anymore than what has been said by others i wonder how hands on sid was with it could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out if ever	13
1	i brought this after having played caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city and i thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension wrong this is a bad rip off of caesar3 sure graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that i was playing the same game but with less involvement or control this is a sit back and let it happen to you game keep the people happy and build everything and they 'll stay caesar iv that 's what you 're wanting it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it is n't feel like i 've wasted my money	13
1	the gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un fun ! the kids did n't even like it run do n't walk away from this dentist office of a game jaws cr p \( jaws just another w smith	13
0	i ordered this for my sson because we could not find it in the store little did i know that i actually saved a lot of money by ordering it here he loves it ! he actually thinks it is good exercise for him as well ! it was easy enough for my 10 year old to figure out how to hook up and operate completely on his own we are very pleased with this purchase	13
1	first of all it 's sad that someone would put out a product \( the 360 \) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself unless you spend another 10 of the product cost on a little series of fans second i attached this i plugged it in it would n't even turn on waste of money do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open uncluttered unblocked area if you absolutely must provide additional airflow just point a 10 clip on fan at it	13
0	i love playing this game the icewind dale ii is 3rd edition rules and the graphics are great	13
1	i played this game until chapter 23 all the dancing levels were very hard to beat ! i think this game is not worth buying rent it	13
0	book fans do n't listen to dude supy because he most likely has n't read the books this game is very fun but does n't last very long at all if you like the books you should rent it you probably wo n't want to buy it though i rented it yesterday and beat it today very fun but not for long	13
0	this game is fun to play but not the greatest game either of course the movie is way better than the game the game is pretty easy and is short considering there are 18 levels the storyline in the beginning could have been alittle better as well some of the missions are pretty hard but after you pass the tough ones it just gets easy again all in all it 's a good game i would recommend it the graphics are good i do like how they put some storyline in from the movie it 's not to bad of a game to play	13
1	i am extreamly dissapointd with this game every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location there is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which i was able to do in 3 sittings	13
0	quick delivery product arrived on time and in excellent condition you have quality shipping thank yo	13
0	my daughter got the eye toy for her birthday and we recently added the dance groove game to the collection she and her friends \( 10 yrs of age \) really enjoy it as do some of the younger kids she says her only complaint is that the most difficult skill level is nearly impossible to master so they improvise which is pretty easy to do if you stand really close to the camera	13
0	excellente juego es una verdadera simulacion de manejo los graficos son de lo mejor y las pistas parecen reales es un juego al que hay que dedicarle muchas horas si se quiere avanzar	13
1	we recommend not buying this game unless you do n't mind a buggy version that is not supported by hasbro and ca n't be fixed hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available save your money and wait for the next one hopefully bug free	13
0	this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2 the warriors bully and the world famous gta \( grand theft auto \) seriesgraphics 9 10sound 8 10gameplay 7 5 10overall 8 3who ever does'nt have it get it is the best western game ever	13
0	this doesnt come with the communicator part that goes in the controller this is just the headset and it sucks you 'd be better off buying one of the cheap ones with the headset that wraps around your head this one always falls out of my ear in my opinion a waste of 25 bucks chris	13
0	i have had this unit for almost 6 months and love it halo 2 is awsome as are other shooters they can keep the new generation of others xbox had it right on this one and its perfect	13
0	this game is hard but very fun so if you want to pick between fantastic four or some other comic book game just get the hulk and if you do collect your patience because this game will hand it to you	13
1	all of the people that gave this game a review of more than two stars are bs ing you those people are probably hardcore ff7 fans that game was barely mediocre at best other ff7 releases advent children cell phone game and movie tv show thing all three things resectively sucked now comes dierge of cerberus whoop did eeee doo ! ! the only reason why i rented it was because the title says final fantasy in it the only redeeming quality of this game is the cutscenes other than that boring if you can get more than 20 minutes through the game then by all means it 's the game for you	13
0	this is a very interesting game lots of places to explore game play is pretty smooth sometimes a rapid fire button will help you a lot the game is very bookish with no cut scenes from the movie it can be fairly complicated at times with some strange moves to master like flying shoes and umbrellas it 's a fun game with good graphics	13
0	expensive but worth it it just works no more wires	13
0	the wavebird can really take a beating there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine plus the game that ip lay all the time is super smash bros melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing i also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird after 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this but overall its a great controlle	13
0	the best set of wireless controllers i have purchased for my xbox system the controllers are nicely fitted for comfortable use and does not cramp up your hands after hours of play connects great and no interruptions while game playing i highly recommend these to anyone that is looking to buy controllers out there they are awesome looking great for playing halo 2 i use it alot with this game and it is the bomb plus my ranking has gone up since using it while playing on xbox live	13
0	great shooter game great graphics 100 ship variation this game is five dollars at toys r us	13
0	i had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card	13
1	bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but i was very dissapointed with it clunky control system really put me off	13
0	if you liked vice city you 'll love san andreas with more missions car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over what could be better \? the games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while however the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash as a note i had no problems running this game with pretty much all options on high i run a dell 8300 3 0 ht 1 gb ram radeon 9700 pro and it flies ! strap up and get ready to defend your 'hood	13
0	when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games i new i wanted it my littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible i ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun i lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on	13
1	the overall impression is that of a game made on the rush assuming the good alignment you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy 's platoons sent by a very unintelligent ai since winning requires no strategy the game is challenging you can do basically the same on all levels the races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their skins and the building 's aspect defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay unlike the previous version of b w there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features cinematics and creature apart it looks like a very primitive first version of age of empires	13
0	bought this as a gift for my granson it is awesome many games to pick from and the ease of use is great he 's only five and works the buttons with ease plus you can take it anywhere great price here too cheaper than anyone else	13
0	ok first of all i think these are too expensive if i was smart i would buy the 2 pack and save money but i keep forgetting ive never had any problems with these so yeah there ya go buy these if you have a ps2 but buy the 2 pack and save some money	13
0	there is only one thing that any self respecting geek loves more than dungeons and dragons and that is star wars this game is the marriage of those two wonderful geeky things it is a flawless game	13
0	this games story takes place before gta 3 so it 's sort of like a prequal set in liberty city compared to the original it looks a lot better plus they added bikes and motor cycles and attempted to improve the targeting by using the targeting system from san andreas i hate the targeting but being able target manually is a good thing if you do n't own a psp i 'd suggest getting this game but if you do and played it on that system there really is n't any point to buying this game unless you really really love gta	13
0	after my little brother lost my original copy i had to buy a new one and i am so glad i did i love the game and it was so much fun to play like all final fantasy game the graphics were amazing as was the gameplay	13
0	i find this game to be very indepth when it comes to the ability to change formations and plays just by what you see however my major disappointment comes from the graphics i understand the ps2 does n't not have the standards of the xbox360 but this was false advertising showing this very detailed game and not showing which system this ran for i just hope when the ps3 comes out madden will rerelease the game for it to give the xbox360 owners something to whine about ea should be more infomational in giving what things look like to the consumer rather then just showing the best picture they have	13
1	i really liked the first two jak games so i was excited to try jak 3 whoa major mistake this game is nothing more than a lame racing wannabe i was very disappointed in this game if you are expecting a platformer look elsewhere	13
0	i like the gta series of games and this one is great too i can turn up my settings to max \( my computer is over a year old \) and there are no problems the kid reviewer claims that he does n't like the n f bomb that is why this is rated m for mature \( so he should not even be playing it \) to give the series a taste some things cannot be eliminated this is a fun games just exploring the city or completing missions	13
1	there are pros and cons of this card pros its stores a lot of memoryable to save many files at one timecompactaffordablecons games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save ! sometimes crashes i tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the gameshark 16x memory car	13
1	i bought one of these for my daughter as a gift found that i need one for each gba or sp so i bought another one for my son then after we could n't get them to work consulted nintendo we found that the wireless adapter does n't work for all multi player games there are only a few games that will work with the wireless version some gift	13
1	the vertical stand is wonderfull but why \? you can do this with 2 useless dvd cases and some duck tape i put my ps slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product \? i bought it just for kicks literally	13
0	very scary at first i was literely shaking while playing this game i could n't stop playing it ! !	13
0	i had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card	13
0	i love this game ! the storyline is wonderful ! i guess if you feel bored with the campaign just go looking for easter eggs ! but what i love is playing multiplayer ! and someone did bash the multiplayer but there are tons of rooms that will kick you out for cussing and or killing your teammates ! i 've had this game for years and i never get tired of playing online ! actually it 's kind of addicting	13
1	i bought the piece of junk from amazon and i regret the day i started using amazon the machine did not work and the customer service of amazon was the worst i have ever experienced i will never ever shop amazon again	13
1	this just sucks the main person just keeps running around he just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board no fwd bike control he wo n't peddle but gos backwards quite well tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked atleast i bought it used and for not much money maybe ill find a fix and try it again later	13
0	i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more i do n't think i will ever get tired of it it is so much fun	13
0	this game is mysteriously hilarious and always fun to play you do n't exactly finish it like other video games but are always trying to beat your fastest time so it does n't get old as fast as a matter of fact we wore out our last copy and this is our second i love it and i'm the parent ! my kids and i play it together and cheer each other on the only thing i would change is make the two player part funner and stop the giant messages that pop up and cover the whole screen occassionally i would keep them in the corner instead overall highly recommend this game more than your money 's worth	13
0	this was a well put together game that was lots of fun to play you 'll want to play it again as soon as you finish it i'm not a big star wars fan but i was nuts for this game this was the first rpg i ever tried and once i got over the fact that i was not doing the fighting i really liked it i highly recommend this game unless you already have a weak relationship with your wife kids \( who you wo n't be seeing much of \) or if your boss hates you and is waiting for you to come in late and bleary eyed so he can pink slip you	13
0	i just got this game last night and i am amazed ea sports really delivered with this one the race for the heisman mode is simply amazing all the problems and slowness of the game from last year have picked up and the presentation is a lot more appealing the game is probably the best football game i have ever played definately a must have for any football fan	13
0	hi tried ordering g2 gold edition online but it wo n't let me and the retailers here do n't have it in their data even so my only options are to get somweone i know in the states to get it for me or to go there myself and try to get it gothic 2 gold edition night of the raven thats the one email me anyone who knows how to get this to me here in victoria bc alan johnson chumtv com or alj2663 hotmail comthanks a bunc	13
0	i am a fan of arena football i enjoy watching it because it is exciting but this game does n't live up to the real game the game is very similiar to nfl blitz except nfl blitz is better what makes unleashed worse is there is less teams to pick from and all you do is pass the most action comes after the play is over when players jump on each other and beat each other up if you are thinking of buying this game rent it first to see if it is really worth the money	13
0	this game although it can be fun yet it can be quite tedious you will need a lot of patience to play it	13
0	this game is fun best lightsaber combat ever but it is hard at time 's but when you get all your force power 's it is so f ing fun you can cut everybody 's arm 's off just like in the frist star wars movie cool man just cool	13
0	this game is great for those that enjoy role playing games there is a lot of reading involved but it adds to the story it was a lot of fu	13
1	all i have to say is this game is not for 'everyone' ! ! you have to be able to read to play ! last time i checked not everyone can read i bought this for my 13 year old son who has autisum he can master just about every game i get him but he ca n't read so for him this game was not much fun i ended up playing more than he did and i did n't even enjoy it	13
0	i baught this game because i was hopping for a good multiplayer first person shooter for the wii but this was not the case the multipler is crap it is jsut your basic oldschool 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 i am more prone to multi player games like time splitters where you can all be on a time so i was pretty dissapointed the story is great though it really takes advantage of the wii mote and has a great storyline ! ! i jsut wish it had a better multiplayer	13
0	i ordered this game based on reviews alone it 's great ! will not disappoint the only flaw is that some evidence is very specific even when something else can be objected other than that a great game hope to see a sequel	13
0	king 's quest games are classic but why are they not including king 's quest 8 mask of eternity \? i know that it was not well received when it came out \( i personally liked it \) but just because it was not well received they wo n't include it it 's part of the series and should be included as well	13
1	dvd 's which play perfectly well on other cheap players freeze skip or do n't play when i try to play them on the xbox do n't waste your money on this buy a stand alone dvd player instead so you wo n't have the frustration that i 've had	13
0	this game is so creative it 's really atypical and really exciting	13
0	when i upgraded to the 360 i was a bit saddened that i would not be able to use my controller with a built in fan but these wireless controllers are amazing first wireless no tangling no mess toss your controller wherever pick it up walk around sounds a bit unnessacary but it is definatly nice to have also the middle x button of these new controllers is amazing also \( although i'm sure they 're on the wired controllers \) quick access to your music friends and dashboard in game plus turn off the controller or the whole console from the comfort of your couch	13
1	starforce nothing else need be said starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of could be great games i do n't know since not a single one will play on a dell xps gaming laptop	13
1	should n't you people know by now \? say it with me never buy movie games a friend of mine bought it and it was horrible it was way too easy to die in etc etc etc hey listen keep you money your investment is n't in here	13
1	this extension cable did not work with my standard microsoft s controller unless you still use the old monster sized xbox controller these cables are worthless	13
0	your back in liberty city \( just like gta 3 \) you cant fly swim clime \( just like gta 3 \) no graphics upgrade no airplanes glitches like crazy same as psp but if your looking for a game to just play and have fun and enjoy the intresting funny good story line than get this 20 bucks cant go wrong	13

0	what a fun game the graphics are good the stereo sound is awesome there are plenty of tracks and it 's got multi player we 've had a blast with this one high quality fun from nintendo	13
0	this game is great both the missions and the things you do on your own \( like extortion \) make this game an awesome part of anyone 's collection i only found one thing wrong with the game when you reach the rank of don everyone still talks to you as i you were at the bottom of the barrel for instance when talking to one of the corleone men they will still say something like hey kid stay outta trouble this game although great can still use a little fine tuning	13
1	if you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360 this will do but it wo n't operate a dvr dvd vcr or cable box if you 're really keen on it i 'll sell you mine	13

0	pros 1 \) wireless2 \) small3 \) lightweight4 \) you can talk to your friends when you 're in the bathroom 5 \) it has a lot of noises to tell you it 's turning on and off and when the volume is at its max cons 1 \) cliking and poping noises2 \) my charger does n't connect to the headset without a rubber band 3 \) there is zero background noise cancellation for high pitched noises like my sister 4 \) have to charge it why ca n't it just have a fuel cell \? 5 \) no mute statis or indicator 6 \) it makes poping noises and a white nois	13
0	i bought it coz i always wanted something like this after i got it i just went and bought a game i made the little mistake to ask who i am living with that said i dont like games which one should i buy well we picked animal crossing and the machine and the games are so good that i havent been able to play it too often it was taken away from me hehehehehso my review is his and he sais that it deserves five star	13
1	ok let me break itdown for you the game is n't all thatb great infact it sucks on ice but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year really you really ca n't blame them that made this game the fact is 2006 is one of the worst years there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great we see about 90 of games and movies arent doing that good so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the ps3 and the wii comes out i promise you that year want disoponte so dont buy every thing in 06 wait till 07 dont waiste your mone	13

0	i love this game once i started playing i could n't stop my ds battery is dead after like 3 days i play so much once you get into the game it is really hard to stop playing you get new moves and new weapons thus making the game new all the time the controls are easy to learn and the story is easy to get into so lets all tip our hats to nintendo and all there mario greatness	13
0	i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more i do n't think i will ever get tired of it it is so much fun	13
0	this game has stunning graphics and fast paced gameplay this game is simply killing different bosses over and over again but dont think im trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is for example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them some a lot more complicating than others and theres os many colossus' that it takes a long time to beat them all so overall this game is great	13
1	do n't buy it unless you want the starforce malware on your computer i understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy but not at the expense of replacing the drivers i need \( ed \) for my dvd burner check the search engines and see for yourself would have otherwise been a great game too bad it is n't playable because of this malware	13
0	i bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys they play this game non stop basically until they 're completely worn out the game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months ! if your kids have a ps2 then this game is a must have ! !	13
0	as you can imagine having 2 separate cards for saving games and info is perfect ! by the way the seller was beyond awesome hope you can get yours from the same !	13
1	i played this game until chapter 23 all the dancing levels were very hard to beat ! i think this game is not worth buying rent it	13
0	i love this game ! it 's not too hard for kids to play \( my 10 year old can beat it with max points and finds all the secrets \) and it 's not trashy so parents can let their kids play it they keep it clean for kids with some adult humor but nothing raunchy it 's also cool so us adults can play as well ! i love creating skaters and parks and the kids love the secret skaters like jesse james and the jester etc the graphics are better in this game than the others in my opinion also	13
0	it works really well and their is no problem with the cable and the enhanced quality of the picture is much better that the original a v cables	13
0	this is a really nice remake of a great classic \( ffiv \) they improved the dialogue and added in a lot of great items the challenge level however was bumped up significantly the game was originally paced so you did n't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up a few of the bosses surprised me this time through \( i 've played the snes version multiple times in my day \) the story is unchanged however a must have for any ff classic rpg fan ! as a bonus i finally got to play chrono trigger	13
0	first things first there is a mute button on this unit if a user taps the power button the sound will mute on and off i'm guessing the previous reviewers who complained that there was no mute button either did n't read the instructions or could n't figure out a product with three buttons on it \( power mute volume up and volume down \) second this is the best way to use the xbox communicator when you have a logitech wireless controller it works well and i noticed no sound quality decrease from the regular xbox communicator	13
0	i bought this for my 15 year old son for christmas he loves it and he 's got me hooked the game is everything they say and more ! you will not be displeased if this is the genre of game that you like ! the only accessory that we need is another gun which we have already ordered	13
0	what can you say for katamari damcy except for it 's exciting original fun edgy ! i totally recommend this for any video game fan that love games on the edge of something different new ! p s do n't delete this game when you are done because you will need to convert your progress to we love katamari	13
1	i am a huge fan of the rpg genre and have played just about every one for the pc morrowind is the most boring one i have ever played i turned it off after two evenings of slowly walking around having stupid repetitive conversations with npcs and lamely fighting rats the interface is terrible you are very limited in what you can carry so after you kill a monster you ca n't even carry your treasure back to town this game was all work with no fun do not buy	13
1	this game is a joke ! it is immpossible for a child to get past level 3 it took my husband about 20 tries to get past it and he is a pro at video games \( he beat mech 2 for x box and halo2 the third time he played them \) do n't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out it is was a waste of money my kids wo n't even play it it should be rated n for nobody	13
0	when i first came home with this game and tried it i thought it was going to be kind of dumb but it is lots of fun and kind of addicting i even got my 11yr old son doing some of the cooking plus it is a good price	13
1	i was really excited when i saw this item was out ! i had the commodore 64 when i was a kid and my brother and i used to spend hours and hours playing games on it i was so glad to see that winter games and summer games was included until the item arrived and i plugged it in and tried to play with it the joystick does n't work at all when you move it to the right so you can only use it to go up down or left big dissapointment do n't waste your	13
0	im a western fanatic i just love the wild west i try to get my eyes or hands on anything western wild west tech desperados wild wild west gbatu so far this game is awesome i cant wait for the new western game gun coming out in nov one thing this game needs though is the good the bad and the ugly theme \) that would make this game perfect but untill they dicide to add it im loopin the song on my cd player with the tv volume down almost all the way just enough to here what there saying	13
0	its simple you can use your controler to do most of the fuctions this remote can do but it takes a lot more time same differance with highspeed and dialup if you have dont mind taking a little longer to get things done then use the controler personally i like my 360 remote	13
0	this game is amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the only problem is that in order to get some achievments you have to play it on veteran mode sometimes you will be near the end of a level and the checkpoint will occur right in the middle of a battle one time i was getting shot at by a tank and it saved the game only three shots will kill you i had to restart the whole level and it took me another hour to complete it	13
0	i'm going to keep this short because the game does n't deserve a review longer than the actual game play great idea tons of fun addictive and short my only complaint just when i was digging the game i beat it alittle disappointing definitely worth 20 just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it	13
0	let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about compdude being off track the keys are in there i found all four of these games to be great i have n't gotten into the lotr one yet because it 's graphics intensive and i have a laptop the other three games are cool too for the price it 's a great deal \( compare to buying the titles individually \)	13
0	i 've done most of the nancy drew games now and a couple csi and law and order games nancy drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than csi i also had so many problems with bugs with the csi and law and order games not so with nancy drew and a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me	13
0	i recived kotor for christmas i was skeptical the front picture was strange to me i popped it in installed and started playing three weeks later i was completely into it it is one of the funnest games that i have ever played the missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars rpg ranking up there with world of warcraft and other hyper popular rpgs	13
0	the wavebird can really take a beating there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine plus the game that ip lay all the time is super smash bros melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing i also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird after 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this but overall its a great controlle	13
0	ok look although this is a old game it is one of the most popular fps \( first person shooter \) games out there ive played this for atleast 5 years now and my friends that i know still play cs today like myself from planting bombs to rescuing hostages you 'll find this game enjoyable there are lots of custom made maps out there that can bring boardness from official maps to playing this game 24 7 the screenshots and trailers could even grab your attention espicially the clan trailers if your looking for a great fps game this is it	13
1	lucas should be ashamed to stamp his name on this turkey do not play on the xbox 360 you will experience random sound shreiks resolution issues too lonng load times and overall this is a really buggy and perplexing product why \? the first was very good	13
1	i bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection or using a usb flash drive i have not been able to get either to work correctly after following their instructions on the datel website on how to update the codes using a usb drive it deleted my game saves on the memory card it also corrupted the memory card and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2 i have had nothing but trouble with it it 's slow and does n't live up to the promises their customer support is lousy with a response that merely said sorry well thanks a lot to them just lost hours of game saves ! !	13
0	if you want to workout at home want it to be fun and already have a ps2 i would recommend this video game	13
0	so if it 's such an excellent game why 4 stars on fun rating \? well it 's a very very fun game but some parts can get annoying and aggravating and it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades which is kinda cheap if you ask me they physically limit you instead of strategicly doing so but everything else is great about it graphics are great not excellent but great sound is great too gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed kinda on the easy side in normal level though but i guess nothing is perfect go ahead and get this one it 's worth what it costs	13
1	my son \( 7 \) used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday it came with 4 dics that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play we kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient we do n't do much pc gaming but we have a fairly new dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient if the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working we would n't have wasted his time we have yet to receive credit for this item a huge hassle ! ! we 'll stick to the ps2 games from now on	13
0	this controller is great you are able to play games much easier with this one than with the first manifest this controller should be considered better than the dual shock because it is more comfortable and for people like me who play games for long periods of time that is a plus	13
0	yes i am a die hard star wars fan and yes i love a good mission based action game so man if this is n't the perfect game for me ! it 's so much fun and there 's so much freedom in the game in itself ! add on to that the space missions and wow this game totally blows me away ! highly recommended for anyone who is a star wars fan a fps fan or a fan of fun gameplay	13
0	i loved this game i played all the way through the difficulty level is low to medium i love games like this instead of being frustrated and having to buy a manual this played smoothly all the way through it kept my interest had good gameplay and graphics did n't annoy me by making me do the same things over and over again i loved it i also loved the mario and luigi prequel to this on gba it 's kinda of a light rpg with action elements i wish they made all rpg 's like this it 's short enough to conquer before getting bored of repetition give it a shot ! it 's a lovely game	13
0	it is a pretty fun game with a few quirks here and there some of them include the anoying click button interface and a few problems that are just a random guess to solve other than that it has very good graphics and a very addictive storyline	13
0	this is the original playstation controller and it is the best it feels great in your hands not too heavy best button response and overall just the best controller you can buy if you have been thinking about buying a controller with a different feeling i strongly reccommend do not buy the big mad catz controller it does not feel good in your hands its too big and heavy and the button response sucks just stick with the sony controler it is the best of the best	13
1	should n't you people know by now \? say it with me never buy movie games a friend of mine bought it and it was horrible it was way too easy to die in etc etc etc hey listen keep you money your investment is n't in here	13
0	i 've been a gta fan for a few years now and to me san andreas has got to be the best one for the first time you can swim ! ! i fell into the water accidently and discovered this new action for the character the graphics are more real making it kind of funky controlling the game but after awhile you 'll get used to it the language is terrible \( more so in this gta version \) so young kids should avoid this like the plague	13
0	this is an unorthodox football game this is not an nfl game but a football game w made up teams in a made up league there are 3 divisions and you start at the bottom beat the division 3 level move up to 2 beat 2 to go to 1 beat 1 to beat the game as you move up you also unlock rewards if you 're tired of madden 's franchise mode give this game a try it wo n't get outdated just because of nfl free agency	13
0	this game is fun best lightsaber combat ever but it is hard at time 's but when you get all your force power 's it is so f ing fun you can cut everybody 's arm 's off just like in the frist star wars movie cool man just cool	13
1	i purchased this product for my niece having had positive experiences with similar items and finding the price to be too tempting however what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset the screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver the titles suffered from redundancy and many of them required the use of too many buttons what was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed perhaps fewer similar titles and a re configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product	13
0	madden comes out again but with some stupid lead blocking controls i think this is as dumb as tha qb vision controls y cant they come out with something good	13
1	i would blame this game sucking on the wii it is unfortunate that the sequel to cod2 had to be this game i played it on the x box 360 and it was n't good there either i was only able to stand playing the game for about an hour after that i could n't bring myself to touch it again	13
0	in this first person shooter you battle through the star wars battles through all episodes fighting as soldiers on the republic 's side and you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier and you have the opportunity to do instant action that is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as also you can choose to conquer a galaxy but it 's really boring this game is really fun but it starts to get boring after awhile so get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen also yoda is awesome	13
1	try before you buy ! this game has a major glitch its save game files are erased sometimes so you can start all over again beware	13
0	this game is fun you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities you can even go the wrong way for me \( older adult \) it was fun to play with my kids but i found it repetitive and boring after a while of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game	13
0	if you are a ds owner this game is a must have you will not be disappointed	13
0	i really enjoy top down and side scrolling shooters so take this opinion with that in mind the only problem with r type is that dying sucks when you die you restart from a usually bad position without any powerups once you unlock free play this can make the game frustrating when you are playing new stages or playing with a different ship etc however overall i think it 's the best of the r types and one of the better side scrollers out there	13
1	nothing more really needs to be said i'm running a 3ghz p4 256mb ati radeon 9000 series pci express video card and 2gb of ram and the game still hangs lags and locks up on my computer i tried uninstalling reinstalling same effect do not buy this gam	13
0	the game has a lot of plot development and cutscenes if you are into it then that 's great i find i scan for the gist and then move on to the next dialogue that being said all of the backgrounds are simply the best ever put on screen i find myself actually commenting aloud to myself how beautiful the game is the action is good and the plot does suck you in nothing novel in the battle system while the plot managed to surprise me after playing both of it 's predecessors completely worth your while	13
0	this site is the cheapest i have found for this card 60 br 62 do not pay for your live service monthly on your credit card 60 br 62 it 's alot cheaper to buy one of these cards every year	13
0	it is not a false advertisement it is just meant for the newer models of the playstation 2 that have a built in ir receiver which is why it does n't include it	13
0	another castlevania game means more excitement going around whipping everything in sight never gets boring because the gameplay of castlevania has been an interesting one for many many years i love the graphics they are truly something magnificent the special effects from all the enemies is really a nice welcoming touch just the overall atmosphere of the game is dark and spooky the way a castlevania game should be this game follows the formula that was featured in symphony of the night which means if you like the metroid style of gaming you will love this game as well	13
0	i honestly hate fighting games i think they 're boring and they do n't offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by enter tekken tekken has been around for many years when it first came out everyone loved it it used to compete with virtua fighter on the sega saturn i was impressed then and i'm impressed now all these years later the action is just a lot of fun you really could n't ask for a better fighting game the graphic updates have really added more depth to the characters and the environments i love the game and i hope you do as well	13
1	this game has starforce copy protection which is software that you do not want on your computer reportedly it replaces your cd and or dvd drivers and often causes extreme hardware and software problems i 've been a victim of the software problems it basically crippled my very expensive scsi scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it it could be the best game that 's ever been produced but anyone who 's had the starforce experience is going to steer clear	13
0	this game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations there are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light either way the game is great and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a force crush on your opponent you are very lucky give this game a whirl	13
0	this game is tons of fun ! my husband children \( ages 6 and 7 \) and i have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game i definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game this game is also great for informal parties as an ice breaker	13

1	i rented this game for my 3 year old who loves the movie he tried to play it he like it i tried to play it got to the dancing part i could n't get past it i tried for 5 days my rental time was up i returned it i have n't rented it since this game is way too hard to beat and my 3 year old got bored with it real fast i would not recommend this game to anyone do n't waste your money buying it unless you are an expert with video games i'm just thankful that i rented it instead of buying it	13

0	this headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear the big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use wearing the halo 2 headset i actually forgot that i was even wearing it because it is so light they have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price i greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis	13
0	the price of the card is about 7 10 cheaper than in the stores but what is the point if you have to pay 10 shipping \( express \) or about 7 \( office depot \) who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not amazon this much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke	13
0	what makes it special is that it 's the first playstation game ever where you have to defeat your ennemy with a time travel device i gave it 4 stars because the game is too short for an expensive ps2 game \( 2 or 3 hours ! \) on the other hand there are several possible endings and a bonus game the game has a nostalgic atmosphere and the graphics are astonishing	13
1	vci 's budget dvd starts out well enough for the obscure thriller lady ice with nice letterboxed credits foreshadowing interesting widescreen photography to come unfortunately as soon as the credits end the aspect ratio changes to full screen and the rest of the film is presented in one of the worst pan and scan jobs i 've ever seen on dvd pass on this one from vci and hopefully down the line there will be a new widescreen transfer so we can see how the film is supposed to look after the credits	16
0	this was the first dvd i purchased after i bought my dvd player \( i know it took me a while to get one \) i had never seen the movie before but amazon com reccomended it so i took the chance it had the perfect amount of predictability and comedie and romance it 's the same story line that gets used a million times and never grows old boy and girl are best friends girl likes boy but boy likes a different girl boy asks for help from girl to get the other girl boy realizes he 's in love with friend girl just in time to stop her from leaving	16
1	nothing not even a trailer what a wasted opportunity for a commentary by west \( who does do them he did one for when a stranger calls \) or a retrospective featurette all you do get with this extended version is additional dialogue between cusack 's character and a female law enforcement officer in a hanger footage of a prison riot during the opening credits montage and a few more graphic shots of hapless inmates being killed during the course of the movie	16

0	quot above suspicion quot offers both a plausible plot and realistic character portrayals the dilemma of the story becomes apparent when a family man 's \( bakula 's \) past comes back to haunt him consequently tearing his life and his family apart his wife \( sciorra \) becomes more and more unsure of her husband as the story progresses quot above suspicion quot has the qualities of an intense psychological thriller as well as a heart warmer it 's a must see for almost any movie fan just do n't confuse this quot above suspicion quot with the film starring christopher reve	16
0	i like this movie a meeting happened in our life is very special and nearly miracle but we do n't think so almost always the story except political things in this movie is thinkable around here screenplay and performance of both bill nighy and kelly mcdonald have led this movie to the excellent one ps i do n't understand why this movie is not released in japan	16
0	this original version is much funnier than u s version the humor is dry and intelligent and the characters are very complex at times you feel sorry for them other times you love them and laugh with them and mostly you think they 're idiots what a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience it 's not often i can watch a dvd or series over and over but this is one that i 've enjoyed each time	16
0	well it 's a great inteligent comedy which makes enjoy to everyone who whatches it i'm form spain and i bought the other three seasons in france i 'll buy it from amazon but i would like to know if in england the other seasons offered subtitles in spanish thanks	16

0	love this movie ! ca n't decide which version i like better this one or the one with grace kelly and bing crosby ! both are great	16
1	most people ca n't get enough of this movie i even own it on laserdisc when i saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on dvd i had to have it i am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality it lookslike there was just a transfer from vhs to dvd there does n't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality i recently saw it on hdnet movies and thought it looked much better do buy this movie because it is an all time classic do n't buy this movie if you think that the 20th anniversary edition is going to get you anything better	16
0	i like this season because it has moved out of the developing storyline and gone into conflicting with each other with two of the best twist in a show ever !	16
0	excellent movie that shows how families should be and how most african american families really are big mama 's are always the most important component to a family definitely a collector 's item	16
1	cool band worst videos ever ever makes me like them less fearless freaks is good this is garbage	16
0	pro great story teriffic acting beautiful settingcon some pacing flaws but not enough to destroy the wholelindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her well cast perfunctory foil as as the story unfolds the differences between british and american style \( and culture \) are revealed providing a nice subtext to the plot one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears from the central story to the character 's lives good actors all but my best actor award goes to the photographs themselves the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once a visually rich film	16
0	one of the best new sitcoms in recent years up until i got the dvd i had no idea bob saget was the narrator neil patrick harris is very funny as barney \( who names thier kid that these days \? \) and basically makes the show what it is legendary !	16
0	this dvd along with her 2 international albums pure and odyssey are best stress reduction kits available in the market slip this in a dvd player and in a matter of minutes stress level heart rate and blood pressure all three are down and life if manageable again	16
0	if you have n't seen this you should great movie never get tired of seeing it i think any age could watch this	16
0	season 3 of the l word is by far the best yet the character development and story have come so far since the 1st season and are even better than season 2 they have scaled back the sex a little bit but when they do put it in the sparks really fly i love the l word	16
0	the best cleopatra that the movies has ever produced be it in the scenario as well as the performance of an actress in the part so many came before and so many after elizabeth taylor however to me cleopatra will always be elizabeth taylor a mega movie with fantastic costumes and acting is a classic in historic movies if you are history lover you should have this movie in your collection	16
1	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one \( rare \) or better than this one as an example buffalo '66 is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die	16
0	gwendoline is free spirited and lots of beauiful skin adventure and action good choice of entertainment they need to bring back a lot of these typemovies with lots of skin and g rated action nudity mades these films very special if you liked sheena or beast master this is a good choice	16
1	im not sure why i gave this a second star maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with \? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman \( the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious adaptation \) this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer \( john cusack \) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz	16
1	this effort shows it 's age in addition there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo scientific method somewhat reminiscent of mengele i suppose it 's possible for it to be taken as tongue in cheek by those at the post graduate level of study at the cheech and chong school of anthropology however i have to admit i was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing	16
0	this movie is great ! very subtle humor but if you watch it you will be laughing out loud love it	16
1	this is one of the worst edited documentary i have ever seen you can not have a single shot spoiled with flashes slow motion and unnecessary digital fx i have nothing against crazy editing when it is for a 3 min mtv music clip or a tv add but on a 7 hours documentary you get airsick if fine edited all this interresting story could have been told in less than two hours each episode has a more than 2 min introduction during the episodes you see some shots more than ten times by the way i am a very long time aviation enthousiast	16
1	i cannot believe this is billed as a baby video the images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value i personally like the baby miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby	16
0	i'm not sure if anyone has pointed this out but the voice 's for paul and company is not their own these were in fact voice actors and they did a very good job too this was also confirmed by paul proir to the movies release	16
1	the story here dose n't matter the main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction meth quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless roberts is so gay you want to smack his face he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius a role he plays better than anyone today in film br	16
1	i bought this because i was familar with the space ghost show and liked it and the fact that this was 50 off it is strange in an uncomfortable way and tends to be very long in parts	16
0	i loved the first one and i think with the logic and plot of the first one this follows through we knew they changed the world and in this sequel we see that the actors do a good since the lead characters are suppose to be let 's say less intelligent but nice i think this movie and the 1st one are classics i like the grim reaper his atitude during the movie and the fact the he is the comic relief \( okay so most of the movie is comic relief \) even if they are fun to watch to laugh at it is worth it to watch	16
1	i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here so i was upset when i watched this sad movie gary graham \( t v 's alien nation \) is a robot jox which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought ! the f x are not very good and the story is paper thin only the acting is good but it ca n't save this one from being just a let down skip it	16
0	a movie not geared for morons ! what a rare find there are n't many movies that ca n't be figured out half way through this film is great very clever never saw the ending coming	16
1	just look how many are for sale thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is it has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting i fastforwarded about 70 of the movie ! and what got me was on the back it says family friendly im still laughing about that ! what has this world come to \? i would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone ! even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person does n't buy or rent this movie im embarassed that i rented it ! please turn away now	16
1	not a good script kind of slow a regular movie if you are into history in america but if you dont live there or got any interest in this particular plot i wont recomended is borin	16
1	warning ! this video has no captioning i 've rented it and it does not have captioning it is useless to me and fellow deaf and hard of hearing folk	16
1	this is not a good movie ! bad acting story and picture ! i was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man after dvd i had but alass it was not pass on this one unless u have 2 have it	16
0	the movies of course are dated but fascinating also the picture quality was excellent as was the sound the main iterest was in seing how much movie stories have changed now even the simplest movie regardless of the subject has an edge these horror movies of the 40s 50s are gentler less scary with a clear statement of good and evil now we view things differently without any absolute judgments clarity has given way to a more unsettled world	16
1	i am big horror movie fan so this flick sat with me fairly well it was kind of cornie but with yvonne \( lily munster \) decarlo and a great actor in rod steiger it held my interest also throw in michael j pollard who always plays an off the wall character and i guess that is what keeps this movie afloat	16
0	this series is exactly what the english love about mystery and crime it 's a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like the shield that being said this series is well done and does capture you over time rather than individual crime stories this series contains only one crime investigation if you like drama and cop stories this is a good one	16
0	i thought that this was adam sandler 's best movie he has made that he played man who 's a slacker that he trys to impress his girlfriend by adopting a cute 5 year old boy \( played by dylan cole sprouse \) i think of how the movie should 've ended real good is for sonny to have legal custody of jullian i laugh out loud when i see this movie ! ! !	16
0	one of the best films of all time ! fans of katharine hepburn and cary grant are in for a treat with this one	16
1	this video was not animated like the classic chuck jones features such as the cat in the hat and the grinch my daughter was rather disappointed to see the camera scanning over pages of the books she already owns along with paper cutouts of the characters floating around as a cheap replacement for animation we give this video a thumbs down	16
0	these 10 minute workout combos are great for any busy mom since you can do one two or three depending on how much time you have and how tired you are !	16
0	p d james' mysteries rank as outstanding entertainment this cd featuring roy marsden as adam dagliesch is excellent it has well developed characters a complex plot involving actions that took place years before and scenes in both london and on england 's coast i highly recommend this product	16
1	i am a howard stern fanatic and a softball fanantic i could n't go wrong with this movie right \? wrong ! it is pretty bad i was disappointed with artie 's project gross jokes terrible acting there are a couple of funny scenes wait until it is on sale	16
0	the absolute fore runner to the musical movie chicago ! if you love music dancing and a poinant story with great acting this is it	16
1	i saw all the revies for this movie and was expecting a dark enjoyable tale about a libtertine i was strongly mistaken johnny depp is a great actor with great abilites but this is the worst movie of his i have ever seen even his cheesy movies were better than this the rated r rating is light i could n't believe how pornographic it was even in quills it was n't as raunchy as this do n't waste your money or your time with this one	16
0	that i bought this movie orginally to see david boreanaz naked i am very glad that i did it is a very funny comedy that was a bonus of david 's nice tush in the movie if you have ever been a baby sitter in your life you will get a hoot out of this one	16
1	nothing original here nothing overly humourous overall pretty bland in my opinion the only part i thought was really worth watching was when the casket exploded at the end	16
1	an incredibly bad film whose only redeeming feature is lana clarkson in \( and out of \) some skimpy outfits she 's completely gorgeous but even she ca n't save a disaster of a film buy deathstalker instead	16
1	wow was that ever awful ! i 'd write more but im busy cleansing my dvd player after loading that steaming pile ! !	16
0	this is a good cartoon for competition with rocket robin hood hope they come to quick agreable turms msp didnt see the black wolf or fox \? \?	16
0	a great ending to a great series it left me craving more not olnly were the final revelations creatively developed the action itself was beautiful plus mugen and jin 's final \( for the time being \) battle was great leaving you starstruck and impressed by his ability to develope their relationship through battle it was perfectly constructed to make you want to beg them to make another season or at least a movie	16
1	overall i have always enjoyed robin william and billy crystal 's performance in many other movies but i must admit to my surprise that it was n't making me laughing on the floor as i usually do the script was boring and the plot was downright disppointing did n't like the ending it was like a stupid wild goose chase for both of them and end up accepting that the mother of the son lied to them which is really a bad example for younger audience to see this and thinking it 's normal for mothers to lie i hope someday to see both robin and billy to act together in another movie in the near future and hopefully better script than this one	16
0	this is a dvd that i thought was dated not ! it was made in 2002 3 and deserves wide viewing i thought i may have seen the title but i had not it may be confused with other previous similar titles dont pass this by it is gritty and artistically realistic the grit of south central l a is authentic and has its own particular big city beauty of a slum area share this dvd or title with friends it is well worth the ride in a black and white it is similar to the shield on fx but deals with the rodney king riots in l a as a backdrop	16
0	this film is one big joke you have all the basics elements of romance \( love at first sight great passion etc \) and gangster flicks \( brutality dagerous machinations the mysterious don etc \) but it is all done with the crudest humor it 's the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately get or you do n't that is a matter of taste and expectations i enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s when nicolson and turner were in their primes the acting is very good if a bit obviously tongue in cheek recommended	16
0	the devil 's backbone is a horror movie like you 've never seen before a good and intelligent one it really is not a horror movie however but a story which involves ghosts \( or the past \) and how they fuel our present actions and decisions it is a strange and memorable film from spain which will make you think as much as it scares you worth seeing	16
0	this is a great movie that everyone should see i'm a conservative and so are all of my friends and they love this movie we do n't see this movies as a republicans are bad movie thats dumb this movie is just what a movie should be funny and entertaining we all love the songs because they are not only great but true too	16
1	i 've been wanting to see this movie and i finally did on logo i'm just happy i waited untill it came on tv i though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it the romance was slim to none i thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role well i wo n't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it anyway i would much rather watch beautiful thing get real all over the guy the incredibly true adventure of two girls in love	16
1	i loved what the bleep \? and i specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day' this video teaches nothing about how to create your day nothing it 's just ramtha \( jz knight \) talking about the fact that you can create your day i heard you in the movie ! i bought this to give me some additional insights into how to create my day it does not teach any how whatsoever do not buy this video ! buy the secret thesecret tv buy the attractor factor by joe vitale buy wealth beyond reason by bob doyle do not buy this video	16
0	the great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action scenes the plot is easy to follow and all is the action and i think jj abrams did a great job as director this dvd is worth looking	16
0	the wolf man legacy set a no brainer like all the classic universal legacy sets the special features are worth the price alone jack pierce 's make up and wolfman creation are still the best ! this set along with dracula and frankenstein legacy collections enables you to see the entire series in order as sequels to the inferior but still hard to dislike monster rallies they would end with you still need abbott and costello meets frankenstein to truely complete the series	16
1	most boring of the barbie movies i am sure glad my daughter has stopped asking to watch it over and over and when it is so boring it seems to drag on forever and i agree with another reviewer princess and the pauper and rapunzel much better ! ! !	16
0	i was so pleased to find this movie on amazon com i had watched it as a child and pinned over it when i could not find it in stores over the years this is such a pure love story with the main characters completely selfless and yet charmingly real there are too few unpretentious untampered romantic movies around these days most reveal too much literally but this one leaves you truly satisfied while lending pleasant modesty to a normally scandalous genre	16
0	it 's a funny concept to begin with and stiller is hilarious then you throw in rip torn \( probably the best film judas among his many credits over the years \) and these cameos that are out of control \( shatner armstrong norris \) and you 've got a comic classic	16
0	very good movie great acting plot very touching i am very glad i own this movie i will watch it very often	16
1	more time could have been spent in ney york city for this movie like with friday the 13th part seven the new blood all of the good gore scenes were cut out but still this is a terrible movie and i am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five	16
0	an absolute must have for all parents families and professionals ! as a speech amp language pathologist i have worked with special needs children for 17 years and finally i have viewed a high quality product for children diagnosed with down syndrome informative comprehensive and heart warming are just a few words to describe this excellent dvd i would highly recommend it for not only families but for all professionals working with this population in fact i believe it should be part of the training and curriculum for all disciplines intending to serve these wonderful children thanks for a great product	16
1	corny science fiction less favorite of mine not even in the top 10 ! afi took the idea on a better approache of this movie about a boy robot !	16
0	i thought the video was well done it was good to feature the clinchinggames of the division and league championship series plus all four gamesof the world sries i think they should have included at least the high lights on a extra disk of games 1 and 2 of the division series againstboston and games 1 2 3 and 4 of the league championship series againstlos angeles still i highly recommend this collection for all gung howhite sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88years a great viewing companion for those cold winter nights	16
0	the muppets take manhattan will keep your children imused from the very begining the music in cordination with the muppets of all different kinds keep the minds of young children going at all times i would recomend this movie would be great for children starting at age 2 5 and older	16
0	i showed this movie to my students they had red the book and this was reenforcement fore the lesson they really enjoyed it	16
1	but the movie was just plain stupid do n't waste your time	16
1	i had heard a lot about how funny margaret cho was and finally got a chance to watch her video i find her way overrated she does have some funny stuff she 's got a particular knack for doing impressions and there 's some other genuinely funny material however the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience she does a lot of vulgar material homosexual oriented jokes etc that are clearly just there for the outlaw value and she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she 's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base it 's just not funny	16
0	my 11 year old saw this movie at school and would n't stop talking about it or asking for it since we could n't find it at any store we amazoned it and there it was ! ! part of his christmas present he loves it this movie is very inspiring and from what he says it makes him have hope in other people and what we can do to help others	16
0	my 2 year old loves his video the animations are unusual but they are full of flare color and imagination the songs they include are by far the best part and my daughter ca n't get enough of them the main character moustache and the rest of the characters are all well imagined and fun as far as the learning experience my daughter loves to repeat the phrases and sing the songs and i see her using what she has learned all the time and the semi interactive format they use really gets her involved in the story line i personally love this video and would recommend it	16
0	this is the 2000 or so version of the dvd this is identical with the vhs version except it adds two features the first is an excellent making of video from 1996 which was re done with a different host for 2006 but all the interview segments are the same the second was a making of video done for the dvd which does n't add a whole lot were i to do it again i 'd buy this version and skip the 2006 50th anniversary release this is the classic chuck jones television grinch in one of the best packages for it and the horton hears a who is also a chuck jones classic a person 's a person no matter how small	16
1	i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a 16mm print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this	16
1	i had not realized what great performers michael flatley colin dunne and jean butler were until i watched this version of riverdance the lead dancers in this version are not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy compared to previous versions what made riverdance great for me was the precision timing and dancers dancing togeather in the irish dance numbers it is all gone here try riverdance live from new york city or the video tape riverdance the show instead this version should not have been released	16
1	i like almost all of lifetime 's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best the name bring obsessed was not what it should have been called the lady was dreaming and had an illness this movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through this movie was not what i had expected as i said i like almost all of lifetime original movies but i definitely wa n't be watching this one again	16
0	this is a fantastic movie ! the acting is superb and it keeps you guessing until the end nicole kidman deserved her oscar	16

1	the only reason why i stayed and watched the movie the whole way through was because i paid to see it awful movie not entertaining at all it was just so poor the animation was n't fantastic political messages should n't be in children movies not a good movie	16
1	as cute and talented as i think hugh jackman is this production was a waste of time space and money everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves the acting is bad the script is horrendous and the cg people apparently think their stuff do n't stink which it does badly it 's not the worse movie i 've seen but it 's surprisingly close please do n't waste your time with this film	16
0	this is a most beautiful movie i can`t imagine anyone not enjoying it the two disc package is brilliant and i will be heirlooming mine to stay in the family long after i have gone	16
0	this movie is very simple and unique it 's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you 're watching because it does n't feel phony this can be credited to the acting the situation and the plot as well this is n't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her that 's all been done and that 's what makes this film a breath of fresh air river phoenix shows why he is missed by so many and really allows you to connect with his character i recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art and be touched at the same time	16

0	either you get on the train or you do n't and as long as you continue to get on the train you 'll grasp the meaning of christmas the true meaning of christmas but you have to be willing to get on this movie was a great adaptation of the classic story i must admit i was a tad bit wigged out by the animation it was just oogey in some ways realistic at times and at other times so unbelievably fake i could n't decide if i liked the animation or not still ca n't but the story itself is worth the struggle i had with the animation get on board ! you 'll be glad you did	16
1	after i saw the first two scary movies i decided too see this movie i thought the wayans brothers were the two writers but i can see that i was wrong this movie is a spoof with no plot and no good jokes i could hardly understand anything in this movie at all without giving my self a headache ! i myself a teen which this movie appealed too did not find this funny i do n't know why teens like this movie so much ben russell	16

0	i have now seen about twenty asian horror films and this series definitely ranks among the best i have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles but suffice it to say that these movies make audition look like a disney romance bleak bizarre and ultra violent yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent this film maker has something to say and will beat you senseless to make his point in short if you want to see ringu 25 stay away from this one if you feel a bit more adventurous i highly recommend this series	16
0	this film is one of my all time favorites i think it 's because these kids remind me of my friends and i as kids riding our bikes going on little adventures etc the cast is absolutely perfect wil wheaton was the best crying kid of all time with the exception of ricky schroeder in the champ lol river phoenix was excellent in this film which is an adaptation of a stephen king short story part road film part coming of age tale all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings	16
0	really delightful and has stood the test of time my recording had a few hic cups with the lighting in one of the acts music lovely as were the costumes and scenery can recommend	16
1	the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful	16
1	this film like most of his early work is for hitchcock aficionados only i am an admirer of hitchcock and also enjoy old british films but i still found this movie tough going not least because of the 110 mins running time the picture quality of this laserlight dvd is not perfect but it is perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you 'd expect for the price the musical score is also okay but nothing to write home about laserlight do however pose a mystery that hitch himself would have been proud of this dvd has no commentary no documentary and no trailer not even one of those awful tony curtis intros so why do laserlight describe this dvd as a 'special edition'	16
1	i do n't like her routine in this dvd at all i do n't like the strechie it 's a completely waste and it wo n't give you the same workout as hand weights or balance ball i solde the dvd the 2nd day i bought it however i do like her 'shrink your female fat zone ' which uses dumbell and balance for upper body lower body and abs	16
1	this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen ! complete waste of my time	16
0	this is a showcase of jet li 's brand of martial arts fast and furious while this is no fist of legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going what i did'nt anticipate was the humor absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it 's own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying	16
0	the direction of this film is excellent i love all the characters and the way they interact the storyline is very important also it 's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other it 's a well paced and interesting story that 's not like anything else i 've ever seen	16
1	this sequel to a horror classic started out ok but by the middle none of it mattered anymore i even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because i had to sit through scenes of a severed and rat duking it out ! the original reanimator is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline but this sequel just stinks	16
1	what a horrendous experiment in comedy if you like jerry lewis i guess you 'll love this travesty of a film if you are a film snob you will love it personally as neither i am grossly disappointed and just really did n't get quot the joke quot it was trite and dull there was no point the plot technology encroaching on humanity well good try but again not for me if i am looking for a laugh i will watch a good coen brothers film	16

1	my god this was the most idiotic horror film since blair witch all the character were utterly retarded they had plenty of chances to escape and blew them all duh ! ! ! ! ! ! so the viewer just stops giving a crud when the victims are behaving like screeching buffoons and the ending made no sense whatsoever ! ! ! the ben guy is tried for their deaths sure that makes sense it 's not as though they could n't find the mine where the actual murderer was and get a crudload of dna evidence and dead bodies not to mention the alleged hundreds of other tourists that have gone missing from that exact place total piece of junk a wasted opportunity for all involve	16
1	an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful quot eat drink man woman quot frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you have n't seen either see the better of the two \( exact same stories \) eat drink man woman	16

1	i gotta say this movie is an example of a terrible idea swain husband beats the crap outta her and she spends her time running from him what 's worse his friend is a lunatic who want swain 's character swain 's character is a hillbilly who like 's an upper class doctor who she really never connects with i never really got why swain settled for a lunatic when she was trying to find inner peace thru the whole movie this movie puts a bad taste in my mouth it was a waste of my time it wasnt a story it was an excuse to make a bad movie \( do not buy \)	16
0	this film is a must see for any dancer the clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative many famous scenes from the old mgm musicals to the water spray scene in flashdance are used to illustrate how diversified dancing in films can be for ballet dancers there is a portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by mikhail baryshnikov scenes of rudolph nureyev leaping through the air compliment this section as well as scenes from various ballets liza minelli hosts the broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length i only saw this film once but i feel that it is a must own selection for any dancer	16
0	my two year old only child adores this dvd so much that she 's adopted max as an imaginary younger brother there 's no flash and no dash no special effects and no tired slapstick but there is charm gentleness intelligence humor and completely accessible characters for the little people in your life my daughter views max and ruby as such a treat that i used it as a potty training reward and she 's always just as delighted with it as she was the first time she saw it ages 18 months through five five stars and then some	16
1	i also found this best of collection to fall very short of the best ! there are clearly many other episodes they could have and should have used and included to make this truly a best of feature the few cases they did showcase were by far not the scariest ! a definite disappointment though still a fan ! !	16
1	terrible movie i really like denzel washington as an actor but in this movie it was very dissapointing he is much better when he plays to be a good person that fights for justice and what is right	16
0	yeah it 's true this movie is awesome i think i watched it four times in the first week i had it	16
1	after having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out i was extremely disappointed the movie very well could be alright on its own merits but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful	16
0	treasure island has that magical touch to it walt disney was famous for treasure island teachers one at a young age not everone is who they seem lots of good guys and bad guys and pirate treasure leads to a wild ride ! this film should be required for all youngsters ! there is a special place in my heart for this film this was robert newton 's finest hour playing long john silver	16
1	these are not the original theatrical realeases in addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films american cinematographer noted in their review of the dvd release that they had gone so far as to change the color timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels though they are an impressive technical achievement i 'll be buying the academy award winning films that i saw when i was younger	16
1	i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it it go 's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right there are better ones out there than this but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it	16
1	one of those cases where everything goes wrong in the making of a movie low budget unispired performances \( alexis denisof is particularly bad here \) lack of decent screenplay for the actors to work upon bad direction despisable characters cliched situations how kinski chose to act in this one \?	16
0	this movie is truly wonderfully done i appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters and the deep resonances of director zhang yimou 's commentary on academics in modern rural china the language is particularly good for students learning mandarin chinese as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken chinese in the countryside and in the cities there are english subtitles for beginners as well i highly recommend it	16
1	this dvd skips quite a bit making it hard to relax for what should be an enjoyable movie also the plastic covering on the dvd casewas torn a little bit when the security sticker was taken off i 've never had a movie do that before i would think twice in the future before buying movies from amazon com	16
1	the film seems to focus on 70 's punk exclusively anything post 1980 is glossed over clumped together and generally viewed with dissapointment by this documentary i think the film does well documenting the roots of punk seeing as how letts was steeped in the scene at that time \( although the misfits were n't mentioned which i found odd \) the interviews with henry rollins and jello biafra were great as well however in order to claim to be a documentary the evolution of punk rock is just as integral \( perhaps more so \) as its origins i think basically letts based the film on his own opinions likes and dislikes instead of actually documenting punk i was disapointed	16
0	it is very nice and they delever it very fast	16
0	i loved these movies and i cant wiat for the third one ! very funny not suitable for chilren	16
1	this complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone star movie with cringingly awful acting laughable special effects \( the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment \) appalling dubbed dialogue cheesy music inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere the grim reaper is a total disaster do n't waste your money on this turkey	16
0	julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a giant corporation in a court of law julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it i give this film 5 stars because julia does look pretty attractive in it at most times	16

0	hard to believe it took me until now \( february 2007 \) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made scarface so popular and award deserving back in the early 80 's i loved this movie it really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting especially tony montana a movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is \( over 2 hours \) everyone must see scarface at least once in their lifetime it wo n't disappoint the ending gave me goosebumps it was that good and intense watch it now	16
0	this dvd 'd ok it has the original program in it and some new features although i was a bit dissapointed as the new features only included about 10 mins of extra buzzer beaters and the t mac ending goes for like 5 mins and the quality isnt that great	16
1	when this movie starts it is so dark you ca n't even see anything the only way you can know what is going on it to read what amazon tells you after that it is just stupid	16
1	i saw this at a friends house so thank god i did n't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy i can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film ! the guys are not hot not even lukewarm for that matter the acting is terrible please anyone who had anything to do with this do n't continue in the film industry if it was possible to assign negative stars i would do so for this awful experience run away	16
0	these are excellent performances for a very reasonable price the look of some of the videos as well as some of the film stock is dated but the performances easily shine through not quite as well played recorded or filmed as bernstein 's many later unitel films but still well worth the investment i wo n't spend time on details but rest assured it 's all great stuff !	16
1	the story line was fair but the t a not so hot 2 star	16
1	this is the dumbest most predictable horrible waste of time i 've ever ever seen this movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply was n't it took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that 's supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe drink and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us after watching this movie i felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash my only hope is that our european friends did n't seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident	16
1	mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks	16
0	it 's not a great movie but it 's a lot of fun this is one of those movies that just catches me it 's quirky and has some decent \( for it 's day \) effects there are a feww laugh out loud momments truth be told they are few and far between some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble the cast is pretty damn cool with urich being upstaged by ron pearlman angellica houston john mat mattus the big guy anyway it 's cornball comedy with a basic plot hey what do you want \? it 's 80 's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been i still giggle at the time warp battle	16

0	the chronological donald vol 2 was the second box of my collection after i happen collected the first one the tin box contains 2 dvd9 look very precious but the shipment made its had some ding if you like disney you do n't miss this treasures collection the dvd content very classical and a lot of fun for your children	16
1	this is an excellent story well told in script and action however it is quite different from the version i saw on a big theater screen this dvd has speeded up the action and the english translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue i was very disapointed in this dvd version and would not recommend it to friends	16
0	i normally do not enjoy movies about the making of movies so i was very pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained by 'living in oblivion' the reason i took the chance at all was due to the presence of catherine keener one of our most overlooked and under appreciated hollywood actresses she once again did not disappoint but the entire cast was extremely good you get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director the amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason i'm glad to join my fellow amazonians in heaping praise on this low budget gem	16
1	this went up from one in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii but otherwise its just a mess the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes who also gave us such film masterpieces as casino royale and chitty chitty bang bang richard harris is his usually unrestrained self and thats not a compliment now i wont even go into the politics which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas 's paean to charles ii in twenty years after but nowhere near as entertaining	16

0	if you liked raise the red lantern or the last emperor this is a perfect movie gong li who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband 's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband farewell my concubine uses chinese opera as a way of telling the story i used to listen to a lot of chinese opera which is an acquired taste this movie uses the story of a king his beloved concubine 's self sacrifice to frame the love story between two men when one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman the stage is set for a tragic love triangle the final scenes are chilling powerful this is a spectacle not to be missed	16
0	shel natowsky ph d this movie is costner 's best without any hesitation the performances by hackman and sean young are also flawless supporting roles are well honed as well the movie has everything you could want in a film i mean everything ! the screenplay is wonderfully written acted directed and presented why is it that movies as superb as this one is cannot be made anymore \? everytime i run it it never ceases to thrill me and to amaze me if you want to see a cold war drama that never ceases to excite and one which moves at a fever 's pace then see this one satisfaction guaranteed ! well done people	16

1	i bought three dvds \( the wood was one of them \) and the dvds were in european codes which means they wo n't play in the united states unless you own a special dvd player i'm very unhappy with my purchase my recommendation to you is that you read every single piece of information before you purchase movies that were formatted for another country this is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices	16
1	hands down the worst episode of the masters of horror television show it 's dull boring and not scary it will leave you scratching your head saying that 's all \? do n't even bother with this dvd it 's a waste of your precious time	16
0	this is a great collection i can remember every saturday morning glued in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on it 's truly a great dvd that not only i can enjoy but my son is hooked on it now too	16
1	the movie is a piece of art one of my all time favorites the extended edition dvd is very badly compiled the bonus features are sub par with bad video quality the alternate ending and beginning look like they are from a totally different film and do not have the bi look and feel other special features are small and without much substance the extended edition of the film itself is not spectacularly extended it is not a director 's cut \( the dvd states this upfront in the opening credits \) so it not fun to watch do n't get this if you are looking for a lotr style extended edition	16
1	this movie was the most disappointing piece of garbage i have ever seen aniston 's character goes through hell to see this guy wake up and when he finally does and shows her that he is ready to give her what she has been wanting she up and rejects him that is total nonsense i expected them to get back together in the end real people do not behave like this or maybe they do it would go a long way in explaining the suicide rate in this country	16
1	the crappiest dvd release ever ! video and audio quality sucks ! this is not a jet li movie buyer 's beware ! i 'll give this a negative rating	16
0	this movie is high in my top 10 off all times list and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie i can think of i watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying thrilling and suspenseful as it was when i saw it first more than 10 years ago my 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well great performance by all cast but especially hanks paxton and beacon probably ron howard best film ever	16

0	there are two story lines here one an unqualified celebration of the state of girls' prep sports after a generation of title ix 's beneficial impact and another the very qualified consideration of the state of some individual girls' athletic lives after a generation of title ix 's less beneficial side effects heartbreak fury exultation are the viewer 's rewards only quibble is that the climactic game was documented in too abbreviated a manner	16
0	jewish soles trying to avoid the devil 's brigade \( hitler 's killing machine \) sad but oh so funny and cute in sections that alas maybe only the jewish people would truly understand i found it all of these things but with love warmth to the end	16
1	this joe d'amato film takes the women in prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze bordering on pornography the plot or lack thereof is typical woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards corruption to make the film last 80 minutes joe d'amato fills the story with lesbianism vile tortures naked women in rat infested sewers and plenty of gratuitous sex i gave this movie 1 star because there is no option for a 0 star rating even hardcore fans of euro sex queen laura gemser will find this one a total bore	16
1	this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand portrayingthe gospel of john beautifully through the movie and slapping yahushua jesusand serious scholars in the face with the other hand the so called scholarly comments for example about how the gospel was written 200 years after the events are by and largeintellectually dishonest and quite simplyinaccurate even the lowliest of bible scholars if honest will realize this it is very sad to see people making a buck off the bible while trying to tearit down at the same time the worst examples of scripture put downs are in the 3rddvd i gave the movie to a relative without that add on	16
1	seriously the sound is the worst i have encountered on any dvd release a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles there is a lot of video jittery things going on it all adds up to my conclusion that the dvd version is transfered from a very very bad analog copy on top of all the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled dont buy this unless you are a fanatic wkw fan who already own all other releases	16
1	i do n't want to spoil this movie for others and i wo n't cache is french for hidden and alot was left hidden why does the son suddenly do what he did \? why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she 's doing \? i did n't care one bit about any of the charactors this is a slow going movie with no conclusion if you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry flip a coin i watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most us made films not this one	16
0	i was surprised to have learn of this very old live performance by cat stevens \( his name then \) i was well pleased with the quality of the performance format and of the tunes selection i was and still am a fan of his music nice to see a dvd concert of his it is old music but if you 're a fan of the man you 'll enjoy it	16
0	this dvd showcases a somewhat new \( as of the 2001 recording \) sound for sade with slightly poppier and quicker supporting music however sade 's voice adapts beautifully and she is one of those singers who just does n't need the standard studio treatment to sound tremendous her buttery chocolate lyrics come through with mesmerizing clarity on this dvd after a few years of owning this dvd i still enjoy and am transfixed by the wonderful editing sound and lights on this dvd i highly recommend it to add to your chill out collection no longer the jazzy sade of yesteryear the versatility of songs on this long \( almost 2 hours \? \) dvd will keep you grooving for hours	16
0	this movie is an action mystery space love story with a lot of interesting charecters and you really get into it there is little swearing and half a second of nudity which does n't show anything but somebodies backside i would recomend this movie the ending is a surprise and there is cool plot twists	16
0	the series just keeps on getting better the bob newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television the other funny show was newhart which i cannot understand why it has not been released on dvd the whole cast just clicks i wish shows like this were still on television if you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets !	16

1	i purchased dick cavett 's john lennon and yoko ono interview and it was great it was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material i gained new insight about john and yoko so i bought cavett 's interview of jimi hendrix expecting something similar the 15 minutes of glib questions by cavett produced nothing new about hendrix included in the dvd are a few minutes of jimi playing at woodstock the rest of the dvd is mediocre at best	16
0	it is a tragedy that brandon lee died while making this film had he lived the crow sequels would have been much better the crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace it set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990 's	16
1	i thought the movie was alright but i am sorry that i bought it i would rather have just rented it it seems like half of the movie is out of focus i am sure it is on purpose but i just do n't get it there are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price	16

1	reference picture quality on hd dvd basically unwatchable though i would not recommend the blind buy on this one	16
1	i would have liked a more real story in this dvd	16
1	i bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that i never got past the first 20 minutes i am not a prude but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff i put the video in my recycle box maybe it had some substance but i could not get past the first 20 minute	16
0	really worth seeing to learn about the life and talent of budd boetticher the collectors edition allows you to watch for the elements of the film that make it special	16
1	i was purchasing rockin' wheels \( the one with the train and fire truck \) for my son and the truck adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together we borrowed the rockin' wheels dvd from the library and he liked it so much i thought it would be good to have two different ones however the truck adventures is not as good and my son does n't even ask to watch it the songs are lame and so is the narrator do n't bother	16
0	this is the only movie that i really like made by woody allen but is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen	16
0	a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it the story is simple enough and not a whole lot happens but there 's no denying it this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way it 's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers and that the film does n't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience not one charachter is stereotyped they are human and they 'll probably remind you of people you know i applaud this kind of a movie and i wish there would be more of them	16
0	my 2 yr old son has watched this dvd again and again he 's not into cartoons so the real life airplanes trains and buses suit him perfectly	16
0	our one year old loves this one and so do i the music is wonderful the creative incorporation of vivaldi 's four seasons and monet 's masterpieces are entertaining and educational the children little puppets and sequences with toys and nature makes this interesting for our child we watch this one most of all the baby einstein 's that we have	16
1	this pilot is so bad the acting the writing the directing the costumes it 's a miracle that b5 ever got even one season approved by the suits at least they could have gotten decent actors pretty much every character on this pilot is represented by a piss poor actor and the writing is grade school \( i think this is what real people do \) tripe horrible rotten useless junk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	16
0	set two is really season three \( set five is season one \? \? \) and all the murders are excellent !	16
0	nothing beats this show archie was recently rated the number 1 television character of all time by bravo for a reason \( edith was number 12 \) highly recommend since the re runs that are seen on various tv stations are chopped by about 2 1 2 minutes a piece	16
0	i enjoyed high anxiety very much i happen to be a fan of mel brooks and all his movies it was entertaining and funny i would suggest it to anyone	16

1	my husband and i loved the original amityville and were so disappointed by this remake with the special effects we have nowadays i thought this movie would have been great i was wrong it was pure hollywood garbage	16
0	the bbc created the perfect cast in this terrific film watching it is like entering into a more pleasant world than the one that exists today it is lavishly adorned with beautiful costume and sets the latest adaptation is an insult to the major players in the bbc version highly recommend to those who love jane austin and her works	16
1	and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i'm 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i did n't for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved	16
1	i got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development my baby watched about two mintues and was gone i think this is pitched as a baby video but it 's really more geared toward older children none of the elements have anything to do with the music making is virtually useless as a learning development product i give it a big thumbs down try any one of the baby faith products like god made me god made music and god made animals they 're awesome !	16
1	this has already been expressed here in the reviews but just as a reminder one more time this dvd is not the original version the original version has more material and is much better hopefully someday they 'll release an unrated version the way it was on vhs at one time	16
1	this has got to be the absolutely the sickest bottom of the heap horror movie ever made you have been warned	16
0	this movie classic is a fabulous movie the story represents a common dilemma faced by 1st generation young people whose parents are immigrants here is this sensitive kind hearted fellow marty a butcher who just wants to meet a nice girl and get married nobody really wants him to be happy and have his own life especially his mother and his aunt these two actors play their character parts perfectly just like real battle axes from the old country etc they gossip and try to ruin his relationship with a nice girl he has just met it is hilarious and entertaining and very true to life i love watching this movie over and over	16
0	richard dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout \( along with partner emilio estevez \) of pretty madeleine stowe \( they have to watch her house through the night \) and he falls in love with her before the movie is over there 's a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer \( aidan quinn \) it 's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie but the script is above average especially the dialogue and dreyfuss 's performance is right on target a very entertaining movie definitely worth a watch	16
1	nothing but self important producer yacking about how accomplished he was at an early age as mere snipnets of what i thought was going to be a movie were shown very disappointing as listing did n't indicate that this was not the full movie uninterupped	16
1	travolta was great in saturday night fever but this country version just did n't work although he 's a good actor he just was wrongly cast in this film	16
0	this set is fine as far as it goes however where are the strawberry blonde and the oklahoma kid \? warners has given other actors 6 or 7 disc sets why not cagney \? on the other hand maybe a cagney volume 2 is in the works let 's hope so	16

0	there are n't enough movies like this these days family oriented \( centered actually \) adventure with edutainmental attributes great cast great score great \( albeit goofy \) story people give this film too much credit for being implausible which is exactly what makes it so much fun to imagine the ramifications if it were true if you 're looking for adventure and fun thrilling characters in a family film this is it	16
0	an awesome film with some suspense and raunchiness all rolled in to one	16
1	if you must see a cannibal film stick to cannibal holocaust the grindhouse release is well worth the money however the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful the picture quality is horrendous the movie is lacking any redeemable quality there are a few violent moments but just a few one of the absolute worst italian horror exploitation films made if cannibal holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films then ferox is the plan 9	16
0	firstly do n't let the dvd region 1 status put you off i am in australia and this disc played perfectly on my pc dvd player and even the ps2 ! it 's wonderful to finally see an intimate performance by elvis costello on dvd ! it brought so many memories of his tour in 2004 back to me elvis fans will love this dvd featuring his latest music along with many oldies it is very rare to get up close and personal with this man ! elvis gives 100 of himself on stage ! a must for your music dvd collection	16
1	everything is this movie seems out of place the old cliche quot good cop bad cop quot lived by sutherland and his pal does n't work at all ! dridget is in an awkward performance totally unconvincing unreal flat anyway it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a tremendous waste of time	16
1	i felt a little ripped off when i got volume 1 and 2 together as an offer from amazon com movie wise volume 2 is actually exactly the same as volume 1 with volume 2 having the option for japanese dialog and eng subtitle amazon could have at least indicated that in the quot description quot	16
1	this is the first and only dvds i will buy from this company this could be possibly the worst instructional videos that you could buy i learned absolutely nothing and the women were disgusting trust me do not buy this dvd if your life depends on it	16
0	this dvd contains all of the original ben stiller show episodes plus an extra un aired episode the show was not only far ahead of its time but also timeless as is evidenced by stiller 's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the tv series for anyone who was a fan of the tv series or stiller 's movies this dvd is a must	16
0	out of the seasons i have seen 1 5 this is my absolute favorite because sophia is my favorite character ans she just shines in this one she has some classic moments like when she goes to a friends funeral makes up with her friends husbad then comes home to get lucky and then married she leaads a secret life by doing volenteer work at a hospital and many many more great things the rest of the girls are great also \( as usual \) this is definatley the girls at their bes	16
1	getting the family to watch any of these is like pulling eye teeth and they were all for buying it	16
1	who would give the green light to this \? it is a total remake of the 1968 classic the only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it it pales in comparison to the original this was really weird to remake this movie dawn of the dead was cool b c it had a new fresh spin to the story this has no scares no atmosphere no innovations and no riveting performances skip this one	16
1	the so called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic it is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor a three year old will laugh at anything every turn of the plot is stupid this is in the running for the worst movie ever made i do n't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure i hope that bruce willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now i think he is a very good actor it 's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in to get his career going	16
1	terrible direction terrible writing it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid	16
0	a very well done and most interesting film on a very intelligent animal the dolphin it is perfect i'm buying copies to give to my friends	16
0	i enjoy all three of the the jurassic park movies though i think quot the lost world quot is a bit weak while i think that anyone who enjoys action movies monster movies or horror movies should own all three i find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies but a fourth dvd containing substantial background information on the making of the movies i give this collection four stars only because the larger more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two you will definitely like the third movie	16
0	this special addiction dvd of reefer madness from twentieth century fox home entertainment is truly awesome ! ! ! includes both original black and white and colorized versions of the now cult classic ! ! ! plus some great extras too including 2 commentaries and the hilarious gandpa 's marijuana handbook ! two thumbs up ! ! ! five stars ! !	16

0	the documentary showed some highlights of some excellent flying by various pilots however it did not show the abilities of different jets and pilots from different nato countries the actual excercise is much longer and the documentary could have covered morethe presentation both the picture and sound are top notch we found out that not every dvd system can read the imax presentation	16
1	love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one	16
1	when i first got this disc the other day it would not play at all i installed the latest firmware update to my xbox360 hd drive and it played however it does not play well at all the video is constantly dragging or skipping the audio is fine though i ca n't really provide a review of the content since so far it is unwatchable this is the only disc that has given me issues	16
0	for sheer excitement you cannot beat this dvd the music is exciting arranged well for brass ensemble and recorded with high quality but that 's only the beginning in blast the band vigorously acts out all the pieces they perform how they manage this energy level will flat out amaze you i can honestly say that after just seeing these performances you are as happily exhausted as the performers must be prepare to be thrilled	16
1	does anyone know if there is a real pg 13 version of this film \? i 've been told it came out as a pg 13 and then was changed to an r film pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see	16
1	i can only imagine how painful it must of been to quot act quot in this film after the first half hour it was like a train crash to watch do anything you can to get out of sitting through this	16
1	i could n't watch this till the end bad production values gimmicky desperate to make a point about violence and voyeurism and evil and wanting to make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide from the nnui if you wanna go all deep thoughts on violence and still get shaken both intelectually and viscerally try something like miike 's ichi the killer makes this movie look so so needless the leading man looked geeky and occasionally cute 2 stars for the eye candy	16
1	this was one of the worst group performances i have ever seen ! unbelievable that disney has financed this hack act and the tread has only started with other weak talented groups coming out of disney save your money for a better movie	16
0	if you want to see lena heady 's breasts exposed this is the film to watch but besides the numerous unnecessary topless scenes \( which are n't too bad \) this film is very intriguing the human spirit tries to break through walls of addiction frustration and isolation now is n't that what a suspense drama should be about	16
1	with a very good scenario and a fantastic kris kristofferson the film is slow over male attitude and finally poorly made and boring	16
0	we enjoyed this video the rugby athletes are fun to watch in such a surreal setting somehow these tough big athletes being posed and shot in various homoerotic poses gives new meaning to sporn	16
0	i became a robson green fan when i saw the first season of wire in the blood since then i have read the books and watched green in his other crime series touching evil if you like to watch films about police solving serial killer crimes you will enjoy this the crimes are shocking the denouement is interesting and at the heart of the story is the developing relationship between dr tony hill \( green \) and the police woman with whom he works these crimes	16
1	this movie was awfull supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion	16
0	for those reviewers who have not seen the remakes see dail m for murder by alfred hitchcock perfect murder starring michael douglas and gyneth paltrow not to mention countless tv movies of the week this is the original and the best barbara stanwyck is superb as is burt lancaster moody and dark and suspenseful	16
1	i saw a glimpse of this movie earlier on hbo and was interested enough to purchase the dvd too bad i did n't watch the movie first when it was free ! james earl jone 's acting abilities were wasted on this movie and i wo n't comment on the others i'm glad that our armed forces are not as inept as portrayedin this film sorry i ca n't be more complimentary but	16
1	i grew up watching sesame street and truly love the muppets however i have to say this video was not what i expected there were some great vintage clips but not enough muppets monsters for me this video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing i would recommend you pass on this one and get 123 count with me instead	16
1	i often wonder if some if not most of the people writing rave reviews 5 stars are really paid biased professionals pumping up the movie for increased dvd sales	16
1	i had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea i do n't know if it because i tend to like more horror type movies or what but i was really bored by them each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way i know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense the movies were violent but nothing one has n't seen before several times so i am not sure about the shock value of it i was n't shocked disturbed or upset just bored	16
0	clarification after reviewing the set and then receiving the set i must applaud a amp e for the brilliant 20 minute behind the scenes special on the 5th disc ! finally the puppeteers get to talk about their work and you actually get to see inside the puppet 's heads ! also on disc 5 they did include the lost footage from the 40th episode ! bravo	16
1	i loved the rm and expected the same level out of this movie but my husband 's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest the teenagers did n't even want to check it out after that scene they also loved the rm if you can get it from the library go ahead but do n't spend money on it	16
1	ca n't add much to the discussion about the movie but wanted to say that this dvd listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of school daze it says it has both full screen and widescreen but it doesnt	16
1	i collect 1950s era sci fi and i have been replacing my vhs versions with dvds unfortunately i need to keep my vhs version for this movie because the print that image entertainment made this from was in such poor shape the vhs version by uav entertainment \( the wade williams collection \) is much better hopefully uav will come out with a dvd version soon	16
1	yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg 13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot \? wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast \( from oscar nominee matt dillon kevin bacon etc \) can turn candy into cuisine	16
1	the only reason i gave this dvd set 2 stars instead of the 5 that i would rate the show itself is because there are absolutely no extras on this dvd set no featurettes no cast interviews not even any episode commentaries while i appreciate the studios putting the season sets out in such a timely manner i 'd prefer they take a little longer and give us some fun extras to go along with the wonderful episodes	16
0	well at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet beware the theme song may start to make adults twitch after a while the dvd has a different narrator than the original \( neal morrissey \) videos but all in all a good viewing for the under 5s	16
0	i echo most of the previous reviews this hayley mills vehicle has little to do with the excellent mary stewart novel that it shares some of its title with hayley was too young to be the novel 's heroine and so for this film the plot and romance were 'youthened' sanitized \( though the novel 's romance was also chaste \) and also very much dumbed down as a featherweight hayley mills film this is harmless and very much a lesser disney film of the 60s just do n't expect this to be more than it is and you might enjoy it even with your kids of today as a retro laugh	16
1	ah um well my brother picked this up not too long ago and well it sucks ! it 's the worst of the whole series ! i thought it would have to do with the mask michael wears in the others but not a ficken thing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i gave it two stars because i liked the killing scene in the hospital but then i took one because of how bad the rest was	16
1	incredible i saw one review describing this production the meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is not incredible it is slow convoluted and uninspired no chemistry exists between the actresses with no connection to the audience	16
0	feeding the cat those girls shold put on a sweater love this movie 50 's detective noir set in 70 's california the beach the hospital mexico the supermarket it 's all great and the theme song keeps going throughout over and over final scene pays homage to the third man beautiful a bit of violence but that 's how i treat someone i love and i do n't even like you never seen an elliot gould movie i like more than this it 's my favorite altman as well	16
0	together with 'odyssey into the minds eye' two of my favorite dvds in my collection they may be watched forever because the constant change of images and inventions cannot be retained by memory enormous visual pleasure with appropriate soothing sound track there is something healing in this flow of beautiful worlds and mind conceptions	16
0	this movie was one of the most honest accurate portrayals of how to play the dating game i have ever seen i liked it so much i bought it for my 15 year old son to give him pointers ignore the tacked on hollywood ending	16
1	over half of this movie consists of scenes taken from the original 1939 classic film directed by zoltan korda even those scenes ca n't disguise the remake 's network tv movie quality beau bridges is generally a good actor but he is terribly miscast on this film go rent both versions of the four feathers and see it for yourself	16
1	i suppose it 's alright if you like overlong musicals focusing on maniacal manipulative mothers	16
0	all men can do anything if they will seems to be the final statement of this captivating picture carefully directed by agnieszka holland one of the major female directors in the world this absorbing drama turns around the lives and times of three children who will meet each one another and exchange livings and fortunate encounters on one hand our little girl will know the world is not turning around her and her initial solitude will be rewarded when she found out a hiddden that will make her dreams come true and finally she will the one in order to impluse and bring back her cousin to the life a triumph of the cinema and definitively one of my top twenty best films of the nineties	16
0	this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since don't look now back in '73 this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out alongside white noise as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense	16
0	one of the last good comidies that isnt outragously stupid	16
0	with king creole love me tender and stay away joe jailhouse rock 1957 is elvis presley at his best he declined the old musical tradition of mgm and insisted on a contemparary look especially how the choreography should be executed in this film we see elvis presley at his very best he was a stunning actor much more prefer him to james dean it`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films only a handful stands out and jailhouse rock is the best it isn`t a classic it isn`t even great but we have elvis the king and that`s the best there is \) \)	16
1	this movie is typical hollywood anti war anti military anti american trash the show biz liberals aided and abetted by their ideological cousins the left wing tv news moguls have always sought to portray american soldiers in viet nam as baby killing drug crazed monsters this movie is typical of that ilk if you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war buy the dvd of we were soldiers a much better and far more honest film	16

1	i have read several of hiaasen 's books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character erin to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i as a woman just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did	18
1	this book does cover alot of information not needed for clep but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep i wanted to ensure i was prepared for the clep so i purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments although they were right about the obscurity this book still taught me alot you do n't necessarily need it but if you want to be prepared this book will not hurt your bank account that much i also recommend the complete itiots guide to american literature \( 5 stars check out the reviews \) and the internet that is all you need	18
0	i would recommend the power of simplicity to everyone this book goes far beyond a discussion of marketing strategy the idea of simplicity is relevent to all aspects of life this book is full of useful information and contraversial suggestions pertaining to marketing strategy although the book is considered an educational read i feel that it is extremily entertaining as well it 's just an interesting book it doesnt get much simpler than that	18
1	melrose larry green 's book is full of quotes quotes and information used to back up points are good things he appears to have researched by surfing the internet watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others this is all fine and acceptable the problem with why the clintons belong in prison is when the author \( cut and paste expert \) attempts his own narrative which is sporadic jumpy and poorly edited his points are not linear and show the author 's attention deficit with a proper literary team this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a hit and run report and reads like a one sided sensationalized talk radio program	18
0	this book is geat for the whole family the illitrations are fantastic and funny it 's about pa who moved to california and sends a note to tell his familly to move to california they take a stage coach from missorii to california and it took 21 days to get there there are funny people in this book ma in this book has a secret in the end so read the book to find out buy this book for the kids and it will make them smile so much that there smile will stay there so buy this book right now ! ! ! !	18

0	i felt that the book was basically the same as the previous edition with the exception of aromatherapy and electric filing unfortionatly no one book can give all of the information that is required about a subject that is what teaching is all about i generally supplement the material from other books and florida law so our students stay on the right path over all i would have to say that this book was above average and addressed many of the changes in the industry to date	18

0	having had the delight of living in st andrews and traveling over most of scotland playing golf allan 's book is the best i have seen by far for describing the reality of golf travel and living in scotland he sugarcoats nothing his opinion mirrors mine and he is interested is ensuring his readers know exactly what to expect and know exactly how to best user their time and travel dollars even with my scottish experience and contacts his book is my golf travel in scotland bible	18

0	quiller 's guide is the most systematic color text available it combines a deep knowledge of traditional color theories with a huge amount of quiller 's personal research into how paints actually mix as colors central to the book is quiller 's color mixing wheel for watercolors oils and acrylics probably the most accurate color wheel available in any published work \( though he has a revised color wheel available separately \) he explores the monochrome analogous complementary and split complementary color schemes through many demonstration paintings and detailed mixing instructions he emphasizes repeatedly the importance of a strong value composition and careful variations in color saturation in building the painting an indispensible book	18
1	american buffalo was recommended to me by a fellow thespian because he thought this was raw and fantastic it is indeed raw but not at all fantastic the dialogue is very choppy and i felt out of the loop with it as if i missed some great detail perhaps this is a play that needs to be enjoyed when seen performed rather than just read i do not recommend	18
1	this book was written so long ago but has been re released with a new cover it contains racist terms and old fashioned dialog i wished i had been more aware and had bought a more updated history of new orleans	18
0	i came across this book while on vacation in a cabin in minnesota i read the entire thing in two days and loved it so much i considered taking it with me ! this was back before the internet and it took me nine years to find a copy of it that i could buy it was worth the wait these are some of the best short stories i 've ever read they are very well written original and gripping tales that are fun to read and reread if only there were more writers like mr ellin	18

1	i tried reading it and made it about 3 4 pages i'm pretty sure that 's a bad sign i seem to recall mr sedaris writing about his mother 's bedpan or something the impression i instantly got was beep beep ! pretentious young writer peddling so called bad childhood experiences for fame money and sympathy guess what mr sedaris \? i do n't give a \( expletive deleted \) about your so called bad childhood millions of people have bad childhoods and do n't play the sympathy card check out augusten burrough 's books they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style	18

0	there is not one book this woman has been involved in that i did n't like so far many stories you will find in her book have different personalities which i find refreshing she has been involved in many science fiction projects and when i go to pick up a book with her name on it i know there will be something if not everything i will enjoy in that book there should be no question when you see a book with her name on it that you should open that book and read a while	18
1	why use 1 word when 12 will bewilder the reader and make the book that much thicker i can not believe that a qualified editor reviewed this book the wheat to chaff ratio is horrendous you can go whole paragraphs without coming upon anything worth knowing i can only hope that the actual cisa exam questions are not written as poorly as the sample questions within this book if you value your time do not buy this book	18
1	if you want the why and the wherefore stay away informative to general audiences it provides little scientific support for its contention with the wealth of information out there this was not the critical review needed nor was it terribly informative about any particular statin caused effect	18
1	i was the commander of my highschools afjrotc rocket club so my godfather bought em this book it is very informative but if you are just building basic este kits then this is way to advanced for you as it was for me and the other cadets in the club but if you are really into rockets this book is for yo	18
0	i ran into this book accidentally while doing some research instead of glancing through it i ended up reading the whole book i just could n't put it off content wise the book does n't bring me many quot light bumb moments quot however i find it extremely well written rhetorically while the book is easy to read it is literarily graceful i 'd suggest everyone to read it just to enjoy the beauty of language	18
1	a useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing accounting standards and approaches between countries however it is not worth the price it is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students it is more suitable for general second year accounting students plus as i am working with a multinational european bank in japan the book is rapidly becoming out of date there is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries	18
1	i tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that i put it down in frustration it reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat the theme is interesting the execution poor cannot recommend	18
1	while the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive what i think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics an example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter but does n't go into detail on how to tie the structural members together he just tells you that you need to tie them together what if you do n't have a shoelace to use \? what other alternates are there \? this book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire but it 's not enough for the serious camper	18
0	the four tales in this collection are beautifully composed they are art not just stories each story is deep in its unique complexities each one has plots and subplots and paints an impeccable image of the story upon the reader 's mind and when i look back upon the book as a whole upon the adventurous stories the excitement and emotion that the author presents so exquisitely i ca n't help but be extremely impressed	18
1	i read this book for a book report and because i could not choose another one i could not stop reading it because i was forced to read this book i now have the knoledge and misfortune of this pathetically boring story the steriotypical characters hurried through the story full of excuses 1 star for one very boring book	18
1	not easy for any beginner to use unless you knew exactly what kind of silver you were trying to identify i e english scottish irish etc it was a bit confusing marks are black amp white some not showing very good clarity and everything is in extremely in small print if you just want to sort through tons of marks and dates this may be for you if you want information about your piece pass it up	18
1	this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up	18
1	when i found hour game in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale i thought i had hit pay dirt but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as the winner and absolute power could turn out such a dog long boring and confusing i fear that mr baldacci hired an aspiring young writer to help him crank out a quick book i cannot pass this book along to my friends i could n't do that to them it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin what a waste what a shame	18
1	the topic of this book is very interesting espionage in the revolutionary war unfortunately washington 's spies goes into so much nit picking detail that as the cliche goes you ca n't see the forest for the trees to really get anything out of this book you 'd have to be a very dedicated revolutionary war buff it did n't have much appeal at all to me as a general reader	18
0	i found this book very helpful in outlining the importance of research amp of tracking earnings estimates mitch zacks gives a good overview of what the key factors are in determining whether a stock will perform the zacks rank was also interesting as it looks like it has performed very well over the past years it seems as if the zacks rank really is accurate and more imporartantly a successful investing method this is the first book i have read that has actually helped me make money rather than just provide broad based market overviews one sometimes reads overall good book i would definitely recommend it	18
0	i believe this will be very helpful for christian people to understand who god is through the life	18

0	i decided to read this on a flight to indiana from ny i managed to complete the book on the return it is a quick read not a self help book more about merton and nouwen finding their true self as well as the author 's road to becoming a jesuit i think we all want to find our true self but not all can and some never attempt to martin stresses the importance of finding our true self in order to achieve happiness that comes from within	18

0	arrived on time and in terrific shape ! thanks	18
1	cooper 's book is yet another warm and fuzzy management guru text from yet another management guru who never served a day as a real manager of a real company it contains all sorts of motherhood and apple pie stories along with trite sayings such as quot when you find a back door that 's open close it quot or my personal favorite quot use the lanterns of your life to help light the way quot if you 're looking for an inspirational book one with a solid basis forget this one you 'd be better off reading the daily horoscope	18
1	does not show you techniques rather it just shows pictures ! after buying this book i was very disappointed since i thought it will show me makeup tips and tricks rather it just shows displays of women 's faces you will waste your money on purchasing this book	18
1	this is one of kellerman 's poorest books when you finally get to what is going on it is ridiculous do n't waste your time on this	18
0	it is in my opinion the second best anne book ! its anne 's wedding ! the whole thing is soaked in romance ! leslie 's story is so amazing and sweet that you have to love her captain jim is so sweet and perfect you can nearly see him miss cornelia is funny and susan is great anne has to deal with tragedy and joy that makes the books so wonderful the only thing i do n't like is that i wish marrilla and all the avonlea people would be in it a little more in my opinion this should be where the series ends	18
1	tedious and inane come to mind it is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a catty pseudo feminist style rambling descriptions of egyptian archaeology real or imagined thinly veiled racist comments about the ignorant natives of egypt and inept sexual innuendo the book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced the characters do not come across as real very disappointing leave this one on the library shelf	18
1	this book is trying too hard to emphasize in being funny it is filled with mediocre 'funny' patters that the readers are encouraged to use but the quality of the actual magic effects demonstrated is poor balancing two forks on the edge of a glass should not be considered magic once you read a few samples the reading becomes stifling knowing that you are not going to learn anything new that other magic books cannot teach you some areas are brighter the photos are clear and it blends magician bios and history within but one can do better with other books around	18
1	i have listened to a bunch of dean koontz books while listening to the second one i saw so many similarities which really turned me off and this flaw continued which each book i listen to which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book however most of the stories were pretty good so i stuck with him this is not the case with this book cold fire is absolutely horrible i so regret purchasing this book it is so bad that i have decided to swear off dean for looooooooong while just on a side note the bad place is the first dk book i read and it was very entertaining	18
1	my mother bought this for me for christmas she used the available new and used section to get it a little cheaper she ended up paying 160 or so when i put this on my wish list i thought that this hardcover version would be the arabic english english arabic considering that it was 175 and the paperback of the arabic english only was available for 45 as it turns out this is only the hardcover of the arabic english only so for one my mother paid an additional 115 for only the hardcover version of a book that i could have gotten in the paperback for 45 i still do not have the english arabic of the hans wehr edition	18
1	definitely not one of his best ! slow slow slow but at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language unlike the hero of the partner who learned a little known spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks	18
1	the author keeps referring to the lds church as a cult by definition a cult is a religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian charismatic leader in christ 's day many would have considered his movement \( christianity \) a cult by definition and now it 's the largest religious form of worship in the world so let mormons do their thing there 's upwards of 12 000 000 of them now so i guess they 're not a cult anymore	18
1	unfortunately this book is the sign of what passes for humour these days even though it may have been remotely funny \( sometimes the author comes close to being bearable \) the book never actually tries to be humour is supposed to be smart however this book gives us the worst case of dumb	18
1	i love dogs but if i had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training including the different levels snd sub levels i would have bought a manual i wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing i got neither the characters were neither likeable nor substantive except for the cop next door i have no idea what they even look like or what if anything they care about besides dogs the plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear maybe the series inmproves after this book i'm not taking that chance	18
1	obviously from all the reviews this book appeals to many people i am not one of them perhaps it 's because i do n't care for science fiction i found the writing stilted the footnotes distracting to the point i stopped bothering with them the story boring and the ending \( covered in the introduction \) to be a twilight zone cliche if like me you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed	18
0	i 've been a skating fan for many years and would recommend this book to everyone ! i thoroughly enjoyed the inside look at brian boitano 's career from start to present it 's easy to read so one can browse through it like a newspaper or magazine but it 's also stuffed full of valuable information about the technical aspects of skating and the quot behind the scenes quot preparation activities for competitive skaters the beautiful pictures lend itself to being picked up and enjoyed again and again ! hats off to brian boitano suzanne harper and all the people who helped create this treasure for my coffee table	18
1	this book is the worst book ever i did n't know there could possibly be a book this bad if you are required to read this book like me i feel bad for you do not read this book for pleasure because it is not a pleasant book it is painful to read if you are still thinking of reading this bad book don't read it ! ! take my advice	18
0	i first read about this wonderful book on one of the services that provides reading guides for book clubs i was intrigued by the premise and knew i had to buy it this is one book that did not let me down ! i was captivated from the moment i began i read in greed hungering for the next diary entry i completed it much too quickly and had to re read some entries i found myself wondering about some of the women \( many are still on my mind \) i am so pleased that book two is in the works this is a book that is too good to miss	18
1	if you have kids or grandkids who think about politics like sf give them this book ! it was one of the many heinlein works that helped me grow up it is the best most important of his for kids novels i ment to give it 5 stars ! ! ! !	18
0	i intend to have the very first item in this read at my memorial service which i hope wo n't be soon ! some of this was slightly dated but always good reading he had such a unique take on his world and such a down to earth way of looking at the goings on around him	18
1	this story is very dark full of menace and dark thoughts not great for kids ok for adults if that 's what you like a hard story not much gentleness in it except for a couple of moments	18
1	if you have had any exposure to good literature you will find this novel nearly insufferable the symbolism is cliche narrative style predictable and unoriginal and the book as a whole is this woman 's self indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read if she had any creative ability she could use her family history as a starting point but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh dull dry predicatable callow and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student	18
1	the writing was not what i expect of andre norton too many gaps and information that is disjointed whether this is a consequence of collaboration i do n't know i felt this should have had a strong editor to point out where things should be tightened for example at the start we know kirion has sent people to capture his sister the book covers over 2 years but you hardly hear of this again i cannot imagine the sorcerer would just have let it drop i am a long time fan and retired children 's librarian sic fi fantasy is my favorite genre but this one i had to push to finish unsatisfying	18
0	it took cancer to wake me up i now do everything i can to inform my family and friends of the of the importance of a health lifestyle and eating habits this author also wrote what you do n't know may be killing you these two books are great to accidently leave at a loved ones home they are filled with tons of improtant messages and very easy to relate to examples are given that help you understand what actually is happening to your body my dad has gone from drinking no water to probably half of what he needs but this is a start he will read more the next time i leave another book by accident this author is great !	18
0	the sunday philosophy club and the other 2 titles in this series by john mccall smith are everything the fans of mme ramotswe would hope they would be leaving botswana was hard but now we are in edinborough scotland and isabelle dalhousie is as wise and vulnerable and real and wonderful as her african predecessor it is a miracle that a man can write his women characters so believably and so lovably it is another miracle that anyone can write such absorbing cozy engrossing books this is good literature and good fun the sunday philosophy club along with friends lovers chocolate and the more recent the right attitude toward rain are too wonderful to miss welcome to scotland	18

0	my two boys ages 3 and 2 both pull this book off the shelf over and over i use it to teach the younger one new vocabulary \( both in english and spanish \) and the older one to continue to practice his numbers \( also in both languages \) as well as colors it 's a great addition to the workbook flip flop spanish and also just for fun my littlest a one year old girl even looks at the pages and will sit with the boys to watch them they 're sturdy pages full of all kinds of things the kind of book you find something new each time you open it it has little lists to find items as well	18
1	this book was very boring details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating this book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it a poll was taken and about 73 of the students in the school liked this book what does that show about the book \?	18

0	this version of the old favorite is an interactive delight engaging all the senses of reader and listener as they sing and play their way through the story each page offers endless possibilities to captivate the interest and attention of the youngest readers the progressive repetion of the song makes learning it fun and easy all the colorful digressions especially the silly commentaries on each page can lead to more fun games wonderfully illustrated sturdy pages	18

0	they are books like those written by stephen ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning some have accused ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts to those i would say bah humbug ! this book is well written and worthy of the readers time unless of course you are a fact checker in which case the original sources to the extent they even exist might be more to your liking for orginary joe 's like me mr ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information i would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the indian wars	18

0	this is a great book for a piano student it allows them to enjoy true music while learning how to play fairly easy pieces these are n't little dittys made up to teach notes it is classical music beautiful dreamer by stephen foster traumerei by robert schumann and the happy farmer by robert schumann are my favorite pieces they are a joy to learn and play ! this music makes you want to practice i also recommend my first book of christmas carols as well	18
0	to learn some italian before visiting italy i tried multiple language learning programs borrowed from my local library some were ridiculous many required using a workbook then i stumbled on the pimsleur program which is totally audio allowing me to learn italian while i drove to and from work due to the pedagogically sound method pimsleur developed for language learning i actually did learn some basic italian as a result i bought conversational italian though i 've never considered myself adept at language learning i actually felt confident in my ablility to learn italian as a result of these cds i 've raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language	18
0	this is for sure a great book if you have the ability to concentrate for more than five minutes unlike the majority of the herd in mean people of today if your intrest lies in the substance of this book read some other review i'm only going to tell you that the \( 1909 \) publication stinks the so called book is more like a oversized magizine and the print is about the size of a footnote in the bible	18
1	i had somewhat forgotten how greg bear wrote his descriptions of the jart are so obscure and long winded the reader may as well just turn the page i found it annoying that greg bear attempted to invent even more words in this book than eon my largest complaint however resided in the high number of typos duplicated words letters dropped etc that made the reading even more disruptive it really looked like there had been global replacements as the same errors were repeated while i 'd admit that an author is more concerned with flow plot and technical accuracy the editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals	18
0	this book was great it read well and never was too slow it was fair to both sides of the war and the leaders who fought the battles and planned the campaign it was complete in that it discussed the men tactics weapons and terrain in the southern campaign not only was this book a great souce for the southern war but it also gave good insight into the revolutionary war in general if you 're interested in this topic and want to increase you 're knowledge of the southern war get this book it 's informative as well as pleasing to read	18

1	here 's a real review the first 100 pages are about how her mother made her get a nose job that when wrong the second 100 pages are about the frankenstein movie the last 90 pages are about every movie star that 's ever gotten cosmetic surgery and the whole thing is stitched together with an english teacher 's weekend theory on how a mix of simulations and simulacra the ego and the id explain why people get cosmetic surgery if you 're someone who orders books online based on catchy titles then do yourself a favor and skip this one how can a book on cosmetic surgery not even talk about the golden ratio \?	18
0	i took my last science course about 40 years ago and had forgotten how interesting science can be this book is not light reading and some people will probably not get past the first few pages but i really enjoyed it i found tons of new information on mushrooms in spite of the fact that i studied mushrooms in college \( until my father decided science was not for girls and convinced me to go to law school yep those were the good old days \) you will enjoy it as long as you take into account that it is a scientific book perfect for geeks	18

1	wow ! i read all these great reviews and thought this would be a great book luckily i got it out of the library did n't buy it i liked it at first but then the situations got more more implausible then i was reading it just to laugh at it some of the sentences in the book were completely ridiculous too if i had the book here at work with me maybe i could quote a couple descriptions that just had me rolling my eyes not a well written book at all in my humble opinion glad the rest of you enjoyed it anyway	18
0	along with from science to god mr russell establishes himself as one of the masters of spiritual reawakening although this piece has more doomsday in it than his later work it has the same hopeful message and the same readability in both books mr russell never seems to lose the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo even when discussing very complicated subjects that is n't a statement on his intelligence or research but rather on his ability to communicate on all levels neither does he offend when he deals with the spiritual aspects of his writings in short everyone can sit around his table \( well almost everyone \) read'em twice	18
1	the characters are uninteresting and 2 dimensional the dialog hackneyed i have no idea why it 's on the new york times bestseller list it was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else do n't waste your money	18
1	a great resource for first time and experienced importers who do not fully understand their responsibilites as an importer	18
1	flynn offers up a fast paced if unbelievable story unfortunately character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences characters like rapp with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles have all the answers and are always showing those good for nothing politicians how the real world works meanwhile flynn 's politicians \( the majority of whom are democrats \) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters flynn consistently goes for the cheap partisan stereotype i was looking for a well developed political military thriller i'm still looking	18

0	an ex officer in the argentinean military confesses how political prisoners were murdered i ca n't write quot highly recommended quot about this book because it seems to trivialise those horrible events to some marchendising event just read it you may not be able to sleep for few nights but you 'll get a true look into the mirror of evil regimes supported by the united states only because they were quot anti communist quot	18
1	being a second generation member of this so called cult and having parents that went through the same situation as the author i can say that he must have too weak to fulfill his duty to god and true parents it 's very sad when a member must leave by sacrifcing you are able to develop a stronger relationship with god hope this helps	18

1	you get a view into 60 's white america the only people of color in this book are a policeman and a caricature i do n't have a problem with other seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe this is set in everyday life and i think its best left on the bookshelf it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair not to mention various shades of skin colour the rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one dimensional quot white quot depiction of the world	18
0	the essential histories series from osprey could easily be compared to the cliff notes series they 'll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with but no real depth most volumns are under 100 pages therefore do n't expect many man in the trenches stories this volumn is a nice introduction to a recent war and presented a bit better than most in the series	18

0	very topical easy read hope people in the know read this and give serious thought to the potential for something like this happening gives good reason why border control should be taken more serious by everybody looking forward to reading other books by mr bell	18
0	this is a wonderful book that catches the subtle and yet glaring clashes of outlook on country and escape grounded firmly in love and faithfulness it moves quickly i was afraid of a tragedy at the end but the resolution is quietly reassuring and poignant the grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that 's understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of julie and abu and it is not transient but deepens miriam abu 's sister remains with me in her moving quietude and the litle girl lela hand in hand with julie plucks deep	18

1	i thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget i was wrong instead it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands on all kinds of architectural extravagances perhaps this book could have a subtitle how to spend a million dollars on a 1 500 square foot house if you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply this is the wrong book	18
0	tina dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case which encompasses motherhood mental illness child abuse and matricide dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion that in and of itself is impressive because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other get caught up in emotion and appear unable to really present all sides of the story lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society 's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention it is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them but also tragically failed their mother	18

0	yes it 's the bible of cooking its like a degree at the culinary institute however its not an easy book to cook from most recipes refer to several parts of the book for details on how to prepare different parts of the recipe so you contstantly have to page back and forth in the book its intimidating for the novice who just wants to cook but if you really want to learn about cooking then its the book to have	18
1	what should have been a fascinating book at the very least as a voyeuristic experience fails to deliver largely due to its poorly written pages the text stumbles along from incomprehensible link to allusive derailment making the mistake of huge chunks of repetitive material which inevitably detract from the fascinating subject matter perhaps more of an editng disaster than an author 's failure at the heart of which lies a story deserving a more coherent telling	18
0	i give this book a 4 star rating not because i believe in the necronomicon but because this particular book has given some very interesting background and historical information on the occult scene in the 1970s the simon necronomicon itself is an interesting tome \( though i doubt it 's authenticity per se \) it is at least as valid a grimoire as any other and more valid than some dead names has provided a great deal of information on certain people whose backgrounds are generally not known as well as the unique wandering bishop phenomena and the so called slavonic orthodox church overall both an informative and entertaining volume whether you believe or not	18

0	i enjoyed this book having read other non fiction frontier books however i must say that the degree to which the author delves into how to make certain tools objects etc i could have done without i would skip through parts like those describing how to build a bean cooker because such descriptions were so detailed if you 're a technical hands on person then you probably would like knowing how items tools were built from raw materials in the frontier but for me i was more interested in the story than the instructionals	18

1	what a chore this book was to read if it were n't for my ocd about finishing books that i start i would 've read the first couple of chapters and then given up it seems like a wannabe suspense but it 's not it seems like there might be a love story in it but there 's not it feels like there might be a creepy angle in it but there is not what i can gather about this book is that the author thinks she 's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy she tries to make a connection but falls way short read vinegar hill that one was worth it pass midnight champagne by	18
1	i tried as hard as i could but just could not get into this book not quite as bad as her book impossible but close danielle steel is getting so repetitive in her writing basically this book repeated over and over how much quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he did n't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying dead drivel she could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves but no a waste of time very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all disappointing to say the least	18

0	i read a review of this in l a weekly which said that it was quot a lot of fun quot and entertaining in a sort of ironic way despite the fact that it became more slapstick at the end i read it and agreed for the most part except i felt that the characters were much stronger and wittier than i had expected and the author seemed more generous to them than i would have thought from the initial satirical tone the ending was a little over the top but it was an example of the kind of senseless fireworks these characters would have to simulate in their own lives all in all i thought it was a very intelligent and amusing first novel	18
0	this commentary has many tremendous insights into the book of romans romans is one of the richest resources of truth within the bible and john stoot does a good job of unpacking it the book is written from a framework of the reader having a strong prior understanding of the scriptures it is probably not considered a highly scholarly work but it is not for the average reader to pick up for light reading either	18
1	i have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask i have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail it just does n't click for me i f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but i just cannot do it my self	18
1	disappointed as an english teacher i expected a more compelling and less hokey use of whitman the first story of the deformed whitman loving boy was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging	18
1	i might have been expecting too much but i was disappointed with this book i did not learn anything on dark magick per se the first half of the book is about a variety of subjects like goths vampires lost souls the collective unconscious dark deities satanism and some other stuff the second half is about magick but it sounds more like high magick to me where 's the dark magick	18
1	this book started well but fell flat in the middle what little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through even the shooting incident could n't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly well i did n't bother to finish it i have limited time for reading and i do n't like to waste it	18

1	this is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature it is timely but it is not timeless not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly not one scene is memorable the true nature of the book soap opera is cloaked under its many pages messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story and she seems to have believed her publicity machine i ca n't believe that her husband who a great literary critic would not talk her out of publishing this oh i forgot money and fame trumps quality every time	18

0	wow wow wow get this book ! this has \( just about \) everything you need to be professional the only thing i did n't like is that most of the resources listed were geared to nyc residents but there was good direction as to how to locate similar services in your area i especially liked the opening that deals with how artists are helping to perpetuate their own starving artist myth and the ways to stop that it made me realize that i am the one standing in the way of my own success ! well no more thanks to caroll i am taking all of the steps listed i wish my graduate school had this information available	18
0	when i first discovered this book in a london bookshop i decided at once that i needed to own it it 's large it 's bulky but it 's beautiful it needs the large pages to illustrate the finest examples of tom 's works as an artist myself who learnt a lot from tom 's unique techniques i appreciate what a fantastic collection of art both colour and black and white has been compiled into this collection but it 's not just pictures there 's an insight into the man himself a delightful tribute to the master of homoerotic art this volume is a great tribute to tom and a valuable tool for the new breed of erotic artists like myself waiting for recognition	18

1	do you like romance novels \? do you call your dogs your babies \? this is the book for you the thriller aspect of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion and the annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive most readers over the edge this was my first johansen novel and it most certainly will be my last two stars for actually wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends	18

0	practical sage advice from stanley not as good as his follow up the millionaire mind this book is somewhat pedantic it also suffers from the fact it 's extremely dry the author 's writing is much more engaging in his followup and that 's a much faster read in addition to offering some practical tips the millionaire next door also lends itself to parody in books like dave barry 's money secrets a book called maybe life 's just not that into you and something from andy borowitz the name of which escapes me if you have to choose between the millionaire next door and the millionaire mind go with the latter	18

0	this book of eight stories by virginia woolf shows virginia 's mind at work demonstrating her quot stream of consciousness quot each story flows from one thought to another asking different questions about life for example quot the mark on the wall quot questions the meaning of life and existence quot an unwritten novel quot is about what people hide and what you do n't know about a person you seat next to on an quot omnibus quot all these stories will make you look at life in a slightly different way	18
0	i really enjoyed this book i could pore over the fashions the interior decoration it satisfied my desire to see all the details ! at the same time i got a sense of the passage of time in virginia and vanessa 's lives read as a companion to any of woolf 's novels i think the book would also convey a sense of the writing process it evokes the time and place beautifully and the text is not intrusive the images are allowed to take centre stage as works of art in their own right fine choice sweetpea	18

1	this series is a travesty i understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series but let laura not macbride have the last word on her family 's experience so much in his books rings false the clumsy historical allusions the narrative voice the potty humor one of the greatest things about laura ingalls wilder 's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she the main character grows big woods is written for little girls and happy golden years for young women macbride does n't manage this and talks down to readers there is a tiny thread of laura in these books but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans sampling is for rap not fiction	18

1	i enjoyed the parts regarding the s s valiant but the later part of the book simply did n't work for me except for picard who we of course know quite well from the series the other characters were flat and uninteresting we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy of the week boring the whole quot adversarial quot situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard	18

1	the book is fine except i had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer she 's such a boring character she 's young but not motivated to work in fact she quited one of her jobs when macon covered her rent the dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men and get support the point is that she does n't enjoy the job thus a detailed description of her dog training job \( which she does n't seem to enjoy \) was just a boring digression	18

0	the cover of this book compares it to the kite runner so it caught my attention i honestly could not stop reading as yasmina khadra does an amazing job of making believable and likeable characters he weaves a tale of how terrible situations eat away at people 's humanity my only nit is the ending was a bit predictable that said it was still a very good ending that rings true spoiler if you wonder why she did n't come back consider that she would not forget the face of the man that bumped into her on the street which led to them being stopped which ultimately resulted in her husband 's death i honestly ca n't wait to read more by yasmina khadra	18

0	a great read for anyone interested in cards i managed to pretend to my friends that i knew nothing about cards before cleaning them out after reading this book	18
1	this book is pure fiction nothing more the problem is that is presented as fact albeit little known fact i wo n't repeat the good points made by some of the other reviewers except to say that i also concur with the criticisms of the book it makes for difficult reading it really is not worth the effort as you will not have any worthwhile information in the end in fact if you are a historian or scholar stay away from it	18

1	i m not a big fan of communism nor of stalin but i cross checked the facts mentioned in this book with facts in some other books i have read on similar subject and found that author edvard radzinsky is strongly biased against stalin in the entire book he seems to give no credit for anything to stalin nor to his leadership qualities during the course of second world war dont waste your money on a propaganda book better to go for an unbiased account from a neutral observer thats what biographies are supposed to be	18

1	this book contains reproducible mini books bingo cards flash cards some word search puzzles and fill in activities in my opinion the fill ins are a bit too challenging i even had trouble with them the only thing in this book really worth it that i could n't make as well myself are the mini books the mini books each contain several different sight words so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them	18
1	i tried i really did but i could n't get beyond 100 pages i love iris johansen books but it seemed she had no joy in writing this one almost as if she were forced to do so it contained none of her usual style the dialogue was choppy and boring and nothing made you care about the characters i'm still a fan and hope the next book is written in more typical ij style	18
0	elaine pagels is a wonderful writer her explanation into early christianity is wonderful it is definitely worth the time to read this she delves into the politics of the early church the passion the resurrection as well as the clashes between gnostic and orthodox thinking too often we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available she just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another if you want to get an idea of who the gnostics were read this	18

1	if you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer this book will provide lots of information it also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog but for my taste i found the photographic results to be uninspiring too much posing too much portraiture lighting not enough of just plain capturing that wonderful dog as it is	18

1	temperance brennan is an american forensic anthropologist the author is a anthropologist in real life and i feel she gave to much detail as to body parts conditions locations in the book and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about gabby including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of gabbys place how gabby and tempe were friends from grad to man parts in life book was not for me i dropped it at the 3rd chapter	18

0	as a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises it 's language is quaint and cozy to modern ears having first been written in 1856 but it is practical clear and encouraging it dispells the idea that only certain people can draw and by focussing on drawing with pencil it provides the foundation for using any other media a wonderful find	18

0	this book is a really excellent source for anyone wanting to understand the reasons that saudi arabia is the way it is today i was lucky to find my copy in a used bookstore it does get a little tedious when discussing the business oil aspects of the 1960 's and 70 's but it 's well worth it it 's a detailed history from start until publishing and that is definitely a relevant time	18
1	i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for the swede without letting us know who the swede really is roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times	18
1	the product i ordered was not actually for sale ! do n't post an product if you do n't have it in stock	18
1	one of the blurbs i read on the book jacket compared this book to into thin air and the perfect storm no way ! those two books were edge of your seat reading experiences this account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring the action does n't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then the cliched writing and deification of balf 's subjects make this book very hard to get through unless you are a serious kayaking fan i would not recommend this book	18

0	i first picked up this book because i 've always been interested in what young writers have to say but i have to admit even i was a little surprised this story mind the mythicism is a real representation of what young children 's minds sometimes go through that idea of a person you fabricated gaining more reality than necessary congrats to ms oyeyemi for her brilliant attempt to shine some light on this realm that few share conversations about she is one i 'll keep in my mind for a while if you like young writers you should check out charles hedji 's fields of discovery i'm an avid reader once again	18

1	if you 've read anything already about these techniques writing it down visualizing it tithing this book offers no additional insights and despite his quot official religious disclaimer quot at the beginning of the book it is packed to the rafters with the author 's own religious dogma if you share the author 's religious outlook you may like this book but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading	18

0	this is an excellent book its academic sociological approach may put off some lay readers but that would be too bad the subject and the message are both very important in many ways this book is similar to quot the appearance of impropriety how the ethics wars have undermined american government business and society quot but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social science standpoint an excellent book well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed \( at best \) results	18
0	based on the description i expected this to be a davinci code knock off but gave it a shot since i recieved a free copy comparing labyrinth to the davinci code do it injustice this is definately not an imitator and is worth reading in it 's own right i enjoyed the characters plot and switching between the past and present i'm not sure it has literary value \( i would n't argue that the davinci code does either \) but it 's certainly complex enough to make you think about the plot and character relationships without being difficult to follow	18
1	i was quite disappointed by this book i was expecting something with more professional level content it 's all very amateur however the artwork used in the examples is sub professional at best i was hoping that the book would deal with some of the specific pre press issues relating to comics artwork but the chapter there was frustratingly slight you would be much better to buy a a more general pre press book the quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a book that cost this much	18
1	when i found hour game in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale i thought i had hit pay dirt but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as the winner and absolute power could turn out such a dog long boring and confusing i fear that mr baldacci hired an aspiring young writer to help him crank out a quick book i cannot pass this book along to my friends i could n't do that to them it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin what a waste what a shame	18

1	i must say that this book does has a lot of pictures in it showing the aspects of shakespear 's world and plays they are very good and intertaining but i must warn you that the book has a whole chapter with illustrations \( in detail \) of people having sex the book is probably very good if you like reading text books and do n't mind these pictures but i was just too grossed out if you are teaching lit in college and or studying shakespeare this is probably the book that you should use but you should flip through the book first \( i e library book store \) to see if that is what you want on your book shelves	18
1	had long looked forward to finally reading this acclaimed novel there are brilliant and imaginative highlights in the book although finding those bits is like looking for light in a black hole a lot of work for very little result i truly believe this is a book that would be more interesting if one increased their medication level way past the recommended daily dosage mark	18

0	buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days but i still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again used to have one years ago now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer the equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer it allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer	19

1	this is a piece of junk the radio reception is terrible fm is marginal and am is almost nonexistent	19
1	these work great initially i bought six of them of the six four broke one stopped altogether one stopped oscillating and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed i bought them in may and they broke after 2 3 and 4 months respectively they are expensive fans and i was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability they were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all i have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch these are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty \( this is 1 year \) and higher quality components	19
1	the printer works great as a usb printer a fax machine and copier it may as well not even have a network port on it the networking driver will find the printer but then it goes back to searching fora printer and this loop continues till you give up i ca n't tell if thr network scanning works because of the above driver problem i can tell you that a dell 1600 works great as a network printer network scanner fax copier we have 3 of these and we tried this hp 3055 and i would not reccommend it to anyon	19

1	these are by far the worst headphones i have ever bought i did not know they could make headphones whith such horrible sound quality they also feel like they are made of cheap plastic definently not worth the 15 i paided for them	19
1	i ordered this item thinking that it would be useful when on the road in hotel rooms to light up my work area wrong ! ! the light is so dim the only thing it might be good for is a night light ! this lamp is a good idea but much too weak to be of any help	19
0	i 've had canon printers using this cartridge for more than a year and wo n't settle for any of those knock offs yeah they 're often much cheaper but this is one area where you get what you pay for brand x fades and does not perform as well in the inkjet system this has been confirmed in independent lab tests in a leading pc magazine i have had to install and remove countless cartridges and never spilled a drop the pop in pop out design could n't be easier	19
0	just my two cents i bought these from the sony store for 15 bucks two years ago they 've lasted me this long for light office use so at 7 year this seems to be a good budget earphones i'm not an audiophile so i do n't need expensive earphones however they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack the wires got loose and the sound just stopped moral of the story do n't twist or touch the wires cable pros lightweight budget oriented comfortable fit for my earscons eventually broke cheap earphone covers will get lost easil	19
1	this remote controller was quite a dissapointment i am using two other philips magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better this one does not look like the picture \( which looks more like the 425 model \) it does not cover the equipment i have \( while the 425 model does \) it 's learning mode is flaky and unreliable to say the least the range is shorter then that of the 425s conclusion this would make for a nice ornament \( it does look nice and if you are lucky you may be able to control some devices	19
1	beware of this product it always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer i have another usb 1 0 card reader that works perfectly i upgrade to get the speed boost with usb 2 0 but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy	19
1	i ordered this for christmas from a marketplace seller it was defective and assumed i would have to deal directly with philips to get a replacement after seven weeks i still do not have a replacement from them their customer service people keep telling me 10 15 days and i have no recourse i also thought the unit was complicated to use and would gladly obtain a refund if i could or even get the unit i would not recommend buying this or any other philips product to anyone their customer service is the worst i 've ever dealt with i also had to pay the shipping to return their defective dvd player	19
0	unlike most tech gadgets that are a little outdated this product stands in nearly every aspect the sleek supreme design by f a porsche makes this product appearance timeless and its preformance is outstanding more effective in this model than its smaller slower \( 80gb 120 gb \) counterparts the autostart is a little slow for me \( its the usb model not firewire remeber \) but is a totally acceptable feature for the price design performance cost benefit equilibrium excellent purchase	19
1	i purchased this product to share my dvi monitor and logitech bluetooth keyboard mouse between my two main machines the exact use promoted by the manufacturer i successfully patched the firmware to eliminate the incessant beeping but am extremely disappointed with the dvi video at 1600 by 1200 \( severe streaking and noise \) and the audio is totally unuseable given the severe hum and noise btw i am using belkin kvm cables do n't even think about purchasing this unit	19
1	i have had this printer for more than a year at first it was a great printer not anymore ! ! it uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tanks \( which is why i bought the thing \) but now the print head is n't working right do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed went to the canon website they do n't even acknowledge this printer ever existed my recommendation is do n't buy this model ! !	19

1	with no mode settings \( repeat shuffle etc \) or shock protection this cd player is pretty undesirable but if you 're just looking for something to hold you over then this 'll do it has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright it could be with just mine but every pair of headphones new and old that i use with it the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers they work fine like i said if you just want a temporary thing then i guess this is good for you	19

0	great soundcard ! i noticed in battlefield 2142 that i can hear the sounds of footsteps behind me better i'm not getting knifed as often \( which is a very good thing ! \) i'm glad i got this card	19
1	this remote is so hard to use and setup the xpress functions do n't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers get something else	19
0	the silicone is great quality fits the nano snugly and the arm band is nice wonderful product does what it 's supposed to do for a fabulous price recommended	19
1	i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online well i just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs i got one that burned good not much bang for the buck i have burned many discs but never memorex usually verbatim or ridata or mam very disgruntled with these discs making coasters maybe my burners do n't like them but whatever the case i wo n't buy them ever again i thought memorex made good products	19

1	i followed the install instructions to the letter but the install program started giving me an error that i could n't get past i downloaded the latest install from the linksys web site and got past the point where i had been getting the error but i could n't get the print server to connect to my wireless network when i had the print server connected to my network via an ethernet cable it detected the attached printer but could n't even print a test page successfully this product was a complete waste of time	19
1	the unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card this requires determining the cf card id when registering instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating magellan 's web site is tricky at best if you enter the cf id incorrectly you cannot store any maps in the unit even if you are provided an authorization code for the cf card beware	19
1	this printer works fine as a usb printer but it does not connect to a network hp will not replace says it must be something wrong with my network nevermind the 2 other printers 2 macs and 3 winxp computers connected to it no more hp for me	19

1	this was a great mouse for about the first year i owned after one year is when all of the problems started the mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it does n't want to connect at all i have changed the battery quite a few times and that does n't seem to help it is very tempremental and i have now given up and am shopping for a replacement so a word to the wise in my experience the mouse will work great for a while just be prepared to replace it in a year or so	19
0	i 've never had a problem with these dvds they burn and play perfectly and i 've never had a problem printing on them what 's particularly nice about these is the printable area goes all the way to the hole it does n't sound like a big deal but it makes for nicer looking dvds by the way i use an epson stylus photo r300 to print great photos and dvds	19
1	i 've had my micro for over a year now and when it worked i loved it ! however i'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue the sound is output in layers and i am constantly trying to reposition my headphones to get full sound my husband called creative labs for assistance and he was told that it would cost him per month for a customer service subscription after reading these reviews it seems we 'd be paying creative labs so that they could tell us there 's nothing they can \( or will \) do next brand please	19
1	this device is much bulkier than it needs to be but an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod the ipod plugs in to the back and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod it is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too	19
0	if you snap shots in burst mode or if you want to take pictures at sporting events fast cards like those are the way to go almost no lag large capacity lifetime warranty no complaints	19
0	great buy for the money four stars only because it is made out of about 3 8 mdf and could be sterdier height is great for medium size bookshelf speaker tweaters to be at ear level while siting on the couch	19
0	pros like a quality piano the keys give a sense of weight the bend in the keyboard tool some getting used too but now am typing a full speed the mouse offers great control though i have n't much used all the buttons that are one the form cons the only gotcha is if the computer freezes there is no way to control alt delete also setting the favorite keys to non microsoft items tends to reset after updates and restarts	19
1	man were we diappointed with this ge phone ! we did everything right trained the battery in the beginning made sure we routinely charged it never dropped or abused this phone and then one day it started not holding a charge we could n't figure it out it worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out just like the other reviewers have said we had a 10 year old toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it 's unfortunate demise which is when we acquired this loser are there any good phones out there somewhere \? \? \?	19
1	this is a good product not as good as an mp3 player with internal memory as it is bulkier but it is great for the price the only drawback is it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory running with it can be uncomfortable at times if you are a runner you may prefer a smaller mp3 player one you can put in your shorts pocket	19
1	first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony but i have toadvise you against the purchase of the bean walkman i purchased one in march 2006 and returned it september 2006 as i had purchased replacementinsurance and was able to return it because it broke it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphonesalways pull out the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable save your self the hassel ! ! ! ! !	19
1	i got this for christmas 2004 played 5 dvd 's on it and started to get the quot no disk quot reading i only had it for 1 month i sent it back and they are replacing it since it is under warranty but they are replacing it with a different model we will see if it has the same problems according to reviews of the 1700m model i expect the same i suggest you spend a little more money and get a better dvd player	19
1	heres a new one i have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer \( imac w intel chip hardly outdated \) simply doesnt recognize them like i never put in a disc at all the kicker is that this spring i also ordered two spindles of these discs \( exactly the same as far as i can tell \) from which i burned one hundred discs \( not a single faulty one ! \) for a freind overseas i have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs anyone got ideas \?	19
0	these were double the price on another site ! my little girl loves these speakers ! she is using them with her pc my only complaint and it 's my complaint and not my lil girl 's is that the sound quality is poor obviously not the speakers to get for real sound quality but kids love them	19
1	i bought this phone for the great features and because i 've had good luck with other motorola products the phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have the handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit the only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings range on the handsets is only mediocre i ca n't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located also battery life is very limited overall the phones are very disappointing and i would definitely recommend not buying them	19
1	this linksys stuff simply does n't work and do n't try getting technical support it 's a complete waste of time if you ca n't google the solution just take the stuff back the adapter install took out my tcpip stack even for my wired connection it took me 3 full days to figure out that i needed to remove any sign of linksys odyssey and funk software from the registry then remove and reinstall the tcpip stack linksys support could n't even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days a dozen emails and 5 separate phone calls linksys support is just embarrassing do n't be caught having to depend on it	19
0	i bought the cooler for my dell inspiron which tends to get hot because i work it so hard it 's cut down the time the internal fan kicks in drastically is very sturdy yet light enough for me so i bought another \( wide screen \) \( black \) version for my hp pavilion which has more ram and so does n't have to work that hard now its internal fan virtually never kicks in in both cases the fan is so quiet that i have to turn it on off to make sure that it is working the only improvement i would suggest is more usb ports 4 stars because 5 is perfection	19
1	it is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor buying this handheld was a big mistake	19
1	300 500 yards under the best conditions given its heft a waste of mone	19
0	there is just one word to describe this product amazing i'm full satisfied with it just buy it with 1mbytes \( mine is 512kbytes \) one last thing the battery lasts forever	19
1	price reflects quality poor sound quality no features not that easy to use do n't waste your mone	19
1	i do n't like these radios becase they only go about 1 2 the mile the battery does n't hold full charge i would recommend going with motorola model or midland that will give you better range	19
0	price is excellent no problems but i falls below a 5 star due to product lacking higher quality materials	19
0	great sound love the volume control on the wire great fit to almost any head size or shape overall a great purchase and i love their product	19
0	i bought this switch last week the installation was as easy as plug n play no major problems so far this switch is worth its price	19
0	this is a great little machine and has so many uses i bought 2 of them and 2 days later came back to amazon to buy some more for gifts and the price has doubled what 's with that \? keep looking and you 'll find this at a hot price again eventually	19
1	i was very disappointed when i got to south america and went to curl my hair and nothing happened take a look at the product specifications it has limited use for appliances between 500 and 1600 watts i had two different curling irons with me one was rated 85 watts and the other 125 watts i am not sure what appliances this converter was designed for take my recommendation buy the converter by tumi instead it is twice the price but it is one piece easy to travel and works with many different types of appliances i am very satisfied with it	19
0	the product works fine it seems kind of strange that i had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that i needed the linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so i ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the linksys units to make sure they did n't pop off	19
1	after buying this product i opened the case after few days as i was out of country to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices however every time i put it in the camera or other devices it gives error and does n't work i could n't use this memory stick since i bought it and as i opened the box almost 15 days after the receipt i am not sure how i can even return it back either basically not at all happy with the product at this time	19
0	do you have an old printer you would like to tie to that new lap top \? i did and at first i did n't think it could be done but a little quick research on amazon and i found this beauty the sabrent cable is very well made and has the look of quality and ruggedness i just plugged it in and everything took off without a hitch \( pc w windows xp	19
1	pny memory is not very specific on its products check and re check that the specs are what you need pny is more a reseller of dubious memory brands of asiatic origin \( not that others are'nt but \) pay the extra and go for respected brands like viking and kingston you ca n't go wrong in the long term it 's a better investment	19
1	i purchased one \( from a local store not amazon com \) brought it home and printed a photograph that i had previously printed on a kodak easyshare printer \( my mother in law 's \) the resulting photograp was horrible it had a very green tint to it i then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer the green tint remained i checked the troubleshooting section of the manual checked cleaned the print heads and still the problem remained given that the product is still on the market i suspect i had a broken unit i did not like the lcd it is very hard to read i adjusted the contrast but it did not help	19
1	i ordered this antenna to enhance the reception of the uhf channels i live in a big city and i thought i should n't have a problem with any indoor antenna it seems i was mistaken this antenna is useless it is almost no better than my previous 99 cents store antenna	19
0	very solid nice looking shelf easy to assemble with good instructions and all required pieces included it 's exactly as i expected it	19
0	this was exactly what i needed it is very easy to use it does a great job of encrypting your data if that is what you want there is plenty of space and it is snap to use with my mac powerbook i recommend it	19
0	picture sound all great the only problem is that you must have an advanced degree in english engineering and computer science to set the television up without my cable company making a house call setup is impossibl	19
1	i do not like this item because it says it is a 16x dvd but when i put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x something is wrong with the dvds because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner so if you are looking for 16x do not buy this one	19
1	the use of this ac power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless on battery the radio works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost invest in batteries rather than this product	19
1	i also was misled into thinking i was getting ten of these tapes not one while the tape is ok it is absolutely not worth the price for a single basic vhs tape i am usually a big amazon fan but this advertisement is very poor	19
0	popped it in works like a charm hardest part is opening the packaging but other than that no worries	19
0	just purchased earbuds at target excellent sound quality expected that much due to a previous of full headphones even better once you find the right adjustable tip to fit your ear well worth my 100 dollars granted i 've only had them 5 to 10 minutes but i wo n't be returning them any time soon	19
0	the one in our bedroom would n't always work could n't hear the kids calling i was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice both my dell charger and thinkpad charger had the same effect even without the laptop plugged into the charger if your having problems i would start with unplugging other things first overall these have been a godsend wife no longer has to scream at the kids across the entire house used to drive me crazy	19
0	the price i paid for this spindle of cd r 's was pretty good and have not had a problem yet the only price that i have seen that beats this one was staples running a sale of 50 for 10 but i have yet to use the stock that i bought as i still have about 25 left on the spindle if you do n't want to wait for their sale this is an excellent bargain the print surface has done very well with the inks from my epson photo r 220	19
1	this phone has about a 20 foot range before it starts cutting out it has great features but you ca n't really move all about your home	19
1	anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds i know because i just did it the cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire you could even use household scissors to gnaw through having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer however if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer you might as well get something with a stronger cable	19
1	i ordered this as i have many items from amazon and had not received it after 2 months i cancelled the order	19
1	this unit replaced my old aio 7410 which i loved this one just feels cheap the construction is cheap parts are loose and it feels like a child 's toy not an office tool given the choice i would not buy another one	19

1	i bought this humidifier reading the reviews here but when i actually used for a few days i found that it provided no relief from dryness while sleeping or during the day it pretty much did nothing except make the room hotter i would not recommend this to anyone	19
1	the card was defective have applied for refund from amazon and have bought another to see if this one works hopefully wo n't have to keep doing this too many times have already wasted a lot of time on this pretty frustrating	19

1	worked great for about a week then i seemed to get an average of 12 telemarketing calls a da	19
1	i 've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this cd the sound from my system did seem to be a little better \( the cd 's were not skipping as much \) but the bottom line is it did n't fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6 disk cd changer	19
1	this is the worst pice of electronics i ever bought started falling apart after few days only battery life is a joke software that comes with it is totally unfriendly and even if you manage to install that thing on your computer it wo n't work with os prior to xp you will find that out after you 're done installing it mediocre performance do n't waste your money on this one	19
0	i have been happy with these phones i find no problem with the sound no static at all the only small thing i have noticed is that occasionally the sound echoes a little i do not understand the terrible reviews this phone is very usable	19
1	it is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them on the flip side once they have been opened once they do n't reclose very well	19
0	buying from amazon was cheapest price especially with free shipping stepped up for more power per channel stayed in the sony family \( previous sony surround output to center speaker quit \) dislike the speaker hook ups in back difficult to attach speaker wires and screw down connections overall happy with purchase	19
1	along with reception of new hd stations i expected high quality fm am to go with my complete top line stereo system instead the hdt 1 gives me very poor quality even less than a table top clock radio very high output can only turn amp up to lowest level and painful to listen to no response to inquiries from sangean	19
1	i bought 2 of these drives to set up a raid1 array \( mirror \) and one of them continuously has errors causing the array to be degraded i called tech support and they said these drives do not support raid big let down i have to go for the server version which will end up costing much more	19
1	i tried 3 of these dvd rs none of them worked errors in every burn i used another brand to burn the session and it worked perfectly so it is definately a problem with these dvd rs and not with my burner	19
1	i find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable i would rate the product a zero if it were an option i ca n't even use them because they 're too uncomfortable to wear not worth the money even though they 're cheap	19
1	simply put the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely there are always bubbles if you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you the keyboard soft material cover is not so bad but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard so when you close the lid the material then transfers some of that dirt right back my resolve just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft clean semi wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster	19
1	i bought this product and was very disappointed by it not only did it damage my head to my c d writter it also destroyed my hard drive in the process eri	19
1	it seems nice enough and it 's cheap but it is apparently incompatible with the canon powershot digital elphs for use with those cameras buy sandisck instead seriously	19
0	i use this scanner primarily for text documents and could n't be more impressed you do need text software i have textbridge but i find relatively few errors in the scan proofreading and corrections are easy and efficient best of all i do n't have another device plugged into my computer or taking up space on my desk caution i have n't used it for photos but it does a great job on text	19
1	do not buy this unit i have tested the vosky iogear and now us robotics and they are all junk while the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate i do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit and why are the so small ! \? the are so small as to be practically useless the iogear unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons bottom line wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a polycom and the computer calling kit that is available through polycom \( even the polycom computer calling kit is analog ! what is the problem ! \?	19
1	the product did n't do what it said it would i cut the power to use it in my car \( i should n't have assumed it worked properly \) so i could n't return it and ended wasting 50 i was extremly dissapointed in this product	19

1	i think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax ! i especially got this machine because i thought it was a quality machine and would n't do that but i was wrong sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating i would stay away it prints nicely but it does n't help if it ruins your faxes i see other reviewers have the same problem	19
1	i 've had these speakers for three years now hissing popping not holding signal all that has been true from day 1 and tonight one of the speakers just would not turn on the power supply was n't the problem it 's something inside the speaker box and something that apparently cannot be fixed so my other one will be mono until i can come up with an alternative solution oh well	19

1	i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company plus i liked the look of it but after just 5 months after purchase and not even using it that often it has already broken i paid about 40 dollars for this cd player so i am very disappointed if i were you i would buy a different cd player	19

0	radio shack wanted 39 95 for a similar item so at 9 95 this was a steal swr is good and performance is as much as i need for corvette runs although it hears well and gives a good transmit signal for the small size far beyond what i need i did have to put a metal plate on the vette \( discreetly \) as it would n't stick to the fiberglass good produc	19

0	we have the original itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in the originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station after reading the instructions i plugged the new itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away that is better than i expected after reading all the feedback i'm not sure what everyones problem is it 's not a radio tower it 's a transmitter the size of your finger i get the feeling that some people think it should power the city block	19
0	not quite as bright a conventional flashlight but certainly bright enough no battery feature ca n't be beat manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind i 've never left mine on that long but i 've only needed to wind it once in over a year this is an excellent flashlight i 've bought several	19
1	i was expecting at least a degree worth of difference it did not help at all ! absolute waste of 50 dollars	19

0	i have had other apc battery backup 's in the past and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit given our power failures brown out and the high wind and storms in our area the apc does an excellent job i have not only my desktop pc but my scanner printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures	19
1	i bought this printer based on its good reviews it does print beautiful photos but i have n't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only the problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly after several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual i contacted canon they ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body	19

0	actually i loved the philips acoustic edge an earlier and internal sound card but it did not like my older dual processor system because of that i was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper threading which windows treats as dual processors i bought the aurelium instead i love this thing ! i am a bit of an audiophile and this sound card is just perfect with my klipsch computer speakers it makes a perfect combination	19
0	bought this to convert pal hi 8 \( canon \) purchased years ago in singapore for mac \( powerbook g4 tiger os x \) nonlinear editing worked perfectly the first time only needed to set a single switch to select pal no need for software drivers etc happily plugged and played with the mac and the camcorder acceptable price for the features and ease of use	19

0	very easy to assemble has very classic lines lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation hard to find add on shelf in maple holds a lot of equipment	19
0	i picked this up to use on a mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity it worked great for charging 2 digital camera batteries which would n't fit in the normal outlet at the same time it 's small rugged and light so it 's easy to pack	19
0	i bought this like a ipod but its better i have about 20 movies on it and about 500 songs and some photo's and still have 50 gigs left the only hang up is you still have to go pay another 20 00 to get the plug in download that lets you show most of the movies they say it can do all this stuff but not with out downloads and some add on's once you get all that there are hours of fun to be had	19
1	this was the top rated system by consumer reports i returned it the sound quality of the message i recorded as a greeting sounded awful as did the sound of the messages i received tried to record my greeting a number of ways but they all sounded awful	19
1	i burn about 50 cds a week in live music trades i can tell you from experience that these discs do not last after a year or so they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems any scratches that they have only make it worse i recommend using sony fuji or tdk all the others are cheaply made in comparison and just do n't stand the test of time so if you care about preserving your cds do n't use these ones	19
1	the transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do	19
0	my doctor recommended getting a wrist support when using my computer because i had previous carpal tunnel surgery ilove the way it comforts the wrist the gel inside is different than other gel pads i had in the past it really does give great support and comfort it can prevent future problems for your wrist iam glad amazon carries it	19

1	after just one week of use and installing the newest firmware this router began showing sickly signs requiring a daily reboot by week two it began needing to be rebooted every 15 minutes this now seems typical of previous experiences i have had with other netgear products so much for plug and play my recommmendation leave netgear to the passive routers and use another brand for firewalls and dhcp serving	19

0	i needed this cable to use with my garmin rino 120 because my new laptop did n't have a serial adapter my first try was to use a similiar product from radio shack but i found the radio shack product was very confusing to use and was unstable i ordered the cp technologie product from amazon and it worked great ! also the cp tech product was less than half the cost of the radio shack product \( including shipping \)	19

0	i have n't had any problems using this dvd cd burner over firewire on a g4 imac running mac osx tiger in fact setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual it was truly plug and play minor quibbles the open close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case and only the lite version of toast 6 is included bottom line i would buy this burner again given my experiences using it	19
1	hard to believe this product is still being sold when it 's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods also the claims of good design i feel are overstated finally the speakers are weak and sound like it wo n't be long until they 're shaking this may influence what music you 'll end up playing through the system all said though i 'd be happy with it for the price if only they 'd update it to fully handle my ipod	19
1	very unreliable i have used dvd rw and cd rw memorex disks on multiple computers and dvd recorders i find that they 1 \) do n't last get about 50 re recordings not 1500 2 \) may crap out on any occasion multiple cd rw 's with critical material would not read on multiple computers avoid memorex dvd rw cd rw disks !	19

1	waste of time software had some bugs but more importantly performance was horrible i would n't pay 10 dollars for this product yes it is that bad accuracy rate was about 25 and the mistakes were beyond spell check they look like some new form of reformed egyption do n't buy !	19
1	purchased for my daughter an english teacher scrabble lover she said she 'd rather have a book to look up words and most of the features on the franklin she 'd never use and thought they took away from the mental challenge of the game she said it would end up on a shelf in her house she 'd rather have a paperback scrabble dictionary i returned the franklin she did n't even like the idea of taking it to school for her kids to use when she lets them play scrabble in class	19
0	the first one i ordered worked for about four days and then stopped recognizing the usb devices i was plugging into it although i had considered just getting a refund amazon was quick to replace the card with no hassles the replacement card has been working fine for a couple of months now the usb 2 is much faster than the original usb ports that were a part of my original computer and this particular card was a reasonable price	19
1	bad customer service its been almost a month and i still have not received this product ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything neither did anyone answer the phones i dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help	19
1	i purchased this from amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included however when it arrived there was no battery upon questioning amazon about the battery the customer service rep said he could give me a 5 credit for the batteries i asked how the battery could only be worth 5 he said that is what aa rechargeable batteries go for the bag is ok but do n't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers	19
1	5 ml for 20 i would refuse to buy any printer that used this cartridge on principal die in a fire hp	19
0	this card is significantly cheaper \( at the time i ordered \) than the sandisk extreme iii at the same speed \( 133x \) i was expecting to receive a 100x since it was listed as that in the description but the 133x came and i was very happy works as advertised and kingston is a reliable memory brand product came quickly	19
0	works well for my mac and bt enabled sony ericsson phone other than the built in drivers for the printer in mac osx support for options within the card and printer are non existant still cant figure out how to manually force a realignment of the cartridges	19
0	the service from amazon was great delivery people were most cooperative made delivery as promised placed tv in space where we wanted and hooked up and checked it out they even offered to take away the empty carton we saved about 250 by buying from amazon rather than from local retailer	19
0	is it expensive \? yes it is ! ! ! however i was conecting my ipod mini to my speakers with two cables mini jack cable and power cable and it was very unconfortable to do every day the dock is a great solution for this issue now i just insert the ipod mini in the dock easy fast and confortable additionaly i can read easyly the song i am listening to	19
0	this is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot it is also silent and convenient it is more flexible with the fat 32 format it comes in but i preferred the ntfs file format whice is safer and more stable it was no problem to reformat to ntfs	19
0	outstanding product ! keeps the laptop cool plus the added benefit of having 4 usb ports	19
1	the card works as advertised but sandisk does not send in mail in rebate even though i mailed it in with the upc barcode sandisk sent me a post card stating that i needed to resubmit it with the barcode how can i resubmit when they already have the barcode \? in my experience with sandisk i got rebate back on one of two cards that i submitted so you get mail in rebate 50 of the time with sandisk i think mail in rebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies do n't trust it !	19
1	i agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download in this day and age there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers a voice recorder is tool for on the go so we should have to carry a cd with us as well in case we want to plug the recorder into a different machine \? this is just a case of wanton disrespect of the customer by a big company	19
1	there are brands i trust and ones i do n't sony has always been a trusted brand but after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken i should have read these other reviews before i made my purchase but because this unit is a sony i trusted it would be a superior product the problems i had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews when playing cds in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a cd and quitting i followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the onkyo dx c390 6 disc changer i am hoping i have better luck	19
1	the paper stripes of 1 4 are too wide at times information such as names and phone numbers came out very clear if somebody is really after information he should n't have much trouble finding it after you throw away your paper	19
1	i also had the model before the m85v and got great reception this new model gets terrible reception i still have my old model and put the old one next to the new one and it was like night and day with the reception do n't waste your money on this model !	19
1	i bought an airplay2 from am apple store for around 60 other than the fact that blank fm stations are hard to find in the new york metropolitan area and that you need to keep changing to different blank stations as you drive the product itself is simply terrible even if you are in a parking lot and find a blank fm station the quality of the music the airplay broadcasts is very bad the bass is almost non existent and there is a constant hiss in the background that you cannot get rid of this product is not worth buying especially for 60	19
1	one month in the wall and sounds like a expresso machine my car 's engine sounds better do n't waste your money i called sharp and they say is the fan great maybe i should remove it and use ice cubes	19
1	this typewriter is an unbelievable piece of junk garbage do n't buy it even if they offer it to you for free there 's not enough room here to list the problems just skip it do yourself a favor and stay away from brother i 've had nothing but problems with their fax machines and printers as well do n't know how they stay in business	19
1	very poor design would never recommend this product the connection is so flaky you will end up wasting lot of time	19
0	i checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case what i received is what i expected lots of compartments to store needed accessories sturdy construction pleasant appearance as with a previous review my only citicism is the shoulder strap while it is comfortable when used it is also fixed and cannot be removed i 've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane other than that it was a good purchase for the price	19
0	this product is a must have for your shure earphones once you use this with the earphones you will not want to use the headphones without it just takes a little getting used to	19
0	these headphones sound pretty good but they are n't the best when running the volume controller gets in the way and bounces it is also easy to change the volume which is annoying i also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange i realize it is done intentionally but it does nothing for me overall for just listening at your desk or in your room these are great headphones for running i would recommend something else	19
0	i used it in brasil and had it developed i was very happy with it it was the very first time i 've used a digital camera	19
0	i first saw these speakers at the apple store and i really liked the sound and the look i went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them as long as you have a decent soundcard these speakers really are great i have had no problem with them at all they look really cool they 're loud they 're small the woofer gives you a lot of bass \( which you can turn down \) and the sound from the speakers is clear buy these	19
1	for the price this is not a bad keyboard here are the two major problems i have with it 1 \) the feel is nothing like a real piano the keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note 2 \) the instructions have a big sticker on them stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and or birth defects \( including lead \) and to wash your hands after handling how on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot very possibly by children \? it 's going back	19
1	this thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over we thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery did n't help do n't buy this item i am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here	19
0	contrary to popular belief i even had a good experience the one time i needed technical support a few random disconnects but overall a great product	19
1	klear screen has to be the absolute worst product i 've ever used it has nearly ruined my 2001fp i was stupid and used it on my primary display first instead of using the 50 50 isopropyl alcohol water mix that 's far superior to klear screen products my lcd now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out my 3 year old laptop 's display looks nearly perfect because i only used the 50 50 solution on it my 2001fp looks horrible now	19
0	unit installed in seconds with no false starts or headaches of any kind the base is wide and heavy and when placed on a mouse pad does n't move around at all even when i get a little too into my flight sim games one ca n't beat the price either for flying prop planes i am very saisfied with the performance	19
0	i bought the intuos 6x11 pen tablet couple weeks ago and i use italmost every day so far so good i do n't expect to have any problems with it i used to have a small wacom graphire and i used for years then unfortunately the pen broke so now i own a new onethe only advice i can give to you is to keep it clean wipe it out every now and then with a wet clothjo	19
0	after looking at 250 00 mounts i was unsure about order at this low price this is a great well built unit i would have no problem puttinga 130 lb unit on it if you follow the enclosed instructions hardwarefor most walls included well painted with no rough edges mine was installed over wall board into wood studs i used the awl to make sure i hit the studs dead center delivery from new york to sarasota fl was 5 days ca n't bet that	19
1	wow how i can write a review about the item i have not received so far i ordered this case on march 7th and to day is april 10th and it seems out of stock so far well i m still waiting	19

0	got this drive a few weeks ago for an apple power mac g4 cube the g4 cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed this drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is unbelievable do n't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6 8 inches from the cube and is totally non existent more than 12 inches from the cube will not hesitate to buy seagate barracuda drives for all future machines the 5 year warranty is a winner highly recommend this drive for its silence speed cost and warranty	19
1	maybe if these were high end rechargable nimh this would be a reasonable price but for alkaline \? this is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell you can find aaa battieries on amazon for a third of this price	19
0	i was very pleased with the improvement of picture quality \( colour and clarity \) over the standard playstation cable anyone with an s video input should consider making this simple upgrade	19
1	i spent 60 on this and it broke after 6 months i guess the old saying you get what you paid for is true \(	19
1	check 10 cases at least 6 are broken in new box i do n't want to waist my time to check the remain 15 pieces	19
1	this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet 932c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment	19
1	first i rated it great and it was for two movies then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling the end	19
1	i put this paper on the wall in my office next to a picture printer on epson heavyweight matte paper and the glossy roll picture was yellow in a little over a month i will never buy this paper again	19
0	a great product snug fit on the laptop and appears to be a part of the laptop itself difficult to remove but no real reason to remove it anyway	19
0	i travel overseas a lot for my job this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your normal plugs for operating four devices most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money \( wires cables etc \) but this gizmo rocks	19
1	i love this minisisc it holds an incredible amount of songs the equivolent of an i pod mini and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great but don't buy it here ! just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by 9 00 while everything else in my order would have been shipped free and you can get them at your neighborhood radio shack for the same price as here i got a hi md recorder instead of an i pod and i'm glad i did just do n't buy the disks from amazon	19
0	it was up and running in 15 minutes had to order wifi adapter to get program updates got it and it installed automatically i would buy it again	19
1	not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again it worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to reset and work correctly it 's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand	19
0	i have and have had lots of sw radios including a number of sonys this is one of their many gems great perfomance lots of memories and snazzy look good for travel \( certainly not as compact as the sw100 of course \) a great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio and do n't want to spend very much good for listening and good for dxing while traveling look no further	19
1	i do n't want to rate this product since i have n't used it i had to though i just wanted to share with everybody that this product still does not come with a charger i received them left them unopened upon not seeing a charger called customer service \( they did n't do anything about the posting \) and sent them back a waste of time and effort and extra hassle and waiting to get the money back do not get mislead by pictures or descriptions	19

1	i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	19
0	this product works great for my ibook g4 screen and also for cleaning off most smudges on the case although it seems like i'm constantly getting new smudges on the screen do n't expect it to get off the spots that build up on keyboard over time though mr clean magic eraser works well for that but only if you make sure to thoroughly squeeze the water out before use on your computer otherwise it may get in and ruin your keyboard	19
1	returned it would n't work with vista and a canon mp780 and it certainly wo n't work with mac os x clients \( note the product does n't advertise support for mac \) why is it so difficult for manufacturers to create a wireless print server that works with multifunction printers	19
1	we got the hdmi cables but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the website the cables come without any packaging and there is no indication anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website we have not yet used the cables yet and we 're not sure whether they will work or not	19

0	this product has good and bad points i listed some below good cheaper than apple \( 5 as compared to 30 \) works greatsmallconvienientbad cheap \( might not hold up long term \) no warranty coverage for your ipod is something goes wronghas to be plugged in upside down \( for me anyway \) overall i'm glad i bought this instead of apple 's version the main factor for me was price but if you have the money get the apple charger simply because you 'll be covered by warranty that way	19

1	i mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card there is an easier way to do it ya know for your psp if the game is really important to you and you ca n't save it just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again just push it back up and hopefully if you did it right you 'll have the game right back in the place you left it hey it saved me 50 dollars and it can do the same thing for yo	19

1	i ordered the a1500 and received the a1000 i opted not to send it back when i read the other feedback on this page i did n't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed \( as the other fellow did below \) amazon is usually pretty good not this time and not on this product if you want you can call them at 1 800 201 7575 \( toll free us and canada \) 1 206 346 2992 or 1 206 266 2992 \( outside us and canada \) 1 877 586 3230 \( canada only \) uk customer service 44 208 636 9200	19

1	bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera it worked for 2 days after that everytime i on the camera it wanted me to reformat the card wth is that \? now i ca n't use it at all i'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from amazon one mistake i made i threw away the shipping and product packages once i tested out the card thought it worked and it would be ok i can no longer return it now needless to say i'm too over confident with lexar 's products buyers beware	19
1	i bought this speaker about one year ago from best buy very disappointed the sound quality is terrible i have two presence channel 15 klh speakers that sound better than this no high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic hence why bose is not high end after a year of misery on my ears i 've replaced this with a paradigm center speaker that only cost 20 more and the difference is not even comparable do not buy this or any bose product at all save your money and buy paradigm b w or similar most of the time they cost a little bit more but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers and you will get your money 's worth	19
0	i 've owned this item for almost a full year and i am extremely pleased with it it 's so nice being able to carry around my laptop and my books in the same bag the side pockets are kind of useless for them being so small but i guess i 'll be able to find a purpose for them	19
1	i bought this adapter because i could use the cable that came with ipod \( one fewer thing to carry \) well about six months after opening this item i noticed that my ipod was running on battery one of the contacts had broken and the device was not working anymore i am disappointed but should have expected that for the 10 i spent	19
0	elegant design sturdy construction supports my yamaha sy35 securely after reading the forbidding reviews i decided to assemble it without first reading the directions it took me 10 min	19
1	when it works it does extend the range however every time you turn off a wirelessly connected pc and turn it on again the pc is not assigned an ip number unplug this extender and the pc is assigned an ip number by the router without any problem a brief power blackout will cut ip numbers to your wirelessly connected pcs i purchased this particular d link range extender because i wanted to ensure that it works well with my di 624 router i wasted my money buying this device it 's useless and it 's too light to even serve as a door stop	19
1	if your router is not by d link and particularly if you use wpa encryption with that router do not purchase the dgl 3420 i have tested it with both the linksys wrt54g and the smc 2804wmbp g and wpa fails with both of them d link technical support in fact has confirmed that they know the adapter does n't work using wpa with the wrt54g besides for significantly less money you can get a wireless bridge with a lot more functionality after this product failed for me i purchased the netgear wgps606 which can connect four items \( x box computer whatever \) to your wireless network and two wireless print servers all for 20 less \( on amazon \)	19
0	note this product will only work on walls with wood studs no metal studs see the sanus website for installation manual and more details	19
1	installed quickly great image quality but within three days the card started to overheat and cause the computer to reboot i was told by others and ati forums that the 1650 pro with ati stock heat sink is known for its problems do not buy 1650 pro unless sapphire or other upgraded coolant system on the card also note this may be an unrelated issue after so many crashes the motherboard was fried and needed to be replaced cannot tell if related to video card or not yet if you are wanting an ati stock card there have been no known issues regarding stock cooling with the agp 1800 1900 series cards	19
1	i ordered this cable a few weeks ago although i must say that it does work fine the cable looks cheap \( in fact it is very thin \) and its length is less than 6 feet as you may agree length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that so for 20 \( including shipping \) i think it was not exactly a good deal	19
1	my wait has been 17 weeks and i received my monthly email today pushing out the delivery date another 30 days one big difference ! ! ! ! the item is now listed as available but for more money than i agreed to pay back in november if this is amazon's way of making me take a walk and give circuit city my it worked	19

1	ymmv but my 80gb drive died after 6 months i found this be very handy to have around to transfer large files between work and home but i expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of i'm glad i back up my data in more than one place	19
1	do not buy this if you own the c340 it does n't fit and amazon should n't market this as if it will it 's a nightmare to have to get it returned and get a refund this is also true for the cigarette lighter adapter i hope there will be clarity as to which accessories go with each model otherwise you 'll be in for a lot of wasted time and money the garmin is great but the fact that most of their accessories are not compatible within the product family is a huge problem	19
1	this is the worst thing i have ever owned ! ! ! ! it broke \( said there were no cd 's inside \) after about a week ! do yourself a favor do n't get this product do n't buy this brand and do n't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too	19

1	i wanted to convert an hp laserjet 4 plus to a networked printer even though instructions from the manual was followed the printer did not work the customer support is claimed to be 24 7 but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet this product cost more than a linksys router so customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time	19
0	i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it it 's the best feeling keyboard i 've ever owned the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature the backlighting is bright day or night and the programmable g keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past highly recommended	19

1	i do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon com but this time as i was listening to my car audio today i was compelled to leave one for others this product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments i bought for mp3 player audio system its sound reproducing transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality it does not balance well the low high frequency sounds resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity mine worked ok for the first several hours i assume i think it damaged the speaker and it now sounds like it 's going to rip apart someone else left review explaing this trouble which i ignored which was a mistake again do n't buy	19

1	i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer i wasnt impressed i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs i dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon ! ! many of my cds i have replaced for 7 10 bucks on here i wish i wouldve kept my 25	19

1	i just lost my synch adapter and it is on back order everywhere unfortunately this is necessary to connect to computer and to charge the player earliest date i can find one is 10 23 due to some shipping problem with creative labs i'm at a loss now that the battery is dead this is the dumbest idea ever why did n't they design the player so that the cords attached directly to the player \? i agree that you should order a back up as this thing is so easy to lose and so important	19
0	this is a great printer for those who want to print on 12x12 scrapbook pages it works well with heavier \( cardstock \) paper it also prints great photos i have a mac i book i also use the print shop 2 program with it it gives me great versatility with my pages photos	19
0	i was unsure of whether to purchase this product when i saw that my printer \( hp deskjet 712c \) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others' reviews i tried it anyway because the price was right it may look a little cheesy but it works i did n't even need the cd that comes with it in order to use the product i just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new dell laptop and it worked i think i may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it very good product	19
0	i have been using this drive for a few months now and have no complaints one of my laptops only has a usb 1 x port and it is incredibly slower for backups that has no reflection on this product but be ready for things to work slowly unless you have usb 2 x and do n't blame it on this drive	19
0	garmin has great ideas that suffer from the company they belong to this option is a great thing to add to your 305 if you spin indoors or want to increase the accuracy of the gps now if only the software was smart about how and when to use the sensor	19

0	which was nomadland the bono pod is beautiful however the inconsistency of the ipod itself is a nightmare i 've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs it 's apparently a known problem with several models of the device with no particular fix great	19
1	the product does not work in my view i have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95 of the cases it is not much different than entering the information manually the character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective does not even recognize that wireless is the mobile phone number one would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years the only good thing is once you scan the cards you can throw them away but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand	19
0	i recently purchased this item and i am very happy with its performance and quality i use it daily in the gym it delivers excellent sound and you dont even realize you have it on due to its light weight	19
0	i exchange audio letters with friends and this stereo recorder was purchased after my sony 100 dvs died and no replacement parts were available the sound quality is perfectly fine though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high end machine it comes with a stereo microphone but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit as it is there is a long clip on cord this makes it tough to do off the cuff recording overall a good value for the money the other machine cost nearly 300	19
1	i hate this unit with a passion and i sell the things its cheap 299 99 at most retail place right now and that 's what you are getting the one died in 24 hours while plugged in and never turned back on it also directed us to a road that was headed into the pacific ocean there is no road across in the pacific last time i checked it acquired satelites once and then never acquired them again and good luck talking to customer service both i talked to did n't speak english a dreadful unit maybe tomtom could go work at walmar	19

1	the 3m privacy filter does not work unless you are at a 50 degree angle or more to the screen otherwise you can see the screen you can see the screen clearly from any distance if you are directly behind it all the filter does is make the screen a little darker do n't waste your money	19
1	i just bought a 25 pack of these along with my new liteon dvd burner to bad only half of the cd players in my house can even read them i dont' think its the lightscribe side thats causing the problem as it does n't seem to matter if i lightscribe them or not the burner works fine with all of the other media i 've tried so i 'd avoid these discs like the plague	19
0	i received them ok none broken or cracked this price beats walmarts price and these cases are as good as any slim cases i have ever used i like the translucent back better than the black ones at staples	19
1	i bought these today so that i could review an mp3 presentation as soon as i put the headphone on i wanted to take them back ! it has the most annoying buzzing sound what philips means what they say noise canceling is that the buzzing sound will drown out all background noise ! well i'm taking these back	19
1	i purchased this product and could n't get it to work on a pc laptop or pda \( cingular 8125 \) not only does it not register in any sd minisd card reader but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well i am currently pursuing a refund	19
0	like the name suggests the m audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles i have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money the audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion i connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my harman kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear the one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first however when quality is essential go with the audiophile 2496	19
0	this is just great for a single vpu video card the cooling system works great moving all the hot air outside the cpu the software overclock is good too u can change values any time u want and u can select if u want those applied for 3d games only it works with any game i 've tested it with oblivion at 1280x1024 hdr enabled and every option at maximum it works great with f e a r at 1280x1024 with aax8 and ffa x 4the price is good for a very high end video cards	19
1	nice product before they decided to save a few pennies i have purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that was part of the atraction of this case note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' not ! 5 stars if it still had the handle or if you do n't need one	19
1	very unreliable i have used dvd rw and cd rw memorex disks on multiple computers and dvd recorders i find that they 1 \) do n't last get about 50 re recordings not 1500 2 \) may crap out on any occasion multiple cd rw 's with critical material would not read on multiple computers avoid memorex dvd rw cd rw disks !	19
1	i watch lots of show and some time wants to record good show while watching it also if properly connected thru satelite dish to this unit and to tv is this unit record the show while watching the same show on tv \? \( some of the units can not record while you are watching the show tv has to be off ! ! ! ! ! !	19

0	i bought this because i did not want to mount my garmin 350 nuvi to the windshield this device makes is much easier to switch the unit to different cars i drove normally and the unit did not slide around on my dashboard i can also mount the unit on a center console and it works there too please note that this is a complete unit for portable mounting and it is much cheaper than buying the sandbag mounting arm separately	19
0	this photo paper is truly top of the line profession grade paper i have been using it for a few years in making very large photo prints and they always turn out great	19
1	for those considering the purchase of this unit keep in mind that only podcasts and videos will be displayed on your tv menus and playlists will not the very slight increase in video quality via the use of the s video cable is n't worth it get some 10 00 cables for your ipod and save mone	19
0	they say it 's quiet and it holds tons of data they were correct fast access speed easy installation an overall fine product have not used the feature that let 's you back up your entire drive but we use it in our lan for shared files and it 's comforting to know that we 've got these files stored redundantly this box does just what it claims to do the warranty of merchantability \( from my old law class ! \)	19
1	egad ! upon receiving this remote control i found that it requires four aaa batteries there was no mention of that requirement in the product description ! i concur with the other review writer the control is top heavy and i would add poorly designed it 's thick at the top and thin at the bottom making it unwieldy i will be returning this monstrosity	19
1	this makes no sense if the industry standard is 4x6 why did they kodak cut the paper to 4x6 5 and then advertise on the carton that it is 4x6 yes i see the fine print on the back side of the carton that reads actual paper size is 4x6 5 i still do n't understand why they did this now i have cut the pictures down to the correct size what a waste of my time ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	19
1	if there were a catagory for 0 stars that 's what i would have rated it i bought this model only because i wanted a tv that would fit into a small space on a kitchen counter the radio works the cd works but the tv died after l month and the tv was the only part i was interested in what kind of product is this \? i would like amazon to pick up this item and issue me a credit carol gruber	19
0	not quite as powerful as i was hoping for but the sound is alright and in a small room it 'll do fine careful there is no plug in at the back so you can only connect mp3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack otherwise it 's easy to use and pretty cool looking ideal for quiet listening lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff	19
0	needed the adapter to charge my shuffle since the ac adapter i have is one of those older apple ones with the firewire connector suits my needs perfectly no experience with any sound docks however so i ca n't comment on the performance flaws other people have brought up	19
1	o k i purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now these batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives i do n't know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is but these did n't last being on the shelf for a little over a year i will never buy this brand again	19
0	i do n't know where the guy below got that this card does n't work with windows media center edition because i just installed the latest xp drivers for the card on media center edition 2005 and it works perfectly i sold my gigaport ag to get this because of the much better signal noise ratio that the firewire audiophile has and it made a big difference very clean sound ! i use it to dj with using mixvibes using the asio drivers and it works beautifully ! a great buy to say the least pick one up you wont regret it	19
0	i saw the small size of this case and was in love it has plenty of space for dvds and cords \( though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold \) it is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky it 's great you wont regret it	19
1	do n't believe the claim that you can just plug it in and it 's ready to use this product is set up for windows and the instructions for installing the drive for a mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the windows software it 's easy to become hopelessly fouled up do n't expect any help from western digital if you can actually get connected to them and your call is n't dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so you 'll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive their web site help is equally useless	19
1	i ordered the 2 year service plan on may 1st this day \( july 31st \) i still have not recievied it i have contacted them a number of times and still nothing do not buy from this company	19
1	i wish i had read the problems and netgear com forums before purchasing this product huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily this requires you unplug and plug back in the ap in order for it to stay visable to your computers second problem i am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare and even at 3 5feet from the ap the unit is around 11 36mpbs do not buy this product find another company who stands behind there products all of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in india people on the phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke latest firmware fixes none of the problems	19
0	ive owned a couple cb 's and this is definitely one of the better ones \( the only ones that are better are substancially more expensive \) works great and can be mounted in dash because of the front firing speaker tons of features including scanning and weather \( which actually comes in very handy \) the only feature it lacks \( and i wish it had \) is the ability to hook up to a pa other than that its great	19
0	fantastic sound for the money ! \( seems to work well with asus p5w dh anyway \) nice crisp highs decent mid range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick imo the only down side i could find is some of the nonsense software included is well nonsense creative scores again	19
1	we purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house with all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft at first it worked like a charm but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason we take good care of our electronic stuff so we were very surprised when the shredder stodecided to stop working then last week i added 2 sheets of paper and the shredder broke useless ! ! !	19
1	agree with the prior message i was duped into thinking 10 vhs tapes were being sold don't order this	19
0	i bought a zen 30g mp3 player and could not stand the earbuds they came with they hurt so much that i used head phones until these v moda earbuds came in they are awesome the fit is so comfortable and the sound it wonderful i got them on sale for less than they are running right now on amazon so i feel pretty good about the purchase	19
0	got 3 of them a few months ago and buying another one now excellent product fits many different plug types no flaws	19
1	this dvr works ok but when it is recording forget about changing channels it is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks broadband feature is nice but usb does n't come cheap its like	19
1	i took the tv out of the box plugged it in and nothing after pushing the on off switch repeatedly it finally came on picture and sound were terrific so i was very pleased turned it off with the remote of course the tv would n't turn on again with either the remote or the switch pushed the switch about 10 times and it finally came on i called panasonic customer service who could not do anything to fix it by phone so now my new tv is in for a warranty repair less than 24 hours after i received it talk about frustrating ! !	19
0	this is one of the best products i have spent my money on this speakers 'speak' well and you will be amazed at how well they sound for that kind of size also the buying experience from amazon was excellent i got mine deleivered in about 2 days will recommend product for anyone else	19
1	every other negative review here is accurate the video connection is horrible the mouse runs on a delay of 1 2 seconds and is unacceptable try the competing kensington product instead it 's more expensive but it works i switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly in short as advertised and expected	19
1	everything is fine and dandy except the fact that it does n't come with the usb cord to hook the printer to the computer and that is a little important also i have windows vista and the printer is not compatible with it i have to download a patch but that was my own fault i guess you get what you pay for	19
0	if your a serious gamer and want the best quality money can buy like me i would highly suggest this product sounds are crystal clear and fiber optics is the next step up in technology my first question for you would be how much do you invest in your gaming \? once again if your like me the answer is a lot my next question would be how important is your audio experience \? you dont know what your missing out on until you actually experience the difference very happy with this product	19
1	the problem is i have more than one guitar this one is my least favorite p s has bad soun	19
1	i loved this printer ! ! the print quality is truly phenomenal ! i had a few issues with paper sizes too many pieces being fed through the rear feed slot same as other reviewers but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful and yes i am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer because it is dead at the ripe old age of 13 months ! exactly one month after the 1 yr warranty my printer is unfixable and hp wo n't do anything for me after speaking to 8 people on the phone \( only one of which i understood fully \) and 3 supervisors they just said that i'm sol so yes very nice printer if it lasts	19
1	not worth one star ! lasted about 1 week and then started emitting a high pitched whine loud enough to wake people in the next town it is now officially dead and useless even the short while it worked it was almost useless switching speed and mouse response was frankly terrible the keyboard lagged several characters behind my typing and fitting the cables into it was simply not possible do not buy this do n't even think about it	19
1	the phone was very annoying everytime i tried to call on the phone it would not connect i would have to either change the channel or just not call i was only able to connect to the number i was calling once in the 30 times i attempted to call i returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone consumers report was very wrong in their rating of this phone the phone was terrible !	19
1	i wish they had a rating for zero stars i bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters that 's a 24 success rate i subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters memorex has really gone downhill	19
0	this appears to be a good piece of equipment i hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well	19
1	the sound quality is fine if you are in range the dual headsets work as advertised in other words 1 you cannot talk on both phones at the same time \( instead you can transfer a call to the other phone \) 2 the range is not great \( though i have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about 30 ft \) 3 the voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none other than that it 's a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household	19
1	this cartridge does not fit my hp 648c as advertised the color cartridge that accompanied it did however	19
1	although the rs receiver does n't have tv reception \( who cares \) it is 1 2 the price pll digital 3 speaker dx loc switch andprobably much better quality	19

1	the thing would n't even fit around my handle bar i had to zip tie it on a waste of	19
0	this is a high quality precision made piece i'm very particular about the construction of things that i buy and this peerless arm more than met my expectations it was easy to attach to the back of my 32 lcd television and equally easy to mount to the wall i read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble not so here everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen all hardware is included along with clear complete instructions i 'd be surprised if you could find something better	19

0	bought this player for its size \( sports \) and its napster compatibility updated the firmware after having a rocky start but things seem a little more stable now also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods \( around 0 degrees celsius \) odd behaviour but mostly ok now that we are in the spring teens again have n't found a case yet to protect from sweat interface is what i expected dead simple no complaints for the price	19
1	does not work with non apple base stations ! i had a powermac g5 i was told by apple retail store clerks it will work any wireless g access points but no ! at my house my pc can see no less than 6 wireless ap 's \( some from neighbors one mine \) but this airport card can only see one \( which is an apple airport station \) ! tried everything \( googled set encryption modes slow downed my linksys wap tranfering bitrate to 2mbps etc \) and no luck returning it tomorrow	19
0	solid product headphone speaker jack on my laptop died and manufacturer wanted 40 just to cover shipping fees to have it fixed ! i bought this great little unit instead for under 30 good audio actually it saved my laptop once too laptop fell from 2 3 feet but landed right on the rubberized turtle beach micro which took most of the force it was bent 90 degrees at the usb connector but it still worked ! proof of solid construction	19
0	great memory card for the price i would highly recommen	19
1	we bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it did n't have battery back up called sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks how bizarre ! ! they do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center ! boxed it up and it 's going right back where it came from if it 's okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however what 's the use in having an alarm clock if you ca n't trust that it will indeed wake you up	19
1	it came within one week of being ordered it is an excellent product and is as advertised i received a manual for sony 's compact disc recorder instead of the manual for the vrdvc30	19
0	the product works great what i did n't like was not having the attachment to charge the battery in my home it only came with the cigarette lighter power source i had to purchase the other power source seperately i also had purchased the 3000 model previously and it came with both power sources why is that	19
1	i was not aware until purchasing that the u3 smart drive by kingston would not run just any software but only certain programs therefore it is mostly useless to me however i will use it as a general back up thumb drive	19
0	good price just not sure it is needed	19
0	i really needed a printer with a scanner so i could store my important files digitally this printer works great i would recommend to change to the lower resolution so it will operate faster it can scan color also but that takes a loooong time b w has been sufficient for me scans quickly for those printout quality is excellent	19

0	i needed to have an s video feed from my classroom computer to a projector and to a tv monitor this proved to be the most cost effective solution to the problem it works just as hoped	19
1	these headphones have a dececent sound but genuinely no noice cancelling effect the battery powers the speakers a bit which does make them a littel louder but nothing special as you see the price is down to 22 00 which is probably a good price for these \( unfortunatly i bought them at 50 00 and had to return them	19
0	i absolutely love the new scarlet color by fiestaware mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice sometimes i think those fragile stickers result in box abuse ! i was surprised at how small it was but it did say 6 and 6 it is you wo n't bake a pie in it \( unless you make individual ones \) but it will be great for dips and sauces	20
1	not a good light the light is already fading and i do n't use it very often very disappointed	20
1	it is best to invest a few more dollars and purchase a better itemlight and not providing the warmth expected from this price level feels incomplet	20
0	this is great it is very easy to clean just put it in the dishwasher you never have to worry about getting honey or syrup all over again it pours very clean and does n't drip after you 're done it looks very nice too great deal with a classy look	20
0	i had all but given up hope on electric can openers until i bought this one you can tell when you pick it up that it 's of good quality \( not cheap plastic junk \) the removeable head is also very solid heavy duty and washes easily in the dishwasher the black and chrome design looks very stylish on my kitchen counter as well i'm a believer again in electric can openers	20
1	this sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access however it is not a good sharpener it sharpens knives but not well also it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash probably half a year and it will be useless spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year	20
0	not only do these burgundian clay pie pans look wonderful they also bake the most perfect pies i have ever put together the crusts come out even and just that great combo of crisp yet tender and flaky i use martha 's pate brisee recipe but with these pans it is foolproof ! i have the big one for meat pies and 2 of the regular size for sweet pies and quiches wonderful	20
0	i had to replace a heart waffle maker as my grand kids love nana 's heart waffles and i had taken it to the beach and left it there they know nana 's heart waffles are the best as they come from her heart i love this one even more than the last it has great controls that make the perfect waffle clean up is a breeze and it is cute !	20
1	a year of one time daily use and this coffee maker is already going in the trash the swing out filter hinges broke during normal use once broken the filter now no longer stays in place and falls out when the carafe is removed hence it 's ready for the wastebasket on closer inspection the entire filter unit is made of plastic and the hinges are only a few mm 's in diameter sturdier design needed !	20
0	it 's well made sturdy good looking pet crate i bought the small first for my 12 pound cat and it was much too large so i exchanged it for the extra small and it is just right remember that it 's a crate so do n't look for the handle	20
0	great ! i love it ! ! goes great with my kitchen	20
0	i bought this decanter as a present for my father and he has definitely been getting a lot of use out of it it is easy to use and works well at keeping the wine preserved i definitely recommend it i just wish it were a little cheaper since the design is not so special	20
0	very loud and heavy i have used lighter and less noisy vacuums in the past this one does pick up hair and lint very well seems to deep clean for the price it was a good deal	20
0	works great i purchase 3 one for my husband and 2 more for my children good design however it would be nice to have a bit more room on the station to accomodate larger products like a blackberry an ipod and a gameboy the station is not wide enough to put three products like this on at one time	20
0	i bought this fan 2 years ago from phoenix and it is still going strong ! its quiet and unwaveringly loyal i bought my 2nd one just the other day as a gift for my son in seattle he enjoys his as much as i enjoy mine the remote is a big hit with us both if i can i'm going to send a 3rd one to my sister in seattle she is in a studio apt this fan is perfect	20
1	i ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof the coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when i tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me it is a very frustrating mug to drink from the only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot	20
0	i was alittle skeptical buying these but they seem to be working great	20
0	this whisk is very nice and feels very comfortable and sturdy in hand one thing i had n't foreseen however is actually pretty obvious the silicone does n't slide very well along most surfaces so trying to whisk along the bottom of a bowl or pan is a little difficult due to the friction it is exactly as advertised though and i am very happy to have it	20
0	i bought this glass for my wife \( who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine \) as a christmas gift last night she tried out the glass with a friend the reviews from both of them were quite something to watch the wine from this glass tasted far far superior to the same wine from an ordinary red wine glass in fact they poured the remaining wine from the ordinary glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening there was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different superior one	20
0	i ordered this item because i know wusthof has a reputation for quality i find the kitchen shears sturdy and sharp especially appreciated are the easy separation feature of the blades for washing and the handy lid gripper for opening jars and bottles	20
0	i love this salad spinner it works easily for two people spins great and best of all it keeps salad incredibly fresh for many days i highly recommend it	20
0	this timer was a christmas gift for mom she loved it she thought it was very cute	20
0	my dog is simply crazy about these treats but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi long lasting morsel of enjoyment in additon to that since these treats are all natural they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats making them extra healthy the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you ca n't beat the quality	20
0	these pans are light and clean up great just do n't use metal in them will buy more	20
0	i am a boy when i bouhgt this stuff it was the first time live without my family i do not know the cookwre set but my female friends always say where did get it \? or it look really expensive they alway said it 's good and reasonable price	20
1	my 5 year old daughter loves this vacuum the only proble it doesn't hold a charge i charge it over night and maybe lasts 15 min can anyone help	20
1	unless you look like popeye and or have the ability to rip phone books in half with your bare hands you will struggle to wring this mop out even if you can move the wringer the handle sections slide apart i spent more time putting it back together and cursing than actually cleaning the floor	20
1	when i first got this item i loved it i used it 4 times and it stopped working	20
0	the filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier it works really well	20
0	cooking is actually a pleasure when you have tools that are as colourful and cheerful as this little pot it is just beautiful to look at and a joy to use \( i never thought i could get so excited about a simple pot ! \) this little green pepper cooks evenly in the oven or the stovetop and clean up is a breeze i 've use this to make casseroles for 2 4 sides for 4 6 even soups and sauces jambalaya is one dish particularly well suited for this pot straight from simmering on the stove to the table it 's gorgeous i'm planning to get the tomato or pumpkin next	20
1	i bought this as my second fryer the third time i used this fryer the oil went up and came out of the fryer then the lid would n't close properly and that 's the end of it prior to buying this fryer i had the presto fry daddy for years and it worked fine	20
0	looks and works just as advertised took it out of the box and used it the day we received it made for a lovely and lively family dinner great buy	20
1	this coffeemaker makes the worst coffee of any i have owned in 26 years it brews very quickly losing a cup or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top the coffee is weak and bitter \( no matter what brand we have tried \) about the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop we thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on the same thing has happened twice more this coffeemaker is a piece of junk	20
1	the image in this product is misleading it looks like this product contains more than 1 piece but when i opened it i got only one piece which is very small size and also the quality is inferior	20
1	cute bookshelf looks goods and serves its purpose however the tips of it that screw together break really easily we were using it at trade shows where we put it up and took it down once a week it only lasted through 3 shows two tips snapped off the last time we unscrewed it even though we put very little weight on it when it was in use and no weight or funny angles on it when unscrewing probably would work well if you never plan to take it down but i 'd question how much weight it can hold over a long period of time	20
0	we use this to serve ice water at meals it is so beautiful it holds a full 2 qts not much else to say about it it is a water pitcher after all it is a pretty piece that just looks great on the table we have two one for each end of the table	20
0	this came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the holidays as a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation as a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb chickens it 's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck the pan looks good from oven to table yes it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron but i'm really glad to add this to my pantry	20
1	my little 2 years boy is crazy about thomas friends his bedroom was decorated with thomas but the drapes is very low quality material looks like drapes sold at dollar stores for 3 99 no soft is like when you use ironing starch i left only 1 start because matching with the bedding ! i used only one pair with denim drapes liner under to block out light because i opened package the other set i send back to amazon i do not recommend this product and if your boy likes dark room to sleep do not buy ! ! ! i bought pottery barn thin wale corduroy panels are excellent light material and block out light	20
1	way off target said 350 degrees when in reality it was almost 500 doesnt work	20
1	we finally broke down and went looking for a complete set of quality kitchen knives the name wushof came up several times and we purchased a set of them they work well until they started getting dull sooner then i thought they would i have numerous sharpening stone \( ceramic diamond \) and buffing wheels and sharpened them myself to a razors edge again they worked well but soon became very dull we were very careful in the storing and handling of them which made no differance they are well balanced looked well made but are over rated and priced the 2 mac japanese knives we have stay sharper longer take abuse better and sharpen easier	20
0	it 's a quality product from krups which gives lots of froth ! sometimes too much if you are not experienced capuchino maker this product is right for you	20
0	pros works well heats fast auto shutoff feature and visible water level are nice cons putting kettle on base requires lining up 3 slots which takes a little extra care and might result in damage to contacts if you 're not careful	20

1	i was very upset with these sheets and how much lint is still coming off it totally clogged my dryer i have washed them 3 times and i still come up with a trap full should have sent them back	20
0	i just bought this for my cat and it definitely keeps the mess and odor to a minimum it cuts the cleaning time in half from 8 10 minutes of dumping the litter or sifting through it with a scoop and spraying the box down down to only 2 minutes it 's just overall so much better than any of the other litter boxes litter maid products i 've seen and the price is reasonable i wish i had this for my previous cats i 've owned	20
0	my husband and i have really enjoyed this product they are very soft and a good sized towel	20
0	i was a little hesitant to spend over 10 for a splatter screen as most of them really are n't worth more than a few bucks however i am very glad that i spent the extra money on this one the quality of this item is top notch it 's much more sturdy than any others that i 've seen i 've been using this splatter screen for a few months now and still love it the feet on the bottom are very helpful in controlling messes the handle is terrific \( some screens only have either a d ring on the top or a thin handle \) and seems to stay cool while in use this even got raves from my mother	20
1	my girlfriend just bought this couch from amazon this is by visiondecor furniture first it shows up on the curbside in pieces did you ever hear of a couch in pieces and that you actually have to put it together \? this is not including the cushions the material is loose and very cheap looking and the frame is flimsy i do n't know if it will last a year ikea furniture is actually better quality paid around 550 with shipping if she would have spent another 200 she would have a great quality couch from one of the local furniture stores in los angeles she is very disappointed and wants to cry sad very sad	20
0	this pillow holds the heart shape better than i expected from some of the other reviews we have been careful so that it does not burst because of others warnings about the mess still my daughter has made good use of this pillow and still sleeps with it every night	20
0	i was pleased with these canisters the lids do not screw on but seem to be airtight with the rubber seal the only complaint i have is that they appeared to be shiny in the photo but are actually brushed stainless	20
0	it is big and heavy but a real workhorse mixes things we would only do by hand before	20
0	i have n't used this for herbs but i have used it for onions and garlic and like the other reviewers found it very handy for quick and tear free mincing it 's a very simple design and holds more food than you would expect i love that it 's only 3 small parts \( 4 if you count the rubber blade \) that all fit easily into the dishwasher \( top rack \)	20
1	looks nice but the roll does fall off and thick paper towels can rub the top edge of the unit closest to the cabinet item is being returned	20
0	we love these glasses we have had the reidel glasses like these many times they break so easily and ca n't go in the dishwasher these glasses are so much more utilitarian we use them as our everyday glasses not just for wine they look great feel good in the hand and can go in the dishwasher and cost so much less we still keep the reidel on hand for special occasions they are more refined but i got so tired of that ultra thin glass breaking in my hand as i attempted to scrub the wine stains out of that porous glass i strongly recommend the libbey glasses you will like it like like it on your table table table	20
1	this fan does not have enough power to even come close to blowing out the hot air from even the smallest room go for the industrial strength expensive ones	20
1	i have owned this blanket for less than a month so i cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability but the first \( and only \) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime and the dye used on the moss green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent i gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm and has an attractive weave	20
1	i followed the instructions many times but still ca n't get the cork pulled out of the wine bottle the oster wine opener cork screw goes in just fine however instead of pulling out the cork the cork screw just reverses direction and comes out of the cork i'm 75 and bought this after reading a review on how great it was for older folks with arthritis well maybe i have a lemon but i certainly would love someone from oster tell me is i'm doing something wrong thank you for the opportunity to bring this to someone 's attentio	20
1	i bought this blender because i liked its retro design and i thought it would function well well every single time i 've tried to use it has been a disaster even for very simple tasks like blending soft avocado the blender has not worked the blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything it 's horrible and i even threw away my old ugly blender when i bought this one and the other worked just fine	20

1	i got these sheets and was very pleased with them at first after a couple of days i observed color sticking to everything around the worst it painted my matress in red color ! ! i tried my best to remove the color but it wont go away now i found the best place for these sheets in the attic	20
1	this was a seventh anniversaty gift and being made of copper is its only real benefit two of the welded connections between the rings were broken upon receipt and it 's light and relatively shabby in construction it 's difficult to find a 7th anniversary gift made of copper and to that end this fit the bill but its real value even for the intended purpose is very limited	20
0	this is a great gift because there fun cute and usefull so when you come home from a bad day at school or work there alaways there to me there like a special friend that you can cuddle so for kids and adults this is a must have	20

1	i ordered this timer and was excited this was stylish and red to match my kitchen this ended up being a nuisance purchase as i have to return it ! it ticks but the bell does n't ring at the end also i was disappointed in it 's packaging as well as the item itself it does not look upscale the plastic is not nice but cheap looking and the metal part is actually painted plastic if you are looking for a classy gift or decoartor item look elsewhere !	20
0	these are a purchase to go with wamsutta sheets my daughter likes extra pillows these wash very well and are nice and heavy duty pillow cases are usually expensive for 2 99 at the closeout price i got a bargain !	20
1	i hated these shakers i got them as a gift and 1 they are too big and take up too much space and 2 the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3 the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out the other smaller fiesta ware ones the round ones are much much better	20
1	this is not and i repeat is not a good alarm there is one alarm light and you can hardly tell which one is sounding it looks as if the specs are lying to me and i hate lies also the battery died after 6 8 months the low battery alert is loud and chirps so anoyingly i also noticed that the alarm sounds a loud shrieking alarm when it sounds i will return this alarm never again will i trust in first alert	20
1	read the info about this product carefully this listing is not for kitchen scissors but rather poultry shears chef 's choice does make the 8 kitchen scissors in the picture but that is not what you will get if you order these i had these on my wishlist and my brother ordered them for me for christmas i am now returning the poultry shears to amazon	20
0	this bread slicer is quite good it has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it it cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized loaves i have found though that if i bake the largest size loaf the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after i slice a few slices i am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container	20
0	i have had this unit for 8 months and have n't had any problems it has ground my coffee fine enough and not cracked i have not experienced a problem with it being too fat to hold with one hand and i have very small hands some of the coffee does stick to the inside but is easily removed with a spoon or napkin	20
1	the bissell 2680b perfect sweep dual brush sweeper has a pole attachment that keeps coming apart every time you attempt to sweep this defect in the design which uses sections instead of one long pole makes it impossible to use without aggravation we have put tape around the pole but it does not work now we are going to try screws to hold it together i never saw anything like this in my life and hope i never do again	20
1	i love the sango nova brown dishware and rate it 5 stars this boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight the slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer 's comments mine too arrived broken sure seems like sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping i sure hope amazon gets credit from sango for all these broken pieces combined score 2	20
1	the item is not packed well for shipping the drawer and top were cracked when i called the number on the replacement part i was told did not have the replacement they gave me a number to call for target they in turn told me they could n't send it and told me to call the number i had just called unreal trying to get this fixed i am going to have to pack the whole thing up and return myself no help in getting this taken care of	20
1	when i opened the product the sheets really were soft but when you 're laying on them they are n't very comfortable i would n't buy another set again but they were cheap so not a horrible buy	20
0	just tried it out with some basic jasmine rice from the local supermarket it is rice we have prepared numerous times in another \( cheaper \) brand rice cooker and also have prepared on the stovetop the rice that came out of the zojirushi was absolutely perfect ! as good as any i have had in any local restaurant or on my frequent trips to china i was astounded none of the crispy brown stuff we had in the other cooker just perfect plump fragrant rice the countertop stayed clean as well did n't bubble over with starch water like the other cooker clean up of the cooker was easy top notch excellent product you ca n't make better rice than what this thing produces	20

1	this percolator is not worth the price the coffee tastes lousy and it does not stay hot i returned mine and purchased the farberware fcp512s 12 cup cordless percolator i love it !	20
0	i have never used any other dehydrator 's and found this very simple to use clean store and the price was great plus it makes my house smell great when i'm using it so far i have only dehydrated fruits and vegetables and still have to get used to how long to leave things in the machine and how to prep them however the instructions really makes it very easy and overall i'm finding it enjoyable to use	20
0	this is a significant improvement over the 750 model the 750 model was not very well designed the first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic we returned this we got the 760 to replace that the 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem for the same price as the 750 the 760 comes with one extra bowl juicer and egg whisk compared with others like the cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed	20
1	i bought this for my mother in law at her request she has arthritis and saw it on tv she also wanted the free gripper that came with it i scoured the listings at amazon looking for one that included the gripper even paid a little more for it she used the can opener once and it broke the free gripper required sending away for it and an inflated s h fee	20
1	i ordered this table based on the reviews i read and boy i will never do that again this table is such poor quality and is not worth the money i am so disappointed in it that i shoved it in a corner where no one can see it and put a plant on it it is not a sturdy table so if you are looking for something that holds up this is not one to buy i would say this table is worth 20 and no more	20
0	i just bought my second one the first alarm hangs in our kitchen and does go off with a nice loud alarm when i seriously scorch dinner it 's easy to turn off with the huge button in front no false alarms here only goes off when there is smoke nearby	20

1	i have used a lightweight hoover for years and was very pleased with it when i first received this new cleaner i was really excited with the power it had the third time i used it the belt broke with each use my back would start hurting the forward motion was very easy but pulling it back was hard i returned this product because i felt there was something wrong with it	20
1	great coffee and a convenient size but the carafes keep breaking on me ! i used the original carafe just a few times before it broke i ordered a replacement and was extra careful when handling it \( especially when washing it \) i used the carafe maybe five times before it broke these things just seem to spontaneously combust the carafes are 12 a piece so it 's not worth replacing again argh	20
1	the description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt pepper but there is no such knob on the mini grinders we replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder does n't work disappointing	20
1	we have used krups products for years and been highly satisfied with them this coffee maker has two problems \( 1 \) its spout is badly engineered it is impossible to pour out the last 3 4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid \( 2 \) it is a thermos so the machine does not heat up the coffee but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed i like hot coffee after the first cup i find that i have to heat up the remainder in the microwave this is inconvenient i would not buy another of this model	20
0	i only ordered these because they were only 9 99 for the whole set i do n't think they are nice enough to serve to your guests but i 'd use them on the weekend when i have brunch with my husband	20
1	i could not believe the condition in which this rolling pin arrived when i opened the bag around the pin one handle fell off when i looked at the pin i noticed huge dark gouges in the wood pieces that make the ravioli i thought that was bad enough but when i turned the pin over there was a huge chunk out of one of the wood pieces needless to say it 's useless this was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last	20
0	after reading some of the previous reviews about shipping damage i almost did n't order it however it arrived in great shape and the packing material was excellent someone must have gotten sanyo 's attention on the quality of their packing material	20
0	i loved my 8 inch global chef knife so much i ordered this veggie knife oh wow this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it 's smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies it also fits in your hand extremely well if you are going to cut up a potato it is hard to beat the chef 's knife however for cutting up a tomato carrot etc this thing is the best tool i have ever used just wonderful	20
0	love this product excellent cheese cutter three choices of thickness highly recommended	20
0	i have this bowl and the larger one they are perfect bowls for mixing the rubber base really helps the bowl stay put i was them in the dishwasher without any problems	20

0	i got this wok for christmas as a gift it is perfect you are able to cook just about anything on this at a high heat without worrying that the food will stick to the bottom of the pan it is easy to clean so far i have cooked stir fries and potatoes with chorizo each time the food came out perfect not undercooked or over cooked	20
0	great pot i'm annoyed at having to press the unlock button everytime the one that prevents accidental spills the automated dispensing is too slow for my tastes i'm used to an earlier version that you have to press down from the top in hindsight i should have bought an earlier version to avoid the differencesi'm also really annoyed at the shipping bought through amazon it was shipped in the box that the manufacturer put it in which was n't up for the rigors of shipping but honestly i ca n't tell if the gaping crowbar looking inflicted holes were caused by the shipping or no	20
1	my gf loves popcorn so i was tasked to purchase her a replacement for her cheapo 10 air popper i saw this one and thought what a great idea and bought it on the spot i had n't read the reviews here when i did my heart sank although some people did rate it high and said it was great sadly these may be closer to paid reviews because the consensus here seems to be true slow popping with small kernals it makes a mess as well with kernels everywhere if you like running through a batch of pops then do not look at this model it 's simply too slow and requires a breather it was returned yesterday	20
1	poor quality the cover leaks i had to return it back do not buy	20
1	the coffe table arrived broken the item where easy to asemble and look good	20
1	all 6 of of the glasses in my set were at least slightly misshapen one was positively a mutant ! the stems were not centered and there were for lack of a better description glass tumors where the bowls meet the stems the glasses were also thicker than i expected from spiegalau other spiegalau items i 've purchased have been superb so this could very well be an anomaly	20
0	like the other reviewers it would be nice if the plastic was metal but i love this little thing ! i usually have tons of honey everywhere just put a little hot water in the base let sit for a few minutes and it pours out great ! so easy that even my little kids can use it without making too much mess	20
1	i bought this cleaner for use in between major vacuuming it clogs very quickly without having swept up very much it is probably fine for floors without carpet	20
1	after reading the reviews on this product i thought it would be a great space heater for my apt i could n't have been more wrong it barely gets hot even on the highest setting and gives off almost no heat ! ! perhaps mine is defective or got broken during shipping but it was a huge waste of money i have had to go out an buy another space heater already it is so frustrating one word do n't !	20
1	after remodelling our kitchen i wanted to upgrade the look of items that would be sitting out when i saw the picture of the towel holder i thought it unique with its scroll work and would n't look like everything else i saw when i received it the first thing i noticed was that the base had ugly black smudge marks on the area that would be visible i tried with no luck to remove the stains the area where the short post attaches screws in crookedly because the threaded receiver was set at a tilt ! all in all i would not trust this company to have consistant quality in their workmanship	20
1	the high tech commercial cooking surface began to come off at the third use of this griddle i do n't know what evenheat means in their product description but this griddle has a hot spot on the left side i'm in the market for a new griddle but i wo n't buy anything labeled broilking again	20
0	i got these to dress up our daily fiestaware as salad plates and they go beautifully with the persimmon especially but also brighten up the sunflower or periwinkle stack up really nicely and compactly unlikethe fistaware \) enjoy !	20
0	we bought two santas and two pacconi christmas trees when they were on a steep discount at amazon they were the best gifts we gave immediate hits with each couple one in their late 50 's one in the mid 20 's in each case the response was the same it 's like my childhood they are going in the living room each season vivid but soft these are superb decorations	20
0	i found this knife set to contain the sharpest knives out of the box of any knives that i have ever bought they hold an edge well and have a good balance the integrated bolster adds to the controllability of the knives the only problem with the set is the steel hone i find it is too course to be used except on the dullest knife that is the only detractor from the set	20
0	ove glove is great everything they say it is my husband is the chef it was my valentine 's day gift to him and he 's happy as a clam ! thanks ove glove	20
0	my wife wanted two sets to match our new family room decor well they turned out to be so beautiful that we have replaced our good formal china with this set really gorgeous pattern and color the red has a slight orange cast and is not a perfect match for a more maroon red the sets arrived in perfect condition although the two outside box were very beat up excellent packaging a fabulous deal	20
0	the price was excellent ordering was quick and easy delivery was prompt the high quality of the muffin rings was matched by their performance in the kitchen they performed flawlessly on my electric griddle	20
1	first i liked this press good coffee reasonable price but in 3 weeks operation the press itself has already broken the plastic holder for mesh filter has broken may be this pres is good for ones a year usage but not for everyday	20
0	what a beautiful bowl i love the tea rose design by pfaltzgraff ! i liked it so much that i ordered a second one ! this seller sends items very quickly and they package their items with extreme care i love this seller	20
1	the detector was simple enough to use although it required alot of batteries \( 8 \) but the results were mixed urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances even in areas where i knew there had been an accident it was difficult to spot the difference all in all i generally would n't recommend this \( although it did clearly show a distressing amount of what i believe is mold in the bathroom \)	20
0	they are n't kidding this thing is razor sharp it needed no tuning up before i used it for the first time the handle is balanced so that one feels almost no weight which is unfortunate because i like the weight for chopping but the hollow edge design is wonderful the mushrooms and onions i sliced up were thin as paper and did n't stick to the blade i 'd recommend it	20
1	i wanted a humidifier that was silent but when i plugged this in not only could i hear it from the other room but it 's a high pitched whine i do n't know what to do about it i think i 'll probably just return it for something different	20
1	i purchased the f69204 for 150 on sale used once that year with good results it was another year before i tried to use again shortly after starting the motor it froze up and quit on disassembly i found that roller bearings are not used in the motor instead an oil soaked felt type bearing that failed the parts book said you could order the motor alone but when i attempted this i was told you had to order the complete motorizing unit for a cost of 90 plus shipping in the future i will stick with the cheaper middle grade units that i have had excellent results with and are cheap enough to discard and buy an new one if they fail	20
1	the decanter 's pretty the wine topper is okay however the picture is misleading these two items are clearly not meant to be paired the topper does not fit must have been very carefully balanced for the photo but it sure wo n't stay that way the topper is made for a bottled wine not a decanter	20
1	because just around the 60 day mark the chime turned into a terrible noise like something dying i just turned that feature off and continued enjoying the dispenser but a month later \( 3 months after original purchase \) the thing is spewing soap non stop wasted lots of soap this way changing the batteries did n't help soap just flows out until there 's none left to maintain some customer satisfaction sharper image should consider backing their products with a better return policy or providing some better quality control	20
0	the fact that you do n't have to rotate the trays like some other dehydrators is great ! we have made a lot of beef jerky since buying the snackmaster express it is a great product works great	20
0	great product at a great price the first shipment came broken and amazon replaced it immediately without the hassles of having to return a broken item thank you	20
1	this item comes with many warnings as it should it can be hazardous to use this heater with an adaptor for a two pronged outlet the product itself is of high quality and runs well just not when you are in the process of renovating a house	20
1	i bought this coffee maker and after only using it 6 10 times over the course of 13 months it stopped working i called the number for service that was listed in the booklet and was told it ca n't be repaired i should just throw it away ! i had already purchased nearly 100 pods and now those and the coffee maker are useless ! buy one at you own risk	20
1	thinking this would be an excellent gift for mr electronics geek light sleeper it became a pretty big joke \( and embarassment for me \) because some of the sounds that come out of this thing sound like a circus or a dying speak n' spell do n't bother buy the sound screens used in medical offices etc for half the price they 're so much better	20
1	as others have stated the gears are plastic and will fail after 1 to 2 years and no replacement parts to fix so the can opener has to trashed	20
1	i ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up big people food for my grandson it could not even grind up a soft hot dog ! we kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material \( painted gray to look like metal ! \) it just could n't do the job sheesh i mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder total waste of money also my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two junk	20
0	these tables are great i bought two of them solid wood classic design that will still look good in 10 years and easy no fuss assembly all this at a great price pick one up	20
0	fiestaware rocks ! the turquoise place setting is beautiful it is much brighter than the pictures on amazon com fiestaware is functional calssic and fun i love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this i highly recommend mixing and matching fiestaware i mix up colors that you would n't normally expect to go together and they usually look great	20
1	will not last long only a few months old and getting weak alread	20
1	omie izzy are brother sister kitties about 6 months old they received this as a gift it 's fun when someone plays with us with a chasing toy but we do n't play in it much on our own one of the wires broke already and we 've had it less than one month	20
1	before i purchased this product i read several reviews many of them very favorable this product was also recommended by the grout cleaning restoring company i recently used for my tile floors imagine my surprise and disappoinment when i discovered how utterly useless this product actually is it does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor and an even worse job of sucking it back up leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor i literally have to remop the entire floor every time i use it i 've tried other bissel products which were fine but this one is an expensive dud do n't waste your mone	20
0	the pizzelle baker performed very well the batches of pizzelles were excellent and the recipes included were good i recommend this pizzelle iron	20
0	i was a little skeptical because of the affordable price but i gave this set a try and love it the pieces are heavy enough to maintain a consistant heat and are very durable clean up is a breeze i am very happy with this set and will be purchasing other pieces	20
1	corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies usually \( but not always \) oxo products are good at making things easier to do i have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky you also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork poor design this time oxo	20
0	this is a great product for holding your knives my wife and i got a nice set of henckel knives as a wedding present i could n't figure out how i could transport the knives along with the blade savers this roll bag does a great job of protecting as well as allowing us to safely transport our knives	20
0	i read a few not so favorable reviews mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand \( which mine does not suffer \) but i decided to order it anyway figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand \( you can also wall mount it \) well it has paid off as the magnets work as promised the tines stay sealed tight and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own as for labels there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices i honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack and it has worked beautifully	20
0	there is n't a lot to say about this other than this pan demonstrates the kitchenaid high quality that one would expect from kitchenaid it 's extremely well made and of very high quality	20
1	the blender i received also smelled as if it was overheating and the tachometer did not work i am sending it back and will be asking for a refund this clearly is not a reliable blender	20
0	getting those decanters to dry without spots can be problematic this is a big help the wide base allows better balance than you would think and is really very secure i would prefer a larger balance point but this does the job	20
1	received set and tumblers are not good quality the edges are quite sharp and the glass still sweats would not recommend	20
0	these are great ! the keep my drinks cold for a very long time and are top rack dishwasher safe ! !	20
1	after i read stories about problems chlorine causes in the shower chlorine i got this filter it turns out most water systems are using chloramine now a more stable additive instead of chlorine and this filter like most is ineffective at removing chloramine see if your water system uses chloramine and save yourself an expensive filter that probably does n't work	20
1	very hard to get any actual pepper to come out of this thing i just put some pepper on eggs and it took over 10 squeezes imagine trying to grind pepper out for a stock pot full of soup impossible	20
0	this tea kettle is simply devine to use no cords in the way no waiting for water to boil just let it sit on your kitchen counter and it 's all automatic looks beautiful as well i 've purchased many as gifts and have one at home and one on the boat thanks cuisinart for this product	20
1	we got this as a present and had high hopes to actually use it as a microwave it takes over 7 minutes to warm something up and forget about making microwave popcorn it just does n't pop the kernals overall lots of features but it 's the worst microwave i 've ever owned	20
0	this color is a bit too bright but the bag it very comfortable	20
1	while the pan handle stays cool the lid handle heats up with the pan you need a pot holder to use the cover i did n't like that	20
1	this is the last item i will ever purchase from sharper image it broke the second week i had it spewing hand soap at will and not when i placed my hand under the infrared sensor it 's pure crap stay away ! !	20
1	i'm not happy the filter needed changing one day out of the box we have soft water so this should have lasted a while difficult to hang on to when filling have to hold it like a baby does put out the air though and fits about anywhere	20
1	i loved this vacuum initially you can even see how much dirt it 's picking up ! however the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately to where the vacuum wo n't pick up a speck of lint you ahve to empty the filter every 5 10 minutes i do not have a terribly messy household just one with no stairs going to the front backyard	20
1	it 's a beautiful mug \( we 've bought 2 \) but it drips does n't keep the temperature it 's a nightmare to clean and it 's not higienic unbelievable bad product	20
0	i purchased this coat rack as a replacement for one that was similar in color and style because it had broken i could n't be happier with the product i received and i am sure that it will last just as long as the other one that i had a great buy	20
0	i owned an earlier similar model that was disappointing and never whistled once but this kettle worked very well and the whistle worked perfectly at first but after only about 6 weeks of use the flip up spout broke off actually just broke in half i replaced it with a chantal teakettle and so far so good	20
1	worked fine for about 6 months and then the inner surface failed i'm not sure precisely what happened but some part of the surface coating wore off and now it 's impossible to make a waffle that does n't stick completely to the waffle iron a complete waste of money	20
0	loved this rug i have purchased 5 nicer than the one at crate barrel and at such an affordable price	20
0	i use this mug a lot for chicken noodle and other soups as well as salads its easy to clean up and to handle i like having the lid with the pop top so its does n't make a mess in the microwave i fits easily in the tote bag when commuting to work i highly recommend it ! !	20
1	i did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation motor power and style i exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs ! it is not the electricity as i have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet	20
0	i ordered these glasses to have extra for a party fun shape drew compliments i now shuffled them in to use as my everyday glasses \( all matching ! \) but i do have concerns with cleaning the larger glass with no dishwasher i handwash everything and i find it hard to reach down into the recesses at the base of the tall curved glass the smaller one is fine my hand reaches	20
0	this machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well the fan is very quiet i like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well my only complaint is that the blue lcd that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is very bright too bright for a bedroom really lights it up i 'll be looking for some way of safely masking it otherwise very nice but hope it lasts	20
0	this miniature pot is decorative as well as utilitarian since it can be used on the flame for melting butter or small amounts of sauces	20
0	this item saves space because it folds everything to the same size it is god 's gift to those of us who have small closets and hate messes i first saw it when a clerk at a store was using it to put clothes back on the floor for sale i tried to buy it off her and she told me the name of the company i love the flip fold you wo n't be sorry if you buy this item	20
0	i absolutely love this tablecloth ! it is a nice gentle white color that goes very well with my dark wood dining set it is very easy to clean because it repels liquids i love this tablecloth so much that i want to get it in a few more colors to change it up for different seasons	20
1	i was not pleased with this griddle at all after reading the positive reviews i ordered it maybe mine was defective but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when i flipped them it did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher oh well ca n't win them all	20
0	so far so good i have a 3mo shep that so far has a blast with this thing i saw one reviewer that said it tore apart and will update as time goes by so far i love them well she loves them easy for her to pick up when the ball is much larger than her mouth \( holes in ball \) the football shaped one bounces in odd directions but highly recommend the blue one as dogs see blue well \( color blind \)	20
1	it stopped working 6 months after the warranty ran out according to sanyo will cost more to fix than i paid while it lasted it worked fine	20
0	for an inexpensive pizza stone it does the job if you 're looking for something that is more versatile look somewhere else this stone is primarily for breads pizza and the like i know this because i tried baking cookies on it the cookies turned out fine but they stuck to the stone however when i make home made pizza from scratch the crust comes out perfect ! not too soft not too crisp it bakes it perfectly all the way through with a nice golden crust	20
0	my husband received a similar bag for christmas that holds 6 bottles of beer we are scheduled to attend a formal event where we will need to bring 2 bottles of wine the black is perfect for the purpose and looks much better than a gawdy paper bag or bottle bag and we do n't have to worry about the bottom falling out the material is sturdy and for cold wines will insulate well	20
0	great product very soft save my expensive mattress from my son 's mishaps several time already however one of the stain got though perhaps it 's not 100 water proof	20
0	works just fine for my needs i use it to press my 'wrinkle free' dockers the water container for the steam is a bit awkward to fill but once it is filled it lasts a good long time heavy duty well constructed dependable unit first package 'disappeared' at ups when they shipped the first machine it was evidently damaged and returned back to amazon by ups \( probably due to the thin cardboard used for packing \) the replacement shipment arrived just fine and as always amazon customer service very helpful on shipping replacement while first package was still 'lost'	20
1	i was cooking 5 strips of bacon on the platter in the microwave and the platter actually cracked in half ! i have cooked bacon on my other platters with no problem this is dangerous and annoying i could n't find sango customer service anywhere therefore had to return to retailer etc	20

1	this is not a 2 quart sauce pan it is 2 5 quarts exactly the same as the one that comes with the se	20
0	there is n't much you can say about a sharpening steel it sharpens well and is extremely fine for keeping already sharp blades at their sharpest the handle is ugly gray plastic but it seems solidly put together and is easy to work with	20
1	i love water filters this perhaps is my third first was a brita gave to family member years ago and it is still in use went on to faucet style but prefer pitchers then to this ultra this pitcher leaks i suspect it is the style leak is not big time but pitcher will have to be replaced wayyyy too soon in a household where there is no rough treatment of kitchen items i am not happy elain	20

1	the stool is great as far as it 's ability to function it is quite thin which makes it easy to store it does have a safety issue ! ! ! ! ! my 3 year old son got his finger pinched when we were adjusting it to push it together i almost got my finger pinched as well on more than one occassion my husband welded it together and now it remains in the open position thus no more pinched fingers i would think twice before purchasing this one if you have toddlers around i was right there when my son pinched his finger and it was difficult to open the stool back up to release his finger	20
1	i bought this about two years ago and it never worked very good for me the handle does n't stay together very good and it does n't pick up much i would n't recommend this sweeper to anyone do n't waste your money on it	20
1	we had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out when i saw the refurbished for 20 00 i thought it was a great deal it would have been if it had come with all the parts and did n't leak ! ! it did n't come with seals or with the water purifier i tried everything including new seals \( that i bought separately \) eventually we just went out and purchased a new one because we still like the model	20

1	i bought this kettle in february 2006 i liked everything about it until its automatic on off switch died recently only two months after the purchase now the kettle wo n't turn on it was n't abused in any way and these kettles usually last for years and years the last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new proctor silex k4070 i wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique \? has anyone else had one with a short lived switch or was i unlucky \?	20

0	these glasses are perfect for keeping drinks colder or warmer and the best part is you do n't feel the temperture on the outside nor do you have condensation from the differences between inside and outside tempeture	20

0	i bought this lightwedge for my daughter who is 7 i found out that after i put her to bed she could not go to sleep right away she would use a flashlight to do little reading well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light it shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes my only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes i ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks they should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes but it does do the job	20

1	i bought this and one of their wooden pizza peels i thought it would be ergonomically advantageous which it may be but on the first pizza i cut \( on the mountain woods peel \) the edge is now folded over a bit rendering the edge much much less sharp than out of the box so i would suggest you save your 3 and the out sized shipping costs and buy yourself a cutter that may last for a while	20
1	this sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use it removes the air with a fan there is air left in the bag it does n't create a vacuum the bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid the bags are folded on a roll and you have to seal three sides to create a bag i was also dissappointed in the weight of the bags they are thinner than ziploc bags you cannot use canisters with this one	20

1	we have had the cordless blender for 3 years now and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen clean up was a breeze too the worst feature of this blender the 'rechargable' battery which withihn a year took less and less of a charge after each use now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once it does not surprise me that cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately which in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence but in turn cuisinart should not be surprised when i never buy another one	20
0	i 've had the grind and brew for almost 3 years and have never had any problems it makes great coffee it 's not that hard to clean and it has adjustable settings for temperature and coffee strength so if you fiddle with it a little you can get it to make exactly the coffee you want i gave one to my cousin a couple of years ago as well and it turned him into a total coffee addict	20

1	my steamer worked well for all of 5 mins the pole went from upright to a 45 degree angle without hanging anything on it and would not straighten out the defect appeared to be at the connection where the pole screws into the machine then within minutes i had water all over my hardwood floors i had the same problem as other reviewers the water tank kept leaking so off to the returns department we went i guess it steamed well for the five minutes that it worked \? not worth all the mess and hassle of returning it	20

1	i bought this wok 6 months ago i seasoned it very well and started to use it but i noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when i cooked the dish with a lot of sauce it meant i could n't use it for steaming when i made a fried rice i had a hard time to clean it and re season it most chinese use a wok to cook everything so i expected i could do that too but i was wrong this wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry that 's all	20

1	i purchased this high end toaster oven because i wanted needed a proficient smaller oven for smaller baking needs after 5 months of moderate usage however the middle knob has malfunctioned and it will no longer bake other than that i was satisfied with the product i called their customer service and to get it repaired under warranty will have to ship it at least 250 miles away at my expense what a hassle i may just go buy a cheap toaster oven to replace it instead of spending the time and money on postage live and learn just because a product costs more does n't mean it 's better	20

1	it seems that there is always something crappy in a good design the pot does a good job perking coffee but the lid and the glass top are bad and enough to void the use of the pot i think that melitta should send out for nothing the glass top i am like the other reviews i would not buy another melitta product unless they make good on this pot there is a danger of the top blowing out and melitta could be in for law suits	20

1	do n't waste your money or your food by buying and using this so called slow cooker just like most people have reported the unit runs very hot ! this is an indication of poor manufacturing quality control after a couple of burnt meals i went out and bought a different unit with a mechanical temperature control switch unfortunately i had thrown away the carton and receipt so i could n't return it as a result of this experience and wasting my good money i will avoid buying rival products in the future	20
0	i 've had one of these in constant use for four years now and it fulfills its reason for being admirably it is totally utilitarian and keeps my valued wusthof global and henckels knives organized out of sight protected and instantly accessable without taking up the whole drawer or using up valuable counter space as larger 'made mostly for show' blocks would if you 're looking for something simple and in its own way elegant this should serve you well for a long time if you have more knives than this will hold or if you have lots of counter space to waste get something larger that 's just my opinion i could be wrong	20
1	this did n't do as well as an old microwve poper i 've used for yers it did n't showa great increase in kernals popped and they were not as light and crispy it is absolutely necessary to use the 'power packs' which i could n't find in local stores since i gave several of the poppers as gifts i shopped on line for replacement 'power packs' for all and found the postage handling fee for 10 packages was ten times what it cost for one \( incredibly light \) pack	20

0	for big birds rib roasts etc you need a long knife to get a clean even slice this knife delivers it has great lines and a ballanced feel the forged blade is thin and flexible yet still drives from the handle the blade follows your directions well and does n't wander during a cut a real gem with top quality construction i'm a big fan of three rivet durability but these contemporary handles look and feel so good that i chose them for the last three knives i purchased blade for blade these knives are the best around at this price you can build a lifetime set in months istead of years	20

1	not functional bought it as a gift and could not give it after looking at it and trying to put a roll of paper towels on it impossible to use the rod and rod top and base are not aligned properly nor made properly also it came in a box that was damaged and taped together \( not the shipping box the polder box that the product comes in \) looks like someone returned it previously \( probably for the same reasons \) and it was then sent to me i still have it because i was not able to return it within the 30 days alloted time to throw it out waste of money	20
1	like everything in the world this coffee maker is lawyer approved in other words it does not get hot enough to cause any harm unfortunately one minute after poring it is not hot enough to be considered a good cup of coffee every day i have to warm my coffee up in the microwave	20
1	we ordered this for a spare fridge and it would be a great size but the first on came and it was damaged it looked like it had been dropped then i called target they did great taking care of getting us another on only the second came today and it was also dropped from a truck the back was dented and it was already rusting so i think we will try some where else for this item	20

0	great item just what i needed the price was fine and the company reputation was a serious consideration in my selection	20
1	when this fountain is freshly cleaned the cats love it the water does stay cool but cat hair lots of that around here clogs the pump and if the whole thing is not taken apart and completely cleaned with a toothbrush weekly it grows slime eeeeuuuw the first pump lasted about three months then the replacement lasted about a month not really worth it because the picky fussy cat would really rather drink from the toilet anyway	20

1	the fan does work fairly well as an intake fan however in exhaust mode \( the mode i need \) i can barely feel a breeze from either side of the unit it simply does n't work as an exhaust fan therefore to accurately describe the fan it may be a 2 470 cfm intake fan and it is about a 2 cfm exhaust fan i'm returning it by the way the packing slip from air n water states that a 15 restocking fee that applies to all returns i am very unhappy with the fan and will be extremely unhappy with air n water if they try to hit me with a restocking fee	20
1	this french press made a delicious cup of coffee the problem is that it is advertised as a 3 cup coffeemaker i returned it and will get a larger size	20

0	i have been using this cushion for a couple of years now i use to be able to buy it at walgreens but they no longer carry it i was so happy when i found it on amazon i have several of the cushions around i keep one in my car one at home one at work and now i have one to travel with i take it on airplanes when i travel i have broken my tailbone twice and the shape of the cushion takes pressure off of the tailbone i have recommended it to relatives and friends and they all pruchased it and love it	20
0	not many people can rationalize spending twenty dollars on a pizza cutter but i previously worked at a pizzeria and often make gourmet pizzas at home this cutter is sharp and rarely requires multiple cuts to slice through all of the crust it is really useful on those thick pizzas like spinach and feta plus it looks pretty cool hanging on the wall behind your cutting board i almost never use it for any non pizza cooking and a heavy sharp knife works almost as well however it 's a fun item and if you find yourself looking for a nice gift for somebody who makes a lot of pizza i definitely recommend it	20
1	i received this model as a gift and thought it would be great since we only brew a few cups at a time however as other reviewers noted almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day i was n't intending to use the delay feature very often so i did n't bother to return it now just short of a year after i received it it suddenly started working so i'm shopping for a replacement i might try another mr coffee model with better reviews but not this one	20
1	ok this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted it barely picks up even simple dirt and debris and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds not minutes also it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into bank of america and swipe a few mil really its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge stupid stupid stupid design the same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together its like a rubics cube a true waste of 40 bucks do n't buy this ! it does n't even look very cool	20
0	i feel rich sleeping in these sheets ! they are quite wrinkley but just take them out of the dryer as quick as possible i will have these sheets for years looking just as they do today i'm sure money well spent	20

0	the bissell flip it saves me a lot of time cleaning floors and does a more thorough job than a mop	20
1	petmate makes a great fountain but their black model should be discontinued it is impossible to tell if the water is clean by looking at it when i went to wash this fountain like i usually do every couple of weeks there was a purplish color slim growing by the pump and the charcoal filter was covered with it i think the pump motor might have been leaking \( i'm not really sure \) if i had their white fountain i would have noticed there was a problem with the water right away	20
0	this works great on tile grout ! it would be nice if it worked good on the glass shower doors but it did n'tnot bad for the price it does take a long time to get the job done	20
0	i just received and tested my new miele office vac even this lowest end miele is fantastic ! it 's as quiet as the one i have at home it 's similarly designed easy to use and works terrifically well i am so pleased that i spent the extra money and got a really good vacuum	20
1	i also had a problem with the coating flaking off within the first week of using it the only reason i still use it is because i'm a poor college student that got it as a gift in the first place and ca n't afford a new one after scrubbing the inside bottom of the wok furiously i managed to get all the flakes off and then some the lid is made of thin aluminum and has bent almost completely out of shape awful product do not buy this wok	20
1	i am sure there is a lesson in my experience i fist purchased the salt and pepper grinding mill balls and found the salt pepper did not go where i wanted it i also found that in order to get a reasonable amount out of the grinder i had to select the maximum coarse setting and over a period of six months the efficiency became so bad i finally threw them away based on a salesmans advise i purchased the dual grinder thinking my problems might be isolated to the shape of the feed tube i am sad to say that i again found it 's performance to be a big disappointment	20
0	i bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend at the end of a hot day the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside it barely fit the width of my window but extender can be purchase afterwards if that`s a problem very easy to install and operate there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high perfect for smaller rooms also the price is definitely right	20
1	i guess misters are hard to make because most of the ones i have bought in my life do n't work out of the box or die shortly after this one did n't even work out of the box there was no mist just air oh well i figured i was taking my chances anyway if you buy this hopefully you have better luck update nowadays most grocery stores sell pre packaged pressurized spray canisters of olive or canola oil it 's like a can of raid except it sprays oil i have found that these work perfectly and last a long time	20
1	i purchased this set of spoons because they are narrow and can fit into any number of spice jars i also wanted them because they are hinged and nest inside of each other take up little space after first use the pin fell out and the spoons became unhinged i tried to reassemble and the pin keeps falling out would n't recommend	20

1	we had a heated pad for years that finally played out it was wonderful wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one i bought this item i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it i was suspect when i opened it poor quality material poor bed fit very very warm on the lowest setting after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires which are quite large in my ribs it had to come off i had rather be cold and i hate being cold	20

1	i did not find these pillows comfortable for airplane travel they are too big and bulky to provide any comfort i guess they would be fine if you were laying on a couch and not sitting mostly upright like on a plane i would have been better off saving my money and using the airplane pillow i would n't recommend these particular pillows	20
1	ordered this at my wife 's request she 's tried cleaning silver earrings run multiple cycles added detergent as suggested it just does n't clean an old toothbrush and toothpaste works much better a very disappointing piece of junk	20
1	once in a while the coffee side of the machine will spew steam out the back and i will get a half of a pot of coffee the big problem with this piece of junk that the coffee maker was under a cabinet and the steam was ruining the kitchen cabinet i say this is 199 down the drain i have never had problems with a coffee maker spitting steam out the back and no water dripping into the pot stay away from this garbage i am not even interested in contacting krups for any warranty repair because it is not worth it	20
1	neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well it takes forever to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount perhaps the blades that crunch the s p are not sharp enough \? very disappointed in product	20
0	i have been in love with the set for years they are versatile sharp and reliable ! each piece has its own speciality and the whole set satisfies all your need for kitchen endeavor i personally like the vegetable chopper and the curved bone chopper best	20
1	the lower bowl part will last forever but the water tank lasts a month outside between the sun and cold air the plastic get weak right away and the slightest touch will crack the top i have gone through 3 of them all with exactly the same results	20
1	i bought this particular lever corkscrew because i read a very favorable review in consumer reports it is all metal which is necessary because the lever action actually puts a lot of stress on the gears the guide and the frame after about 50 bottles the pin in the guide started wearing and the screw no longer entered the cork along the axis of the device making it harder and harder to use i actually fixed this a couple of times but then the frame actually broke at its thinnest point end of story	20
0	i bought a pack of 3 for my purifier this filter does a good job and keeps the watrer tasting good	20
1	this item is not nine inches wide it is the same width as the seven stick cornstick pan but costs ten dollars more so you are paying ten dollars to get two extra cornstick molds of the same size hopefully the item description will be changed soon now i have to pack up and ship back several of these but at least amazon is paying the freight lodge logic is the greatest for cooking and baking though i think this is just a random error just be sure and buy the seven stick pan for 7 99 the cornsticks will be the same size	20
1	i received the set in the mail and immediately noticed that the contents inside were damaged i returned the item to amazon who issued a prompt refund it appears that the persons handling these fragile items are n't very cautious so i would advise against buying this amazon was great with a prompt refund though	20
1	one should n't have to empty water out after every use one should n't be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice that is not a functional teapot if that may be the case though it is the prettiest teapot around it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while le creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime but the enamelware ca n't even touch the quality of the cast iron cookware fortunately the company stands by its products and i am sending mine back for a replacement see www lecreuset com for details	20
1	i have just used this spinner for the first time in a long while now i remember why i avoid it it is nearly impossible to get the top and spinning basket to mesh and at the same time get the top with the handle to fit onto the bottom part the very few times that all has gone together and stayed long enough to get a good grip on the bottom the greens have come out nice and dry otherwise it 's an exercise in frustration ! i hope that mine is defective or something because otherwise i must say pass this one by and find a different design or model and test it in a store before you buy it	20
0	does it look and feel cheap \? yes ! does it do exactly what i expect it to \? \( make coffee automatically at a pre programmed time in the morning \) yes ! i 've used it to make coffee before i wake up every morning for almost a month though the design of the pot itself is pretty bad \( i kinda expect it to break or otherwise fail sooner or later \) it 's done the job so far and i ca n't complain	20
1	a couple of days ago i depressed the switch to begin toasting a piece of sliced bread when all at once a blue flash jumped out at me thus causing the demise of my applicance i now realize i paid far too much for this unsafe piece of junk that lasted about two weeks short of a year	20

0	i was looking for something small to put near our litterpan since the cats track the clay out of the box when exiting i found this vacuum at a fair price and decided to give it a try it does a perfect job ! i owned the original model when it first came out years ago this one is more streamlined and improved the dustbuster is the right choice for little cleanups	20
0	excellent value towels ! wash first so absorbantcy is best right away blue color is gorgeous	20
1	this grater is fine when you can get it to work but most often the handle does n't screw in correctly and you ca n't get it to it 's mostly a waste of time though the concept is a great one i 'd recommend trying maybe a stainless steel one instead of this plastic one	20
1	i loved this while it worked this worked great for the first 2 times we used it after that it would n't work it has a 6 month warranty so i am in the process of getting if fixed	20

1	i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice	20
0	there is no substitute for le creuset's ability to distribute heat evenly withstand heat without staining and to top it off it's soooo easy to clean ! worth every penny	20
1	this pan was a bargain that turned out to be overpriced i have a number of farberware pans that have served me well but this one came out of the box warped the first time i put it on the range top it was rocking like crazy with only one strip through the center that made contact i could return it but for 10 it is not worth the argument with amazon about restocking fees so after one use it is now washed and packed up in the goodwill box i would never use it again	20
0	a little disappointing we have several cuisinart products including a food processor that we 've had for umpteen years and still works like new we also have 4 cuisinart pans or skillets with the same comment the toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheapo toaster that we replaced we 've only used it a few times so maybe it will be better once we get used to it	20
1	hopefully i will never make this kind of mistake	20
1	the first time i used it i could n't even boil water in it on my flat surface stove ! a notice that came with it said this pot may not work on all stoves refer to the owners manual \( no owners manual was sent with it \) as soon as the water started to heat the pot danced and wobbled all over and the water was sloshing out of the top ! nothing in the web site ad referred to the pot not working on a flat surface it would have been nice to have known before ordering as i am not a pro cook and have no special knowledge of these details	20
1	as great as it looks i ca n't get past the incomplete directions \( only printed outside of the box no directions inside \) to get it installed on the wall it says pull out the plastic end cap have n't a clue what the plastic end cap is nor how to pull it out nor how to install the screws that hold it on the box may have to return	20

0	this is my second bug zapper took another brand back that did n't work this zapper is working great and that 's all thanks to its intelligent design some bug zappers have super small entry holes and then wimpy little electrodes inside this zapper is designed to let bugs fly in easily and it has vertical electrodes that zap bugs this zapper works really well in fact the other night it was zapping like crazy because it was hot and the bugs were out we live in an urban area near a plant nursery so we 'd always have bugs coming in the back door now this zapper kills them and attracts them away from our backdoor great product	21
0	i bought this for my husband in december we put it in december 25 \( we have an acre for our back yard \) with about 40 mole holes the ground has been freezing on and off and we put one in the middle of an old hole takes 3 d batteries and believe it or not the thing is still vibrating \( sounds kind of irritating if your close \) but who cares beats the back yard looking like a new cemetery no new holes you could chew more juicy fruit which the kids love to help out with for our small front yard but that only lasts you about 3 weeks i m buying another for the front yard	21
0	i checked multiple sites and manufacturers for this type of product we are totally pleased with what we received the construction and fabric are all that we could have wanted at much more cost	21

1	i purchased this particular clock because it was described as an outdoor clock upon receipt of the clock i read the instruction book and under the section entitled frequently asked questions is the following q can a la cross technology clock be used outdoors \? a yes but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 f andd 131 f this clock is not water resistant living in new england we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 f the clock has a very misleading description	21
1	you have heard the old expression that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is \? this product is proof of that i really wanted to avoid poison and traps so i thought i would try this p o s to solve my gopher problem humanely sure i was skeptical but some buyers reported success after 4 weeks i can report that my gophers are utterly and completely indifferent to this product i noticed some buyers experienced a surge in activity but i have seen nothing nada zip numerous fat happy gophers before numerous fat happy gophers after caveat emptor	21
0	protecting your grill is important if you leave it outside all the time this is by far the best grill cover we have had it is easy to put over the grill the velcro straps keep it from flying off it fits the genesis s 320 perfectly and it is heavyweight recommended definitely	21
0	i have had this smoker for about 8 years as i live on the east coast of florida it has been subjected to a great many adverse conditions sun rain heat salt air and the occasional 150 mph sandblasting the only degradation that it has experienced was that the 2 legs \( without the wheels \) need replacing due to rusting off at the bottom and the grills had to be replaced maintenance is a snap just regular cleaning and an occasional coat of oven black she may not be the youngest lady at the ball but she still makes the best ribs chicken and steak	21

1	item was not new and arrived with dents scratches gouges and jammed doors returne	21
1	these mitts are good quality problem is that the thumbs are way to short and narrow rendering these mitts virtually useless do yourself a favor and go to a store where you can try stuff like this before you buy	21
0	this is a great clock looks good makes no noise and very easy to read setup should be simple but i would suggest adding a button to change from manual to automatic you usually do n't get the clock at midnight and you want to setup it right from the beginning since it 's not going to be able to sync early in the afternoon you want to set the time manually and leave the clock to sync at night but this is where an additional button comes in handy cause moving the hands is done with the same button and its hard to know if the clock was left on automatic or not	21
0	we absolutely love it it is truly amazing we only wish we had this clock a long time ago we have missed out on a lot of fun and convenience we have enjoyed this instrument so much that we ordered six more for each one of our children they have all reported back on how much they love theirs as well	21
0	i 've been looking for an atomic clock with functions and design i finally found it with the 8249 the large display is very nice all info are logically located on the display one quick glance and i know the time indoor outdoor temp humidity day date and month the clock update itself about 2 to 3 times a day i ca n't really ask for more than this especially the price on amazon was really good	21
0	like all weber products i have owned this brush does an excellent job	21
0	this is just what you need for those hard to reach places today 's houses are built with such high walls and windows that you need to have this in your home	21
1	the price for the item is reasonable the quality of the item is excellent the shipping costs are n't displayed on the selling page the shipping costs are more than the cost of the item do not buy with one clic	21
0	we love this product it was easy to set up and it 's great knowing what time it is without having to turn a light on the only thing i do n't like is the alarm it 's very annoying	21
0	this is a good product i'm very happy with the atachments the squgee works real well its hard to find a good one with treads to screw onto a extention pole the pole should extend to 15 feet its only 10 feet long fully extended but nice and short to carry around in and out of viechels i would order this product just for the attachment	21
0	i 've had this for about a year and still have n't used it but it 's the having it that counts ! it looks like it will work well should the occasion ever arise	21
0	i have had mine for 4 years and it has worked out great the main difference between this offset barbecue and more expensive ones is the lack of complete air control there are simply too many open seams to allow in air so it takes a bit of tending to keep the temperature at 215f that said with a bit of patience and practice you can make excellent barbecue on this thing the metal gauge is heavy enough to last you several years \( though eventually the firebox will burn out \)	21
1	i like everything about the thermometer except its most important feature the outside temperature is too strongly influenced by the inside temperature ok so i have it installed at my place in the mountains where the difference at night on the inside outside termperatures can be forty degrees or more many mornings i check this thermometer with two other outside thermometers and find the other two may read for example 15 degrees and this one will read 35 degrees it will be 60 degrees inside my window is double paned but that still does not insulate sufficiently to produce unreliable outside readings when not window mounted and placed by other thermometers the readings are acceptable and consistent	21
0	i bought this unit 4 years ago it has performed flawlessly i'm still amazed at how often the rain prediction turns out to be correct it 's hitting about 90 accuracy on rain within 36 hours better than the weather dude on television	21
0	this is a very nice cover it is heavy duty and vented at the rear of the top others say this cover fits tight and it does but i can get it on and off by myself the trick is since the cover is a little stiff you can hold it with one hand above the grill while you use your other hand to guide it on to the grill then it slides down and fits properly it looks awesome really sets my grill apart from my neighbors' unkept grills ! \)	21
0	i put the sensor out my backdoor in a shady area about 30 feet from the main unit in the kitchen one screw attaches each item it has three channels it 'll memorize the high and low indoor and outdoor temperature the display is large enough to read from several feet away it 's been installed for several months of silent dependable and accurate temperature monitoring	21
1	i purchased this cushion thinking it would be comfortable and durable when you lay in the cushion it is rough and abrasive if any water gets on it it stains immediately and the stain does not disappear when it drys i am very dissatisfied with the cushion and would not purchase one agai	21
0	i purchased this table to replace my second broken glass top table that broke during a storm as a result of the wind i will never buy a glass top patio table again this table is especially lovely to look at and fit in perfectly with my chairs and umbrella looks like it all came together had to learn my lesson about glass i wish it was a couple inches bigger but it 's really just fine	21
0	the brush does a good job of loosening grit and grime from your grill but you are still going to have to break down and wash the grill with soap and water now and then the brush has a strong wooden handle leather loop a sturdy set of bristles and a grill scraper for tough jobs be sure to buy this longer brush as the 12 inch one does not have the reach especially for larger grills	21
0	purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews i have found the basket to work great you put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces very easy with rock cornish game hens though i needed to tie them a little bit but that is because the little legs are well little never had one before just the skewer kind cleans fairly easy too love it	21
0	this comfort meter works very good the shipment came in time for a gift for christmas one for us one for gift	21
1	i normally bbq 8 9 racks of ribs at once for our annual party thought that this weber rib rack would make it easier however i found that it was more of a hinderance than a help i like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce several times so i have to remove them from the rack for basting getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain if you 're going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook then it might be useful but that 's not me so i gave my weber rib rack to my brother in law	21
1	there oughta be a law i can utterly guarantee that this thing wo n't work i was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years we used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time \( it 's usually nice toasty warm in there \) sanitation exclusion and very careful application of pesticides is what you need rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time but quickly adapt \( adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best \) again count on sanitation exclusion and traps try to avoid baits because you 'd rather know where the little s o b died \( i e in a trap rather than in a wall somewhere \)	21
0	got this on ebay for 150 00 it was barely used give me a high five	21
0	the bench is easy to assemble and lid actuallydoes work well it is not an item that will lastforever but it is priced fairly for what it is a storagebench	21
0	extremely pleased ! we received the entire strathwood bainbridge collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product \( s \) ! ! the patio furniture is both beautiful and solid hope it will last for many years	21
1	the grill is up to webers usual high standards but i do have a couple of quibbles with it i bought the q grill because i needed a high quality but smaller and lighter unit for use in my rv since every pound counts the solid cast iron grill will probably not travel but an even bigger problem was the lack of a non stick surface i do n't have the time nor inclination to season a cast iron grill what i would have liked is a high quality aluminum grill with a non stick surface	21
0	i owned the ws 8248u for a couple years and really like it that i decided to buy two ws 8236u for my two other bedrooms setup is easy i do n't have to manually correct the time for daylight saving time anymore the time is correct down the second really love it	21
0	purchased for the weber genesis silver a it is a genuine weber replacement part fits and operates perfectly easy installation and cheaper than buying from weber directly	21
0	i am using this clock indoors very nice looks and large enough to use on a big wall without looking cheap the main concern i had before getting this was the battery life i have heard bad stories about some atomic clocks using up a battery \( s \) in as little as 30 45 days but since receiving this 3 months ago it 's still going strong on the first charge of the rechargeable battery i put in i really like the fact that i can easily tell what time it is from across the room and down the hall without my glasses even being pretty badly near sighted	21
0	i gave it as a gift to my son and he likes it	21
0	while we 've used coleman folding stoves for years if you have trunk space there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill the small tank makes this practical for camping if you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available this is a great choice for camping equipment we still like the coleman for boiling water but i love barbecuing on a propane grill like this	21
0	this was the best price on the internet for this item it fit perfectly and solved the problem	21
0	i am quite pleased with my lunchbox it is the perfect size yet is not obtrusive in design shape or capacity i would recommend to others	21
0	this garden bench is very well made and extremely attractive the color is elegant i have it in a small sun room and it is perfect the cushion fabric is sturdy enough to withstand my dogs but the cushion itself could be heftier the bench is lightweight giving the impression it is not solid and sturdy but has supported whatever i have subjected it to and i have 10 dogs that love a couch ! i would give it 5 stars if the cushion were made of a better foam	21
0	my glass came broken so waiting on replacement thanks amazon for fixing my proble	21
1	i was looking forward to purchasing this item until i got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost the cheapest shipping would run me 14 99 for an item costing 21 89 sorry weatherbuffs you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price	21
0	the la crosse weather station has excellent looks and works well however the outside temperate regulary drops out especially in cold weather overall i'm happy with the form and satisfied with the function	21
0	i wanted this since i did n't trust the humidity reading on my humidifier has large and convienent display due to its size and battery power i can easily move it around the house to check temp humidity in different rooms	21
0	this product is great for the following reasons 1 stability \( your chicken wo n't fall over during the cooking process as with just a standard can \) 2 quality is wonderful \( not flimsy and cheap \) 3 dishwasher safe \( easy to clean \) 4 not too big \( so that it takes up the whole grill \) 5 priced well compared to other similiar products6 no worries where the can has been and what inks might come of	21
1	i purchased this product in may 2006 however it is not working this year april 2007 i replaced the 40 watt bulb but it still does not work this is not a product worth the expense i would say that for less that 11 months of use 8 00 would be a high enough price to pay	21
1	i have two units and two sensors i thought they would all be compatible i just received this sensor yesterday and find it works alone but is n't compatible with my units i wish i had checked this out more carefully before i purchased it	21
1	after twice sending the unit back to the factory the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on i tried all the suggestions made by the factory the following year i opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong i found totally frozen fan bearings i suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings to end my agonies with the unit i took it to the garbage dump the unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable when it worked it worked well i believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito	21
1	i bought this in january and it worked beautifully until daylight savings time came around now it is an hour off \( one hour less than it should be \) and wo n't reset to daylight savings time there is a button that resets it if you do n't have daylight savings time but it dosent do anything either removed and reinserted the battery following instructions endlessly but it is stuck an hour short until the fall no reply from the manufacturer beautiful clock but useless half the year	21
0	short of having an extra limb the hinged grate allows for roasting grilling with much less heat loss the extra control of the heat source allows for a better cooked product this steak is b tching was a quote from the gameday crowd at jack kent cook stadium at fedex field in maryland i will continue to pimp my grill with more accessories for next season	21
0	i 've had this unit for almost 3 years it works great i installed it per manufacturers recommendations i was careful with it to not damage it the software is great for communication via internet i have found the measurements to be very accurate i would buy this again i'm sure the competition has nice units too but i really like how this one works the rain guage works great what i 'd really like is a snow guage	21

0	i thought when i ordered these chaise lounges \( 2 \) they would only be temporary until i could afford good ones because they were so inexpensive well these are good and i do n't need to replace them the design actually matches my table set and i did n't even realize it until we unpacked them fully assemled ! i only have one complaint and it 's really not that bad the thickness of the cushion seems fine for me but my skinny butt husband tells me the cushions are n't cushiony enough other than that the chaises are absolutely wonderful and good quality	21
0	i found the 16 lacrosse atomic clock to be exactly as described the metal case is sturdy and good looking the directions very straight forward 16 is big be sure you want this diameter they make smaller units i am quite satisfied with my purchase	21
0	this clock is great it 's really modern looking and i love the black face i have this in my kitchen and it looks great there is a second hand which is invaluable in any kitchen the fact that it 's an atomic clock is super because it means that i never have to reset it for daylight savings time because it resets itself automatically shortly after you plug in the battery the clock starts setting itself to the atomic clock and that 's kind of fun keeps precise time	21

0	it 's designed in germany and mfgd in china i 'd say definitely locate and purchase the extension kit i did i have a large guatemalan hammock that i 've owned for years that 's barely seen any use usually on camping trips it finally occured to me to research and secure a hammock stand and it 's really delightful to be able to laze in the hammock in the shade of the house on summer afternoons i wish i 'd bought one of these years ago	21
0	i had purchased a brinkman electric smoker and needed some rib racks i looked around and found the cheapest price for these racks was from amazon \( which included free shipping since i purchased 2 racks \) i bought 6 racks of ribs cutting each rack in half they all arranged perfectly on the racks and we had some great ribs clean up was easy too all the grease came off and they are ready to use again good construction on the racks i definetly got my money 's worth on this product	21
0	this is truely a must have the flat non stick skewers holds everything in place they wo n't flop around so the unbalanced pieces of food are always on the bottom near the heat a friend told me about these at gander mountain selling for 7 39 a set but i checked here 1st and found them for 5 99 a set i ordered 5 sets ! ! the skewers are 14 long for plenty of food get yours today do n't wait get at least 2 sets	21
1	the turning weel is too small so the hose often falls off the stake is round and too short it wo n't stay in ground pretty much useless	21
0	excellent quality functional and flexible extra long handle lets me reach across the heat without getting burned the rubber grip was a nice touch and the replaceable brush heads are unique this comes with 3 brush heads and after those are used up you can get them for under 2 00 each this is a very solid well built tool that is built to last i highly recommend this	21
1	these outdoor window thermometers seemed like a good idea however they 're worthless ! the lcd display is not bright like shown in the picture the numbers are so light they are totally unreadable also the suction cups will not stay stuck to a cold window i'm returning them	21
1	this grill cover is pretty much as generic as you can imagine not only is the vinyl material that it is made of thin and easily tear able the drawstring at it 's base is very easily prone to breaking i have bought and had to return this product twice already save yourself the trouble and look up market for something that you can depend on for a little longer than a single use	21
0	so it 's not a big deal to reset your clocks when the time changes and when the power goes out right \? well yes it is as i get older and technology becomes more demanding and time consuming the fact that i can have one device that takes care of itself has become fairly important to me it 's just a clock but it works which is more than i can say for my fax or copier or phone or i always get lacross because i like the looks of their stuff be good to yourself upgrade to atomic	21
0	i 've used this along with the base station for one year now i 've monitored temp and humidity inside outside and in my rv parked in my driveway works great easy to use easy to change the batteries despite the instructions you can use rechargable batteries they read low on the display but work just fine	21

0	purchased this cover to protect my new weber q300 grill fits like a glove ! strong durable construction and superior protection	21
1	i was very disapointed with the smoker cover it is made of a very thin plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material this type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat weather and also some general scratching just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it the company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable sincerely yours allen vest iii	21
0	love to look up at the clock in the night without having to roll around to see a clock works great ! !	21

1	you should remove this merchant they have numerous complaints on multiple websites i ignored it and trusted amazon 's brand however my experience was horrible they over charged me and when i called to rectify the issue they were n't interested in trying to solve the problem but simply place blame on me then the service rep hung up on me i 'll never do business with them again	21
1	while the mitt is beautiful and the price is right it is narrow most mitts flare towards the opening this one does not i have larger forearms and it wo n't fit all the way up my husband has average sized arms and it wo n't go around his upper forearm either since they are so long they go almost to your elbow	21

1	i bought this thing to solve a problem and i have a new one i red the little manual trying to figure out how to have a projection and no way it does not stay in projection mode if you want to see the light projection you have to press the button i change the battery i left the clock for 26 minute before to change the paramenters and no way i wil buy one more expensive but one that work the projection of course i do not recogmend it	21

1	i have had this smoker since august and have a total of 20 hours smoking on it i noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after 4 hours of use and by hour 20 it was gone rendering the smoker useless the other problem i have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed dealing with charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless at the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered i would pass for something better	21
1	do not buy this planning to leave it outside on your grill ! there were warnings with this product saying that it should n't be left outside but i figured it could n't be that bad a couple months later i discovered that my cutting board \( left on a covered porch through a mild california winter \) had completely split into several pieces for a 30 outdoor product this is really unacceptable a plastic or metal cutting board would have worked much better	21
0	have purchased 2 of these for my office and am buying 2 more for home these are easy to set up easy to read and the self adjusting daylight savings time with the atomic function \( self setting \) is wonderful earlier reviewer mentioned how to reset when battery needs replacement which i found very helpful so keep the set up instructions handy to refer to if and when you need to replace the batteries ! also purchased 2 of the larger 14 inch version and they 're just as nice	21
1	i bought this clock expecting it to show the humidity in a room show the temperature and to set itself for daylight savings it does neither of the above the temperature stays at 60 and the humidity measure it always way off in the same room i have an alarm clock that does all of the above accurately the clock is attractive and easy to read and it keeps time ok but it should do more i am very disappointed	21

1	the third time i used this brush it broke the wood split diagonally at the neck of the brush a little before where the bristles start i now have the perfect implement with which to stake a vampire my other weber brush \( which i purchased at a diff website \) is still intact and works okay you see the bristles are a little gunked up that 's why i bought this second grill brush buyers and vampires beware	21
0	i 've had one of these smokers for 4 to 5 years i 'd buy another one if my current wears out well well worth the price this cooks the best chicken turkey and above all salmon that i 've ever tasted try marinating salmon filets overnight in teriyaki and smoking for 45 to 60 minutes with alder chips for the most moist flavorful salmon you 've ever tasted	21

1	the photo on amazon is n't representative of the product i received the frame is white or an extremely light silver i also bought a lacrosse technology wt 3122a 12 inch wood atomic analog clock which did n't match it 's photo either but at least i like it	21
0	i love it ! it 's a bit of work to maintain but it 's an awesome grill that cooks everything \( once i figured out how to cook and got a good grill cook book \) i bought two propane cylinders and just swap them out when the gauge that they hang on says it 's a at a quarter tank it 's worth the price	21

0	we are delighted with our new chairs and table the products were well packed and came in excellent condition the chairs are sturdy ample and comfortable even without the cushions the cushions that come with are very nice but too thick for my liking the chairs have an additional feature of leveling pads on the bottom of each leg that can be screwed in or out to accommodate uneven surfaces the table is big enough for a full dinner for four but small enough to still feel intimate we now spend a lot more time on our patio	21
0	lifetime has produced an extremely well made table it is very sturdy the top seem impervious to abuse the legs are much more robust than any other i have seen and they lock when folded a really nice feature highly recommended	21

1	it arrived fast enough but i should have sent the chair back it 's pretty cheaply made the ends are taped with what looks like regular scotch tape it 's ok but i 'll keep my eyes open for a better one and we wo n't swing on it i do n't think it would take it	21
0	i purchased this to monitor my attic and crawl space temperature prior to installation of additional attic ventilation vents and insulation 3 channel readings are accurate to within 0 5 deg f sometimes we lose the signal but it reacquires it relatively easily min max temperature memory is a nice feature	21
0	this table is about twice the table you would expect at the price its size is ideal with a 2 passenger teak bench kompur wood is so like teak we 're staining our teak furniture to match the kompur wood it looks marvelous with the 30 round folding table fit and finish are a plus ca n't rate durability yet or it would have 5 stars	21

1	the tongs where hard to grip so what i did to avoid sending them back i took a pair of very small plyers and bent just the pointed ends inward like a claw now they are excellent grip great love the long handle and heavy duty soft rubber hope this helps those of you like me who hate sending stuff back	21
0	i purchased two of the 9 foot oxford garden market umbrellas in desperation we were having a backyard party at our home and my local stores were all out when they arrived a short time later i was very pleased to see how well made they were i especially like the pull cord to open and help close the umbrellas not only are these umbrellas attractive they are easy to use study and detail oriented i 'll probably get one more before the end of summer	21
0	this is a good rack it cleaned pretty easily and a nice compact size but the ribs are just a bit too close together \( i cook mainly full spare ribs \) i have rib racks from steven raichlen that are perfect the more spacious racks allow for better basting heat distribution and more even cooking when the meat touches like in the weber rack the meat does n't cook as well	21
0	this grill is the greatest for simplicity and ease of use it is compact and portable so there is no unsightly grill always hanging around your house or patio i use it in summer and winter and even set it up in the snow if you do charcoal grilling exclusively as i do this grill has the flexibility to adjust the combustion air and exhaust to suite what you are cooking for high temperatures such as for steaks i leave the top cover off takes perhaps 5 to 6 grillings before one learns all the right charcoal loadings and vent adjustments necessary cools off totally in 15 minutes if you close all vents	21
1	essentially a one season lightweight hibachi that does n't stand up to extended use so at 12 it 's too expensive but may be worth about 5	21
0	hard solder beautiful looking unbelievably priced no assembly required pieces of furniture that seem to be sturdy enough for home use but not for someone weigthing 300lbs crashing on them i do n't weight 300lbs and i love them i got also two chaises \( read review \) the deep seating sofa 2 ottomans and a couple of side tables	21
0	i have used the fryer for chicken wings which is what i bought it for because i have plenty of parties throughout the year along with the professional look of the product it performs great ! if i could give it 10 stars i would it is the best fryer i have ever used and that says alot i would recommend this fryer to anyone looking to enhance their outdoor cooking and bring it to that next level	21
1	notice that the people giving it 5 stars are the people who reviewed this product and this product alone sounds like employees trying to build up ratings	21
0	bought this for my wife she loves it perfect for a first time bounty hunters it works very well for anyone that does n't need all the professional features	21
0	very well made product i am extremely pleased heck of a lot better than that cheap cover i got from ebay last year that was very deceptively advertised regarding it 's durability	21
0	this thermometer has been very useful it registers the temperature quickly and the numbers are easy to read even with bi focals the cover becomes a handle so your fingers do n't get to close to the flame when grilling i would recommend it	21
0	this thermometer and hydrometer is not only attractive but works beautifully i was given one as a gift and later bought one to give as a gift	21
1	do n't waste your money \( even just 10 bucks \) the plastic is not rip stop and tears very easily i will now just use a big heavy duty black trash can liner they are much stronger	21
0	we got this for my dad for father 's day i was not there for assembly but heard that it went well it is so much nicer looking in person than in the ad pix a very nice little unit dad did say that he might want to drill some holes in the bottom to get a better draft going but all in all we are thrilled with this product	21
0	just received this and think it will turn out to be a great table bought the bench and matching chairs they are a great set	21
1	i received a painful injury and almost lost my finger to this recliner i grabbed the arm rest and tried to slide back into the recliner the mechanism under the arm rest snapped closed on my finger i could not get out of this trap had my wife not been there to help i would have lost my finger no way should this chair be sold to an unsuspecting public !	21
0	i was very pleased that this seller emailed me right away when i sent him an email about my concerns that the product might not be exactly what i needed and wanted to cancel the order he very quickly emailed me and assured me he would cancel and refund my credit card and i was impressed with this service gayla tregr	21
1	i purchased 8 of the aa batteries because of the low price of 4 99 for 4 the fine print on the battery indicates 1900 milliamps plus or minus 10 percent so the range would be 1710 to 2090 milliamps after many days of refreshing the battery in my la crosse bc 900 charger i ended up with the following 1634 milli amps1795170120011769178117541549so two of the cells are below spec earlier i had purchase some 2700 milliamp batteries from sanyo on amazon for about 12 99 per four all of them were within spec i'm glad i did n't pay a penny more than 4 99 for four	21
0	my family and i love beer can chicken but i did n't like the idea of literally putting my food onto a beer can this weber poultry roaster is so much cleaner and far easier than using a beer can the chicken remains stable too no more trying to balance the chicken on a beer can and it 's a great way to switch from using beer to using wine what a fabulous product	21
0	it is a very attractive wall clock that keeps accurate time it is easy toview from a distant it also made the time adjustment for day light savingtime	21
0	the hammock is a great choice if you like sharing it with you significant other or by yourself it 's very sturdy and comfortable even with two adults the quality of hammock is good and worth the price especially compared to other models we looked at	21
0	this is a very nice mitt although not as good as another one i have which is a bit heavier still a good buy though	21
0	this thing works great i prefer to keep bottled beer on hand so i never had a chance to make beer can chicken the chicken i cooked came out perfect crispy skin and juicy inside excellent ! i'm going to dry lemon juice and wine next time the bottom tray holds all the grease so your grill stays clean highly recommended	21

0	this is a great cleaning system for anyone with high walls or vaulted ceilings plus all the attachments make cleaning very versatile i looked at a similar system listed in the frontgate catalog and almost purchased it for more than 120 00 then i found this for less than 40 00 it 's great and i recommend it to anyone who likes to stay cobweb dust free	21
0	i bought one for my girlfriend over a few years ago it sets itself and projects the time on the ceiling in a soft red this is an amazing feature no more getting up or turning your head to check the time it makes the sleep experience much more comfortable	21
0	i was able to reach the top of the windows in my two story foyer with this wonderful product i need to point out i am 5'4 i did need the assistance from my boyfriend \( who is 6'1 \) to reach the ceiling to remove the cobwebs but he did it and they are gone ! i just received my simple clean today and i have already tried three attachments the ceiling fan attachment worked well i used the duster to dust my window panes in my foyer as well as my fragile lighting loved it ! we also used the spider web remover and it was great ! i recommend this product to everyone !	21
1	absolutely useless the three gizmos are in three small adjoining areas kitchen breakfast office areas the roaches come out at night and do a little dance to the clicks that the gizmos emit no effect whatsoever after 3 months	21
0	we had bought one of these for this house loved it so much we bought one for the other house too the original one was bought w the 22 wok which is gorgeous we use both w woks and it 's kewl easy to break down for travel too only thing was i shoulda bought the cover for the 22 wok while they were available ca n't seem to get one now	21
0	it works as it should but it does n't have a celsius option otherwise i'm satisfied with it	21
0	i bought this for my husband for christmas to replace an old \( scary looking \) smoker it was a real pain having to ask his folks to send mesquite wood from texas to massachusetts then cut it up soak it etc we tried the bradley smoker this weekend while we had the unusually warm weather it comes with pellets of wood which get fed in automatically much easier the prime rib was done in no time at all we finished it off in the oven for a crispier outside we also smoked fresh kielbasa both were amazing ca n't wait to try the cold smoke feature	21
0	i just got this turner and it feels really nice in my hand the grip feels very comfortable and the turner has a very nice solid and balanced feel i got this turner so it would work better with the cast iron griddle i got i tried out tonite cooking burgers and it felt easier to flip the patties than a normal cheap spatula i felt like a short order cook !	21
0	the hammock is fine particularly for the great price unfortunately my pine trees dripped sap onto the hammock which is a pain to get off not the hammock 's fault i guess it just was n't such a good idea	21
1	a year ago we bought a performance series and was very happy with it until a week ago when upon lighting it the fire spread out of the pit area and melted the controls char broil was unconcerned and indicated that did not sell replacement parts no comments whatsoever on the safety it seems that replaceing the grill on a yearly basis is expected at charbroil in the past we have used weber and got ten years from the grill i would look at the weber	21
0	elegant and simple design with that awesome rubber handle that put oxo good grips on the grip map i bought this to complete my good grips bbq set the only thing it lacks that some bbq'rs may miss is a bottle opener on the end of the handle but that does n't bother me seeing as i do n't drink beer and it also gives the tool a cleaner design if the dog does n't get ahold of it it will last a lifetime	21
0	cushions look great on chaise loungers bright dark green in color cushion get very hot in the sun items arrive well boxed and well before promised date	21
1	sorry to say this is not good for pets like it says my poor two cats as soon as i plugged them in they went running to a room that did not have them and would not come out please do not get if you have cats	21
0	buy this little fun toy clock it 's a blast in the bedroom just look up and you know the time i love it ! cute little thing the front panel is worthless \( to see \) but who needs it	21
0	choosing our first grill really was a simple decision we knew we wanted something quality and that would last us for a while weber was the only way to go in our minds now that we own this grill i can honestly say that hardly a day goes by that we do n't use it ! i'm really glad that we opted for the one touch rather than the smokey joe by the same manufacturer this grill has a hook inside the cover to hang on the side and ash clean up is very easy and for the two of us this grill is enough to keep us or even guests well entertained highly recommended	21
0	i have been very pleased with my hammock chair this past summer the pillow was a real bonus my kids and i can hang out in the yard for hours	21
0	i did n't know much about grills so i asked around everyone told me to get a weber grill and after reading reviews i could see why i just got my grill this weekend and we have used it 3 times already we love it ! very sturdy solid and super easy to use all you need to do is turn the gas on turn a knob and press the ignitor ! everything we have cooked has come out perfectly very even cooking this grill may not have all the bells and whistles but you can bet it will last for years to come	21
0	living in florida we grill almost daily i seem to burn out a set of enamel grates every 15 months or so hopefully the stainless grates will last much longer without a doubt the best price for the grates in store or online was at amazon ! !	21
0	picked up the time signal within five minutes set your time zone and you 're in business no more guessing if you have the correct time no more resetting twice a year for dst large display characters are easy to read neutral design fits with most any decor i would have preferred the moon phase colors to be reversed a full black circle is actually a full moon	21
1	i bought a new grill and wanted to make sure it was used properly i do n't like it when small pieces of food fall through especially on gas grills so i bought this well on first use it stained so bad despite my priming it and worse it warped hey i can still use it but it 's kinda like wearing soiled clothes wo n't feel as good	21
0	great looking and quite large easy to see from a distance though the other two dials are correspondingly small updates quickly and automatically and is unfailingly accurate i wish that i had a dozen of them the price is very reasonable also i certainly will buy more of these clocks eventually	21
0	well look no further my apartment complex does n't allow any type of charcol or gas grills but electric is allowed i was going crazy trying to find one that would fit my george forman kettle grill i did n't want to lug it in and out all summer so i took a gamble and ordered this grill cover and it fits perfectly ! i can now leave my george forman kettle grill on my deck and not have to worry about the elements	21
0	i bought 2 sets of these chairs and the matching table i was pleasantly surprised when they arrived they are quite substantial without being heavy and their appearance is quite nice the chairs came with no assembly and the table was very easy to put together with the provided allen wrench the feet on the chairs are adjustable so that you can get rid of the iritation of off balanced legs overall this was an incredible value at approximately 650 for the set i was so impressed by the quality and price that i have since ordered the matching bench	21
0	used it for a tri tip last night and it came out wonderfully cranked on high to initially heat it up then we left it on low and it kept the 400 degrees no problem \( it actually got too hot according to my instant read thermometer ! \) some of the complaints here say that the burner is too loose that 's because they used the wrong washer to mount it ! there 's one washer that 's larger than the others use the wrong one and it 'll be loose	21
0	clock was a great value and looks good on the wall just keeps ticking always on time thumps up to river city clock	21
0	i thought these grates were n't good enough to sears meat boy was i wrong the beautiful lines on the meats got me great reviews from my guests easy to clean too	21
0	this solved my problem of ants in the feeder had it hanging on our deck all summer long and they never got to it ! this feeder is also very easy to clean and because it is made of glass does not pick of that aging hazy appearance i highly recommend it to anyone	21
1	i found the mitt to be too stiff to be of any real use you ca n't really pick up or handle any utensils with the mit on you can move hot plates etc but you ca n't really carry anything with the mitt on not worth the money albeit not very expensive	21
1	i bought one of these summer 2005 this unit runs way too hot to use as a smoker \( easily 250 300 degrees f \) i even got a replacement regulator from the mfctr but both ran too hot i 've had some success controlling temperature with valve on lp tank and a c clamp on the gas hose but only limited luck i 've tried using an electric hot plate burner but that only worked in warm weather and barely got above 200 degrees hate to say it but would recommend you invest your money elsewhere	21
1	did not expect much for 10 bucks but give me a break 2 weeks and the plastic streched and tore around the handle up on top of the smoker i think a heavy duty trash bag is what this product is equivalent to	21
0	this thing catches mosquitos ! it 's easy to set up and you dont have to buy propane it was a lot less expensive than the mosquito magnet and it does what they say it does	21
0	they are very attractive and we had no trouble putting them together our only complaint the stain ran during a rain storm and stained our patio	21
0	i bought this grill set for my fiance he absolutely loved them they are heavy and extremely sturdy i would definitely recommend them !	21
1	way to small of a cushion had to purchase another one from a local store	21
0	my family and i are quite happy with this hammock it is comfortable and sturdy since it does n't come with the hanging hardware future buyers make sure to order it from amazon at the same time \( hammock kit screws by american science surplus \) otherwise you might find yourself on a long search the only other place where we came across it was wal mart	21
0	the bench is comfortable and has enough weight so the wind does not blow it over the cushion is real nice and it dries quickly plus it fastens to the bench with only two small velcro straps two people can sit on the bench in comfort	21
0	this is a great clock when i bought it about a week ago i put the battery in the clock and placed it on the wall in my family room where my old clock used to be that was it at first the clock appeared to be broken but within 5 minutes it adjusted itself and has been running perfectly ever since this clock can be seen clearly in my family room from 25ft away as i get older i like things to be bigger and this clock gets the job done while still looking attractive my wife likes the clock because she does not confuse the short hand with the long hand from a distance	21
1	the bbq mitt had lots of mold on it and had an awful smell the box paper and all smelled bad amazon was quick to accept a return with no return shipping charges amazon is great as usual but they need to drop this product	21
0	i really am pleased with my solar lights they are the right color everything they seem to stay light longer	21
0	i love this clock i won it as an incentive through my creative memories sales i love that it is always set to the accurate time my 4 and 6 year old love to tell me what time it is and at what phase of the moon it is presently \( they always double check outside \) it 's been a great addition to our home	21
1	i got these chairs in july 2006 and was very pleased how they look after eight months front right legs on both chairs cracked and broke we are not overweight people \( 140 190lb \) very sad that we have to replace them because we were happy with appearance	21
1	shame on me ! i should have read the reviews before i purchased this piece of garbage i had the same experience as others cumbersome to fill trouble attaching to the window then the whole thing crashes to the deck an atractive price until you find you 're charged more than half the price of the item to have it shipped not to mention the poor quality design could n't give me another one of these	21
0	to keep it from cracking i am using mineral oil on mine and keeping it out of the weather	21
1	this hummingbird feeder looked like a good idea until i filled it \( following the direction \) and put it up on the window and it fell off 15 seconds later and the glass busted	21
0	this is by far the best grill accessory i have every gotten it cooks chickens to perfection and keeps them juicy moist and tender i have n't tried cooking anything else but i'm sure whatever it was it would come out great i would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a weber charcoal grill	21
0	for the price you get the same as other units selling for double or triple the price the most important feature for me was exterior temp and humidity plus the unobtrusive design of the unit all functions are easy to read on the display could not be happier with this purchase !	21
0	i'm not sure quite what to say about the burners as expected they work extremely well and they were rather easy to install the only problem i had was with a bolt that had rusted and required a little time to get off beyond that i had my grill lit within 15 minutes of taking the burners out of the box	21
1	do n't fall for the false advertising lentek got sued by the ftc for making false claims http www ftc gov opa 2002 08 lentek ht	21
0	someone mentioned that this is just a glorified trash bag it is not it is pretty durable and with careful use will last a long time	21
0	i have 2 indoor stations in different rooms in my house operating from just 1 outdoor sensor about 60 feet from my house and they work very well and the tempt they show is always the same as my mercury thermometer which is always right on robert johnson lewistown p	21
1	do n't waste your money i bought two of these a few weeks later several moles tunneled within 10 feet of the one in the same places as last year i put one in my gardern a few weeks later a mole tunneled right alongside the molechaser as if to see what it was to his delight ! total waste of money like everthing else i 've tried except nash loop traps	21
0	i love this clock ! it 's big enough to see from all around the back yard and looks great keep in mind that they recommend keeping it sheltered from extreme weather we have ours under an upper deck so it 's sheltered from the rain that 's about as extreme as the weather gets here in los angeles	21
0	this cover is extremely heavy duty and has survived many windy thunderstorms and still good as new after a year and a half it is still going strong still good as new	21
0	just got my thermometer love it i just put the batteries in and it started working ! my kind of item there are other things that can be captured but all i want is to know when it is 12 degrees out love being able to bring it around the house	21
1	i'm very unhappy with these lights i placed them along the planter in my patio a couple feet away from the fence in full sun but they did n't work at all we set them out in the middle of the patio and now five of them do work for a little while but they do n't accomplish their purpose in that area they 're also in the way one of them has never worked at all i gave them the old college try for a month or so but now it 's too late to return them so i'm stuck with them and out my money	21
0	keeping this smoker up to temperature had been a chore until i invested in a heavy duty 25 foot extension cord i bought a 12 gage 15 amp 25 foot chord and i'm now actually using the thermostat to back off the temperature i got this cord at lowes and it cost around 18 dollars the manual says to use a 50 foot or less cord with your smoker but it makes sense to use as short of a cord as you can also thanks for the tip from a previous reviewer about drilling a hole at the bottom of the smoker to allow the excess water to drain out got to go my ribs are almost done	21
0	this shelter met all my expectations i would tell anyone to get the optional sand bags if you do not plan to use spikes to secure it being so large it catches quite a bit of wind and would surely tip over otherwise i had mine setup on a raised deck so the sandbags were a life saver ! overall this is a high quality item and has already been used a few times and is a much more economical option to renting party tents ! the storage bag is outstanding too with nice wheels and a handle it is easy to transport ! the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it is a little challenging to setup because it is so large	21
1	this item was a disapointment looks great in the picture but is cheaply made peices of the wicker were coming loose the item is also very short i am 5ft 10 and my feet stick off the end by a couple of inches i guess you get what you pay for if you spend 800 1000 you will get much better construction and at the end of the day will last longer than this	21
0	an excellent product fits my grill perfectly easy to put on and take off looks like a winner ! one small sewing flaw but otherwise well mad	21
0	we have had this for along time now it works great it has n't rusted or needed parts or repairs if you are thinking about getting one but are concerned about the price just buy this one the better product	21
0	its excellent but with black paintings it doesnt reflect too much i recommend i	21
0	just from looking at the picture i can tell that this chair is made from redwood and is constructed with quot mortice and tennon quot joints a very solid method of construction my only hesitation is that there are no measurements given plus if the chair and chair back slats are n't thick enough they will be prone to spliting	21
0	we bought two of these we were very impressed how easy the set up was since installing the weather station we have enjoyed the accuracy of the weather station both inside and outside temperatures one feature of this weather station is a ice alert up here in north we do get freezing rain ice and snow this station has been right on thebutton with those predictions i would highly recommend the purchase	21
0	the firepit was exactly as described and of good quality arrived faster than promised a quality item to get and enjoy an evening with the family roasting marshmellows	21
0	two days after buying this swing i found just the exact thing i was looking for and contacted don the seller about a refund even though it was a sunday he got right back to me and said he 'd make every effort to cancel the order even though it ships direct from his supplier he kept me informed every step of the way while he did what he could to cancel by tuesday i got word that the order had been cancelled and that a full refund had been given it was such a stress free exchange i would recommend this buyer for sure	21
0	it works in new jersey just wait a night before you say something else	21
0	very easy to remove old igniter and install this one on my weber spirit 500 grill took about 5 minutes and started up on the first push of the button no more trying to light a match and stick it through the hole on a windy cold day	21
1	i received this watch as a gift after reviewing several others the display is very good the altimiter is usually way off and varies greatly even remaining in the same position it is a little difficult to make use of all the watch 's features i am very concerned the watch is stamped on the back water resistant but new reports are showing it is not in fact if it is not we have been misled by the manufacturer overall i can not recommend this watc	21
0	this is a fantastic grill i highly recommend it if you are looking for a high quality basic grill assembly was rather easy and we were grilling the same evening	21
0	my 15 year old son put the grill together while i was as work the grill has a very even heat distribution and very good heating controls i have cooked steak at high temperatures and chicken at low temperatures all items have come out great so far the stainless steel cooking surfaces and internal parts appear like they will last along time my last weber grill lasted for about 12 years i expect that this one will do as well or better my only disappointment was that this grill did not come configured for quick connects like the last grill did it uses the standard screw type connection for the gas bottle	21
0	this is a very good working metal detector i 'd recamend it to anyone who is looking in to buy it	21
0	i bought two of these weber roasters because they make the process of roasting chicken so easy no can and a nonstick surface make removing the cooked chicken so much easier and clean up is a cinch also because these roasters retain the juices in the pan the inside of my bbq is much cleaner and i do n't have to clean it after every chicken i cook	21
0	love the large illuminated time temp on the ceiling setting up the external temperature sensor was a bit tricky you 'll need to make sure you have a glasses size screwdriver which i did n't have readily available otherwise everything worked as promised i am still not positive if the atomic sensor is working the instructions said you have to be something like 750 miles \( or was it 1000 \) away from the location in denver etc i am in detroit so the signal never seemed to sync up but it may have i am not sure all in all a great purchase	21
1	the projection was too small and not bright enough the clock was a pain in the neck to set i have many of these type clocks and this one was a dissapointment i returned it	21
0	this clock is great i'm always looking over at the clock through the night now i just look up i recommended this to a friend and she said they love it this will be christmas presents for everyone next year	21
0	i just had my platinum grill stolen and i'm not only devestated but having a hard time finding one available just found one at ace this is the perfect grill for anything let 's rally weber to make this more available !	21
0	i have a high ceiling so the display of the time was fuzzy and i missed the see through case with the red night light on the earlier model but overall i was satisfied with the clock	21
1	the photo on amazon is n't representative of the product i received the frame is white or an extremely light silver i also bought a lacrosse technology wt 3122a 12 inch wood atomic analog clock which did n't match it 's photo either but at least i like it	21
0	i am a happy shopper great value and fun way to quickly spruce up the yard bought this for my mother in law and after visiting her house i had to have a few for myself they hang from tree branches water spouts and lamp posts i have even been able to hook the chains together to make them longer i thought they would have a hole in the bottom for the water to drain from but i guess they are suppose to fill and slightly tip so the water overflows over the edge that works as well so far they have not changed color or rusted	21
0	we replaced an old larger and broken sunbeam bug snapper with this unit this is lighter and easier to handle we 're in southern arizona so our bug season is just starting the unit works great but upon encountering a really big moth it sizzles for as long as ten seconds kind of gruesome if you 're dealing with night flying insects this is the solution	21
0	not a bad product quite sturdy for being made of plastic and all the pieces simply snapping together don't assemble it if the pieces are cold i shattered two pieces trying after the shipping box was in single digit weather overnight let it warm up first ! grinny from m	21
1	i recently bought the stinger uv15 it worked well for one month ! in that month i followed the recommendations for cleaning it and keeping it clear of dead bugs well just shy one month and the grid has completely failed so it attracts the bugs but does n't kill them this product is not worth the money	21
1	i have have had this item for 6 months and tried to change the time since it did not update itself for daylight savings i waited about 15 minutes to reinstall the batteries when i did there was no time display i waited for possible transmission overnight and positioned it to the north and the south sky still no time i changed the batteries several times no results i will never buy this brand again	21
0	accurate easy to program and good to look at well worth the spent	21
0	we were so excited about getting this fire pit rightly so it 's great we could n't ask for more ! adding wood is a breeze it radiates heat well was very easy to put together so far has n't shown any rust at all \( although we do expect it to eventually \)	21
0	we are growing this in arizona and having a fair amount of luck so far the plants are thriving well it helped to start them in peat pots the soil here is clay so after they had their second leaves we transplanted them into the garden for our first time they have n't been much trouble yet easy seeds to grow	21
0	this is great for people like me that are never sure when the steaks are done to the stage i want !	21
1	in theory this is a nice set and i like all of the different tools but i bought this as a gift and i'm going to return it it just looks too cheap the wooden handles are chipped in some places there 's almost no finish on them and the plastic case is really flimsy and cheap looking perhaps if i was buying them for myself i would n't mind but i 'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift	21
0	protects the pit well but is hard to tie tight on a 33 inch pit	21
1	beware amazon lists this cover with the weber performer grill it does not fit the 2006 performer and should not be purchased together	21
0	this chaise lounge made for the perfect addition to my deck the cushion is durable thick and extremely comfortable with velcro 'ties' to keep the cushion in place \( from sliding \) it truly is a beautiful piece there was a slight mix up with the shipping but once everything was straightened out the lounger was delivered just as scheduled the delivery guys even brought the box around to my backyard and on to my deck the chair comes completely assembled all you do is open the box and enjoy	21
0	this stand assembles easily and is perfect for large hammocks do n't forget to get hooks and chains when you buy a hammock to fit this stand	21

0	i like oregon scientific products but their previous atomic alarms had quirky controls often leading to changing the time zone in the middle of the night rather than turning off the alarm this one 's lots better ! the projection feature works ok though does n't really focus sharply at the close distances i 'd prefer to use the eight minute snooze alarm is great just the right interval ! overall a nice useful moderately expensive alarm clock	21

1	i bought this unit and used it one time in a smoker and everything worked perfectly the next time i went to use it i found that the probe had failed replaced batteries and then checked probe with an ohmmeter and found it was open circuit so it cost me 20 to cook one meal my advice is to look elsewhere if you need a digital thermometer	21
