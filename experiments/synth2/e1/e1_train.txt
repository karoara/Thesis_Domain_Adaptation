0	i bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting by the end of my fitting my feet were throbbing red and pinched literally my pinky toe was purple i bought my true size but i still do n't think these shoes would 've been wearable even with a size larger they must just be really narrow	0
0	the jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive the elastic and threads bite into your skin if you use this one for sports you will constantly be distracted the feel of the material used is very rough against your skin esp at the waist	0
0	these socks are okay but after one wash they were covered with so much fuzz and didnt look good so the next pair i washed it with hand and dried alone to avoid the fuzz also they are too warm socks	0
1	these are so pleasing on the eye what can i say besides the fact that these jeans fit great look great and attract alot of attention buy them ! !	0

0	i was happy at the appearance of the bag but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack i received it around christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell it still smells making it unable to use	0
0	a year or so ago i bought several of these on sale they are poorly sized \( i have 4xt \) far too tight for a big man like me to wear comfortably maybe you could order several sizes too big to get a good fit but unless you want everyone to see every roll of fat i 'd avoid buying these	0
1	great slippers very comfortable i love the fact that the front is open in case i just got a pedicure and the black ones are perfect because they do n't show dirt like the white ones	0
0	i almost fell for it then i realized how in the world are those pearls so cheap \? \? they are n't real ! if you are a sucker for a good deal like me think about it before you buy it it would be helpful if the item was advertised as imitation pearl thong	0
0	buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe the real shoe has an ankle strap also the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller i had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs	0
1	these thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight they are also a shiny patent material these are the pluses the one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot that is the toe piece seems a bit long i kept them because i know i will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house i also do not think that they are really worth the price yes they are tommy hilfiger but the name is all you are really paying for they are an okay shoe overall not my favorites	0

0	you ca n't beat this shoe for comfort but they 're definately cuter in the picture i thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel did n't quite seem to fit the shoe i returned them	0
0	although very cute crocs are not good shoes they are a cheap plastic shoe that is over priced and not comfortable at all i bought a pair for my two year old daughter because of the ease to clean them and because they are non slip she did slip in them many times and the worse part is that they gave her huge terrible red blisters on the side of her feet they are the right size but i just think they are not made well do n't go for the hype they are a useless shoe	0
0	i really really didnt like this product at all i hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying very hard to keep them tied also i'm petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off the product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all	0
1	awesome handling while balling on this shoe great grip on the court and i especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet	0
1	the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80 's purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge i was blown away	0
0	i purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit i ordered 2 suits through amazon com but to my surprise the size 34 that i ordered in reallity is a size 28 which makes it very unconfortable to wear so becareful when ordering look at the manufacturer 's sizing list \( very small letters \) to find the right size by the way i had to pay to return these items because i did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart not a happy camper	0
0	i'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received but the case i received does n't cut it for the 60gb it fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them i do not recommend this product for the 60gb i suppose we zen 60gb owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players	0
1	this is my first charles by charles david shoe the material is good the size too the only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side but it after 3 days using them it was ok very nice shoe but definetly it is not a 100 dollars one if you pay less than 50 will be fair	0
1	i got it on size 32 because i usually get my pants on size 32 the bathing suit was too tight i 'll get in on size 34 next time	0
0	item was called fleese but was 80 cotton and looked felt like a regular sweat shirt to return an item to them they give you free mailing but they will deduct 5 95 off the refund for s h after calling them about this they agreed to give us a full refund but the refund will not show up until after 2 or 3 billing cycles i doubt that makes many consumers happy champion makes a fine line of products but i will never deal with them on line agai	0

1	absolute gems simple versatile shoes that are fun comfortable and have great casual style i have them in red wear them to work when traveling and the one time i got stuck in a surprise seattle snowstorm they even had traction nearly an all purpose shoe	0
0	i love all other crocs styles but was very disappointed in the prima they are too slim and look odd and stretched out on me they also tend to slip off in the back as i walk yet the other styles fit me perfectly great idea but they should have worked on it more i ca n't wear these outside the house	0
0	i never wanted to write one of these but i feel i have to i bought these boots they were great but one size too big so i tried to exchange them amazon does n't do exchanges apparently too difficult on top of this the price doubled after i bought them so now if i want the boots amazon will not honor the previous price this is something that any dime store would do but apparently one of the world 's largest online retailers could n't this is very disappointing and i would never recomend this company to anyone ever quite the opposite	0

0	i bought this for the flashlight feature you have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on also the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on the buttons on the front are cheap and do n't seem like they 'll last very long	0

1	these socks are a bit on the thin side but they withstand a lot of wear	0
0	straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro they are too short i tried to add velcro but that did n't work i had to give the shoes away the strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable would not recommend if you are on the heavy side	0
1	i wrote a rave review of these the day i got them they were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug however the next time i wore them for a longer session they got stretched out my toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way i put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance they were very uncomfortable oh well the concept is great but they do n't really work unless you 're doing very little movement i wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job	0

0	this jacket is worst outerwear that i have ever seen although the image might look good in here my size is usually between medium and large i ordered size medium however when i received and tried it on i end up look like wearing xxx large jacket also the craftmanship is very poor the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing i hate to return anything that i had order online because i have to waist my time to go to post office and i have pay the shipping and handling fee nevertheless i returned it yesterday please do n't waist your money on this order it 's not worth it at all	0

0	i bought this dress in black good news it does flatter your postpartum shape bad news the pockets for the nursing pads do n't go where they should causing leakage worse the color black showed milk stains after i leaked definitely not worth the price how important is your figure when you 're sleeping anyway	0
1	this is a great swimsuit but if your buns are out of shape do n't buy since that is what is showing the most i think it would rate a 5 if it was n't lined like previous speedos	0

1	this item was just what i was looking for i did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband 's ties or a tie bar it is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving	0
0	i usually wear size 7m however this shoe of size 7m is way too small i have to return it to amazon and pay the shipping fee for the return by myself i will advise anyone who is interested in this shoe to by 1 size larger than the normal size you wear	0

0	i bought these for my younger than three month old son he did n't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt i ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together i do not suggest that anyone buy these	0
1	this is a very sexy pair of underwear guys if you 're new to the thong g string scene this is a good place to start i recommend g strings because there 's less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs the reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because it 's pretty expensive but go ahead and splurge on one fancy pair of underwear your girlfriend will love it mine did	0
1	i was pleased with all purchase i did not feel that i was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer in addition for reasons that are not clear to me i continue to get duplicate orders or the order is sent to an old address the return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul	0
1	i bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites my husband loved the way i looked in it i must admit i was not that sure i wanted to buy something like this online mainly because i am extremely picky with the quality of the things i buy and also because i tend to be between sizes but i ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me i am very pleased with this seller the order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition	0
0	tan color looks very synthetic cheapens look of shoe also very wide fitting	0
1	it 's nice and has yet to fall apart in 10 belly dancing classes the only thing is that every other triangle does not have coins so you are only getting half as many coins as pictured however for the price i would rather that than have it full of coins and falling apart	0
1	they are exactly what i was hoping they would be i love the contoured front pouch all the web sites i saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal i would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit my wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel i ordered 4 different pairs of unico 's and they 're all good quality and look and feel great	0

0	i bought this a size smaller than i thought i needed but maybe i would be happier with it if i had bought it 2 sizes smaller i really do n't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of firm control sure it 's comfortable but i was expecting some kind of control it does smooth out some but not at all what i was expecting	0

1	this is n't a review of this product so much as it 's a review of the impression it makes anyone who was in paris around the turn of the century will remember aubade 's lecons de seduction advertising campaign of which the image shown here for this tanga was a part each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of impression and is n't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for \? nothing has made a stronger impression on us	0
1	for me they are very difficult to put on i have to use a long shoe horn they are n't tight in fact they are so wonderfully comfortable and warm they look great if you like the ugg look i'm hoping when they loosen up they will be easier to put on the top scrunches down when i put my foot in that is why it is so hard to get them on it could be me though ! otherwise i love everything else about them van c	0

1	i found that these shorts do run a little bit small in size so make sure you give yourself an extra size up to make sure there is adequate room to move freely follow the care label for the first wash or two until they get broke in because the shorts are bit stiff at first due to their scotchgaurding tip make sure you wash them before you wear them i would recommend these shorts for most anyone who is looking for durability comfort and or needing a professional look in the garments they wear note if you are looking for extra pockets go the dickies cargo route these do not have any extra pockets	0

0	i was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991 however i had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had the shoe is hard uncomfortable and much wider than the 991 my foot slides around everywhere i recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first do n't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991	0

0	this is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover the plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing the collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark a cotton cotton blend or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses	0
0	these are the absolute worst things i have ever bought serves me right for by a sandal without ever having tried it on i walked around the block from my house with them and barely made it home they hurt the bottoms of my feet so badly i may need to take an extra day off of work the part of the sandal where it might normally be flat and cushioned has sharpened plastic spikes knifing the sole of your foot take your money and throw it right into the garbage and save yourself the misery of ever having worn these so called sandals and i love adidas	0

0	the scarf arrived with several holes in it my daughter was very dissappointed crying and wondering why santa sent this to her we ordered well in advance before christmas but the set arrived too late we were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping a few days before christmas it arrived ! it was too late to do anything amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site	0
0	beware the size is not true size fitmy small turn out to be something that fits like a large from some other brands this is not a small it 's loose fitting and it 's a straight line cut it 's really bad it 's so disappointing everything doesnt holds in places it doesnt look like the photo at all the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy and if you are a medium you need a small for this dress and it will still fit loosly on you that 's how big of a dress this is i'm returning it	0

0	i found the wallet to be cheap looking and much smaller than the picture lead me to believe to call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product this is more of an insert to a wallet consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket i was n't pleased with the purchased expecting quite a bit more the 14 i spent i can go to target and get a wallet for less that what i paid for this one and it will be a full wallet not a sorry wannabe	0

1	finally ! i 've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years these enhancers are well shaped and incredibly comfortable when ordering go ahead and get the b c size even if you are an a or low b these inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up i personally recommend using a fashion forms pocket bra style 9400 or a playtex style 4300 order a cup size above what you would normally wear	0
1	i bought this bag as a gift for a lawyer friend she loves it and has told everyone about it the color allows her to express her personailty while remaining professional and the size and durability of the bag allow her to eliminate a separate purse lunchbag and carryall	0
1	the whole rubber wristband thing has gotten out of hand do your part to put it to rest by buying regular wristbands when it was all for charities before thats okay but it is ridiculous now heres the rules livestrong okay because that was the original everything else no people who wear like 5 of them probably the main reason why you 'd starting wearing the regular ones plus they 're way better and not some cheap piece of rubber that cost 2 cents to make anyways end the fad ! ! !	0

1	i like the flip case it is exactly what i wanted however the clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it	0
0	a \) the quality is not that great b \) the socks are not skid proof butits good to have 8 pairs because somehow the curse of missing socks will hit babies socks too sometimes they pull them off while takig a walk at restaraunts friends' homes and sometimes the dryer eats them	0
0	the top was very roughly finished the end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place because the seams on it were very rough so i had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be the top got completely ruined on the first wash i followed the instructions to a t during washing but still the blue on the top ran and i had to throw it away the skirt is still fine after washing it twice but i would not recommend this outfit to anybody	0

1	these are comfortable slippers that with composite soles can take you out on the deck to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so they 're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet breath a little fresh air nice value for the price	0
1	i have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful	0
0	we have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where i work but he is n't nearly as menacing as this sucker ! in fact 's he 's kinda friendly this guy 's a beast blood red eyes sharp claws looks like he 'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom no ordinary broom neccesary here friends no what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick buy this guy set him in the windows of a dark room and call the cops god knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games would get more stars but he 's damn expensive	0

0	this was a nightmare order i paid extra for expedited shipping to assure christmas arrival package tracking log revealed that the shoes were not even shipped until after christmas disgraceful and unforgivable to have to tell my 7 yr old grandson that his gift did n't make it the shipping cost as much as the shoes and this company should be ashamed they are also impossible to reach amazon could n't even get them on phone thank goodness the shoes fit i ca n't begin to imagine what a return would have been like the product is great	0
1	these socks are absolutely the best i take pilates classes and if it is hot your feet can slip off the mat \( not good in the middle of a side plank ! \) anyway these socks keep your feet planted and dry one note make sure not to order them big the idea is that they should be snug	0

1	these are so great and keep my baby 's feet warm she even slept with them on with no problem she 's been a master at getting her socks off up until now they also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails she 's chewing on the toes but i have n't seen any scuff marks yet so they are holding up very well	0

0	please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop i received with battery problems it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it you have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner the suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all	0
1	it is exactly what i was looking for i had no problems ordering or receiving it i got to my house quickly nothing is wrong with it	0
0	i am sorry but i did not like it nor will i wear it as it is too big looks funny on me i wish i had not have gotten it	0
0	even for only 12 these were n't worth the money they came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine or some other noxious chemical and now at least 2 months since i have received them the smell has not dissipated they are extremely stiff so even if they did n't reek i still would n't wear them b c my feet would be in tatters by mid day i guess that 's what i get for buying cheap shoes	0
0	these booties are very cute and soft but they just slip right off my son 's feet they do not have a way to secure the 'tongue' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet the 'tongue' part just pulls right out not a good value for the money	0
0	this shoe is very comfortable unfortunately i had to send it back to the manufacturer twice the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are i am very dissapointed as i have come to expect quality from merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks i would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping	0

1	the megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes it has a nice feel to it the bathrobe is made of japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of 100 cotton cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable i purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected overall i am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if i had the choice to do so	0
1	highly recommend shoe but you might need a larger size than usual i wear easy spirit 7 1 2 w but found this shoe too snug in both width and length and had to return	0
0	the shirt is of ok quality but the design is hard to see and will probaby wash off quickly be sure to order a size bigger than you normally would as it is cut small also my personal opinion is the shipping charge for this very light item is a little excessive	0

0	judging from the picture i thought this thing looked like a turban ! it actually has no wrapped fabric but is a firmly fitting cap hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap aside from this the coloring is too bold old glory will select random coloration for each customer but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture ! i do n't see how i can wear it without attracting stares	0
0	i ordered a small it is huge and has shoulder pads that are on my elbow	0

0	this is not a jockstrap it is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity i tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable let alone not exactly hygenic ! no surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by rips	0
1	i bought this product online about a week ago and it is exactly as described and to the reviewer who backpacks if your that hardcore of a backpacker you might want to consider spending more than 6 on a fanny pack seriously lighten up and review the product not tell your life story	0

1	having sampled 100 cotton pinpoint shirts both on line and from the stores themselves my husband keeps returning to his favorite the land 's end pinpoint without a doubt the quality is unsurpassed and its longevity is legendary ! now when its time for new shirts we do n't think twice and go directly to land 's end and order they also have the widest color selection and each color is true to its picture and flattering to all	0

1	i have started water walking in the fitness center pool and found i was slipping enough to bother me this shoe fits like a glove and is very inexpensive to use i would recommend it to anyone desiring to use it for this purpose or any other water related activity i am certain it would be great at the beach etc	0
0	first of all they look cheaper than i thought they would look but the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the top of my foot in other words the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot and caused blisters i am hoping that if i keep trying to wear them the leather will soften up and become easier to wear	0
0	i only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute other than that they were quite unusable i usually wear a size 7 but i could not even get my foot into these shoes and they are quite hard had to get rid of them	0

0	i had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions i wear they are my son 's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room he 's only 6 and when i had trained him i tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear in my personal thoughts are that men 's boy 's underwear has a fly in the front for need use unlike that for women and girls whom do n't require it	0

1	i bought two of these as a gift for my husband he 'd previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed these were ready to go right out of the box no assembly required took up less space in his closet than the 3 4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from the cushioned tie hooks ensure the ties will not slip off and also that they will not be damaged a breeze to organize his vast tie collection and he 's loving this product	0

0	as much as seller might like this backpack to be 11 by 8 5 by 6 5 the one i 've got is surely not that big \( 10 x8 x4 at best ! \) and as a result of this it is totally unsuitable for me since notebooks would absolutely not fit into it \( and judging by the size the seller decided to advertise was it what they were aiming for \? \) the material is ok so is the craftsmanship but the fact that they lied \( yes ! l i e d ! \) about the size just completely spoils the whole deal a great dissapointment ! ! !	0

0	a sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise but this one does n't also the construction leaves something to be desired it 's very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks where the seams are sewn i bought two after trying them several times i gave up and sent them to charity do n't bother	0

0	while i was a little wary of ordering a jacket for 20 online i went ahead and ordered this one it seemed like it was made of durable material and looked snazzy when it came in the mail today it was stuffed in a first class envelope with another t shirt which i really like ! i was anxious to see what it was like this jacket is literally made of the material used for fedex envelopes sounds cool huh \? the jacket is extremely thin and feels like you 're wearing a paper bag while i appreciate the prompt service of the people at andrew christian they will probably see my jacket returned within the next couple of weeks	0

1	i pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running i not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but i ran two half marathons and the nyc marathon with this exact sneaker when they became worn from the wear and tear \? i bought another pair exact one these sneakers lasted me half a training season plus the marathon not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles i highly recommend them and the color is fun too	0

0	i purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because i have a hard time walking in really high heels they are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap does n't hold my foot firmly in the shoe when i walked around in them i could feel them flopping also anytime i raised my foot \( to simulate my fiance taking off the garter \) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe so just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe for the price this is not worth the buy	0

1	we are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season unfortunately the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from amazon after sending 4 emails we do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching we have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company but we can not get anyone to respond we will never order anything through amazon again	0

0	they 're pretty but flimsy very light construction the lens is not really mirrored so if you attempting to hide your eyes forget it it would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap chinese knock off gave them two stars simply because they are good looking but cheap and they feel that way on your face	0

1	this shoe is great it even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design the only thing that i felt it lacked was extra comfort i wear skechers and have done so for years and i have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet it was a great deal that i just could n't pass up and definitely worth the price	0
1	this is a great and comfortable bra and it works for me it 's a minimizer and is great for larger sizes i exercise a lot and it provides great support even good enough for running on the treadmill i have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years i am so impressed with them that i looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more and it is half of what i paid in the mall now it is all i wear for everyday \)	0

0	save yourself the trouble and get the braided \( 3 line \) latex hose type of clothesline want suction cups rings snap hooks etc \? buy them for pennies at a drug store the problem with this clothesline is that you ca n't make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines they slide down to the lowest point in the middle the only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they 'll dry is with a braided line period	0
0	i have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away the shoes look cheap not typical of the nine west brand i would not purchase this item again i thought i was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work	0

1	columbia sport sandals for kids are great ! we 've bought them three years in a row now for our kids they hold up well are comfy and the colors are great easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze they 're well constructed but the dirt starts to show on the nylon parts after a while they wo n't really wear out before your kids feet grow to the next size	0
0	i will be returning this item to the vendor i rec 'd this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery instead i find the word baske in a mirrored embroidered image not sure what baske stands for i guess it 's their idea of 'short for basketball' whatever ! you ca n't see the pic clearly i'm out the shipping cost on this one what a bummer !	0
1	i was shocked to see how high the heel was and being in my 40s i was n't sure if i wanted to find out how they felt but i had a company dinner party and wore them and was surprised at how walkable and comfortable they were i have worn them several times since then	0

1	the price for the slippers was average no big discount but they arrived at my front door in time for christmas that was a big plus and my daughter loved them	0
1	these are perfect for low rise pants the cut will likely be flattering for any guy the front pouch design allows for maximum comfort and moveability and i find the fit in the back to be basically great an essential for those whose jeans hang low	0

0	the jacket we received had weird arms they had a hole for the thumb and then another for the rest of the fingers great for skiing or snowboarding but for casual use in florida winter was n't very practical columbia in general is a company i swear by	0

0	these were a gift at christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much !	0

1	the robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well ! the color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful	0
1	this is an amazing product i bought one of these along with another swaddle product that did not have the sleepsack feature believe me there is no comparison not only is the halo product made better and is more durable and holds the baby better but it is a 2 in 1 so that you can use it as a sleepsack by itself too i trust this company because the product is recommended by the sids society i do n't have to worry that my baby is going to wriggle out of the swaddle because he is so secure in it	0
0	i was so disappointed in this product i bought the ad hook line and sinker thinking that the memory foam was a great idea that it would give me bilateral plantar fascitis suffering feet some long awaited relief after about 2 hrs of wear the foam is completely flat which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard save your money ! these are awful	0
1	i love these shoes i bought 3 colors and they are great ! they are very stylish and comfortable and that is hard to find in a dress shoe	0
1	i find this a very comfortable bra for women of larger sizes	0

1	this is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you 're looking for a slightly wider toe box it looks great with a skirt or slacks my only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable and kindest to my feet i ca n't find my size \( 6 5 w \) in navy i have the shoe in black if anyone from naturalizer is reading this message how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available	0
1	ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase i just wish it was n't hand wash only	0

1	this item was durable warm the right size as advertised and the right price	0
1	the item is much better than any others that i have got through out the years it should last a long time not rip easy it feels very sturdy i think it is real good	0
0	i was very disappointed with this bra i would definately not recommend it if you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the maternelle bra instead this bra looks sexy but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra \( at least not for a size 38dd \)	0

1	my friend was very happy with them they are very good quality and they fit him for the most part the only issue we had was the length of the arms they were a little too long other than that we were pleased they got here in time for christmas and they were just what he wanted	0
0	i bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old luvable friend 's onsies are awful the biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies and the velcro does n't even stick they becomes undone and fly loose within minutes also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old lastly even the shirt tag stinks it is this cheap oversized tag that i had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son shame on them for making such a cheap product shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review !	0
1	for the money these are a great value unlike a comment above i have not found these short at all but average in length	0

0	if you have a 60 gig ipod this is n't 4 u it is way too tight limits access to the click reel and completly blocks access to the hold butto	0
0	maybe i'm naive but i never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase they are spring loaded and they turn a certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out i got one out by sheer accident but that is it and there are no directions included so i'm back to a keyring and that 's not so bad	0
1	great fit lightweight these are very snug and allow for maximum mobility for quicker players who do a lot of cutting and fast movement support strap is not too tight which is good and actually serves a purpose	0
1	i absolutely love this case ! the cool thing about it is that it does n't look like a regular laptop case \( i e the bulky usually black boring case \) my best friend did n't even know it was a laptop case and fell in love with the bag itself ! it makes a great gift for any soon to be college student	0
0	first time i 've ordered a product from leg avenue and it 'll probably be my last ! i opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 runs in one of the legs before i even tried them on what a waste of money and if i would pay to ship them back for another pair then i 've already put way too much money into what should be an inexpensive product	0
0	company sent me two of one shirt and this shirt i ordered 3 different shirts this shirt is large in size but very short ! not what i had expected asked the company to fix the problem with the shirts as they were christmas gifts for my daughter i received a fill form two weeks later with no correction to the problem	0

1	one of the most comfortable bras i 've ever worn i own several and they 're just about all i 'll wear ! very nice fit and good look under clothes	0
0	in theory this boot seemed perfect added some height came in perfectly wearable colors was made of real leather the price was unbeatable but \( yes unfortunately a big but \) like everything else which seems perfect it was perfectly flawed i did my research read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual but still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet totally crushing my veins i'm a big shoe collector and i can recognize a design error when i see one surprisingly that it came from this brand usually so quality reliable these boots are not meant for walking if you want to take a pretty picture in them they might fulfill that purpose	0
0	i too have been searching for the panty in the picture i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg there should only be a 1 2 inch of fabric but there is more like 3 inches yuk ! bhas anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured \? \( the ones that we all seem to love and want \) \? please email me personally if u have found them ! sheemna yahoo co	0
1	this bra is the best nursing bra i have found it is very supportive and comfortable i like that it gives you the same support as an underwire bra but without the hard wire digging into you it holds up very well in the wash i would definitly recommend this bra to anyone that has a hard time finding bras to fit them	0

1	these are the only semi affordable bikini briefs i 've found that are actually designed with a pouch making them the most comfortable on the market \( of all the brands i 've tried that is \) unfortunately they 're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets and you 'll probably have to purchase them from an amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges but what can i say i guess it 's worth it the briefs also run about a size small i have a 31 waist but the mediums are too small	0
1	very cute tops for a nice price they wash up good they do run a little big just so you are aware	0
0	i just wanted to let all other bigger busted women know to not buy this product it is made for smaller busted women in mind there is no support and barely any coverage for bigger busted woman it was a trial on my part but i hope by writing this it will help other women avoid making the same mistake stick with the strapless bras ladies !	0

0	i wish i could give them 5 stars i got these to replace a pair of new balance 999 that i had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around 170 should be really good i could n't be more wrong the lining of these shoes started falling apart a just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day ! ! ! stay away at all cost	0

0	i love the t shirt because i loved the movie but just note that if you are typically bothered by restrictive neck lines and arms this may present an issue for you the areas you see in the navy color have a tapering fit	0

1	it 's a very durable bag i run trails a lot and i was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season durable as well as comfortable and cheap so i do n't have to worry about ripping it the straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders the part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills and if you need it for books the padding will keep the books from poking your back i would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though i expect i will tear it to shreds eventually but for the price it 's worth it	0

0	the foam padding does not have enough consistancy it stays compressed with in a short period of time not recommended	0
0	this shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining the people who like it must be quite thin indeed it does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it does n't breathe very well either i am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me for the price you can do better even at someplace like target	0
0	if you are a weightlifter or bodybuilder the yoke piping will cut into your lats and pecs unless you buy a larger size than usual this restrictive band makes the jacket rather uncomfortable the velcro isn't quite right either the material itself is nice to the touch but the design is flawed wasn't worth even the sale price	0

1	good color visibility nicely structured with warmth applicable to the unspeakable and inhuman frigidites of the amerikan north the hat fits snugly and will evoke a positive commentary now and again i have ordered maroon but will likely add some other color choice as the array is rather impressive for an 100 acrylic knit this is not a bad hat the only problem perhaps being that it sucks up hairs very easily almost as if it were a hair vacuum machine	0
0	nice stretchy material but too short and i'm usually a 16 18 the g string is not even close to plus size do n't even bother	0
0	very disappointing this product has less control than an average pair of pantyhose the high waist was always rolling down i was n't expecting miracles i just wanted to smooth out my silouette while i lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight this product was completely useless product has a clever name but that 's it i really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item look elsewhere	0

0	these underwear were supposed to be size 34 but i could barely shimmy them up over my legs the fit was so tight that i could not wear them even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine they are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs if you must try these buy them at least 2 sizes larger but you would do better with another product	0
1	the zipper pulls are somewhat ill suited for the job the only way i found to be able to zip the boots up quickly easily and snuggly was to replace the zipper pull with a key chain	0

0	even though i favor leather every once in a while a pleather product comes along that i really appreciate well these boots sadly are not in that category the pleather started cracking after i wore the boots x3 the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling the sad part is that for the amount of money that i spend on these boots i could have bought a pair of leather ones after x mas	0

0	i am not leaking so i do n't need those annoying papery pads but i would still like a little padded protection so i was hoping this bra would do the trick well it served that purpose alright but it was a pain as far as nursing went the clasp was difficult to release with one hand the cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult worst of all the underwire gave me a rash ! this bra may work for some but not for me	0

0	i ordered a 11 5eee size slip on shoe despite the labelling in the shoes they felt more like 12 5ee in other words too tight across the arch and so loose on the heel they wore like flip flops unfortunately the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them which voids the company 's product return policy anybody want a worn once pair of shoes cheap \?	0

0	the sling support feature on these underwear is practically useless my testicles always slip completely out of the sling before i 've had them on for even an hour if these briefs enhance a man 's profile at all it 's because they 're so darn tight it has nothing to do with the sling support and talk about low rise the top of my crack is exposed even when they 're pulled all the way up i'm in pretty good shape but if these things shrink in the dryer i wo n't be able to fit into them anymore my advice anybody ordering c in briefs should go one size larger than what he 'd normally wear	0

1	the fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed they wash beautifully and require little or no ironing my husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well the hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing frankly i wish i could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price hagaar offers haagar has done a terrific job again	0

0	ok i do n't why this bra is available in any size larger than a b cup because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust \( i see that is available here in 38 dd and i shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing \) it 's comfortable enough to be worn around the house under jammies for a little support when just relaxing but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day this bra wo n't do it the front closure just does n't allow for any lift or support unless you possess a smaller chest skip this one	0

1	i purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas i was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots with four children sometimes a compromise is in order so when i saw these at a more reasonable price i got them when she opened them she at first did n't even realize they were n't the ugg 's she has been wearing them since and i'm guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost in comparison to the more expensive boots she says no difference	0

0	i bought two of these hoping to use them as sashes in a bridal event and quickly returned them since it took over two weeks for delivery i am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return refund the sashes are not the quality that i thought was represented by the term charmeuse and are thin and gauzy they came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz much of that must have been the packaging a quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction	0

1	i 've tried 6 different nursing bras this one with the center snap closure is the easiest to use it is also the lightest and most comfortable while providing good support my only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric even when i try to sew it back into place it breaks loose after a few washes perhaps if i handwashed the bra instead of using a machine it would last longer this bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras \( particularly the leading lady bra which seems to be indestructible \) but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort lightness and ease of use it is by far my favorite	0

0	i have worn jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time the product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them ! i shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings given the cost of panties and other similar products you 'd think the quality would be decent however jockey is n't the only company out there with a substandard product i guess until i can afford to spend substantially more for panties i'm stuck i will only pay sale prices	0

0	while the suit fits and looks great my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit it 's really the placement that bothered her there is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam which from a distance looks like one had an accident in their trunks thanks but no thanks these shorts are being returned	0

1	this bra is great for those of us with smaller busts it 's the only bra i 'll wear under my t shirts now because it does n't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra i 've found it very comfortable the only downside is that mine did lose it 's form \( it 's not as tight fitting as it used to be \) a little bit faster than some other bras but it 's absolutely worth buying a replacement i just hope they never stop making this bra	0

0	i bought these shoes to do aerobics in they look good and are comfortable but only to walk in there is zero arch support and when i walk in them i feel as if my feet are flat on the ground there is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics my old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones but i ca n't use the old ones the gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes they are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt i am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location now i have to look again	0

0	i am a 44dd i am having the hardest time finding a good bra i ordered this one and i am a little dissapointed the underwires in the front poke out and make it look like i have these bones sticking straight out of my chest everthing else is ok no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone	0
1	this shoe transcended all my expectations the style color and fit were all everything i hoped for and more ! ! ! all this plus a modest price ! !	0
0	i had several of these shipped to my mum in law 's in california for sending to me in france where we work and live because of a decent delivery speed and her thinking they looked ok i gave them a rating of 5 stars today after even having boiled them in water hoping for shrinkage i am sad to say that nothing happened they are horrid to wear i oredered a medium size and the fit is that of xxxxxxxl do not buy this horrors i wish i could get my hard earned money back as now i'm wondering if i was the brunt of a joke in nightmare alley you 've got to be con artist to sell these things	0
0	get ee if you get these the d is very narrow and thefore uncomfortable	0
0	i bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts i usually lift weights have no prior injuries and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form \( i played a college sport etc \) after a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that i could barely move them regularly it was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier \( free weights included \) perhaps i was doing the exercises incorrectly but that seems like a real risk with a video like this	0
0	i have a 33 34 waste i bought the medium size because it is advertised to be fit for 32 34 waste the thing is too tight ! it almost blocks circulation to my legs plus the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch i was mostly disappointed with this product you can find a much better value at this price	0
1	these sandals are very nice and the price that i paid was a very good price	0
0	i'm just not too crazy about this thing doesn't quite fit right or look right at least i only paid 5 bucks	0
1	nice shoes cut a bit high in the back so i got blisters at first love the fabric and color prompt shipping and nice bo	0
0	i placed order on 10 10 i called blue blood racing the shipper because i did find any shipping info on amazon and was that as of the 10 16 that my order had not been shipped i that it would be shipped that day i was told that i may get my item 10 23 or 10 24 horrible customer service the shipper also told me that there was some kind of problem with my shoe that is what took so long but i was not contacted and told that there was a delay in receiving my item i will not order from blue blood racing again ! !	0
1	this case is so cute and matches my green ipod perfectly i read other reviews that said it leaves little black fuzz on the ipod but i have n't had that problem the belt clip works great with this and feels very secure the other review said the cut out for the wheel is off a little and i guess she is right looking at it you can see just slightly that the wheel is n't centered but it is completely accesible and i have no trouble using it overall i love this case	0
0	i bought a bunch of these shirts because i saw the good reviews at first i was happy they fit perfect then i washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than i ever seen shirts shrink in my life my medium shirts became xxs i wish i had a 8 year old son because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now	0
1	i bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started let me tell you these boots are great ! ! ! ! ! ! i read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they 're a little big regardless i love them and another thing they keep my feet very warm and cozy	0
1	i was looking for an inexpensive but functional leather briefcase and this was exactly what i was looking for i have more than three electronic devices that i need easy access to and the case has three outside pockets big enough to hold my devices the only thing missing is an outside place to put a pen or pencil i do n't know how durable it will be but i'm hoping very ! ! for the price this is a good buy	0
1	this sheet is great solution for difficult to change crib sheets just lay it over the top of your pretty sheet and snap it to the crib frame i highly recommend it to those who do n't like wrestling the crib sheet onto the mattress	0
0	i have worn jockeys for almost 20 years but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years the fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly and the underwear is for some unfathomable reason heavily perfumed ! i had to wash them at least 5 6 times to get the smell out plus some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight and some was so loose i could n't wear them and they were all the same size very inconsistent quality i do not recommend these anymore	0
0	i really wanted to like these but they just wo n't stay put it 's not a thong but it will be after a few hours of wear i usually love dkny products so i am disappointed	0
1	i love these jeans i have 3 pair and they are the only jeans i wear just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight i wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great	0
1	my new shoe wallet is even better than i expected ! it securely fastens to my running shoe holds my key emergency cash and identification and most importantly serves as a safe place for my ipod sport sensor best of all my ipod works efficiently and accurately in the shoe wallet without my purchasing nike branded shoes i'm a very happy consumer !	0
0	this was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line the fit was awful there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless	0
0	this tie winder is not only twice the size i was expecting but it does n't work after one attempted use the lid no longer stays on i would have returned it if the return shipping did n't cost more than the item	0
0	the box it came in looked like it had been torn apart by a pack of wild dogs when i received it fur was falling off of the coat as i pulled it out of the box i tried it on just to see if i 'd like a replacement since it was not in perfect condition and it was not cute on i immediately returned it	0
0	i purchased this to replace my husband 's favorite keyfob from american eagle which was almost identical \( and lasted ten years incidentally \) this one fell apart after two months time for a trip to the local leathersmith	0
1	let me assure anyone who is even remotely thinking of buying these shoes do it ! they are not only beautiful but as high as they are they are extremely comfortable the detail is way more beautiful in person as they are on the website my favorite shoe of the summer	0

1	this is the fifth pair of club cs i 've owned the second in black i believe they 're the best combination of durability and comfort on the market i 'll undoubtedly buy another pair when these wear out	0
0	the product was unsatisfactory because of how large it was my son exchanged it	0
1	my husband is a big man and very rough on belts most belts last him a few weeks this one has lasted him 3 years the only reason i'm buying him a new one is because he 's lost so much weight there 's still 'lots of miles' left in the belt i'm replacing definitely got our money 's worth out of it	0
1	these wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price and they were delivered faster than expected	0
0	these cover ups are very thin a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun the colors are pretty but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps they are cheap good thing because i ca n't imagine what to use them for i 'd return them but the postage would cost more than the item	0
1	this is cute funny and it 's not uncomforable ! i think it rocks ! i love this movie i even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth	0
1	these boots are so warm and soft ! i usually wear a 7 5 and i ordered them in size 7 \( even though they recommend sizing up for half sizes \) and they fit perfectly an awesome \( and cheaper \) alternative to uggs	0
1	fits great on my ipod nano does not slip off like other silicone covers pretty durable and great protective piece for the nano con do plastic cover or protection for the screen	0
1	if you have the body to show for it by all means wear it alone	0
0	these socks were thin large and horrible they had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently absolutely worthless	0
1	i purchased this bag to take on a tour of greece and was pretty happy with it i loved the size not to big and not too small and also the flatness of it it was very lightweight and the compartements are easily accessible the only problem i had with it is that when you wear it as intended accross your body the strap tends to rub at the neck so i had to keep adjusting it every five minutes overall it was pretty good though	0
0	i bought two of these bags so far both have failed at the plastic fastener one arm just snapped in no time the bag itself is ok but the plastic parts on the belt are really cheap i wont buy a third one	0
0	it 's true that you get what you pay for the good thing i can say aboutthis product is that the price is right but the quality was low and the fitwas poor however if you are strapped for money then they are certainlywearable but get a half size smaller than you usually would get	0
0	the sound works but the light does not	0
1	i love these shoes ! they are so comfy and look good the price is a bit steep i think but considering i could wear them practically every day and not get tired of them i guess they are worth it definitely considering purchasing another pair in brown !	0
1	i bought another of clark 's sandals a few years ago which is why i ordered them again these sandals were even more comfortable than the last pair ! there was no break in period with these shoes i just put them on and spent the day in them without pressure points or blisters i will buy more in other colors i'm sure you ca n't go wrong with clark 's	0
0	not as expected too short nothing special for the price took forever to receive \( about 3 weeks	0
1	these wellies \( rubber boots \) are a show stopper ! i get lots of comments on how smashing they look and they are very functional i wear them in the garden on the beach \( can walk into pretty high water without getting wet \) and they are comfortable for long periods of walking very happy with them and the price was right too	0
1	i bought this for my husband and am so impressed nice and thick and incredibly soft and huggable i have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores the attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise sturdy shipping box and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required there was even a hand written thank you note included i am more than satisfied	0
0	i would have loved it if they sent it but after over 2 weeks of telling me that it was in stock on it 's way the company fessed up that they were out of the color that i chose the other color that they wanted to sub looked pretty bad so i cancelled	0
0	the slipper seems to have some craftmenship in my case they seem to run about a half size small who wants to wait for a pair of slippers to stretch \? i wish i had known this in advance they look good in my closet though	0
1	i just purchased fleece hoodies and pants by andrew christian the material is wonderful the hoody feels luxuriously soft on my skin i would recommend them highly the pansts are low rise since i am older i am still getting used to that but they too feel really good on	0
0	i bought a sweatshirt from them the tote was a freebie and too small for much use anyway customer service was awful they sent me the wrong size a man 's size not the woman 's i was searching for \( and the photo had a woman wearing it ! she must have been an amazon \) i returned it the next day and they refused to accept the return saying it looked worn	0
0	our company ordered these shirts from the texas shirt company while we were happy with the quality our order was missing 2 shirts over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for as if to say we were not telling the truth if you do n't care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company	0
1	i received the earmuffs i ordered 3 days after i placed the order	0
1	i'm very satisfied with this purchase the jeans are great quality for the price however it was not stated that they would be the \( very \) long length that they were i had to alter them which was an inconvenience	0
0	if your loved one is a beautiful 5'7 130 lb slender lady like mine forget about this piece of clothing if however she is a 5'1 180 lb gorgeous petite girl this might just be the excitement inducer you are looking for you 'll have lots of fun first trying to put it on her then trying to use the slits which are in all the wrong places and then finally to remove it from her body without injuring her or yourself fun that will come after that is purely optional	0
0	this review is n't really about the flip flops because theyre great why would you buy them here for 5 61 when you can get them at the store for 2 50 each \?	0
0	the product would have been great but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes i requested xl long pants they sent size 3x pants so they are completely unusable and do not respond to my emails i would never order from them again	0
0	after one washing the letters were all rolled up i was able to pull the rest of it off and now it is just a grey onesie the quality of the graphic was horrible	0
1	i bought these for my granddaughter after i saw her wearing a pair of plain black rubber boots which she loved ! when i gave her these she absolutely loved them ! they are so cute with flowers and butterflies all over them they run true to size are well made and look so bright and cheerful on a rainy day needless to say the black boots have been retired	0
1	these boxers are much nicer than the photos suggest i was pleasantly surprised i was trying to replace a pair i had accidentally washed in the washing machine \( a no no with this fabric \) turns out the replacements were twice the quality of what i had originally purchased i will probably be purchasing more your wife will thank you for buying these excellent quality and softer than satin my only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes because it 's made without a fastener the idea is for a sleeker feel but it sacrifices security love 'em anyway	0
1	these are without question the best panties for wearing with slacks no line at the leg no line accross the middle of your behind and no riding up they are also cut low enough to not show in a moderately low rise pant sizing runs true to any other maidenform pantie you 've ever bought can be had cheaper at a maidenform outlet store but still well worth the price on amazon buy lots of them	0
0	i got this bra thinking it would be great for rigorous sports and my 38ddd chest think again go for the the enell sports bra i bought a size 3 and it is perfect no bounce whatsoever ! ! ! i was amazed do n't bother with this one	0
1	once my best friend described my bra size as beige meaning that when you shop in the full figure section of a department store you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny 's closet most of the bras are beige with some black or white ones and all are gigantic and ugly if this sounds familiar to you then this is the bra for you it looks pretty comes in a variety of colors and i at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences the cups do the supporting so the bra does n't need to have those super wide heavily padded straps and it gives a good silhouette under clothes but will also look nice by itself	0
0	i was very dissappointed by this item it arrived folded into a 6x6 square bag and was very creased when opened it will take considerable pressing to try and get it out the fabric is too stiff and does n't drap well the length is n't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap the return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk	0
0	after only one week use at home the sole was completely broken the worst quality slipper i have ever seen	0
0	the sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body my husband is 6' 178 pounds so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit but this one looked like a stiff kite on him be aware the items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money and only after i had filed a complaint with amazon amazon acted quickly to post the credit	0
1	most flattering yoga pants i 've ever worn i have an akward figure long waist big butt a little pot belly but these pants look and feel great plus i 've heard the company pays a living wage to thier workers i want 10 pairs	0
0	the nippits did n't really work for me and they were painful to remove	0
0	when i move around i sure do n't need a front closure that comes undone many times a day \? ! the hook on this bra needs to be changed to a snap closure ! perfect bra in every other sense but a self unhooking bra \? no good	0
1	i was a little nervous about ordering clothing from the internet not knowing if it would fit i think that the sizing chart used for this particular product works well because the produt turned out to fit just right also the picture is on key with the actual product my loved it and so do i	0
1	this jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip this is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect it will keep you perfectly dry you will sweat a little on a warm day but it is well worth the money for a cheap dependable and totally waterproof suit enjoy the rain and mud	0
0	it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces look at tunebelt they have one that fits pretty good	0
1	i love this umbrella it 's just the right size and works perfectly it 's so pretty that i do n't want to get it wet ! !	0
0	these pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all if they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these i have lost the 3 pairs i biught to the self same calamity and always in public please save yourself the trouble by the way the lee version of these pants also do the same thing be afraid be very afraid	0
0	the fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips i am a 5'6 120 lb small boned female the company offered to exchange it however did not offer any others with cell phone holder now i will have to pay return shipping plus 4 95 restocking fee to return this item i did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now	0
0	the jacket itself its well made but they sent a jacket with different colors and it does not look as nice as the one in the picture	0
1	i have to say those crocs are the best they are super confi and light i recommend them	0
1	i bought a pair for my wife and she told me how warm her feet were while wearing them so i decided to buy a pair for myself i wear them without socks as they are so warm and comfortable i think wearing socks w these shoes would get a little too warm for my feet	0
1	my husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing we love them i gave him two pair for christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these they look great too	0
0	this corset is not well made at all it 's made of really cheap plastic boning and the boning sticked out after just a night of wear \( i wore it to the club one night and by the end of the night the boning sticked through the top	0
0	i have ordered intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase so far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings i will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn i now know why i pay 15 00 for two pair ofjockey 's	0
0	i was disapointed with this jacket it was advertized as cashmere when i received it the label stated it was recycle cashmere and it did not look or feel like cashmere i was very disappointed and i returned the item	0

0	a good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky boulder type terrain the previous model called the sawtooth had the shank and the tigertooth does not i recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe by the way i just loved the sawtooth from columbia the business decision to drop the sawtooth was a mistake the shoe was great for rocky desert hiking i convinced 6 of my friends to buy it	0
1	this is not a basket short or soccer short no ! ! ! ! it 's a very very nice beach short or just to sunnys day specialy in my country with hot beaches all year and beatyfull shopping mall near you can use this shorts for both activities that 's why i bought it and do n't mess the shoppin	0
0	super low price advertised on 'select sizes and colors' oh and u have to add to your cart before you know the price	0
0	we have not opened the package the item is advertised as one size without a notice that the one size is not one size fits all it is xl \( grand plus for those that speak french \) my wife wears a size 2 or 4 obviously this was a waste of money	0
0	i 've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full time in the summer and very little the rest of the year while the shoes are comfortable i was disappointed at how fast they 're falling apart the padding around the ankle has torn there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes and i was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement the solid rubber outsole delivers long wearing durability that 's been my major complaint with these shoes shortly after i got them the soles cracked at the heel and now layers of the soles are peeling off i recommend buying another model	0
1	a difficult item to find in department stores found some at twice the price in a leather goods store the fossil leather key cases were of equal quality i purchased two and am very satisfied	0

0	i have several pairs of clarks shoes that are wonderful the lalita is very uncomfortable they are stiff and the sides that come over the foot are stiff and rub i was truly disappointed	0
1	the fatigues were just what my son wanted the only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order i guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom but my son did n't want that so i had to hem about four inches on each leg other than that it was an excellent product	0
0	i purchased a ipod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside on the inside of the case they 've got some ruff edges that will damage you ipod screen if you 'd like scratches on your ipod screen then purchase this case but if you 'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then stay away from this case !	0

1	the gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties ! it takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but i believe that all gazebos have the same problem	0
1	great flats ! compact and small for those who have too many shoes already the only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time	0
1	this is such a wonderful pair of gloves they are light and easily portable they can be folded and stored in one 's pockets they have features that enable use of one 's index fingers and thumbs for fine operations such as turning minute knobs the synthetic materials comprising these gloves also make them very protective against harsh weather \( especially wind and rain \) i am now able to run outside in icy wind despite the fact that my hands freeze more easily than anyone 's elses	0
0	the upper portion of the boots which is supposed to hug your calf is ridiculously huge the shoe portion fit i have relatively normal sized calves and i was swimming in these boots i immediately returned tham	0

0	i never received this item when i was promised it so it was cancelled and my account was credited	0
1	it is perfect for my three year old to carry his toys instead of me carrying them ! ! !	0
0	the shoes look and wear great however the leather is pretty weak i think i must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter size scuff on it i will have to try to cover it up by oiling it obviously i do n't think this pair will last long at all	0
0	the trunks look great as long as you do n't get them wet because once you get them wet they become see through i guess that could be advantageous for some but i was looking for something to wear on public beaches	0
1	very nice sandal lookes great with a dress or jeans low enough to wear for hours at a time but high enough heel to make it look chic	0
1	my son loves the jersey a little pricey but a nice jerse	0
1	these work great but its important to know that these are adjustable ! it does n't say so on the box so when i first got them i thought they were way too small for adult heads and i was quite annoyed however you can adjust them once you put them on just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly	0
1	i was asked by my daughter to get these for christmas i got some for myself for my morning walks in 30c temps they do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day even when i have just gotten it done and keep my ears toasty warm great product and worth the money my daughter is equally impressed	0
1	i gave this shoes to my girlfriend and she just love them she says they are really confortable and i find them really pretty a really good buy it is	0
0	the actual bag itself was great however the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not i ordered this bag and three weeks later it came i had to go buy a bag to take on vacation kind of defeated the purpose	0

1	everything you need that your ipod did n't come with at one low price shipped promptly	0
0	while i ca n't agree with the other reviewer re the quality of the 560 jeans \( it seems excellent to me having owned six pairs over the last two years which i wear to work every day \) and certainly as men 's jeans i do n't think they 're out of style i do have to say amazon 's price on this item is far far out of line you can find these same jeans online elsewhere for 38 \( with free or cheap shipping \) meaning the cost is nearly 20 less than what amazon is charging	0
1	i purchased this dress to be the maid of honor in my best friends wedding it arrived quickly looked great and was an awesome price it would be hard to beat this great deal	0
0	these tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini however as another reviewer noted there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin i'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that i own are for my size medium 32 34 streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam but i 've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this maybe buying the next size up would work but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and i like keeping 'em close to home	0
0	nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing \? it looks good but is it 4 x 8 or 12 x 8 \? sure would be nice to know the size before i buy da trol	0
0	i returned this bra to exchange for size the day after i received it in october it is now january and i have not yet received the replacement i have called several times but to no avail ! i ca n't give a good review of this product because i have n't actually gotten to wear the bra	0

1	good quality jeans at an affordable price size is just right quite comfortable	0
0	this is an okay jacket the padding in it is okay sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal there is no liner and you will get cold riding at night overall the jacket has only 2 layers and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up	0
0	i received the trousers in a timely manner they were what i expected although they did not fit i returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company	0
1	i love this bra just the right amount of support order arrived 4 days before expected woo hoo ! !	0
1	i got and love it however someone else 's product was shipped inside the box it looked like the box came open and someone just grabbed whatever they thought came in the box the product was not mine and the owners name and phone and address on it i contacted them and sent it to them myself it was suppliments for a very serioulsy ill small boy i hope all that get things for others send it to them too ! you never know whose life depends on it	0
0	these body suits are awful ! when i first saw them i was really relieved that i had found something that would be good for the summer months i put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs ! the suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label i am so disappointed and angry it was a waste of my money	0

1	these are by far my favourite yoga pants very flattering for practically every sort of figure but more than that they 're super comfy so stretchy that they feel like a second skin and the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you 're self conscious about your belly plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your t shirt riding up and sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you 're good to go back on the street ! the biggest problem with these pants is that it 's hard to want to wear anything else i own some 4 pairs of these and love them	0

0	these slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things i 've ever put my feet into the concept is good but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger that might solve the length discomfort but there still is n't sufficient heighth comfort they felt like an all encompassing vise squeezing my feet so tightly that i had to remove them to gain relief very uncomfortable	0

0	sling is a misnomer for this gimmick think tourniquet and you 'll be closer to the reality there are several buttons and eyes on the sling to adjust the fit i tried every configuration and they all felt too tight a snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around despite the problems with the strap i like the briefs my recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap the sling technology needs more r d before it 's ready for the big time	0

1	so far i have been very satisfied with this bag for the price i really ca n't complain it has enough different sections places for pens a divider pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use i'm curious about the durability how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last i use it to hold 2 1 notebooks a textbook a portfolio a book a calculator and my pda this is about maximum capacity i should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections the handle ontop is cozy the over the shoulder strap should be wider overall i am happy with the purchase and hope that it lasts	0
0	i bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old luvable friend 's onsies are awful the biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies and the velcro does n't even stick they becomes undone and fly loose within minutes also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old lastly even the shirt tag stinks it is this cheap oversized tag that i had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son shame on them for making such a cheap product shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review !	0

0	i am vey unhappy with the sales professional in nautica outlet stores i had a very bad experience at nautica store outlet stores the customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional they basically said they do n't really care if they lose one customer other customers will still buy \( if that is the case why are prices slashed by 50 it is because people do not want to pay the full price \) i do not think i will ever buy from nautica a few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company	0

1	best sock in performance that i have ever tried i buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed no sagging no defects the only reason i toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use one of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again if they ever stopped making them i would buy a 100 pairs just to know i would have them for my liftime there i actually wrote a review on socks !	0

1	i ordered this bra as well as the olga women 's perfect fit full figure black 38ddd this bra provides much better lift support and separation than the olga i think it is because the cups are seamed i 'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature \( i'm 5'2 \) and also has a large bra size \( i'm a 36ddd \)	0
1	if you have the body to show for it by all means wear it alone	0

0	i was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra i loved the cotton one hand closures and the lack of underwires it felt and looked great when i tried it on but after a few hours of wearing it had the classic problem of riding up in the back eventually i gave up wearing it at all i bought mine in a boutique where i was professionally fitted so i had the right size \( 34f \) i 'd recommend a bravada bra for larger sizes they consistently fit great and stay put	0

1	it clearly says it is a mesh dress ! i wore this for my wedding outside in bright sunlight and it certainly did not show everything but do not expect it to be completely opaque as it is a mesh dress with delicate lining as for the quality it wore well and the frayed edges are intentional and part of the design very fairy like and pretty and i was pleased to wear it	0

1	i purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish platinum color they were so comfortable that i purchased two more pair in different colors ! the straps are very comfortable they 're elastic and not tight or constraining the shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes i can wear these shoes for both the am and pm services to church where i usually have to wear a different pair for the pm service because my feet hurt so bad ! it 's hard to find a comfortable pair of heels so when you can find them stock up on them	0

0	only the front of the bag is actually beaded and the quality poor the original price should have been 5 or fewer to be reasonable this would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory	0
1	for years i wore asics the gt the cumulus the nimbus but i have to say if you 're fan of any asics shoes named after clouds you should try the trigon 4 very similar but cheaper also they did not joke when they called it the ride it has a very smooth transition and insane cushion but a little more support than asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight a big thumbs \( toes \? \) up	0
0	this set is made of thin scratchy cheap fabric ! there is no shape to the gown awful	0
1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	0

0	i hate this bra the elastic band is not soft and rolls up as the day wears on shoulder straps are skinny inadequate only good thing is that it is low cut i prefer my 12 nursing bras purchased at wal mart i only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low cut	0
0	quality was terrible undersized or seconds later i saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1 3 of this price i would not recommend these to anyonei paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere it is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface i am disgusted with this product	0
1	this is the standard style from the new line of performance jocks from bike this waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch but very comfortable the pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps do n't twist or bind easy to launder and pretty inexpensive i got rid of my old worn out jocks and bought a few of these new ones they 're masculine modern and comfortable but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym \( like an orange or blue jock \) a good buy comes in a black version that is also great i 've worn for working out and just around town good for both	0

0	i ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product i received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame that is where the only star i am giving is coming from i am concerned with having a good supportive bra i have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years this bra is the farthest thing from supportive i had to cut the straps and re sew them to make them shorter so i could even where it the material is soft but thin and stretchy i have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and i will not again	0
0	this product never made it to destination it was purchased with pants to match \( which were pin striped and did n't \) and it was never sent to the recipient nor was i invoiced so i am currious if the seller plans to at this point or even if they intend to send the correct pants \? \? \? all i know is that with everything else being late for shipping durring the holiday and the wrong products otherwise i will not purchase from this seller again	0

0	i had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while i type they keep the office i work at at very cold temperatures these gloves seeemed perfect because many fingerless gloves do n't have fingerless thumbs but these gloves do the cost was only 2 99 for a pair of black or navy gloves i ordered the black pair well the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing there are many stray strands at the fingers they snag easily they are warm and i would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily but i did only pay 2 99 for them so i guess it 's a case of you get what you pay for	0
0	i love these shoes in fact i ordered another pair in black they are very comfortable and look cute hey ca n't beat that	1
1	i bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting by the end of my fitting my feet were throbbing red and pinched literally my pinky toe was purple i bought my true size but i still do n't think these shoes would 've been wearable even with a size larger they must just be really narrow	1
1	the jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive the elastic and threads bite into your skin if you use this one for sports you will constantly be distracted the feel of the material used is very rough against your skin esp at the waist	1
1	these socks are okay but after one wash they were covered with so much fuzz and didnt look good so the next pair i washed it with hand and dried alone to avoid the fuzz also they are too warm socks	1

1	i was happy at the appearance of the bag but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack i received it around christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell it still smells making it unable to use	1
1	a year or so ago i bought several of these on sale they are poorly sized \( i have 4xt \) far too tight for a big man like me to wear comfortably maybe you could order several sizes too big to get a good fit but unless you want everyone to see every roll of fat i 'd avoid buying these	1
0	great slippers very comfortable i love the fact that the front is open in case i just got a pedicure and the black ones are perfect because they do n't show dirt like the white ones	1
1	i almost fell for it then i realized how in the world are those pearls so cheap \? \? they are n't real ! if you are a sucker for a good deal like me think about it before you buy it it would be helpful if the item was advertised as imitation pearl thong	1
1	buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe the real shoe has an ankle strap also the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller i had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs	1
0	these thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight they are also a shiny patent material these are the pluses the one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot that is the toe piece seems a bit long i kept them because i know i will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house i also do not think that they are really worth the price yes they are tommy hilfiger but the name is all you are really paying for they are an okay shoe overall not my favorites	1
0	these shoes are beautiful and comfortable i wore them at a new year 's eve wedding danced all night with no sore feet ! this is my third pair of carlos shoes love them	1

1	you ca n't beat this shoe for comfort but they 're definately cuter in the picture i thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel did n't quite seem to fit the shoe i returned them	1
1	although very cute crocs are not good shoes they are a cheap plastic shoe that is over priced and not comfortable at all i bought a pair for my two year old daughter because of the ease to clean them and because they are non slip she did slip in them many times and the worse part is that they gave her huge terrible red blisters on the side of her feet they are the right size but i just think they are not made well do n't go for the hype they are a useless shoe	1
1	i really really didnt like this product at all i hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying very hard to keep them tied also i'm petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off the product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all	1
0	awesome handling while balling on this shoe great grip on the court and i especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet	1
0	the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80 's purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge i was blown away	1
1	i purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit i ordered 2 suits through amazon com but to my surprise the size 34 that i ordered in reallity is a size 28 which makes it very unconfortable to wear so becareful when ordering look at the manufacturer 's sizing list \( very small letters \) to find the right size by the way i had to pay to return these items because i did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart not a happy camper	1
1	i'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received but the case i received does n't cut it for the 60gb it fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them i do not recommend this product for the 60gb i suppose we zen 60gb owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players	1
0	this is my first charles by charles david shoe the material is good the size too the only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side but it after 3 days using them it was ok very nice shoe but definetly it is not a 100 dollars one if you pay less than 50 will be fair	1
0	i got it on size 32 because i usually get my pants on size 32 the bathing suit was too tight i 'll get in on size 34 next time	1
1	item was called fleese but was 80 cotton and looked felt like a regular sweat shirt to return an item to them they give you free mailing but they will deduct 5 95 off the refund for s h after calling them about this they agreed to give us a full refund but the refund will not show up until after 2 or 3 billing cycles i doubt that makes many consumers happy champion makes a fine line of products but i will never deal with them on line agai	1

1	i love all other crocs styles but was very disappointed in the prima they are too slim and look odd and stretched out on me they also tend to slip off in the back as i walk yet the other styles fit me perfectly great idea but they should have worked on it more i ca n't wear these outside the house	1
1	i never wanted to write one of these but i feel i have to i bought these boots they were great but one size too big so i tried to exchange them amazon does n't do exchanges apparently too difficult on top of this the price doubled after i bought them so now if i want the boots amazon will not honor the previous price this is something that any dime store would do but apparently one of the world 's largest online retailers could n't this is very disappointing and i would never recomend this company to anyone ever quite the opposite	1

1	i bought this for the flashlight feature you have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on also the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on the buttons on the front are cheap and do n't seem like they 'll last very long	1
0	stretchy comfortable and made well love this t shirt ! \( also its a slim fit and not really really long like many are right now more of upper hip length which is great if you want to tuck it in !	1

0	these socks are a bit on the thin side but they withstand a lot of wear	1
1	straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro they are too short i tried to add velcro but that did n't work i had to give the shoes away the strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable would not recommend if you are on the heavy side	1
0	i wrote a rave review of these the day i got them they were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug however the next time i wore them for a longer session they got stretched out my toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way i put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance they were very uncomfortable oh well the concept is great but they do n't really work unless you 're doing very little movement i wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job	1

0	this is exactly what i was looking for it 's longer and perfect for wearing on your hips feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff	1
1	i bought this dress in black good news it does flatter your postpartum shape bad news the pockets for the nursing pads do n't go where they should causing leakage worse the color black showed milk stains after i leaked definitely not worth the price how important is your figure when you 're sleeping anyway	1
0	this is a great swimsuit but if your buns are out of shape do n't buy since that is what is showing the most i think it would rate a 5 if it was n't lined like previous speedos	1
1	very cute i always get compliments but i wear them only every so often and the bottoms are all ripped up you 'd think i wear them everyday ! i'm just upset i paid over 60 for shoes that will barely last one season	1

0	this item was just what i was looking for i did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband 's ties or a tie bar it is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving	1
1	i usually wear size 7m however this shoe of size 7m is way too small i have to return it to amazon and pay the shipping fee for the return by myself i will advise anyone who is interested in this shoe to by 1 size larger than the normal size you wear	1
0	i'm a size 0 2 i ordered a size small if i ordered another pair i would probably get a medium due to dryer shrinkage they fit in every way but they are so revealing i'm barely comfortable going outside	1

1	this my first pair of 100 nylon socks the problem i have is that my feet cannot breathe in them my socks are wet after a full day wearing them i guess i 'll just have to stay with cotton i 've never had that problem before with cotton polyester socks they do stay up above my calf all day long though	1
1	i bought these for my younger than three month old son he did n't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt i ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together i do not suggest that anyone buy these	1
0	this is a very sexy pair of underwear guys if you 're new to the thong g string scene this is a good place to start i recommend g strings because there 's less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs the reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because it 's pretty expensive but go ahead and splurge on one fancy pair of underwear your girlfriend will love it mine did	1
0	i was pleased with all purchase i did not feel that i was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer in addition for reasons that are not clear to me i continue to get duplicate orders or the order is sent to an old address the return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul	1
0	i bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites my husband loved the way i looked in it i must admit i was not that sure i wanted to buy something like this online mainly because i am extremely picky with the quality of the things i buy and also because i tend to be between sizes but i ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me i am very pleased with this seller the order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition	1
1	tan color looks very synthetic cheapens look of shoe also very wide fitting	1
0	it 's nice and has yet to fall apart in 10 belly dancing classes the only thing is that every other triangle does not have coins so you are only getting half as many coins as pictured however for the price i would rather that than have it full of coins and falling apart	1
0	they are exactly what i was hoping they would be i love the contoured front pouch all the web sites i saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal i would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit my wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel i ordered 4 different pairs of unico 's and they 're all good quality and look and feel great	1

1	this item is not 100 cotton rather it is 100 polyester	1
1	very nice prints but the quality of the briefs is not good to top it one of the briefs was even damaged i guess the maker does n't have a quality control department overall a bad buy	1
1	i bought this a size smaller than i thought i needed but maybe i would be happier with it if i had bought it 2 sizes smaller i really do n't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of firm control sure it 's comfortable but i was expecting some kind of control it does smooth out some but not at all what i was expecting	1
0	i was n't expecting much based on the price so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my order the tote is a nice size made of relatively heavy fabric and seems to be well sewn i 've paid a lot more for a lot less this was a great buy	1

1	product advertised and then after paying for them they were not available tied up money for over two weeks before refund credited back bad experience	1
0	this is n't a review of this product so much as it 's a review of the impression it makes anyone who was in paris around the turn of the century will remember aubade 's lecons de seduction advertising campaign of which the image shown here for this tanga was a part each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of impression and is n't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for \? nothing has made a stronger impression on us	1
0	for me they are very difficult to put on i have to use a long shoe horn they are n't tight in fact they are so wonderfully comfortable and warm they look great if you like the ugg look i'm hoping when they loosen up they will be easier to put on the top scrunches down when i put my foot in that is why it is so hard to get them on it could be me though ! otherwise i love everything else about them van c	1

0	the new balance 991 gl \( and 991 and 990 before it \) is an outstanding shoe for running and day to day use \( even some cross training \) i have worn this family of shoes because they provide ample support wear well and are well ventilated the 991 gl carries on that tradition hopefully the 992 will be just as good	1
0	i have used this mat almost everytime i 've been outdoors i have n't seen anything like it at any department store and its much cheaper than the mats at the beachside boutiques it is an awesome value for the price	1
1	the sizes listed do not print on the invoice instead army navy uses 'codes ' when they send the wrong sizes then they blame you for not selecting the right size and want a 15 restocking fee plus return shipping	1

1	i am a bit disappointed in the quality it looked like a possible reject off the factory line there are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets you really should not expect too much you may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain	1
1	who would ever wear this monstracity \? first of all you got no color no padding no pazazz ! this shirt makes the garbage bag i wear look like a royal tunic it is also from a company called jerzees and it 's not a jersey \? what up with that \? michael jordan is probably spinning in his grave	1
0	my favorite underwear right now the pima cotton is very soft if you want an alternative to boxer briefs these are great if you are kinda between sizes round up	1
0	these are the softest most comfortable flips flops i have found in years ! you can't beat the price either	1
1	these gloves should really be called simulation leather they are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather i wouldnt feel comfortable riding a motorcycle with these if you hit the pavent with them they 'd probably just vaporize	1
0	like wearing a moccasin only with more support more supple than most driving shoes and light weight too soles wear very well as do uppers a great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in southern cal	1
0	this product is fine however it was much too baggy i'm not that skinny and i felt like the excess leg space made me look ridiculous there is nothing wrong with the short but i just wish i had bought a smaller size definitely go with the smaller size if you buy this product	1
1	why \? i do not know but be more carefully anbout it	1
1	perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe 's insert but i hated it it felt half there there was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front like those orthotic deals that come on infomercials well it did n't feel good on my tender forefoot so i sent them back on the other hand the shoe looked great i guess if you really want it shoe can go shopping for some dr scholl 's	1
1	thinking this jacket was made of fleece like material i ordered it thinking it was a good buy when i got it in the mail a week later i was soooooooooo disappointed the material is like paper potato sack material its awful like plastic i dont recommend u waste on this the jacket is stylish no doubt but the material not something u 'd actually wear so a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best	1
0	i found that these shorts do run a little bit small in size so make sure you give yourself an extra size up to make sure there is adequate room to move freely follow the care label for the first wash or two until they get broke in because the shorts are bit stiff at first due to their scotchgaurding tip make sure you wash them before you wear them i would recommend these shorts for most anyone who is looking for durability comfort and or needing a professional look in the garments they wear note if you are looking for extra pockets go the dickies cargo route these do not have any extra pockets	1

1	although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie how to lose a guy in 10 days the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust this made me look awkward and did not fit well do n't waste your money on the shipping that you will have to pay for when you return it as i did	1
1	i was going to surprise my girlfriend with a nice just because gift when i opened the package i was really disappointed the color of the item was more brown than eggplant and the quality of the fabric was like stitching shop rags together now i have to return the item because it just looks bad the problem with returning is the non refundable 7 50 to ship to me and the 5 95 i have to pay to ship it back to them i also have to take away a star for receiving the item late and having to hassle with their customer service department who could n't find my order	1

1	this carrying case was a terrible purchase the zipper broke within hours and the nintendo ds lite does n't really fit into it very well i was very disappointed my six year old used his own money to buy a g pak case which is a much better case for the nintendo ds lite	1
1	i was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991 however i had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had the shoe is hard uncomfortable and much wider than the 991 my foot slides around everywhere i recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first do n't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991	1
0	oh my gosh ! i was so excited to see this item my 15 year old and all of his buddies are big fans of napoleon dynamite and this t shirt is an exact replica of the one worn during the famous election rally dance ! i will be a hit on valentine 's day with this gift !	1

0	i have a wide relatively short foot with a high arch and have lots of problems finding high quality dress shoes that fit bostonians are the only quality shoes that fit me so i have been loyal for the last decade i ca n't find them in my area so amazon is the only channel i use to get them	1
1	this is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover the plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing the collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark a cotton cotton blend or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses	1
1	these are the absolute worst things i have ever bought serves me right for by a sandal without ever having tried it on i walked around the block from my house with them and barely made it home they hurt the bottoms of my feet so badly i may need to take an extra day off of work the part of the sandal where it might normally be flat and cushioned has sharpened plastic spikes knifing the sole of your foot take your money and throw it right into the garbage and save yourself the misery of ever having worn these so called sandals and i love adidas	1
1	oh my it enhanced my rolls instead of hide them it did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt which was very noticeable not worth the money charged for it	1
1	the material 's good but the suit runs way too small i ordered the appropriate size based on my measurements but all my wobbly bits are poking out i do n't think i could wear this out in public ! not for curvy women !	1
1	the scarf arrived with several holes in it my daughter was very dissappointed crying and wondering why santa sent this to her we ordered well in advance before christmas but the set arrived too late we were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping a few days before christmas it arrived ! it was too late to do anything amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site	1
1	beware the size is not true size fitmy small turn out to be something that fits like a large from some other brands this is not a small it 's loose fitting and it 's a straight line cut it 's really bad it 's so disappointing everything doesnt holds in places it doesnt look like the photo at all the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy and if you are a medium you need a small for this dress and it will still fit loosly on you that 's how big of a dress this is i'm returning it	1

0	i brought a pair of the beach garden clogs from cozee world the order was shipped quickly and when i realized the size was wrong they even allowe dme to exchange them for the correct size it was overall good service thanks	1
1	i found the wallet to be cheap looking and much smaller than the picture lead me to believe to call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product this is more of an insert to a wallet consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket i was n't pleased with the purchased expecting quite a bit more the 14 i spent i can go to target and get a wallet for less that what i paid for this one and it will be a full wallet not a sorry wannabe	1

0	finally ! i 've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years these enhancers are well shaped and incredibly comfortable when ordering go ahead and get the b c size even if you are an a or low b these inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up i personally recommend using a fashion forms pocket bra style 9400 or a playtex style 4300 order a cup size above what you would normally wear	1
0	i bought this bag as a gift for a lawyer friend she loves it and has told everyone about it the color allows her to express her personailty while remaining professional and the size and durability of the bag allow her to eliminate a separate purse lunchbag and carryall	1
0	the whole rubber wristband thing has gotten out of hand do your part to put it to rest by buying regular wristbands when it was all for charities before thats okay but it is ridiculous now heres the rules livestrong okay because that was the original everything else no people who wear like 5 of them probably the main reason why you 'd starting wearing the regular ones plus they 're way better and not some cheap piece of rubber that cost 2 cents to make anyways end the fad ! ! !	1
1	i must not have read the fine print ! this shirt must be a childs size it just fit then one wash and way too small how can this be considered an xl \? \? \?	1
1	the pads inside the bra fall out every time you wash it	1
1	i bought this speedo because i like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design the biggest problem is that the 1 inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses i own several speedo swimming trunks this one is the worst if the band can be improved i will rank it at least 3 stars	1
0	i love these bras so much ! they are so comfortable any other bra i wear now feels weird the only thing i noticed was the lacy edging started bubbling after about two months of washing and drying otherwise their my very favorite bras	1
1	i bought these for my mom as a gift thinking hey they 're cheap is n't all shearling good \? not so much the insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap they were very sturdy ! not so comfy they also ran about a size smaller than i ordered i'm a size 7 and the 8 's were a little small for my feet	1
1	i wore this shirt just once it 's almost transparent not worth it even if you get it for free	1

1	i ca n't say much for the shoes but amazon goofed up on this one they shipped out an empty box luckily ups caught it and sent notice to amazon for me	1
1	this order was most unsatisfactory i received the shoes with the security device attached i had to take the time and trouble to send them back to have the devices detached i have yet to receive them i would advise customers to avoid orders	1
0	this backpack is sturdy good looking very functional and at at least a third of the price of other similar backpacks i looked at i'm completely satisfied with this purchase	1
0	i like the flip case it is exactly what i wanted however the clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it	1
1	a \) the quality is not that great b \) the socks are not skid proof butits good to have 8 pairs because somehow the curse of missing socks will hit babies socks too sometimes they pull them off while takig a walk at restaraunts friends' homes and sometimes the dryer eats them	1
1	the top was very roughly finished the end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place because the seams on it were very rough so i had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be the top got completely ruined on the first wash i followed the instructions to a t during washing but still the blue on the top ran and i had to throw it away the skirt is still fine after washing it twice but i would not recommend this outfit to anybody	1
0	i love these shoes and so does everyone who sees me in them i am the envy of the girls at work	1
1	i bought this dress for a trip i'm taking in one week should 've known better you get what you pay for that 's for sure this dress arrived balled up in a usps bag it did n't look anything like the picture shown on this site more like a slip than a slip dress and here 's the kicker it was ripped ! had two large snags on the back of the dress i'm sending it back and they better not try to charge me shipping i'm po 'd to the max and who knows if i 'll find a dress in time grrrr	1
1	if you see the description made in italy be careful ! they are made in india i have written to amazon to let them change but if you still see made in italy be careful ! everybody knows the difference	1
0	these are comfortable slippers that with composite soles can take you out on the deck to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so they 're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet breath a little fresh air nice value for the price	1
0	i have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful	1
1	we have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where i work but he is n't nearly as menacing as this sucker ! in fact 's he 's kinda friendly this guy 's a beast blood red eyes sharp claws looks like he 'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom no ordinary broom neccesary here friends no what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick buy this guy set him in the windows of a dark room and call the cops god knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games would get more stars but he 's damn expensive	1
0	love these boxers i stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own love the fabric and the cut not too long not too short and just the right amount of butt room	1
1	i always buy the same size and type of overalls and this is the first time ordering this pair from dickies they are very stiff and tight fitting they should have actually been baggy on me being the size that they were	1
1	this was a nightmare order i paid extra for expedited shipping to assure christmas arrival package tracking log revealed that the shoes were not even shipped until after christmas disgraceful and unforgivable to have to tell my 7 yr old grandson that his gift did n't make it the shipping cost as much as the shoes and this company should be ashamed they are also impossible to reach amazon could n't even get them on phone thank goodness the shoes fit i ca n't begin to imagine what a return would have been like the product is great	1
0	these socks are absolutely the best i take pilates classes and if it is hot your feet can slip off the mat \( not good in the middle of a side plank ! \) anyway these socks keep your feet planted and dry one note make sure not to order them big the idea is that they should be snug	1
1	paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon this store never again	1
1	the actual bag itself was great however the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not i ordered this bag and three weeks later it came i had to go buy a bag to take on vacation kind of defeated the purpose	1
1	just too small for wat i needed it for had to went and get something else bigger to use	1
1	these shoes look great but are horrible running shoes the soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact i do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes they may be a good walking or all purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them i returned them and plan to try something else	1
0	the socks were nice but cost too much price a little unreasonable	1
1	these socks are advertised as seamless toe socks they are very thin and they do have a very uncomfortable seam in the toe not only does the seam press into the toe but you can feel the inner seam of the shoe itself terrible product	1
0	my husband refused to wear slippers and it was driving me nuts that he walked barefoot all the time he said he could never find slippers that were comfortable enough since the red sox are his favorite team and the reviews were so good on these particular reebok slippers i thought it was win win all around so i bought them as part of his valentine 's gifts needless to say they were a big hit he loves them ! they are comfortable modern looking and the red soz logo made his day i would buy these for any sports lover with their favorite team logo on them	1
0	since these jeans were ordered as a gift for someonelse i cannot give my own opinion of the jeans other than to say i received the jeans in a timely manner and that the size and color was exactly what i had ordered	1
1	this shoe is cut right underneath the ankle everytime you walk the edge of the shoe rubs into your ankle and causes extreme discomfort and blisters	1
0	these are so great and keep my baby 's feet warm she even slept with them on with no problem she 's been a master at getting her socks off up until now they also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails she 's chewing on the toes but i have n't seen any scuff marks yet so they are holding up very well	1

0	i bought these just a couple of months ago but i 've already put them to the test i went hiking to a waterfall in mexico i ended up covered in mud my new shoes included i was worried they would be spoiled \( it really was a lot of mud \) then i just washed them with running water and all the dirt was gone besides being really comfortable it 's great to know that you can use them in all types of terrain and they will do the job	1
1	they were not as heavy weight as stated to me they seem more like a regular t shirt and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm after first washing they really shrink i will not buy any more	1
1	please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop i received with battery problems it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it you have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner the suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all	1
0	it is exactly what i was looking for i had no problems ordering or receiving it i got to my house quickly nothing is wrong with it	1
1	i am sorry but i did not like it nor will i wear it as it is too big looks funny on me i wish i had not have gotten it	1
1	even for only 12 these were n't worth the money they came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine or some other noxious chemical and now at least 2 months since i have received them the smell has not dissipated they are extremely stiff so even if they did n't reek i still would n't wear them b c my feet would be in tatters by mid day i guess that 's what i get for buying cheap shoes	1
1	these booties are very cute and soft but they just slip right off my son 's feet they do not have a way to secure the 'tongue' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet the 'tongue' part just pulls right out not a good value for the money	1
1	this shoe is very comfortable unfortunately i had to send it back to the manufacturer twice the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are i am very dissapointed as i have come to expect quality from merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks i would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping	1
0	i do roofing work work outside on the hotest days i had problems with heat rash jock itch my boss suggested i wear loose fitting all cotton boxers like most of the crew i asked around picked up some hanes all cotton boxes wow what a difference they feel great no binding when i work the cotton does give a bit as you wear them now they are the only underwear i will wear they do shrink a bit after washing so do get a size up	1

0	the megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes it has a nice feel to it the bathrobe is made of japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of 100 cotton cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable i purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected overall i am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if i had the choice to do so	1
0	highly recommend shoe but you might need a larger size than usual i wear easy spirit 7 1 2 w but found this shoe too snug in both width and length and had to return	1
1	the shirt is of ok quality but the design is hard to see and will probaby wash off quickly be sure to order a size bigger than you normally would as it is cut small also my personal opinion is the shipping charge for this very light item is a little excessive	1
1	i recently purchase ''better bottom padded panties' l was really disappointed like most women i always wish i had a bigger and more curvy bottom but was really disappointed when it arrived the padding was made of cheap foam material and it was very visible under clothing even denim ladies please dont waste your money iam really gutted because i bought some new trosers and i was hoping to wear the padded panties underneath it	1
1	judging from the picture i thought this thing looked like a turban ! it actually has no wrapped fabric but is a firmly fitting cap hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap aside from this the coloring is too bold old glory will select random coloration for each customer but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture ! i do n't see how i can wear it without attracting stares	1

1	this is not a jockstrap it is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity i tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable let alone not exactly hygenic ! no surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by rips	1
0	i bought this product online about a week ago and it is exactly as described and to the reviewer who backpacks if your that hardcore of a backpacker you might want to consider spending more than 6 on a fanny pack seriously lighten up and review the product not tell your life story	1

1	one of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other genius ! not the result the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other grrr one more thing only the screen is protected by a clear plastic the wheel is not	1

1	i was so happy when i found these shoes they are cute and comfortable exactly what i was looking for but after about two weeks of wearing them always with socks or pantyhose they started to smell terrible i do n't have this problem with any of my other shoes this was so disappointing i will either try to return them or just trash them	1
0	having sampled 100 cotton pinpoint shirts both on line and from the stores themselves my husband keeps returning to his favorite the land 's end pinpoint without a doubt the quality is unsurpassed and its longevity is legendary ! now when its time for new shirts we do n't think twice and go directly to land 's end and order they also have the widest color selection and each color is true to its picture and flattering to all	1

0	i have started water walking in the fitness center pool and found i was slipping enough to bother me this shoe fits like a glove and is very inexpensive to use i would recommend it to anyone desiring to use it for this purpose or any other water related activity i am certain it would be great at the beach etc	1
1	first of all they look cheaper than i thought they would look but the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the top of my foot in other words the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot and caused blisters i am hoping that if i keep trying to wear them the leather will soften up and become easier to wear	1
1	i only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute other than that they were quite unusable i usually wear a size 7 but i could not even get my foot into these shoes and they are quite hard had to get rid of them	1

1	i had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions i wear they are my son 's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room he 's only 6 and when i had trained him i tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear in my personal thoughts are that men 's boy 's underwear has a fly in the front for need use unlike that for women and girls whom do n't require it	1
1	the jacket is cut undersized typical of foreign makes with poor quality control the lining in the sleeve keeps coming ot at the wrist which interferes with activity exterior shell has nice feel but overall a poor piece of work	1
1	we were disappointed when we received this because it showed up in a search with silk robes and pajamas and i guess i assumed tht it was silk rather stiff and uncomfortable	1
0	these boots are a little bit on the snowboarder side of things as far as the way they look the fit is right on and they are very warm and dry i love them ! they are very easy to just pull on and tuck your jeans into highly recommended	1
0	i bought two of these as a gift for my husband he 'd previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed these were ready to go right out of the box no assembly required took up less space in his closet than the 3 4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from the cushioned tie hooks ensure the ties will not slip off and also that they will not be damaged a breeze to organize his vast tie collection and he 's loving this product	1
0	very comfortable and feel no one makes it like under armour	1

0	so glad i did n't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them this wallet is slimline and holds all my cards it 's been 6 months since i wrote this review and i only become more satisfied with this wallet all my cards are easily accessed viewed and i know immediately if one is missing the leather is silky soft and durable people have been asking where i found this item i think it 's the best i 've ever purchased	1
0	i purchased this robe for my boyfriend as a christmas gift and i wish i would have purchased one for myself as well ! this robe is made of the softest warmest materials but is extremely light weight unlike most robes luxurious is the perfect adjective	1

0	before this bra i would have to wear an underwire bra and a sports bra on top to minimize bounce my cup size is f so it 's been difficult to find a sports bra that i can wear standalone well folks i found it this is the bra ! ! i wore it while doing turbo jam today and it was amazing ! it did better than the two bra combination ever did if you 're looking for a sports bra that actually works this is the one	1
1	size 9 5 fit like it was an 8 i wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in and was unable to walk in them at all without pain i 've bought steve madden before many times and know they run slightly small but this pair was ridiculously small and i suspect perhaps mis labeled	1

0	it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length ya who am	1
0	this brown leather wallet does not have a highly glossy finish as shown in the image leather is well stitched but thin old fashioned style with no credit card slots snaps and zipper handle add bulk to profile not a front pocket wallet for sure purchased two as gifts for nephews will probably get one for myself	1
0	all my gold toe socks are excellent but these offer extra room and are extremely comfortable especially after the first washing i am about to buy another pair ! the trellis style is the other wonderful gold toe sock for comfort	1
0	see my review for the desert digital i own both the woodland and the desert bdu 's	1
1	tommy what were you thinking \? although they are lovely to look at they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe bar none the shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk i even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem i was wrong take this design back to the drawing board and start again	1
1	good socks nice material but on the second day of using them one sock had a tiny hole in it they are knee high and stay up provide good warmth in the cold weather	1
1	i wear boxers but boxer brifes look sexer so every one start wear boxer brifes that way you wont get pantsed or get a wegie	1
0	i love these running shoes they have a great look and they feel great too they fit my feet perfectly	1

1	i purchased this as a gift for a teenager she told me that it is difficult to zip as the fabric gets stuck in the zipper it is being returned	1
0	these socks are just what i was looking for a thin cotton blend to wear running no bunching and they breath very well the price and timliness of the order was also great	1
1	i give the order processing an a due to receiving the product within three days the bag on the other had leaves a bit to be desired while the material used is soft the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand	1
1	they were not as heavy weight as stated to me they seem more like a regular t shirt and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm after first washing they really shrink i will not buy any more	1
1	i purchased a bag from this vendor thinking that by being affiliated with amazon that they were legit i got the bag and thought it looked fake the vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique the boutique confirmed that it was not authentic so i am returning the bag i got from moda party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney unauthentic bag	1
1	after seeing the photo and reading the other reviews i thought this would be a good buy i'm not really thrilled about this jacket it 's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker it does n't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel this is something you can easily find at walmart on sale for 9 99	1
0	great pants i bought these in a variety of colors and i am very satisfied	1
1	i received an email from txshirts stated that i should direct all inquiries to csr txshirts com i did this on two occasions and received no reply customer service finally contacted me only to ask why i had left negative feedback on amazon they stated they never received any email from me their gym shorts were not as described the description said covered elastic waistband instead i received an uncovered elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin their response \? i should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back but who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised \? \?	1
1	i was disappointed when i got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin i emailed the company i bought them from and requested an exchange return many times they never responded and i ended up keeping the shoes as i needed them for work i would not purchase from this company again	1
1	as much as seller might like this backpack to be 11 by 8 5 by 6 5 the one i 've got is surely not that big \( 10 x8 x4 at best ! \) and as a result of this it is totally unsuitable for me since notebooks would absolutely not fit into it \( and judging by the size the seller decided to advertise was it what they were aiming for \? \) the material is ok so is the craftsmanship but the fact that they lied \( yes ! l i e d ! \) about the size just completely spoils the whole deal a great dissapointment ! ! !	1
0	i 'll start with my stats i'm a size 8 5'2 and i carry my weight in my rear and thighs \( all extra 20 pounds of it \) this skirt is lovely it hides what should never be seen \( refer to the 20 pounds above \) and helps create a slimming line i 've worn it with silk blouses stockings and high heels and i 've worn it with slouchy sweaters tights and chunky mary janes it works perfectly with both	1
1	i would not buy this product again it hurts my heeles badly because it is so narrow at that end	1

1	returns and exchanges are very slow process has taken a month so far	1
1	i have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats i'm very disappointed this is supposed to be a reversible coat however the hem of the black side is too long consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed and it does not look good at all the company needs to revise this pattern	1
1	i ordered a 7 5 m which is what i always wear in a shoe i could n't even get my foot into the shoe i can tell you that it was way too narrow i do n't know about the length because my foot would n't go in i had to return them i would n't buy another pair of daniel green 's until i knew for sure how the sizes really run 0 stars	1

1	this is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal but the mistake goes more long because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole	1
0	these shoes are the best ! i like the removable wheel ! you could heel to schooland when you got there you could take your wheels out so nobody will know that you have them on ! you will be heeling across the floor in no time if you keep practicing on them ! it took me a while to get the hang of these shoes ! you should be absolutely satisfied when you try out these shoes ! they are the only shoes with removable wheels in the heels !	1
1	i would n't order from andrew christion again ! i ordered three shirts more than a month ago they sent only two and never responded to my emails ! where 's my shirt ! ! \?	1
1	a sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise but this one does n't also the construction leaves something to be desired it 's very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks where the seams are sewn i bought two after trying them several times i gave up and sent them to charity do n't bother	1
0	this is a fabulous find ! my husband loves henley shirts but they have to be just the right fabric weight and sleeve length after many failed attempts i finally found the perfect shirt great look great feel and most importantly my husband likes it too	1
0	these are very cute and they fit great i wear them all the time	1
1	while i was a little wary of ordering a jacket for 20 online i went ahead and ordered this one it seemed like it was made of durable material and looked snazzy when it came in the mail today it was stuffed in a first class envelope with another t shirt which i really like ! i was anxious to see what it was like this jacket is literally made of the material used for fedex envelopes sounds cool huh \? the jacket is extremely thin and feels like you 're wearing a paper bag while i appreciate the prompt service of the people at andrew christian they will probably see my jacket returned within the next couple of weeks	1
1	i love the cotton color just the right shade for most beige and some white slacks the show style it the most unconfortable of any clark shoe i have have there is something strange about the left shoe it give me a blister everytime i wear it	1
0	this boonie hat is collapsible yet has a firm rim chin strap is attached to keep it where it belongs in high winds this is the hat that will conceal you in the woods but gets noticed about town the digital pattern is impressive can often times is a conversation piece i wear it almost every day and it 's my favorite piece of headgear	1
1	i 've bought the predator absolion trxfg before and it is a great shoe however in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper and the pair i received yesterday \( blue with red and silver \) is synthetic make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price you receive a leather shoe ! you are not saving 50 if it 's synthetic	1
1	these underpants are too bulky and puffy my daughter was very uncomfortable wearing them	1
0	this merchant really delivers with this item in the stores this is almost twice the price i really was n't expecting such quality from this item \( yes it 's crushed velvet so not warm but warm was n't the goal \) would definitely recommend this item and may buy another color for myself	1

1	i got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance thickness etc however it has been only two months and several of my three year olds' socks now have holes in the toes the heels and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places my 8 month olds' socks are fine however he does n't give them the wear of a three year old so if you have a baby these socks are great ! if you have a preschooler very poor choice	1
0	i pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running i not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but i ran two half marathons and the nyc marathon with this exact sneaker when they became worn from the wear and tear \? i bought another pair exact one these sneakers lasted me half a training season plus the marathon not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles i highly recommend them and the color is fun too	1

1	i purchased the crocs butter thinking it would be something special just for crocs shoes as soon as i opened the package i noticed the crocs butter is just like any other shoe buffer cleaner with the black sponge i already own two shoe buffers one of which i received free with purchase from a local shoe store needless to say i returned the crocs butter since it 's not worth 4 95 plus 10 shipping which i was not refunded what a crock	1

0	i use these socks for running and they are very well cushioned and comfortable they also withstand frequent laundry without loosing quality	1
1	i bought 2 sleepers sleeper had holes in the arm pit area and the other sleeper had a whole where the neck trim should of been sewed on a real waste of my money	1
1	the bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all but either i have a big head or something becuase it does n't cover my ears all the way as for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine so i guess if you have a big head do n't get it becuase it will not cover your ears	1
1	i was so excited to find these they seemed the perfect combination of elegance and comfort they look weird they went straight back and after paying shipping and return shipping i practically have to pay them to take it back	1
1	i purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because i have a hard time walking in really high heels they are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap does n't hold my foot firmly in the shoe when i walked around in them i could feel them flopping also anytime i raised my foot \( to simulate my fiance taking off the garter \) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe so just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe for the price this is not worth the buy	1
0	quality product exactly what i wanted but it runs large i wear a half size bought the size larger now think i 'll buy the smaller size	1

0	we are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season unfortunately the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from amazon after sending 4 emails we do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching we have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company but we can not get anyone to respond we will never order anything through amazon again	1

0	my baby is large for her age and wears 6 9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old i ordered two of these hats sized 6 12 months they are way too big for my baby but will probably fit her when she is actually 6 months hats are made of t shirt fabric and look just like the picture you do have to tie your own knot on the top andrew christian sent each hat in a separate envelope and they arrived on different days but within the shipping time specified	1
0	birkenstock clogs are the comfiest shoes during a recent trip to washington dc i was the only person in my group whose feet did n't hurt after several hours of walking i have had several pairs over the years they last forever and go with tons of different outfits	1
1	they 're pretty but flimsy very light construction the lens is not really mirrored so if you attempting to hide your eyes forget it it would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap chinese knock off gave them two stars simply because they are good looking but cheap and they feel that way on your face	1

0	the robe is very warm and heavy perfect for cold mornings and the just out of the shower chills that you get it doesnt quite have the luxurious feel of a spa robe and the thread loops are matted in certain areas but quality wise it is better than anything else i 've seen for similar prices the length is much shorter than pictured i bought this for my boyfriend who is 6 ft 190 lbs average build and it comes just above his knee ! all in all it 's a decent robe for the price and he likes it	1

1	my review appears to be inconsistent with the others weeks after i received my jacket i had to take it to a seamstress to have stitching repaired in several places this is not following heavy use but wearing the jacket one or two days a week walking to my car and from the car to the office in addition the metal snaps should be replaced with buttons for a better look when considering the cost of the jacket shipping and repairs i should have to gone to macys and purchased a nicer jacket	1

0	i just got these and love them my only complaint is that they pinch are a little narrow even though i do n't have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes the dark red color is a little deeper than the picture but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer if you 're gonna buy red shoes or any other colors available these are a great choice	1
0	of all men 's silk pjs that i purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best the fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well after reading other customers' reviews i purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size m and occasionally l it turned out too small i would recommend going one size up	1
0	these were nice lightweight budget jazz shoes however they do not fit the same as street shoes despite what the description says my daughter wears a 2 5 in street shoes and i ordered her a 4 in the jazz bootie thinking there would be plenty of room for growth wrong ! i have to return them and get her at least a 5 or maybe a 5 5 beware	1
0	i love this shoe ! it 's a perfect heel height classic pointed toe comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot perfectly proportioned with all day comfort if i win lotto i plan to order every color with spares in case it 's ever discontinued the natural leather is lovely but scuffs easily i strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap oil to give it a bit of durability highly recommended even for wider feet !	1
0	i bought a pair of these in tortoise and really love them ! they fit great they arrived in great condition and very quickly the rhinestones are really blingy in the sun ! i am buying a pair in black for my best friend who is in love with them also very cute for the price	1
0	i love the look even my friends complement it and the wedges are so light ! but you got to stick to your size i could n't find size 8 5 so i bought size 9 instead which was a big mistake	1
1	i realize anyone admitting to wearing a 3x is in trouble in the conservation of fabric but this manutacturer must be very generous the garment was so large i could have made two out of the one unit this certainly was an error in sizing or i am smaller than i thought i hesitate to purchase from this retailer because i can not trust their product sizes and sending stuff is expensive and a hassle	1
0	we bought this for our 13 month old for christmas and she loves it it is extremely soft her favorite part is the cell phone that rings the compact also squeaks i love that it is all soft so that she cannot hurt herself with it this is a perfect gift for a 1 year old girl	1
1	like a permanent wedgie these kept riding up my crack i do n't recommend these at all the liquid metallic look is only useful if you 're going to be a male stripper otherwise you 've got liquid metal up your crack not very appealing	1
0	this is an excellent bra in addition to being sexy it is also quite functional it defines one 's individual breast shape well and it offers maximum support this particular bra comes in a pretty peach color and a beautiful black chantelle bras are made according to french standards you get a somewhat larger cup and the band size is not as long still it 's an excellent bra	1
0	mom was looking for a similar item from bass i told her this brand was very reliable she can put them down	1
1	do not waist your money on this item ! it looks so unnatural the padding is only on the side of the butt cheeks doesnt cover the whole butt so you can definitly detect the padding i was so disapointed when i tried it on	1
1	amazon did n't tell any outright lies about this product but they certainly were n't what i expected i was expecting something a bit more durable the first night i tried to sleep in these they ripped in the back the immitation satin is so thin that it can barely hold itself together but i ca n't give them 1 star because they are just as cute as they look !	1
1	i purchased these ear buds to replace those that came with my 80gb ipod expecting them to at least be comfortable i ca n't judge if they are more comfortable or not because they wo n't stay in my ears long enough to decide even when i'm sitting still on the sofa they fall out none of the sizes work for me ! ! ! if falling out of my ear is n't bad enough the sound is not even half as good as that produced by the stock ear buds very disappointed !	1

0	whoever said the 80 's are making a comeback was n't lying ! i love american apparel clothing especially this deep v neck shirt just know that it really is deep ! i'm only in my twenties but i almost feel like an older man when i wear this shirt cut lower than other v necks your chest hair is bound to hang out ! if your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it ca n't get any more comfortable than it already is ! honestly i probably wo n't wear it anywhere other than the gym and home but i still love it	1
1	this is a beautiful sandal but the shoe was made from really stiff and ungiving material the footbed was uncomfortable and not a good fit or feel to it the price is right but there are so many sandals with gemstones to choose from i decided to return these sandals	1

1	i received this item as a gift and was disappointed when i pulled it out of the box it 's okay but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem the beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo but are rather cheap looking it looks like something i could make myself very cheap and plain looking	1

0	awesome shoes not necessarily worth the outlandish cost but 4 stars nonetheless i 'd recommend them to anyone who takes running seriously and who likes to look even cooler when doing it	1
0	this shoe is great it even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design the only thing that i felt it lacked was extra comfort i wear skechers and have done so for years and i have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet it was a great deal that i just could n't pass up and definitely worth the price	1
0	this is a great and comfortable bra and it works for me it 's a minimizer and is great for larger sizes i exercise a lot and it provides great support even good enough for running on the treadmill i have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years i am so impressed with them that i looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more and it is half of what i paid in the mall now it is all i wear for everyday \)	1

1	save yourself the trouble and get the braided \( 3 line \) latex hose type of clothesline want suction cups rings snap hooks etc \? buy them for pennies at a drug store the problem with this clothesline is that you ca n't make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines they slide down to the lowest point in the middle the only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they 'll dry is with a braided line period	1
1	i have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away the shoes look cheap not typical of the nine west brand i would not purchase this item again i thought i was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work	1

1	i will be returning this item to the vendor i rec 'd this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery instead i find the word baske in a mirrored embroidered image not sure what baske stands for i guess it 's their idea of 'short for basketball' whatever ! you ca n't see the pic clearly i'm out the shipping cost on this one what a bummer !	1
0	i was shocked to see how high the heel was and being in my 40s i was n't sure if i wanted to find out how they felt but i had a company dinner party and wore them and was surprised at how walkable and comfortable they were i have worn them several times since then	1

1	this was my second time ordering a dickies jacket and being disappointed i will not do it again the zipper gets stuck on a flap of material almost everytime i zip or unzip it i contacted andrew christian over ninety days ago by e mail and i was ignored today i decided to send him a message through amazon and found out it was to late i thought that the time limit was 180 days i like everything else about the jacket but this problem has cost me a lot of time and frustration there must be a better brand for my money somewhere out there	1
0	the price for the slippers was average no big discount but they arrived at my front door in time for christmas that was a big plus and my daughter loved them	1
0	these are perfect for low rise pants the cut will likely be flattering for any guy the front pouch design allows for maximum comfort and moveability and i find the fit in the back to be basically great an essential for those whose jeans hang low	1

1	these were a gift at christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much !	1

0	the robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well ! the color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful	1
0	this is an amazing product i bought one of these along with another swaddle product that did not have the sleepsack feature believe me there is no comparison not only is the halo product made better and is more durable and holds the baby better but it is a 2 in 1 so that you can use it as a sleepsack by itself too i trust this company because the product is recommended by the sids society i do n't have to worry that my baby is going to wriggle out of the swaddle because he is so secure in it	1
1	i was so disappointed in this product i bought the ad hook line and sinker thinking that the memory foam was a great idea that it would give me bilateral plantar fascitis suffering feet some long awaited relief after about 2 hrs of wear the foam is completely flat which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard save your money ! these are awful	1
0	i love these shoes i bought 3 colors and they are great ! they are very stylish and comfortable and that is hard to find in a dress shoe	1
0	i find this a very comfortable bra for women of larger sizes	1

0	this is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you 're looking for a slightly wider toe box it looks great with a skirt or slacks my only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable and kindest to my feet i ca n't find my size \( 6 5 w \) in navy i have the shoe in black if anyone from naturalizer is reading this message how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available	1

0	the item is much better than any others that i have got through out the years it should last a long time not rip easy it feels very sturdy i think it is real good	1
1	i was very disappointed with this bra i would definately not recommend it if you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the maternelle bra instead this bra looks sexy but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra \( at least not for a size 38dd \)	1

1	i bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old luvable friend 's onsies are awful the biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies and the velcro does n't even stick they becomes undone and fly loose within minutes also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old lastly even the shirt tag stinks it is this cheap oversized tag that i had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son shame on them for making such a cheap product shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review !	1

1	maybe i'm naive but i never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase they are spring loaded and they turn a certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out i got one out by sheer accident but that is it and there are no directions included so i'm back to a keyring and that 's not so bad	1
0	great fit lightweight these are very snug and allow for maximum mobility for quicker players who do a lot of cutting and fast movement support strap is not too tight which is good and actually serves a purpose	1
0	i absolutely love this case ! the cool thing about it is that it does n't look like a regular laptop case \( i e the bulky usually black boring case \) my best friend did n't even know it was a laptop case and fell in love with the bag itself ! it makes a great gift for any soon to be college student	1
1	first time i 've ordered a product from leg avenue and it 'll probably be my last ! i opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 runs in one of the legs before i even tried them on what a waste of money and if i would pay to ship them back for another pair then i 've already put way too much money into what should be an inexpensive product	1

1	in theory this boot seemed perfect added some height came in perfectly wearable colors was made of real leather the price was unbeatable but \( yes unfortunately a big but \) like everything else which seems perfect it was perfectly flawed i did my research read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual but still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet totally crushing my veins i'm a big shoe collector and i can recognize a design error when i see one surprisingly that it came from this brand usually so quality reliable these boots are not meant for walking if you want to take a pretty picture in them they might fulfill that purpose	1
1	i too have been searching for the panty in the picture i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg there should only be a 1 2 inch of fabric but there is more like 3 inches yuk ! bhas anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured \? \( the ones that we all seem to love and want \) \? please email me personally if u have found them ! sheemna yahoo co	1
0	this bra is the best nursing bra i have found it is very supportive and comfortable i like that it gives you the same support as an underwire bra but without the hard wire digging into you it holds up very well in the wash i would definitly recommend this bra to anyone that has a hard time finding bras to fit them	1

0	these are the only semi affordable bikini briefs i 've found that are actually designed with a pouch making them the most comfortable on the market \( of all the brands i 've tried that is \) unfortunately they 're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets and you 'll probably have to purchase them from an amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges but what can i say i guess it 's worth it the briefs also run about a size small i have a 31 waist but the mediums are too small	1

1	with a title like 'swirl skirt ' you 'd expect the fabric to be able to well swirl but the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable plus the cut \( of the size 12 at least \) was awkward giving my tummy a bubble that was n't even there and the last thing i want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is so i do n't recommed this item	1

0	it 's a very durable bag i run trails a lot and i was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season durable as well as comfortable and cheap so i do n't have to worry about ripping it the straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders the part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills and if you need it for books the padding will keep the books from poking your back i would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though i expect i will tear it to shreds eventually but for the price it 's worth it	1
1	i do n't own this gear bag and i'm not going to buy it even though it looks interesting would this be a suitable carry on bag or would i have to check it \? i do n't know the dimensions are not given anywhere i want to know more about the products i order	1

0	having looked extensively for a casual parka that works well with jeans i finally found this one i ordered on line and then received a phone call from the company supplying this product through amazon verifying that the size i ordered was correct the person i spoke with was very friendly and helpful she helped me decide that i needed a larger size and i'm very glad because when the parka arrived it was the perfect size i love all the pockets it has just enough lining to be warm yet comfortable and best of all it looks great with jeans and other casual clothing the outer shell is also very soft	1

1	this robe virtually fell apart when i washed it it stained the inside of my washing machine it raveled before i even got a chance to wear it do not buy this product i got the burgandy one i am so disappointed by this product i may stop shopping at amazon	1
0	well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got and i was not to be disappointed they are really awesome ! ! they are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play i even wear them to office sometimes \) though after wearing them for a long stretch of time i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star but they are worth every single penny i spent on them if you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too look no furthe	1
1	this bra was a terrible waste of money the wire on one side stabs me constantly the other side is fine it 's obviously defective	1
0	this is the absolute best sport bra made i have been running 5 miles or more 5 times a week for over 20 years and once i discovered this particular model i have never switched back the champion also lasts wash after wash without losing it 's shape unfortunately these great bras never seem to go on sale	1
0	i couldnt resist these shoes for the price i 've had good experience with bandolino branded shoes i have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable sure enough this pair of boots are very comfortable too ! the color is a great burnished bronze that is a great neutral color to wear \( plus metallics are in fashion again \) the zip up is easy and the calf is roomy i'm very happy with them and would recommend them to anyone who does n't want to spend 100 's of dollars but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes	1
1	i had to return it immediately when i opened the box on the picture it looks more blue than purple	1
1	ordered large got youth large too small threw out receipt before checking my bad wife now wears t shirt to work out in	1
0	what a great pair of pajamas these are so soft non binding roomy and great for lounging i 've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays very good quality silk well sewn and tailored i'm normally an xl tall but the regular xl fit fine	1
0	the fit is great sexy slim look and feel slight stretch to add to comfort and hugging feel of the denim got lots of compliments	1
1	it is a comfortable little t shirt dress for 9 bucks be careful because the sizes run small if you get it buy a size larger than you normally would	1
1	the foam padding does not have enough consistancy it stays compressed with in a short period of time not recommended	1
1	this shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining the people who like it must be quite thin indeed it does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it does n't breathe very well either i am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me for the price you can do better even at someplace like target	1
1	if you are a weightlifter or bodybuilder the yoke piping will cut into your lats and pecs unless you buy a larger size than usual this restrictive band makes the jacket rather uncomfortable the velcro isn't quite right either the material itself is nice to the touch but the design is flawed wasn't worth even the sale price	1
1	got to be the toughest piece of leather a cow has ever produced ! i 've literally never had a pair of boots that need this much breaking in and i own lots of boots makes me not even want to to wear them	1
1	the advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving because it does n't properly show it from what i saw on the amazon site i thought the wallet will be much bigger amazon does n't give measurements of the product and there are not enough pictures of the it basicly it is n't worth it to buy a product if i'm not sure of how it looks like now i have a wallet that my husband does not want and i can do nothing with it i feel that i wasted 25 00	1
0	good color visibility nicely structured with warmth applicable to the unspeakable and inhuman frigidites of the amerikan north the hat fits snugly and will evoke a positive commentary now and again i have ordered maroon but will likely add some other color choice as the array is rather impressive for an 100 acrylic knit this is not a bad hat the only problem perhaps being that it sucks up hairs very easily almost as if it were a hair vacuum machine	1
1	nice stretchy material but too short and i'm usually a 16 18 the g string is not even close to plus size do n't even bother	1
1	very disappointing this product has less control than an average pair of pantyhose the high waist was always rolling down i was n't expecting miracles i just wanted to smooth out my silouette while i lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight this product was completely useless product has a clever name but that 's it i really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item look elsewhere	1
0	was shipped very promptly not the largest man 's umbrella but well designed looks like someone really studied how umbrellas can wreck themselves by blowing inside out so that this one wo n't	1
0	great product just what i was looking for service was excellent and shipping was prompt thank you thank you thank you	1
0	these shorts look like normal hiking or outdoor shorts but underneath they have a snug lycra lining and padding where you need it the construction is very sturdy and the pockets are a great bonus i loved the first pair so much that i bought a second pair	1
1	this hat is not suitable for a small child it is way too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff if i had been there when it arrived i would have sent it back	1

1	this is a beautiful dress but it would not fit me or most people i know 36 bust 33 waist and 41 hip \? fat fat fat ! what about us tall slim people	1
1	these underwear were supposed to be size 34 but i could barely shimmy them up over my legs the fit was so tight that i could not wear them even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine they are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs if you must try these buy them at least 2 sizes larger but you would do better with another product	1
0	the zipper pulls are somewhat ill suited for the job the only way i found to be able to zip the boots up quickly easily and snuggly was to replace the zipper pull with a key chain	1
0	these trunks are great the pouch in the front works great in keeping everything together and comfortable i drive alot and these are by far the best underwear i have ever had just be sure to order one size larger than you usually wear otherwise they will be skin tight \( unless you want that \)	1
1	while this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival it does not function to transmit the ipod via fm frequency it can hook to the ipod cradle the iopd and charge the ipod but it does not transmit the product was made in china but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return while i could probably process back through amazon and the seller it is not worth my effort all in all a complete loss of cost and shipping for this product	1
0	great jacket excellent feel only qualms are the quality of the zipper and the big bright label on the inside of the jacket 5 stars for the leather itself soft and very comfortable change the zipper so that it doesnt jam on the way up 99 of the time and make the label much more subtle and this would be an awesome jacket ! also sad but not surprised to see this is made in chin	1
1	even though i favor leather every once in a while a pleather product comes along that i really appreciate well these boots sadly are not in that category the pleather started cracking after i wore the boots x3 the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling the sad part is that for the amount of money that i spend on these boots i could have bought a pair of leather ones after x mas	1
1	bag was well made but too small ca n't put much in it nice well made leather bag if it was three times bigger it would be a perfect	1
1	the pants that i ordered for my size were very small they were n't true to size at all i would not recommend this item to anyone	1

0	i got this handbag for my 14th birthday and i looove it so much ! ! it is so perfect the best chanel handbag there is everyone that saw my new handbag loved it and asked where i bought i actually bought it at nordstrom everyone should have one ! ! buy it	1
1	this bag is much smaller then i was expecting the zippers do not open shut easily i was very disapointed	1
0	the wand is sturdy full sized and nicely designed even if made of plastic the kids wanted their wands so they could play harry potter so this was much more appropriate than the beautiful but more fragile and very expensive collectors versions available	1
1	also item shipped is not item pictured	1
1	i was very dissatisfied with this purchase the material feels like paper and the seams were all crooked then when i returned it i got an ugly email keep looking for the price you can find something of much better quality	1
1	had only 4 wks poss washed 2x \( and hung dry \) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me	1
1	i have white everlast boxing shoes they are very comfortable i thought these ones were the same the difference is that the other ones have soft parts in it where the feet move when boxing the black ones are uncomfortable in the back side where the division of the shoe is they do n't move well plus they charged almost 20 for shipping so i ended up paying a lot for them	1
0	this is a well made rugged coat sort of a north face mountain hardware coat for the farm ranch not a summer coat too heavy ! ! ! the next model needs to have pit zips !	1
0	this bag is perfect as a commuter bag on my bike the cell phone pocket is very accessible and the bag is large enough to hold a change of clothes but not so large everything gets lost inside	1
0	great product works well and was shipped promptly also there was an accurate product description thank	1
0	this bra fits very well \( i found it fit very true to size \) and offers great support i 'd much rather pay this price than the outrageous prices i 've paid for sports bras in the past that have offered no where near the support it has held up well while jogging	1
1	i got two problems with this here lingeree 1 that model at the top of the page is sparkin hot how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend \? eh \? false advertizing if ya ask me their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does or a warnin label objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear 2 i paid 14 95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on my suggestion go for the crotchless or the bustless or the fishnet but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend	1
0	i was looking for a wrap to go with a black backless dress this scarf was perfect it added just enough color with a little sparkle and was plenty large to use as a wrap very pretty	1
1	i ordered this to go under my halloween costume nine days in advance and it arrived too late for me to wear it it 's still in the package in my closet maybe next year	1
0	i 've been looking for black sport socks for a long time ! finally a black comfortable cushy sport sock of medium thickness i'm completely satisfied	1
0	these look great with jeans though i'm not a fan with skirts i bought the black and now wish i could find the bronze in my size i normally wear a 9 and depending on the brand i sometimes need a wide but these i found the 8 5ww fits perfectly go figure naturalizer runs very very narrow i love love these shoes i can dance all night without pain \) they are very cushioned the top straps do not cut at all and the heel height is super comfortable more like a 2 heel i so wish i could find these in other colors in ww !	1
1	ok for some reason my first review was never posted which only makes me more upset about this bra ! this bra is useless for me it has snaps instead of clasp which make it a two handed job to open and close not so great for public nursing and for someone who is a 34 36 b c it is amazing to me when the bra slides out of place the nursing pads fall out and my bed becomes soaked with middle of the night leakage ! all and all i would not recommend this bra	1
0	i love these shoes and wear them at least 4 days a week	1
1	these boots were the worst ever ! they were grossly missized and not as depicted the back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering when returned the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving never again	1
0	bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions it is stable comfortable provides good traction and is warm without being sweaty i would strongly recommend this boot	1
0	i bought this scarf with a gift certificate i received for christmas i love it so much and my kids love it so much they are buying their own it is super warm and retains it shape even after my nine year old tried it on as a dress	1
1	nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing \? it looks good but is it 4 x 8 or 12 x 8 \? sure would be nice to know the size before i buy da trol	1
1	these compression shorts are nothing like the other pair of hind i have aside from the low grade material and poor stiching the waist band rides up around my chest ! it looks like they were designed for someone 7 feet tall	1
0	i am thrilled to finally purchase birkenstock at a price that is fair our local retail stores mark them up so ridiculously thank you amazon	1
0	color and image are delightful i do wish i had gone up a size as i like to wear it with a long sleeved t shirt underneath	1
0	the shorts were everything i wanted the service was 5 star and my husband wears these short all the time i bought him all the colours available	1
0	the shawl was beauiful and just the right color an excellent value too very good product fast shippin	1
0	this is a great idea that is not apriciated until you go on a long trip and end up with dirty wrinkled clothes that are all thrown into a bag this keeps clothes seperated and organized and easy to repack if you are moving from place to place	1
1	based on the prior reviews i fully expected to like these unfortunately i do n't and wo n't buy more they do n't stay up i do n't have particularly large or small calves and do n't have that issue with my other athletic socks oh well buy and learn i bought both white and black and they are equally disappointing	1
0	my son loved these jeans the jeans were very comfortable the best thing about them was that because my son is so thin the elastic adjustments were perfect	1
0	i love this jacket it is lightweight but still warm enough to wear in all but the coldest weather it is also long enough to cover my rear very good in the rain too	1
1	had a hard time using this thing first it tore the loop off my tie trying to fit it in the clip then it cut my button off the shirt sliding up and down the shirt i went back to using my tie bar and tack	1
1	these gloves are very soft and seem to be made well but they have a big flaw the fingers are too short ordering up a size may not solve any fit problems	1
1	i received wrong item but there was no service after that	1
1	i totally did n't have a problem with the seller or anything great shipping ! um but the book kinda rots if you know how to tie a tie already then it might be fine but i do n't the pictures did n't really help and the wording was n't concise one sentence could be interpreted like nine ways ! ! i practically destroyed one tie definitely practice with a tie you do n't care about or one that doesnt need to be dry cleaned cuz they get pretty rumpled	1
0	this was a christmas gift for my friend 's husband he really liked it and said it was excellent quality	1
1	not worth the price at all the bead work looks very cheap the color does not look the way its shown in the picture decided to return it the moment i opened the box	1
0	these shoes are so light that sometimes i forget i have them on they are so comfortable than i do n't want to take them off i have to walk a lot every day and i am not kidding when i said that any other pair of shoes make my feet sore after a few hours of use but these shoes do the job to perfection i highly recommend them	1

0	i bought these for my son and he says they are really comfortable he wears them when he plays basketball lots of support and no blisters i 'll most likely buy another pair for him	1
0	this belt is seriously great i ordered it and it arrived 3 days later exactly as the seller described i'm not sure what the previous review was all about but my belt is great i love how i can use interchangeable buckles with it	1
1	while they are certainly bold and noticeable and have a handy security flap on the back to cover your personal information they are n't even close to being leather i do n't think i would have bought them if i saw the cheap stitching and smelled the strong vinyl stench beforehand not really worth the price and definitely not worthy paying the extra shipping charge from the seller	1
0	i am very pleased with the terry wrap that i bought as a christmas gift i had looked in every store i was in while christmas shopping for one but found none so was very pleased to find this one it is well made looks good and the price was great shipping was very quick without paying extra for express service	1

0	these are the first mootsies tootsies i have owned and i love em since then i have bought another pair of loafers and a pair of their boots these shoes are very comfortable	1
1	i got the shoes for a while and i must say it was a total disappointment ! the look and heel were ok so does the gtx xcr however there is a major problem the shoes wo n't hold your foot ! the opens for the shoes lace \( the tounge \) are too big so the shoes wo n't hold your foot intact this is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe hate it ever since i put it on i have total of 3 pairs of gtx hikers now and this one is the one i regret to out money in	1

1	these undies look very cute but they do n't breathe and well let 's just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear	1
1	this garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men if you just want underwear look on however if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less at is unless the view is everythin	1
0	i have been trying to find low heeled sandals with a back strap and no thing between the toes so i was very excited to find these i bought 4 pairs \( silver bronze black and turquoise \) they are beautiful and comfortable \( i walked around at disneyland in the turquoise ones from 9am to midnight ! \) the sizing was very true and the standard shipping was very fast i highly recommend both these sandals and amazon com	1
0	this is a top quality item i is an 80 20 cotton poly mix double stitched seams very well made i bought a 2x for my son who ususally wears a 3x and after putting it through the washer and dryer twice it 's just as perfect as the day it was delivered	1
0	the belt is high qualilty and was a good value for the price very satisfied	1
0	i'm in love with these sandals although they are very lightweight they are vastly more substantial supportive and comfortable than most flip flops i may have to buy another pair if you 're a half size go down not up	1
0	i own 2 pairs they are classy and go with everything but the only minus point is that they are a bit heavy but you eventually get the hang of it	1

1	i ordered this item on september 10 2006 as of january 12 2007 i have still not received the ordered item but the pictures of it sure are nice one star is one star too many	1
1	i am not leaking so i do n't need those annoying papery pads but i would still like a little padded protection so i was hoping this bra would do the trick well it served that purpose alright but it was a pain as far as nursing went the clasp was difficult to release with one hand the cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult worst of all the underwire gave me a rash ! this bra may work for some but not for me	1
0	i received these slippers for christmas in december 2005 i got the pine green a very nice looking slipper with lots of comfort i am ordering another pair in charcoal as i want 2 pairs to have at both places i live it 's all about comfort for me when i am home so these fit the bill good value as well	1

0	about 18 24 months ago we purchased a pair of beach crocs for our daughter child toddler size 12 13 like those pictured she has used them for the beach around the pool wearing them to school on non gym days going on non strenuous walks and so forth plus we have used them as a floating throw toy at motel swimming pools even though her shoe size is now 1 to 1 1 2 she still wears them and the shoes are in good shape ! also daughter 's mother has been wearing her own pair for similar uses for about two years so we highly recommend crocs	1
0	i love these pajamas the color the softness \( get softer the more you wash \) and the fit i had purchased these for an older friend and found i was n't able to part with them so i made it up to her in other ways never done that before shows how much i like 'em	1
1	they totally fell apart after wearing them 2 or 3 times ! i expected more having paid nearly 20 for a pair of slippers very dissapointed	1

0	robeez are the only brand of shoes we even bother to use they are well made and do not come off by accident or when baby tries to get them off ! we 've tried all of the other generic brands and they all come off but not these its worth it to spend the extra on these shoes and they 're so well made they 'll last for baby 2	1

0	the lilyette maximum support bra is well made and wears well it holds up to frequent washings and retains its support features it is comfortable	1
1	the bra cup itself is too big for my chest and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30 's and 40 's it is not at all comfortable blah ! and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure	1
0	i am very happy with this product its comfortable and good looking worth buy	1
0	stretches to fit you exactly the smooth fabric holds everything in place contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy highly recommended	1
1	cute shoes but extremely uncomfortable i am not sure that i will get much wear out of these shoes i know my size but i starting to think they sent me the wrong pair i am so frustrated with amazon where shoes are concerned this is the 3rd pair of shoes i have bought that does not give me a good fit i suggest that you buy a 1 2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big it 's a catch 22	1
1	the glasses look fine from a far distance they are produced very carelessly given that it 's on sale the quality can not be as high as normal however it should not that bad	1
1	good short sleeve shirt but i ordered a long sleeve	1
1	i ordered a 11 5eee size slip on shoe despite the labelling in the shoes they felt more like 12 5ee in other words too tight across the arch and so loose on the heel they wore like flip flops unfortunately the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them which voids the company 's product return policy anybody want a worn once pair of shoes cheap \?	1
0	great cap quality is top notch price is also great	1
0	the lands end 60 40 oxford is the dress shirt to own ! it is the end of the line in your search for an excellent product ! i buy nothing but this shirt and have multiple shirts in each color made i 've worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since i was 16 years old in prep school \( 35 years now \) and the lands end is the best i highly recommend this shirt	1
1	i ca n't imagine who could pull off these clown pants they 're unwearable ! what was hanes thinking \?	1
1	these pants did not look good on me they seem built for thin people while not obese i am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me the material is nice though	1
0	my hubby liked this shirt it was a great christmas present	1
1	can you say p a i n \? this is what steve madden shoes are pain the soles must be made of cast iron the upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough i am convinced that this madden person hates women if it were in my power i would track down steve madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs only standing walking and dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain	1
1	if you like cheap furniture you 'll love this boot the slave labor used to make this boot was wasted	1

1	i was disappointed with the shoes when i received them on the website the shoes looked gold in color and were described as gold but when i received the shoes they were beige i am sorry to say that i could not wear the shoes	1
1	shoe has a high back that kinda cuts in to your heel i love clark 's but not this pair	1
1	look a little harder if you want an alternative to boxers and bland briefs the elance is poorly made and designed jockey is barely evern trying look on the web guys there are better choices jockey 's elance and the similar department store knockoffs of womens underwear are lame	1

1	the sling support feature on these underwear is practically useless my testicles always slip completely out of the sling before i 've had them on for even an hour if these briefs enhance a man 's profile at all it 's because they 're so darn tight it has nothing to do with the sling support and talk about low rise the top of my crack is exposed even when they 're pulled all the way up i'm in pretty good shape but if these things shrink in the dryer i wo n't be able to fit into them anymore my advice anybody ordering c in briefs should go one size larger than what he 'd normally wear	1

1	the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes i have used it about three or four times and i do n't feel it will last much longer what there was of it seemed to work well but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use	1
0	the fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed they wash beautifully and require little or no ironing my husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well the hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing frankly i wish i could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price hagaar offers haagar has done a terrific job again	1

1	ok i do n't why this bra is available in any size larger than a b cup because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust \( i see that is available here in 38 dd and i shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing \) it 's comfortable enough to be worn around the house under jammies for a little support when just relaxing but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day this bra wo n't do it the front closure just does n't allow for any lift or support unless you possess a smaller chest skip this one	1

0	i purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas i was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots with four children sometimes a compromise is in order so when i saw these at a more reasonable price i got them when she opened them she at first did n't even realize they were n't the ugg 's she has been wearing them since and i'm guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost in comparison to the more expensive boots she says no difference	1

1	i love the colts but this sweatshirt is supposed to be a large it is the wierdest fitting sweatshirt i have efer seen the shoulders are to big and the neck is to tight i wear a large but i cant wear this shirt because it looks so awkward	1
0	at first i thought i would n't like this bra because it has to be pulled over you head to put it on however this is the most comfortable bra i bought and i bought a lot of different kinds this is perfect for engorgement and just plain daily comfort	1
1	i never wear this top after having purchased it the stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them the shirt itself hangs very awkwardly i prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and therefore is n't very flattering i think i 've worn it once and will probably donate it soon generally i have been pleased with adidas products but this shirt did not work for me personally	1
1	when the product came it was torn and had one of the three pieces missing i called the seller and they said all of the purses were missing one piece i would not order from this seller unless you are not worried about all the pieces	1
0	i initially bought these shoes for my mom for a christmas gift but she said they were too high for her well i fixed that i kept them for myself \) i love them and they are really hot ! thnxja	1
1	i bought two of these hoping to use them as sashes in a bridal event and quickly returned them since it took over two weeks for delivery i am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return refund the sashes are not the quality that i thought was represented by the term charmeuse and are thin and gauzy they came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz much of that must have been the packaging a quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction	1
1	the leather on these gloves is soft and supple and they 're warmthats about all that i can say that is good there were scuffs when i got them the stitching was ripping \( and finished itself off soon after \) and the fingers were different lengths on each glove avoid at all costs	1
1	first i tried these pants on in my size and i looked like kramer in that episode where jerry dares him to wear jeans it was ridiculous i went back to the store and bought them a little bigger and they are the best pair of jeans i 've ever owned	1
1	sadly this well designed item does n't work for me it comes detached from its clip while i'm exercising and plunges to the floor dragging my headphones off	1
0	i 've tried 6 different nursing bras this one with the center snap closure is the easiest to use it is also the lightest and most comfortable while providing good support my only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric even when i try to sew it back into place it breaks loose after a few washes perhaps if i handwashed the bra instead of using a machine it would last longer this bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras \( particularly the leading lady bra which seems to be indestructible \) but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort lightness and ease of use it is by far my favorite	1
1	great concept but they slip off my ears way too often often enough that i stopped wearing them	1
1	the collar stays work as the ad indicates they will they are organized and packaged well the sizes provided accomodate all collars	1
1	i had got these for my husband for christmas nice material however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height so we had to return it	1
0	this case is really nice and compact there is a nice place for a card or x tra batteries inside is snuggly fits the hp digital camera protects well and well padded very nice case	1
1	i have worn jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time the product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them ! i shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings given the cost of panties and other similar products you 'd think the quality would be decent however jockey is n't the only company out there with a substandard product i guess until i can afford to spend substantially more for panties i'm stuck i will only pay sale prices	1

0	i have just recieved my pair of boxer briefs for my son i took a kid 's review 's idea and got one size smaller for my son i asked him how they felt and he said that they felt really good i asked him if they give him enough support and he said yes and he even told me i do n't know why but he told me that he can get his hand down the boxer briefs and take it out without the boxer briefs streching and loosing their tightness	1
1	while the suit fits and looks great my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit it 's really the placement that bothered her there is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam which from a distance looks like one had an accident in their trunks thanks but no thanks these shorts are being returned	1
0	i bought as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved them these are some great looking shoes	1
0	this bra is great for those of us with smaller busts it 's the only bra i 'll wear under my t shirts now because it does n't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra i 've found it very comfortable the only downside is that mine did lose it 's form \( it 's not as tight fitting as it used to be \) a little bit faster than some other bras but it 's absolutely worth buying a replacement i just hope they never stop making this bra	1
1	i still got a pantyline with this strange and frustrating	1
0	do n't know where else to find a garter panty set \( arrived fast too \) for this price they say economy so was n't expecting much but we 're still enjoying this set to spice up special evenings ! we bought the one size \( for a size 8 \) and it is perfect and adjusts	1

1	i ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and i had the same problem with the turpentine smell i was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price i wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem i washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink i'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they do n't make my other clothes smell and i'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them	1
1	i do like this t shirt i liked the organic cotton and the general style but i will never buy american apparel again not only are they very labor and union unfriendly their ads exploitive of young girls \( i mean i can tolerate some of the young models in general but these are particularly young girls in amature porn looking situations \) but a friend 's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores i know i can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere ick	1
1	i bought these shoes to do aerobics in they look good and are comfortable but only to walk in there is zero arch support and when i walk in them i feel as if my feet are flat on the ground there is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics my old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones but i ca n't use the old ones the gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes they are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt i am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location now i have to look again	1
0	got this for my teen as an alternative to a bathrobe she loves it nice warm pretty pink color they run small she usually takes a medium got her a large she could have used an xl sleeves are a bit short she likes the look the zip front	1
1	easy to install we used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates you can still hear the engine running but no movement hardly any use at all maybe 10 times we tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you ca n't open it to see the inner workings i have never received a bad item from amazon before i am very disappointed with this product	1
0	these are basically plain black yoga pants but they fit fine are good quality and have washed fine without shrinking it 's hard to rhapsodise about them but they are more than adequate	1
1	i really wanted these boots and had been contemplating getting them for almost 6 months when they came i was so excited and took them out of the box to look at them and they were stained i was extremely disappointed that the product was defective because i have never had a problem with any amazon products in the past i sent it back and i was reimbursed for my purchase i am really disappointed i will think twice before i purchase any shoes from amazon again	1
0	i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items reasonable price and am very happy with items	1
1	i am a 44dd i am having the hardest time finding a good bra i ordered this one and i am a little dissapointed the underwires in the front poke out and make it look like i have these bones sticking straight out of my chest everthing else is ok no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone	1

1	i had several of these shipped to my mum in law 's in california for sending to me in france where we work and live because of a decent delivery speed and her thinking they looked ok i gave them a rating of 5 stars today after even having boiled them in water hoping for shrinkage i am sad to say that nothing happened they are horrid to wear i oredered a medium size and the fit is that of xxxxxxxl do not buy this horrors i wish i could get my hard earned money back as now i'm wondering if i was the brunt of a joke in nightmare alley you 've got to be con artist to sell these things	1
1	get ee if you get these the d is very narrow and thefore uncomfortable	1
1	i bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts i usually lift weights have no prior injuries and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form \( i played a college sport etc \) after a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that i could barely move them regularly it was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier \( free weights included \) perhaps i was doing the exercises incorrectly but that seems like a real risk with a video like this	1
1	i have a 33 34 waste i bought the medium size because it is advertised to be fit for 32 34 waste the thing is too tight ! it almost blocks circulation to my legs plus the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch i was mostly disappointed with this product you can find a much better value at this price	1
0	these sandals are very nice and the price that i paid was a very good price	1
1	i'm just not too crazy about this thing doesn't quite fit right or look right at least i only paid 5 bucks	1

0	this case is so cute and matches my green ipod perfectly i read other reviews that said it leaves little black fuzz on the ipod but i have n't had that problem the belt clip works great with this and feels very secure the other review said the cut out for the wheel is off a little and i guess she is right looking at it you can see just slightly that the wheel is n't centered but it is completely accesible and i have no trouble using it overall i love this case	1
1	i bought a bunch of these shirts because i saw the good reviews at first i was happy they fit perfect then i washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than i ever seen shirts shrink in my life my medium shirts became xxs i wish i had a 8 year old son because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now	1
0	i bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started let me tell you these boots are great ! ! ! ! ! ! i read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they 're a little big regardless i love them and another thing they keep my feet very warm and cozy	1
0	i was looking for an inexpensive but functional leather briefcase and this was exactly what i was looking for i have more than three electronic devices that i need easy access to and the case has three outside pockets big enough to hold my devices the only thing missing is an outside place to put a pen or pencil i do n't know how durable it will be but i'm hoping very ! ! for the price this is a good buy	1
0	this sheet is great solution for difficult to change crib sheets just lay it over the top of your pretty sheet and snap it to the crib frame i highly recommend it to those who do n't like wrestling the crib sheet onto the mattress	1
1	i have worn jockeys for almost 20 years but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years the fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly and the underwear is for some unfathomable reason heavily perfumed ! i had to wash them at least 5 6 times to get the smell out plus some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight and some was so loose i could n't wear them and they were all the same size very inconsistent quality i do not recommend these anymore	1
1	i really wanted to like these but they just wo n't stay put it 's not a thong but it will be after a few hours of wear i usually love dkny products so i am disappointed	1
0	i love these jeans i have 3 pair and they are the only jeans i wear just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight i wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great	1
0	my new shoe wallet is even better than i expected ! it securely fastens to my running shoe holds my key emergency cash and identification and most importantly serves as a safe place for my ipod sport sensor best of all my ipod works efficiently and accurately in the shoe wallet without my purchasing nike branded shoes i'm a very happy consumer !	1
1	this was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line the fit was awful there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless	1
1	this tie winder is not only twice the size i was expecting but it does n't work after one attempted use the lid no longer stays on i would have returned it if the return shipping did n't cost more than the item	1
1	the box it came in looked like it had been torn apart by a pack of wild dogs when i received it fur was falling off of the coat as i pulled it out of the box i tried it on just to see if i 'd like a replacement since it was not in perfect condition and it was not cute on i immediately returned it	1
1	i purchased this to replace my husband 's favorite keyfob from american eagle which was almost identical \( and lasted ten years incidentally \) this one fell apart after two months time for a trip to the local leathersmith	1
0	let me assure anyone who is even remotely thinking of buying these shoes do it ! they are not only beautiful but as high as they are they are extremely comfortable the detail is way more beautiful in person as they are on the website my favorite shoe of the summer	1

1	the product was unsatisfactory because of how large it was my son exchanged it	1
0	my husband is a big man and very rough on belts most belts last him a few weeks this one has lasted him 3 years the only reason i'm buying him a new one is because he 's lost so much weight there 's still 'lots of miles' left in the belt i'm replacing definitely got our money 's worth out of it	1
0	these wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price and they were delivered faster than expected	1
1	these cover ups are very thin a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun the colors are pretty but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps they are cheap good thing because i ca n't imagine what to use them for i 'd return them but the postage would cost more than the item	1
0	this is cute funny and it 's not uncomforable ! i think it rocks ! i love this movie i even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth	1
0	these boots are so warm and soft ! i usually wear a 7 5 and i ordered them in size 7 \( even though they recommend sizing up for half sizes \) and they fit perfectly an awesome \( and cheaper \) alternative to uggs	1

1	these socks were thin large and horrible they had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently absolutely worthless	1
0	i purchased this bag to take on a tour of greece and was pretty happy with it i loved the size not to big and not too small and also the flatness of it it was very lightweight and the compartements are easily accessible the only problem i had with it is that when you wear it as intended accross your body the strap tends to rub at the neck so i had to keep adjusting it every five minutes overall it was pretty good though	1
1	i bought two of these bags so far both have failed at the plastic fastener one arm just snapped in no time the bag itself is ok but the plastic parts on the belt are really cheap i wont buy a third one	1
1	it 's true that you get what you pay for the good thing i can say aboutthis product is that the price is right but the quality was low and the fitwas poor however if you are strapped for money then they are certainlywearable but get a half size smaller than you usually would get	1
1	the sound works but the light does not	1
0	i love these shoes ! they are so comfy and look good the price is a bit steep i think but considering i could wear them practically every day and not get tired of them i guess they are worth it definitely considering purchasing another pair in brown !	1
0	i bought another of clark 's sandals a few years ago which is why i ordered them again these sandals were even more comfortable than the last pair ! there was no break in period with these shoes i just put them on and spent the day in them without pressure points or blisters i will buy more in other colors i'm sure you ca n't go wrong with clark 's	1
1	not as expected too short nothing special for the price took forever to receive \( about 3 weeks	1
0	these wellies \( rubber boots \) are a show stopper ! i get lots of comments on how smashing they look and they are very functional i wear them in the garden on the beach \( can walk into pretty high water without getting wet \) and they are comfortable for long periods of walking very happy with them and the price was right too	1
0	i bought this for my husband and am so impressed nice and thick and incredibly soft and huggable i have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores the attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise sturdy shipping box and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required there was even a hand written thank you note included i am more than satisfied	1
1	i would have loved it if they sent it but after over 2 weeks of telling me that it was in stock on it 's way the company fessed up that they were out of the color that i chose the other color that they wanted to sub looked pretty bad so i cancelled	1
1	the slipper seems to have some craftmenship in my case they seem to run about a half size small who wants to wait for a pair of slippers to stretch \? i wish i had known this in advance they look good in my closet though	1
0	i just purchased fleece hoodies and pants by andrew christian the material is wonderful the hoody feels luxuriously soft on my skin i would recommend them highly the pansts are low rise since i am older i am still getting used to that but they too feel really good on	1
1	i bought a sweatshirt from them the tote was a freebie and too small for much use anyway customer service was awful they sent me the wrong size a man 's size not the woman 's i was searching for \( and the photo had a woman wearing it ! she must have been an amazon \) i returned it the next day and they refused to accept the return saying it looked worn	1
1	our company ordered these shirts from the texas shirt company while we were happy with the quality our order was missing 2 shirts over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for as if to say we were not telling the truth if you do n't care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company	1
0	i received the earmuffs i ordered 3 days after i placed the order	1
0	i'm very satisfied with this purchase the jeans are great quality for the price however it was not stated that they would be the \( very \) long length that they were i had to alter them which was an inconvenience	1
1	if your loved one is a beautiful 5'7 130 lb slender lady like mine forget about this piece of clothing if however she is a 5'1 180 lb gorgeous petite girl this might just be the excitement inducer you are looking for you 'll have lots of fun first trying to put it on her then trying to use the slits which are in all the wrong places and then finally to remove it from her body without injuring her or yourself fun that will come after that is purely optional	1
1	this review is n't really about the flip flops because theyre great why would you buy them here for 5 61 when you can get them at the store for 2 50 each \?	1
1	the product would have been great but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes i requested xl long pants they sent size 3x pants so they are completely unusable and do not respond to my emails i would never order from them again	1
1	after one washing the letters were all rolled up i was able to pull the rest of it off and now it is just a grey onesie the quality of the graphic was horrible	1
0	i bought these for my granddaughter after i saw her wearing a pair of plain black rubber boots which she loved ! when i gave her these she absolutely loved them ! they are so cute with flowers and butterflies all over them they run true to size are well made and look so bright and cheerful on a rainy day needless to say the black boots have been retired	1
0	these boxers are much nicer than the photos suggest i was pleasantly surprised i was trying to replace a pair i had accidentally washed in the washing machine \( a no no with this fabric \) turns out the replacements were twice the quality of what i had originally purchased i will probably be purchasing more your wife will thank you for buying these excellent quality and softer than satin my only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes because it 's made without a fastener the idea is for a sleeker feel but it sacrifices security love 'em anyway	1
0	these are without question the best panties for wearing with slacks no line at the leg no line accross the middle of your behind and no riding up they are also cut low enough to not show in a moderately low rise pant sizing runs true to any other maidenform pantie you 've ever bought can be had cheaper at a maidenform outlet store but still well worth the price on amazon buy lots of them	1
1	i got this bra thinking it would be great for rigorous sports and my 38ddd chest think again go for the the enell sports bra i bought a size 3 and it is perfect no bounce whatsoever ! ! ! i was amazed do n't bother with this one	1
0	once my best friend described my bra size as beige meaning that when you shop in the full figure section of a department store you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny 's closet most of the bras are beige with some black or white ones and all are gigantic and ugly if this sounds familiar to you then this is the bra for you it looks pretty comes in a variety of colors and i at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences the cups do the supporting so the bra does n't need to have those super wide heavily padded straps and it gives a good silhouette under clothes but will also look nice by itself	1
1	i was very dissappointed by this item it arrived folded into a 6x6 square bag and was very creased when opened it will take considerable pressing to try and get it out the fabric is too stiff and does n't drap well the length is n't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap the return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk	1
1	after only one week use at home the sole was completely broken the worst quality slipper i have ever seen	1
1	the sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body my husband is 6' 178 pounds so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit but this one looked like a stiff kite on him be aware the items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money and only after i had filed a complaint with amazon amazon acted quickly to post the credit	1

1	the nippits did n't really work for me and they were painful to remove	1
1	when i move around i sure do n't need a front closure that comes undone many times a day \? ! the hook on this bra needs to be changed to a snap closure ! perfect bra in every other sense but a self unhooking bra \? no good	1
0	i was a little nervous about ordering clothing from the internet not knowing if it would fit i think that the sizing chart used for this particular product works well because the produt turned out to fit just right also the picture is on key with the actual product my loved it and so do i	1
0	this jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip this is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect it will keep you perfectly dry you will sweat a little on a warm day but it is well worth the money for a cheap dependable and totally waterproof suit enjoy the rain and mud	1
1	it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces look at tunebelt they have one that fits pretty good	1
0	i love this umbrella it 's just the right size and works perfectly it 's so pretty that i do n't want to get it wet ! !	1
1	these pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all if they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these i have lost the 3 pairs i biught to the self same calamity and always in public please save yourself the trouble by the way the lee version of these pants also do the same thing be afraid be very afraid	1
1	the fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips i am a 5'6 120 lb small boned female the company offered to exchange it however did not offer any others with cell phone holder now i will have to pay return shipping plus 4 95 restocking fee to return this item i did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now	1
1	the jacket itself its well made but they sent a jacket with different colors and it does not look as nice as the one in the picture	1

0	i bought a pair for my wife and she told me how warm her feet were while wearing them so i decided to buy a pair for myself i wear them without socks as they are so warm and comfortable i think wearing socks w these shoes would get a little too warm for my feet	1
0	my husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing we love them i gave him two pair for christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these they look great too	1

1	i have ordered intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase so far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings i will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn i now know why i pay 15 00 for two pair ofjockey 's	1

1	we have not opened the package the item is advertised as one size without a notice that the one size is not one size fits all it is xl \( grand plus for those that speak french \) my wife wears a size 2 or 4 obviously this was a waste of money	1
1	i 've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full time in the summer and very little the rest of the year while the shoes are comfortable i was disappointed at how fast they 're falling apart the padding around the ankle has torn there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes and i was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement the solid rubber outsole delivers long wearing durability that 's been my major complaint with these shoes shortly after i got them the soles cracked at the heel and now layers of the soles are peeling off i recommend buying another model	1
0	a difficult item to find in department stores found some at twice the price in a leather goods store the fossil leather key cases were of equal quality i purchased two and am very satisfied	1

1	i have several pairs of clarks shoes that are wonderful the lalita is very uncomfortable they are stiff and the sides that come over the foot are stiff and rub i was truly disappointed	1
0	the fatigues were just what my son wanted the only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order i guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom but my son did n't want that so i had to hem about four inches on each leg other than that it was an excellent product	1
1	i purchased a ipod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside on the inside of the case they 've got some ruff edges that will damage you ipod screen if you 'd like scratches on your ipod screen then purchase this case but if you 'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then stay away from this case !	1

0	these are hands down my favorite pair of jeans i'm 5'5 and they are just the right length to wear with tennis shoes and midheight heels the stretch fabric hugs in all the right places and the cut is slimming	1
0	the gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties ! it takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but i believe that all gazebos have the same problem	1
0	great flats ! compact and small for those who have too many shoes already the only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time	1
0	this is such a wonderful pair of gloves they are light and easily portable they can be folded and stored in one 's pockets they have features that enable use of one 's index fingers and thumbs for fine operations such as turning minute knobs the synthetic materials comprising these gloves also make them very protective against harsh weather \( especially wind and rain \) i am now able to run outside in icy wind despite the fact that my hands freeze more easily than anyone 's elses	1
1	the upper portion of the boots which is supposed to hug your calf is ridiculously huge the shoe portion fit i have relatively normal sized calves and i was swimming in these boots i immediately returned tham	1

0	it is perfect for my three year old to carry his toys instead of me carrying them ! ! !	1
1	the shoes look and wear great however the leather is pretty weak i think i must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter size scuff on it i will have to try to cover it up by oiling it obviously i do n't think this pair will last long at all	1
1	the trunks look great as long as you do n't get them wet because once you get them wet they become see through i guess that could be advantageous for some but i was looking for something to wear on public beaches	1
0	very nice sandal lookes great with a dress or jeans low enough to wear for hours at a time but high enough heel to make it look chic	1
0	my son loves the jersey a little pricey but a nice jerse	1
0	these work great but its important to know that these are adjustable ! it does n't say so on the box so when i first got them i thought they were way too small for adult heads and i was quite annoyed however you can adjust them once you put them on just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly	1
0	i was asked by my daughter to get these for christmas i got some for myself for my morning walks in 30c temps they do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day even when i have just gotten it done and keep my ears toasty warm great product and worth the money my daughter is equally impressed	1

0	everything you need that your ipod did n't come with at one low price shipped promptly	1
1	while i ca n't agree with the other reviewer re the quality of the 560 jeans \( it seems excellent to me having owned six pairs over the last two years which i wear to work every day \) and certainly as men 's jeans i do n't think they 're out of style i do have to say amazon 's price on this item is far far out of line you can find these same jeans online elsewhere for 38 \( with free or cheap shipping \) meaning the cost is nearly 20 less than what amazon is charging	1
0	i purchased this dress to be the maid of honor in my best friends wedding it arrived quickly looked great and was an awesome price it would be hard to beat this great deal	1
1	these tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini however as another reviewer noted there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin i'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that i own are for my size medium 32 34 streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam but i 've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this maybe buying the next size up would work but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and i like keeping 'em close to home	1
1	nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing \? it looks good but is it 4 x 8 or 12 x 8 \? sure would be nice to know the size before i buy da trol	1
1	i returned this bra to exchange for size the day after i received it in october it is now january and i have not yet received the replacement i have called several times but to no avail ! i ca n't give a good review of this product because i have n't actually gotten to wear the bra	1

0	good quality jeans at an affordable price size is just right quite comfortable	1
1	this is an okay jacket the padding in it is okay sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal there is no liner and you will get cold riding at night overall the jacket has only 2 layers and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up	1
1	i received the trousers in a timely manner they were what i expected although they did not fit i returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company	1
0	i love this bra just the right amount of support order arrived 4 days before expected woo hoo ! !	1
0	i got and love it however someone else 's product was shipped inside the box it looked like the box came open and someone just grabbed whatever they thought came in the box the product was not mine and the owners name and phone and address on it i contacted them and sent it to them myself it was suppliments for a very serioulsy ill small boy i hope all that get things for others send it to them too ! you never know whose life depends on it	1
1	these body suits are awful ! when i first saw them i was really relieved that i had found something that would be good for the summer months i put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs ! the suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label i am so disappointed and angry it was a waste of my money	1
0	i love my clarks and i can get such good prices through amazon i havebought two pairs of clarks with amazon and i plan on buying more inthe future bett	1
0	these are by far my favourite yoga pants very flattering for practically every sort of figure but more than that they 're super comfy so stretchy that they feel like a second skin and the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you 're self conscious about your belly plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your t shirt riding up and sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you 're good to go back on the street ! the biggest problem with these pants is that it 's hard to want to wear anything else i own some 4 pairs of these and love them	1
1	first let me say that i was very impressed with the shipping speed of this hat which was nice because i bought this as a last minute gift though with that said there is a big difference between straw and straw paper this hat is straw paper i'm afraid to see what will happen once this hat gets wet from sweat or rain i really think amazon should improve this hat 's description	1
1	this camisole did not fit my purpose the idea is great but it did n't fit me correctl	1
1	the zen cover did n't work that good i had to cut off one of the flaps that covers the buttons because it was not made right i ended up taking the cover off and do n't even use it anymore it 's not worth getting	1
1	the fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful egyptian cotton but the bathrobe was huge it was more like a tent than a bathrobe it was an anniversary present for my wife \( size 8 \) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18 i was very disappointed that i could not have ordered at least a general size \( large medium or small \)	1
0	at first i was bugged by how sticky this was but boy did it work ! they gave me 1 2 ounce tube in the hospital \( and charged me 9 for it but that 's another story ! \) it moisturizes and protects your nipples from chafing while nursing and does n't bother baby a bit take my advice bring your own tube to the hospital to avoid being over charged !	1
1	the shirt was beautiful notice i used the past tense verb was \? after hand washing it twice the hem came out the front tie fell off and the side of the lace ripped open it found a new home in the trash	1
0	agree 100 very comfy besides making the ideal for everyday use the fabric is so soft that is very hot to the touch the look is very sexy so they are good in both sides comfy and sexy	1
0	these are the most comfortable briefs i have ever worn they are worth every penny in my opinion they are designed for a man plus they seem to not gather moisture as some fabrics do	1
1	these pants were washed one time following the washing instructions they were not put in the dryer and they shrunk not only around but lengthwise i had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems i look forward to your reply	1
1	these shoes are not as cute as they appear the heel is really 2 5 the material is cheap the fit is too wide the shoes are uncomfortable to walk in etc etc etc on a positive note it 's the type of shoes that can be worn with a pair of jeans or a cocktail dress be warned the company claims that all their shoes have 2 heels when they do n't and they charge tax on shipping charges	1
1	i was impressed by the look of this bag it really looked like it would seal the contents well unfortunately it did not i tried several times and each time the contents of the bag were soaked ! fortunately i tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool and only ended up with soggy money if i had put my cell phone and watch in the bag they would have been ruined i don't recommend it	1
1	i ordered this wool wrap at the beginning of december and never received the item i am disappointed that this seller is ripping people off and plan to report the fact that my money was basically stolen from me if people ca n't be honest in their transactions then online buying will eventually die out two thumbs down	1

0	i purchased these socks from a large department store in chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks i had it took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort i went to amazon and found them in a second i have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks i have in my drawer i am hooked on hue plus size and it is so easy through amazon	1

1	these slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things i 've ever put my feet into the concept is good but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger that might solve the length discomfort but there still is n't sufficient heighth comfort they felt like an all encompassing vise squeezing my feet so tightly that i had to remove them to gain relief very uncomfortable	1
1	the color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture also from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows good customer support though i could n't return it because of being a gift	1
1	men here is a tip if you want to please your lady use a sexy thong instead we love how a man looks in a thong	1

1	this was something that i could of bought at the flea market for 20 bucks and it cost me 60 with shippng the leather is cheap it is so thin that they lined it with batting to make it feel thicker buyer beware would not buy again bottom grade leather	1
1	for all the costs involved in purchasing the jedi robe it was'nt worth it shipping handling and customs charge were not worth purchasing the item i will never shop amazon or any online store	1
1	these shoes are cute but 1 \) they are made wide 2 \) the heel is a little bigger than 2 3 \) they are uncomfortable to walk in i think i could find a better pair at wal mart if i had to the company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a big two thumbs down for that	1

1	the writing was peeling off this badly i ca n't let me child wear this i threw it out	1
1	the main shoe photo is not the shoe that is sent with your order amazon had said they would rectify the error although it looks like the main photo still shows the shoe with the circle buckle and the shoe that is sent has long ankle ties and a different strap entirely	1
1	i ordered these for my 21 year old daughter who attends juilliard they looked terrible because they were shiney the worst part is that the company will not allow a return or exhange	1
1	i ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day we have a recycle area in our apartment building but it is usually used for things that are not brand new ! these shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete i walk on i will not buy another pair of shoes on line again unless i know the make and size from hands on purchase before	1

1	the pants are not juniors' they are women 's pants that go up past your waistline when you wear them	1
0	finding sleepwear that has enough support for lactating large breasted women is no fun but this dress is pretty good what this will not give you is any kind of coverage if you 're ok with people seeing you with major cleavage then this is fine if not just wear it to bed not in the hospital or as i see some women do out of the house yikes ! i think i 'd be arrested	1
0	i had the opportunity of wearing these for my husband before i left for the west coast and my annual visit with my friends and our second annual lingerie party my hubby could n't believe i 'd wear something like this but boy oh boy he did n't object he could n't take his eyes off my well you can just imagine what it was he could n't take his eyes off of	1
0	the nine west botamy boots are comfortable and really well made the leather is very soft also even though the toe is very pointed these boots are still comfortable amazon has a great price on these boots	1
1	this is a very styling money clip however it is not like a big paper clip it opens like a butterfly then closes together with the strenght of the magnets it feels that your money and other cards might fall off i'm not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information	1
1	good features include many pockets bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining as a result the two pockets where i carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets	1

1	i purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store and it 's not even worth the dollar very cheezy item	1
1	this item was cancelled by amazon because of a price mistake that they would not honor after taking my order very poor customer servic	1
1	i thought i was on the same page as crocs when i ordered the pwclog it confusing i thought i was ordering a sale on crocs they are not crocs	1
1	this case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth the case is too big for a snug fit it works but i did n't spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new ipod real scam	1
1	my son picked out these shoes for basketball he liked them at first and gave them time to get broke in but the outsides of the shoes had no give most shoe will form to your foot these did not at the end of third stripe you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe we had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better nice looking shoe but not the greatest fit	1

0	i am very happy with the swimsuit delivery was as stated fits wonderfully the only problem was once i was wearing it a little of the edge of one of the cups was showing but i tucked it in whenever it was noticeable i was very happy that the suit fit nicely because i was a little worried of having to return for a different size and paying shipping the size i ordered was the size i normally wear and as i said it fit great	1
1	i ordered two bras and both were defective the left side strap had been sewn twisted and there was no way to correct without cutting and resewing	1
1	not comfortable the thong between your toes is too thick and too tight if you are looking for toeless this is not the way to go try dkny hosiery instead expensive but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable	1

0	got this for my dad before his truck was a slew of mail and papers worked out well	1
1	the fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes i received they look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects i am sure i will not show them off much when i wear them	1
1	sling is a misnomer for this gimmick think tourniquet and you 'll be closer to the reality there are several buttons and eyes on the sling to adjust the fit i tried every configuration and they all felt too tight a snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around despite the problems with the strap i like the briefs my recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap the sling technology needs more r d before it 's ready for the big time	1
1	i thought this product was going to be easier but i have found it really dosent work the tape dosent like to stick to your skin and i think the sizes are off i wear a 38c and so i got it its like whereing a b cup not a c well i hope this info helps peoplesher	1

1	i have to say that i was disappointed when i opened up the package containing my ipod wallet it 's cute but not 60ish cute first of all it 's not leather it 's nylon the lining is indeed suede but the photos in the product listing are misleading i'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back etc is n't worth it it does the job but it was n't what i was expecting i feel ripped off	1

1	i 've been buying these t shirts for 20 years without issues about 9 months ago calvin klein changed the manufacturer these t shirts are nothing but crap now ! they are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads the price has n't gone down just the quality please do n't get ripped off do not buy these shirts here is another case of american immorality at it 's best let 's cheapen the product so my pocket gets bigger at the expense of yours	1
1	classic sweatpants have elastics around the ankle to keep out of your way for biking \( and now spinning \? \) i hate this new style where the manufacturer saves money by imitating fashion jeans leaving the elastics out and letting the ankle cuff drag on the floor dangerous for working out and certainly not classic !	1

1	i purchased this item judging by its comfort factor all 's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place the straps slip off occassionally causing the shoes to come loose	1
0	my husband really likes these socks because they do not slide down his legs below the tops of his work boots i also like the fact you can buy them in black and amazon had a fantastic price on them i do n't know the wearability of the socks since i just got them for my husband for christmas i bought these same socks in white locally some time ago and they seem to be wearing okay no holes in the toes yet ! overall i think the socks are great	1

1	these shoes are cute but not practical at all i generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes i have ever tried on i ordered these and the peep toe sling back version these are really narrow in the two my foot feels so constricted in there they totally cut off your circulation and forget about even trying to walk in these very poorly constructed the peepttoe slings however are great fit true to size and are comfortable	1

0	i 'd been shopping for a pair of running shoes and have tried on various brands these shoes surpassed others in fit support and comfort i'm so glad kayano comes in wide sizes because it fits my feet perfectly ! i highly recommend !	1
0	so far i have been very satisfied with this bag for the price i really ca n't complain it has enough different sections places for pens a divider pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use i'm curious about the durability how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last i use it to hold 2 1 notebooks a textbook a portfolio a book a calculator and my pda this is about maximum capacity i should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections the handle ontop is cozy the over the shoulder strap should be wider overall i am happy with the purchase and hope that it lasts	1
1	i bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old luvable friend 's onsies are awful the biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies and the velcro does n't even stick they becomes undone and fly loose within minutes also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old lastly even the shirt tag stinks it is this cheap oversized tag that i had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son shame on them for making such a cheap product shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review !	1

0	these are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff levi 's my cutoffs are so faded so frayed so well you know so when i peal them off to reveal this butterfly lace up panty \( in black with the pick laces on the back \) it 's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl we only had two colors at our lingerie party white and the black and pink models but i can imagine all the colors would be nice too	1

0	i have owned a pair of these boots for three years now and they are still going strong i work in construction and find these to comfortable boots whether i am on site at home out on the town etc these are really incredibly made considering their 40 dollar price tag	1
1	i acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit i even complimented her on them i liked so much how they looked on her that i took the time to locate them online \( amazon \) i ordered them with much anticipation that i would also look cute in them needless to say looks are deceiving perhaps they felt better on her than they did on me but i felt like i was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic i was disappointed if there 's nothing i 've learned being a woman in her mid 30s i come to realize that there 's nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes	1
0	these shoes are awesome i have bowled with them for the past couple of weeks and they are just what i was looking for the color is hot and everyone on my league noticed them and said very positive things about them thanks for the super fast shipping and supurb quailty	1
0	pros ultra fast delivery w package tracking item was shipped within a few hours of order suit is in great condition and i like the color cons when they say grab bag that means the suit may or may not look like the picture mine turned out to be a blue stripped jammer which is cool with me cause i actually wanted a blue jammer just be prepared	1
0	the gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties ! it takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but i believe that all gazebos have the same problem	1
1	i just received this dress today not only was it cheaply made \( there are rhinestones missing threads and it does n't flow smoothly \) the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight also the support is badly made i have a very small bust but i do n't think this would compliment anyone who is n't built like barbie definitely would n't recommend it looks great in the picture but it 's not being modelled on a real person	1
1	i liked the boots in the first couple of weeks they are very warm and comfy however they are not at all durable after a month of use the soles had holes my freind who had them experienced the same problem they are great feet warmers when the weather is dry but they are not waterproof	1
1	i expected this bag to be much more comfortable but i have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags however i do like all the compartments for organizing	1
1	very hard to use maybe with a lot of practice it would get easier do n't buy if you are planning to use immediately this is where is i got very discouraged just have n't had the time to play with it so it 's sitting in the box	1
0	i am not a runner thus i use the shoes for typical tasks such as shopping errands hanging out etc i have owned many shoes over the years and these are probably 1 of the 2 most comfortable shoes i have ever owned i am hooked on the new balance line of running shoes	1
0	these are lightweight cotton thermals at a good price i wear a large in most shirts and the large size for these fits snug especially after a wash which is how i like it for wearing as an undershirt if you 're buying for outerwear you might consider going a size larger shipping was n't 'amazon quick' but it was reasonable about a week if i remember right	1
0	i wore these shoes when i worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet ankles knees and hips i could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the teeth in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good being diabetic i am very concerned about circulation and i believe this was a good purchase a little expensive but well worth it in the end i plan on buying more	1
0	the skin fits well the belt clip works well it seems a bit bulkier than my friend 's zen skin belt clip but she paid about 10 more than i did ! i would definitely recommend this product i have yet to use the armband so i ca n't review that right now my only issue is the screen protector fits into the window of the skin not zen screen so the screen protector is smaller than the zen screen the window of the skin covers a couple millimeters of the top of the screen but that part only tells the time anyway	1
0	on time delivery would have been nice to have a gift wrap optio	1
1	slippers finally arrived and i was a little bit dissapointed construction was cheap goose fill was light and overall flimsy if you want to wear it twice then thats what its worth	1

1	the garment i received was labeled large in fact at best it is a small the material and workmanship was good but the product was simply mislabeled	1
0	love this kept couture toiletry kit i actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends the bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel it keeps the leaky goods all inside wo n't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase and it 's a perfect size it can hold about 10 days' worth of toiletries	1
1	this jacket is wind and water resistant but not waterproof i was soked through after first rain i use it mainly for wind block while biking now	1
1	i am vey unhappy with the sales professional in nautica outlet stores i had a very bad experience at nautica store outlet stores the customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional they basically said they do n't really care if they lose one customer other customers will still buy \( if that is the case why are prices slashed by 50 it is because people do not want to pay the full price \) i do not think i will ever buy from nautica a few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company	1
0	i have been a fan of asics shoes for many years my feet tend to overpronate which puts a terrible strain on my knees and arches asics duomax technology allows me to run comfortably which i love to do but stopped for many years due to the strain on my joints until i found these shoes i absolutely love these shoes they have helped me regain the confidence and comfort to enjoy running again this is the only type of shoe i will ever buy and has been the only one i have bought for 7 years now ! i highly recommend this shoe ! especially if your feet tend to overpronate	1

0	please note i did not find the need to order up many sizes i only ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly nice quality boot slippers with excellent traction nice arch support and a just little lift in the heel which relieves pressure from the low back i loves these boots and at a great price too fast efficent shipping as well i should say that i bought a pair of white mountain suede shearling boots and i was disappointed with the sizing as well as the quality	1
1	these did n't do the job as far as keeping my nipples from poking out so much they do have great adhesive also no good if you are trying to hide the darkness of the areola because they are pretty small i used every pair just thinking i was putting them on poorly but everytime i was a pokin	1
1	you have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit properly they only fit properly for one wearing stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry i have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought i would try these you get what you pay for applies to this product	1
1	i have the same jacket in black but i bought this from elsewhere what a rip off it is it is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day i had to remove atleast 20 25 of the feathers since they peek so much i doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers ! ! ! do not buy	1
0	best sock in performance that i have ever tried i buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed no sagging no defects the only reason i toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use one of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again if they ever stopped making them i would buy a 100 pairs just to know i would have them for my liftime there i actually wrote a review on socks !	1
0	this is absolutely one of the most comfortable heels i have in my closet great buy good pric	1
0	this mask attached using some velcro in the rear i love it because it can be removed or put on without taking off my helmet ! at first i had some problems with my glasses fogging up what i did was just pull it extra tight until the material was very snug with my cheeks this drastically reduced fogging i read on another products review that using some medical tape below the eyes would eliminate fogging \( on a similar product \) overall this has been a great buy nic	1
0	the jersey of our 54 got here for my wife in time for super bowl and she was very happy \( with the jersey not grossman	1
0	i did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect however the unisex width is way too wide for me i have a pair of ugg men 's ultimate and they are not as wide overall i still think uggs are a little better and more comfortable	1
1	these boots are very cute and comfortable however they are not leather as stated in the description they are clearly labeled all manmade materials on the inside of the boot since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal but the price i paid is not worth it for non leather boots	1
1	mail fraud i believe its called ! ! texas shirt company if this is a real company never had this item to sell i'm surprise amazon com is even associating with them and mike to get this bent out of shape over a 12 dollar item you need to see someone to address your anger issues	1
1	this product worked well in holding up a strapless bra but after a few hours my skin developed a blister underneath the tape i would rather risk the wardrobe malfunction than have any more blisters so use this product with caution	1
0	i ordered this bra as well as the olga women 's perfect fit full figure black 38ddd this bra provides much better lift support and separation than the olga i think it is because the cups are seamed i 'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature \( i'm 5'2 \) and also has a large bra size \( i'm a 36ddd \)	1
0	if you have the body to show for it by all means wear it alone	1
1	in my case the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough my feet are size 14 and eee width \( but some ee made on wide lasts can fit \) the boots that i received were marked 14 ee but would n't even allow my feet half way in i wish they fit because they look good the quality is good and price unbeatable however i lost 8 50 at the ups when i sent them back	1
0	i love this bra ! it is very comfortable and like the other reviewer said adds a whole cup size ! cheaper than victoria 's secret and well made	1
1	i was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra i loved the cotton one hand closures and the lack of underwires it felt and looked great when i tried it on but after a few hours of wearing it had the classic problem of riding up in the back eventually i gave up wearing it at all i bought mine in a boutique where i was professionally fitted so i had the right size \( 34f \) i 'd recommend a bravada bra for larger sizes they consistently fit great and stay put	1
1	the product is as described and i'm sure for some ladies the product would be great however for whatever reason the stretch lace bodice was irritating to my skin and the material was more see thru than i desired the product is well made with no defects	1
1	does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only supplier does not carry the wide ones birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths not here no exchange possible now i'm stuck with shoes that do n't fit and midwest sports could n't care less i wo n't ever order from them again	1

0	these are my single favorite pair of underwear not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish i'm in the military so at first i thought thongs are not for real men but after wearing these i found they are and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize i wear these for every day activivties sports work and leisure there is n't much fabric so they 're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy after wearing them for a while it 's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it if you 've never owned a thong i think you should give these a shot i definately recomend the 2xist y back thong	1
0	it clearly says it is a mesh dress ! i wore this for my wedding outside in bright sunlight and it certainly did not show everything but do not expect it to be completely opaque as it is a mesh dress with delicate lining as for the quality it wore well and the frayed edges are intentional and part of the design very fairy like and pretty and i was pleased to wear it	1
1	cute designs but they shrink i have to stretch the sheet back out after washing it and when i attempt to put it on the mattress it flips up	1

0	my dh has worn clark oxfords for some time and says they are the best fitting and most comfortable shoes he has ever owned this new pair of clarks the citadel oxford is his new favorite because it is light weight casual and so comfortable	1
0	i bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open nearly to the waist and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little nobody would be able to see anything the nude ones were practically the same color as my skin so they were perfect they also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold the best part was they did n't feel weird at all	1
0	i purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish platinum color they were so comfortable that i purchased two more pair in different colors ! the straps are very comfortable they 're elastic and not tight or constraining the shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes i can wear these shoes for both the am and pm services to church where i usually have to wear a different pair for the pm service because my feet hurt so bad ! it 's hard to find a comfortable pair of heels so when you can find them stock up on them	1

0	these boots look good with everything from jeans to skirts because they are real leather i was expecting to have to break them in before they were comfortable but it only took a few wearings before i could wear them all day with a lot of walking and no sore feet did n't have any problem with them fitting my calves i had that problem with other boots i have tried before even if you do n't consider the great price for all leather boots they are wonderful buy	1
0	the webbing was abundant and easy to cut to my needed length these belts can be made to fit anyone	1
0	must have shoe for bunion and hammertoe sufferers i also have very hot sweaty feet and these are an excellent choice if you share these problems very large toe box and excellent webbing for ventilation very good looking comfortable shoes only qualification is that if you stand on your feet all day or do a lot of walking you may want to pick a shoe with more support these are very lightweight shoes but lack the support a heavier athletic shoe would offer but those type of shoes are usually harder on bunions and my feet get extremely hot in them	1
0	this sandle is very comfortable and attractive i would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of sandle	1

1	these body suits are awful ! when i first saw them i was really relieved that i had found something that would be good for the summer months i put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs ! the suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label i am so disappointed and angry it was a waste of my money	1

0	i really love the way these shoes look i am really picky about shoes i buy i dont like to have my toe cracks showing when i wear shoes and i was afraid that these might do that they actually do show a little toe crack but only at the end where my little toe is i wore these shoes all night on new year 's eve and had no problem i also wore them all day at work and then to the mall afterwards and did have a little discomfort but not as bad as you would expect with shoes this high i love these shoes so much a have 2 pair black and red	1
0	soft durable breathable fabric perfectly flexible for vigorous practice i'm glad i bought these	1
1	awful fit ! i usually love wacoal petites because they are generally a perfect fit for me however the mesh on this one is terrible because it rolls at first i thought it was the size so i purchased another and found the same issue steer clear of this model	1
0	the pj bottoms were soft and of good quality material however i ordered the extra large and they were very small for that size it seemed as though the xl was more a med large i would also think that lounge pants or pj bottoms would be a bit bigger as you would n't want these types of pants too tight they were a gift so i just hope they do n't shrink after washing !	1
1	the main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap i boughtit for my wife to carry all that stuff to work with out the strap it does not work i requested another one got it no strap on the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was if any thing over done gre	1

1	the one size fits all does n't fit my slim body and the item looks made in china if you know what i mean rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong they look much classier than the transparent beads with nylon string of the string of bubbles panty	1
1	the sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body my husband is 6' 178 pounds so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit but this one looked like a stiff kite on him be aware the items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money and only after i had filed a complaint with amazon amazon acted quickly to post the credit	1
1	i bought this shoe and had to return it because it was so narrow i could n't get it on and i do n't have a narrow foot	1
1	when you buy natori you expect the best but this product just is n't up to their usual high standard most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings for 20 dollars they should be awesome they are n't my favorite panty right now is a nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks i have n't seen them online but this is worth a trip to the store	1

0	this is a great wallet ! it fits into small purses the purpose of this is just to hold a few cards your id and a small zipper section for some money it 's not meant to be a complete big wallet i love it because it fits into my small purses and so easy to carry around i do n't have to shove and push my bigger wallets into my purse and not have room for anything else anymore love it !	1
1	these are made of a nice material and good for travelling however the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing as soon as i sit nothing is really being covered with a longer inseam these would be awesome	1
0	i purchased this bag recently for an overseas trip \( along with the 20 nxt roller \) and i'm very happy with it the styling and fit is excellent and it holds more than i expected it 's comfortable to hold in your hand or to sling over your shoulder i purchased the black version with victorinox 's lifetime guarantee you ca n't go wrong ! amazon com is very competitive on price on this bag and though there were a few stores that were cheaper i felt it was worth it to go with amazon if only because i trust them	1
1	i do n't recommend you make purchases here i spent 61 on these items and have only recieved two there has been no explanation as to what happened to the rest of my order or my money patiently i 've waited for over a month for my items to arrive and nothing	1
1	this is a very pretty high quality leather shoe the wedge heel is very steep and the toe is narrow if you are going for looks only they are good if you want any kind of foot comfort skip it	1
1	very very weird fit too short too wide tiny ankles very big and loose above ankle	1
0	the quality is much better than expected i bought one for myself and one for my husband prior to our las vegas trip sept 6 2005 we were able to walk with or hands free because these fannypacks held all of the necessities our cell phones travelers checks keys and medicines in particular we love the spacious divided compartments i highly reccommend this product	1
1	i ordered these based on the picture a high cut brief these are not the ones they sent me and now i have to pay to return them ! rip off ! ! ! zero stars	1
1	i actually had to send this back cause of the size they run really small	1
0	i bought it for my boyfriend for the gym he would carry all his extra gym clothes wallet keys and phone all bundled up in his arms and shove everything in the locker dropping everything along the way he really likes it and especially the extra front pocket allows him to seperate small stuff not very many other products have that extra pocket very sturdy material and the size is just right	1
0	the zipper wallet is a product with a practical idea that is long overdue it is a known fact tha all leather wallets stretch resulting in important items such as credit cards and drivers lisence etc slipping out making identity theft a serious possibilty the zipper wallet avoids this from happening ironicly this item is not available at local stores i encourage everyone to try this product and see for yourself how useful it is in the everyday worldyours truly joe alvare	1
1	i 've purchased several of these bras in the past from qvc as their ad states and was surprised to see it so cheap here though i was suspicious i ordered one anyway not surprisingly the cups puckered when i tried it on never had this problem with any ordered from qvc when i inquired about returning it i was disappointed to find they have a no return policy \( though not posted anywhere i could find easily \) i believe this company sells '2nds' though does not advertise that fact i will not purchase from this company again and i am now leery about purchasing through amazon in general	1
1	these were a waste of money they were not properly designed to cover anything much less my backside even though i did order what should have been the right size i realize i have a lot to cover but i ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick i 've still got a pair in white that i have n't even opened ! and wo n't ! it would be a waste of energy !	1
0	if other underware binds you you have finally found one that doesn't the pouch is very large lots of room ! i bought an additional dozen and threw all my other brands away	1
1	this shoe is n't as comfortable as my other keds shoes it also does n't breath as well if you have a tendency to develope hot feet this would n't be a good purchase for you it also needs the new insoles that the newer keds shoes have	1
1	this is a piece of garbage it 's cute looking and just barely will fit just your ds and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth but as far as any kind of long term travel functionality look elsewhere the charger does n't fit in there very well which i do n't think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case i was able to squeeze both my ds lite and the charger in there for awhile but recently the zipper broke and i had to split it apart to get to my stuff and now it 's useless if all you want is something to carry just the ds in this is a decent option otherwise forget it	1
1	not very good pictures or description wallet was smaller than i expected quality was ok not competitively priced	1
1	it 's awful the s size is too big for me \( my waistline is 34 and in the sizing chart it says size s fits 26 36 \) so i end up cut it and sew it back so it can fit on me then after 3 days of wearing it the velcro is messed up it can not attached together anymore the costumer service is an answering machine \( i tried several times to call the costumer service and only get the machine answer my call \) i can not return the item because it says its illegal to return this kind of item so my advise dont buy this item or you 'll be sorry	1
0	my child slept with these shoes on the first night he got it i allowed it because he has not worn it outside of course he wore it the following day to school rode his bike with it and just took it off at the end of the day very comfortable and cute shoes i might get a pair for myself	1

0	these panties fit great wash after wash great quality and very smooth under dress or pant	1
1	it has a very loose fit and i feel a little silly but pulling it out of the package i totally forgot how exactly this thing should look on me it is made like a very unflattering potato sack sadly	1
0	great item ! have already used several times and is exactly as is described	1
1	it is a horrible item if i could have given this hairagami a no star rating i would have and to think i wasted almost 20 for this junk it snaps unexpectedly all the time and always while you are twirling the hair it totally tangles the hair it is a nightmare to get out of your child's hair my oldest 12 really wanted this hairagami and was totally disappointed she told all her friends not to buy it	1
0	we have always bought stride rite shoes for our son however the cost can be overwhelming when you are buying a new pair every three months ! i was excited to find these here at such an awesome price they are identical to those in the store and my son loves wearing them	1
0	i purchased one of these cases for my sister in law and she liked it so much that i bought one for me too i really like it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a great carrying case for their ds lite the vendor that shipped both of the cases did a great job of a quick shipment of a case that met all expectations i would purchase from them again without hesitation	1
1	i broke through the toe on the second wearing lousy product	1
1	beware this is a little girls camisole and cheap looking	1
1	this suit fits like a true italian size i ordered a 54 which equals a us 44 approximately it fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should even though the body length was normal for a regular i think these suits are defects rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long so i would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves	1
1	look it 's on sale ! usually 800 00 now you can get it for only 150 00 and you wo n't find anyone else wearing this original make your drunken friends dizzy with envy spill anything on this shirt it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill worth every penny as a bonus you can also wear this shirt while hunting	1
0	the boots arrived packaged in their original packaging and individually wrapped inside these boots will never disappoint they are fun warm comfy and stylish ! dont forget to spray with silicon before taking them out	1
0	i love these underwear i have not bought them from amazon yet but i plan to i will wear them until jockey stops making them i have worn these for the past 3 years or so and they are so soft and comfortable highly recommended	1
1	i bought 2 lilyette embroidered minimizer bra 's here and both of them broke within one week i have never had such a negative experience with a product before where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment they broke right away since i do n't know how to get my money back or an adjustment this cost me approx 60 for a loser of a purchase my suggestion do n't waste your money on this one	1
1	the color that i received and the color that was online was not the same i shipped it back had to pay for the shipping and handling and insurance myself tried to resolve through hungry lion but they claimed the color was never shown online when it was hungry lion did say i would get a refund on the item still have not checked to see if i have received credit yet still waiting for my statement	1
0	this is the best of the small front pocket wallets available other front pocket wallets have gimmicky designs that do n't work well this is designed on the same pattern as a full size wallet only reduced to 4x3 inches holds three cards bills and id as well as having a little room under the id card for business cards great buy	1
1	only the front of the bag is actually beaded and the quality poor the original price should have been 5 or fewer to be reasonable this would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory	1
0	for years i wore asics the gt the cumulus the nimbus but i have to say if you 're fan of any asics shoes named after clouds you should try the trigon 4 very similar but cheaper also they did not joke when they called it the ride it has a very smooth transition and insane cushion but a little more support than asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight a big thumbs \( toes \? \) up	1
1	this set is made of thin scratchy cheap fabric ! there is no shape to the gown awful	1
0	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	1
1	ordered gray they shipped black since it is from canada i'm not even going to waste return shipping charges minor inconvenience yet still folks i ordered gray ! pants are also not new the tags are ripped and torn it looks like return or wholesale merchandise i feel cheated angry but mostly just disappointed for shame people for shame	1

1	i hate this bra the elastic band is not soft and rolls up as the day wears on shoulder straps are skinny inadequate only good thing is that it is low cut i prefer my 12 nursing bras purchased at wal mart i only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low cut	1
1	quality was terrible undersized or seconds later i saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1 3 of this price i would not recommend these to anyonei paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere it is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface i am disgusted with this product	1
0	this is the standard style from the new line of performance jocks from bike this waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch but very comfortable the pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps do n't twist or bind easy to launder and pretty inexpensive i got rid of my old worn out jocks and bought a few of these new ones they 're masculine modern and comfortable but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym \( like an orange or blue jock \) a good buy comes in a black version that is also great i 've worn for working out and just around town good for both	1
1	i was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policyi made a mistake by buying i	1
1	i washed this garment according to the recommendation and it shrank about 2 sizes to the point i can no longer wear it bummer after just wearing it once	1
1	i received the night gown tried it on and actually hated it the built in bra was loose as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top the straps are too wide the rest of the gown was okay although it too seemed too drapey and long i sent the gown back 3 weeks ago now and have still not received a refund i am very disappointed with the whole transaction product	1
0	when i play basketball or in the past when i did jiu jitsu then too anyway they keep me warm and tight like a brace in the way that so my muscels do n't pull or cramp anyway i guess they look o k too but who would see them anyway they're underwear ! ! ! ! take care and good luck	1

0	the presentation of the product is claer and attractive and the product is durable comfortable and goodlooking	1
1	i have a small head and it makes it look huge ! maybe if i had a big head it would look alright pfff	1
1	in general i do n't think much of the manufacture of the scrubs that are sold for medical professionals i thought dickies would be the best but found they are mostly like the others after i received these i ordered dove apparel which are more expensive but thicker of material and sturdier of make	1
0	the product was as advertised and delivered on time	1
1	out of style ! all the girls make fun of me for wearing levi jeans they say it is a sure sign of being old and out of style the fit quality durability and comfort level do not seem to be as good as they were two decades ago there is definitely a noticeable difference and not a positive one the price far exceeds the value overpriced !	1
0	birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet i found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking	1
0	this is just the perfect accessory for the cats costume one of my dancers is using for our dance recital got this in gray and brown too ! took a while for the product to get here in fact i had to re order because of the delay but when finally the product arrived it was worth the wait	1
1	i ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product i received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame that is where the only star i am giving is coming from i am concerned with having a good supportive bra i have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years this bra is the farthest thing from supportive i had to cut the straps and re sew them to make them shorter so i could even where it the material is soft but thin and stretchy i have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and i will not again	1
1	this product never made it to destination it was purchased with pants to match \( which were pin striped and did n't \) and it was never sent to the recipient nor was i invoiced so i am currious if the seller plans to at this point or even if they intend to send the correct pants \? \? \? all i know is that with everything else being late for shipping durring the holiday and the wrong products otherwise i will not purchase from this seller again	1
1	this bra is one of the most uncomfortable bra 's i 've tried it 's seems to be made cheaply and digs into my skin i would not recommend it	1
1	i was mislead by the advertisement the shorts are skin thin and do n't have pockets in them quality it is ok for what they really are pijama shorts maybe it is my problem 'cause i am not a native english language speaker maybe not	1
1	i had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while i type they keep the office i work at at very cold temperatures these gloves seeemed perfect because many fingerless gloves do n't have fingerless thumbs but these gloves do the cost was only 2 99 for a pair of black or navy gloves i ordered the black pair well the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing there are many stray strands at the fingers they snag easily they are warm and i would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily but i did only pay 2 99 for them so i guess it 's a case of you get what you pay for	1
