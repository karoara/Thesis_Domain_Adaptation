0	i loved the look of the boot the price was great i guess you get what you pay for they run a size small there is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location you break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off believe me i tried i really wanted to keep the boots based on the look once on they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all i am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe i tend to be pretty easy i just could not make these work ! sorry	0

1	as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present one size fits all it becomes increasingly difficultfor those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit inanything other than the most expensive brands these shoesare well made and an excellent value the only negativeis that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacerto make them narrow the heel tends to wallow a little bit inmy particular case	0
0	they run much smaller than birkenstocks i sent the size 44 back \( which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks is it the boston \? \) and got the 45 and it still feels small the upper is ok the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate it 's just the size thing that bothered me	0

0	broke within 12 hours of purchase very cumbersome and non flexible for different types of cars would n't recommend	0
0	i did n't pay much for these so i had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag they repel water from the outside just fine but they also keep it in they might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them but that is hard to do in a pinch go for it otherwise invest in something better i certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	0

0	maybe just maybe someone will buy one of these stick up bulbs and maybe just maybe the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out i thought to myself buy another one because maybe this one was defective i bought three more every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use it 's a great idea but a worthless piece of junk the spare bulb \? useless as well do n't waste a dollar on this junk if i could have found the receipts i would have gotten my money back	0

1	i ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well i 've been wearing birks and various varieties of them for years i'm always very satisfied with the fit delivery time and the customer service that i receive from midwest sports i wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow but as soon the walkways and streets are clear i'm back in them with thicker socks of course they can be a little stiff at times but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing you will love them like no other	0

1	i really liked my tote bag what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag stuffed in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship that was foul ! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much	0

1	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than 30 retail price even on sale was 60 the jacket arrived in about a week its nice and warm very good quality the upper torso shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear it fits great and looks good only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little but all in all i'm very pleased	0

1	this is a heavy thick robe i expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly i am 5'8 and the sleeves are only slightly to long but i do n't even notice now the comfort level is amazing this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed i cant speak on durability as i 've only had it for a month or so but you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel i got the brown color and i love it i feel like grisly adams in this thing	0

0	in the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable but it shows it in a smaller size than the one i wear so once i opened the box i was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome it could not possibly be worn with a low cut top which is why i bought it if you were a size 34d or above beware	0
0	i found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it 's worn the more it loses shape the shoulder straps i did n't find had enough support hooks for lift up i personally would n't recommend this bra	0

1	i have owned and worn this for several months now and it is very durable and warm as well ! i would just be cautious about the unisex sizing as i am a medium sized person \( 10 12 \) and it does seem to be a little large yet i wear it anyways hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size	0

0	i absolutely agree with brett a warner these replacements feel horrible they do n't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 's on i bought them at a local store which did not take returns so they just sit in the closet if you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will i wear a 11 1 2	0
1	i was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years yet was n't going to take years to pay for ! \( ha ! ha ! \) this is a nice checkbook cover for the money my only complaint is that it needs to have a tab to keep your check register open to the page you are working on however it does have a loop to keep a pen inside you should desire to do so all in all a good buy	0
0	these broke within the first 3 days of use 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located	0
1	and i am very pleased with them they are very comfortable ! ! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	0
0	buying this was a mistake this bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt the straps are not comfortable it 's cuts deep into the shoulders it should be atleast padded def not what i expected from this product the material and pattern is the only thing i liked it has a sexy look to it	0
0	i agree with the other review i love the tag free feeling but that was about all i liked about this bra the fabric seems really cheap after maybe 6 washings my barely there cc tagfree was feeling flimsy and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill for what they charge for even basic bras these days i definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months ! i would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric	0
0	very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers relegated to cleaning after just one use	0
1	i give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle i ordered i like it delivery is fast i will order something else	0

1	as the weather has cooled for fall and winter i needed socks for my baby i initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just did n't hold up as well i have also tried socks with grips on the bottom but they were so thick my son just sweated in them the children 's place socks are not too thick and very durable also the non slip feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked the other socks did not ! i strongly recommend these socks for your child	0
1	i just recieved my shoes today and ca n't believe that these shoes fit perfectly the wide size 8 5 is just what i needed i am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as i would often have with other shoes i love the value as i purchased these for only 19 79	0
0	the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face however the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that i first used it it hasnt torn completely yet nevertheless i would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon i wouldnt suggest this produc	0

1	this is my 2nd set of these type of curlers the last ones stayed with me for three years they are so good i stopped using the big home set and use these type daily heat up fast great lasting curl \( particularly for hard to curl fine hair \) and do n't even need to leave them in that long would have given them a 5 but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl recommend getting or using a set of the old fashioned wire clips that come with most non travel sets if you want a smoother curl	0

0	did not fit well at all way too big around the ankles every step i took the boot would start to fall off they were the right size length wise and all just way too wide above my ankle they were about half as tall as they looked in the photo which was very disappointing i sent the boot back at my own expense the same day i would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first then ordering it off of here for cheaper	0

0	i just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs \( from another online company \) because they seemed inexpensive durable and came in many fun colors i was sorely disappointed the colors are pretty but the material is crummy its rough flimsy and feels like plastic the pastel colors \( citron cool mint etc \) are almost see through and definitely show patterned underwear the tops run quite large \( i wear a 6 8 on top and the medium is very roomy i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again \)	0

1	these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look they also are easy on the feet i like the suede versions best personally but when winter hits its best to have the leather	0
1	comfy tough lightweight wrinkly \( like me \) surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is good stitching velcro back pockets will save your wallet ! does n't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear freak cargo pockets not for the tidy country club set who need creases on everything but just perfect for active soccer dads or when the family hound insists on playing fetch with muddy logs and the like	0

1	the footbed on these clogs is very comfortable but buyer beware the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily \( in my case after two wearings \) the seller 's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside they wo n't take them back i had to sew the buckles back on in my opinion 100 shoes should n't need to be repaired after two wearings the suede is also much darker than the picture still a pleasant color but not what i expected when i ordered	1

1	this was my first online shoe order i figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip on i'm usually in a size 11 or 12 so i ordered a 12 while my feet are pretty wide i 've never had to purchase wide shoes these shoes were incredibly tight they were long by about an inch but the width was unbearably constricted they reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock climbing boots i really had to squish to get my feet in the result was so uncomfortable these are going back i would n't have expected this from 'slip on' shoes it gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great	1

1	these shoes look great on however are extremely uncomfortable they run very small in size \( i went up 1 1 2 sizes from what i normally wear in sm brand \) i would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot	1

1	i bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for christmas she loved it the downside the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off we would have returned it but it was christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat we ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine ! i guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone 's head	1

0	good construction and material for the price size seems a bit different in l vs r unless i am more asymmetrical now than i noticed before \? nice sheepskin material i am hoping this lasts longer than the previous moc i purchased by acorn	1
1	the fabric is a little stiff at first bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes the elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric after a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable while cheap and nicely packaged these things suck spend some money on decent underwear	1
0	now i'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be backpacks i spent about two months searching for a new one until i finally came across this particular model i 'll start with by saying that i love this damn thing it has plenty of space a whole bunch of extra cords that i suppose a hiker would use but i think just look nice and its very durable \( which is a must for me since everything i own will take a beating \) i'm telling you straight from the horse 's mouth this backpack is worth the money now if it only came as an 18 slot	1

0	this shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt it is unlined has a bit of stretch for comfort and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts i think it runs true to size and matches the color on screen i bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt it was almost thirteen dollars then but i have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal	1
0	this was inexpensive attractive excellent windbreaker only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip	1
1	i absolutely loved this bra when i first put it on but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm i thought it was just a rare occurence but i bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime they cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them i am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire	1

0	i have to tell anyone who has lower back or foot pain to try a pair of merrells when you try them on they feel comfortable but once you wear them for a week you 'll never wear another brand of footwear \( unless you have to \) most of their shoes need no break in time i own these in four different colors my eldest daughter owns two pairs of these i own more than 20 pairs of merrells i have been wearing these for years the cool thing about them is when you see someone else wearing a pair it 's like you 're both in on a secret you know you 're walking in heaven	1

1	wow the headband on this skull cap is cutting off mycirculation ! it is way too tight for casual wear also the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty hose andyour hair will poke through if you have a buzz cut like me if you 're not an athlete then do n't buy this skull cap it 's meant primarily for bald football players to wearunder their helmets	1

0	i like this dress i am medium sized and bought size medium and the dress fits just like on the model shown with even a little extra i think even if i would of get size small it would still fit well with more trim fit look it is basically like a super long tank with body contour nice to wear around house when you just want to quickly through something on but also want to look good in it \( it is way more flattering than wearing boyfriend 's long tea shirt if you understand what i am saying \) it is soft comfortable cozy beautiful color i am very pleased with this product	1
0	love them they feel as comfortable as tennis shoes and give the right support when doing a lot of walking but at the same time they look more hip and dressier then tennis shoes	1
0	i got so many compliments on these shoes the first time i wore them to work they are very pretty and preppy looking i wore them with slacks and a matching cable knit sweater the green is very bright so they do n't match everything but it 's a standout accessory wore them without socks and had no blisters	1

1	if you return items amazon will charge you for shipping both ways whether the product was satisfactory or not do n't buy from amazon	1
1	even though i bought these for 9 99 i still somewhat regret it the quality of the jacket is really poor every parts of the jacket is poorly constructed from the pockets to the zippers while wearing it the jacket smells like paint or what they used to bleach the colors on i hope the smell gets out after washing i am a little concerned whether the colors will rub off easily when i wash it and onto my other clothes	1
0	these boots are warm and comfortable like my sheepskin slippers my feet are toasty even when it 's freezing outside they have a thicker sole than some other styles which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice i love the warm brown of the chestnut they look great ! at 50 off the price was great too	1

1	i love vanity fair their bras just fit me perfectly when this bra arrived i quickly found it was not vanity fair not only that but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material i tried it on in hopes it may fit it was the most uncomfortable bra i have ever tried on not because of size it was bulky rough and obviously inexpensively made the tag said something along the lines of made in hong kong	1
0	great buy for 20 bucks they look nice and fit well they are distressed but it is not as bad as i thought it would be from reading the other reviews they look nice with jeans and a dark shirt pretty comfy too	1
1	i loved the look of the boot the price was great i guess you get what you pay for they run a size small there is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location you break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off believe me i tried i really wanted to keep the boots based on the look once on they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all i am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe i tend to be pretty easy i just could not make these work ! sorry	1
0	i love these crocs ! they are much more comfortable than the original style and i like the two tone color combo i wear them even in the winter	1
0	as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present one size fits all it becomes increasingly difficultfor those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit inanything other than the most expensive brands these shoesare well made and an excellent value the only negativeis that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacerto make them narrow the heel tends to wallow a little bit inmy particular case	1
1	they run much smaller than birkenstocks i sent the size 44 back \( which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks is it the boston \? \) and got the 45 and it still feels small the upper is ok the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate it 's just the size thing that bothered me	1

1	i have been wearing boyshorts for ages and i gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute the fit is horrible ! ! ! the seam down the middle constantly rides up into very uncomfortable places i mean the whole point of a boyshort is to not have to pick wedgies ! i even bought them a size larger because some brands tend to fit a little snug	1

1	broke within 12 hours of purchase very cumbersome and non flexible for different types of cars would n't recommend	1
1	i did n't pay much for these so i had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag they repel water from the outside just fine but they also keep it in they might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them but that is hard to do in a pinch go for it otherwise invest in something better i certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	1

1	these pants were washed one time following the washing instructions they were not put in the dryer and they shrunk not only around but lengthwise i had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems i look forward to your reply	1
1	maybe just maybe someone will buy one of these stick up bulbs and maybe just maybe the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out i thought to myself buy another one because maybe this one was defective i bought three more every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use it 's a great idea but a worthless piece of junk the spare bulb \? useless as well do n't waste a dollar on this junk if i could have found the receipts i would have gotten my money back	1

1	should n't amazon address this in some way \? if it is real i would buy it if it is fake \( and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score \) should n't this be off amazon 's site \? i think it becomes an issue of amazon 's credibility	1

1	really cute boots but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they were n't supported and about to slide out the 4 heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and i had to take these off after half a day my next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help	1

0	i ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well i 've been wearing birks and various varieties of them for years i'm always very satisfied with the fit delivery time and the customer service that i receive from midwest sports i wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow but as soon the walkways and streets are clear i'm back in them with thicker socks of course they can be a little stiff at times but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing you will love them like no other	1

0	before seeing it with my own eyes i was a little skeptical of the huge buttons after wearing it i felt they were hardly noticable i bought the brown version for 17 99 and i thought it was well worth it this jacket is surprisingly wind resistant ideal for cold weathers the pockets on either side are so huge that you can practically store a couple of cell phones in there	1

0	i really liked my tote bag what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag stuffed in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship that was foul ! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much	1
1	the pic that i ordered showed a knee length half slip instead i received 3 long half slips from her room i cannot use the long half slips and i sent them back also i had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and could n't find where to apply that so the cost was put on my visa thanks jeanne alle	1

1	i have to say that i was disappointed when i opened up the package containing my ipod wallet it 's cute but not 60ish cute first of all it 's not leather it 's nylon the lining is indeed suede but the photos in the product listing are misleading i'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back etc is n't worth it it does the job but it was n't what i was expecting i feel ripped off	1

1	i have found gerber brand clothing to be disappointing the do n't stand up to laundering very well in that they shrink quite a bit they already seem small for the size on the label but it gets worse after you wash and dry them \( even on the delicate cycle \) my 6 week old was already wearing onesies and sleepers sized 3 6 months ! it 's worth spending the extra money for a better brand such as carter 's	1

0	this is by far the most comfortable pair of unders i 've ever worn over the years i 've gone with boxers and with briefs and in the boxers vs briefs contest both are losers compared to the contour thong there 's no elastic to chafe the legs yet there is full support the contour thong has a y thong back and you do n't need to have the body of an international male undergear model to wear these for any guy with an open mind i recommend these just buy one or two pairs and give a try	1
1	the color you think you purchased might turned out to be completely different i recently ordered a blue one from the image i was expecting a light baby blue skin but when i finally got it it 's a dark navy blue it looks nothing like the one shown also it 's constantly attracting dust i am very disappointe	1

1	like every review before mine my order was wrong as well the picture is incorrect and needs to be updated i waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design yes it 's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund i strongly feel that if amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner is this just another big uncaring corporation \? this experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with amazon for anything again	1
0	it 's really hard to buy scrub pants on line because everyone is different cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality i think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite by the time i finished hemming them i did n't have that cute slit at the bottoms they wash well and wear well	1

1	i loved this bra when i first got it a year ago it gave me great support it looked great and i was the happiest with a bra that i have ever been my girls are in the f range so it has been difficult to find the right size a year later the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it i am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost 70 for one bra they are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time one year just does n't work for me	1

0	i love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that ca n't be worn with a bra but the nipple issue was quite vexing i did n't feel comfortable with any nip protrusion the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply but problem solved these things rock	1
0	i love this shoe ! it looks very elegant on the foot and there 's a little bit toe cleavage which is always a plus ! but make sure to go half a size up it 's a little snug in the front and it takes a couple wears to break it in	1

0	i really like the speedo suit i wear two swim suits the speedo and a larger drag suit over it i 've done this since my days on the swim team the chlorine in the water tends to weaken the seams on my suit over time causing the drag suit to self destruct eventually having the speedo prevents any embarrassing moments the fit and material is good and it holds up very well this is the first replacement i 've needed in years if you are husky this might be a tight fit i wear a 42 44 pant size and this is on the snug side	1
1	i was so disappointed in these i am full busted \( 38dd \) and my nipples are sensitive and show through my bra and shirts all the time i used a band aid and it did a better job these provided no help at all and they really hurt taking them off	1

1	i washed 'em and they shrunk up so small i ca n't wear 'em anymore bummer	1
0	it 's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather but great in keeping the chill off when you 're out and about or at the game the blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on mlb baseball caps \( also has the mlb logo on back \) it folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare the price is great and makes a great gift	1
1	i 've ordered from this seller before and the dress i recieved from the previously was perfect while delivered promptly this dress was not as it was pictured the bodice of the dress is barely ruched at all and ends up giving the appearance of being lumpy and ill fitting unless i wanted to put several hours into altering it it 's basically too unflattering to wear	1
0	if you are a grandma on a budget it can be difficult to find useful items for grandsons i thought that this was a good buy at 7 99 for my 11 year old grandson for either his birthday or christmas i would have given five stars but there was not a complete list of teams offered	1

1	i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front the boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy and the ties up the back looked awful it might be good for someone with a different figure than mine but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it	1

0	i bought these for my husband and he loves them the material is soft and comfortable and they keep his feet warm they are also easier to slip on and off than his previous pair of slippers he wears 11 1 2 wide so i got him the xl pair and they fit him well	1
1	i bought 3 fleece with different size but the size of the fleece are not proper though it says medium large xl everything was in same size and the length is not proper as the measurement mentioned	1
1	the 2 bras i ordered were they same style it even said so on the labels attached however they both look and feel different the white has a lot more padding a rounder shape and the lining is tearing away from the padding \( part of the design \) the navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding \( which is what i wanted in the first place \) i was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had in addition i had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen i was not informed that it would have to be backordered not happy with my overall experience	1

0	great overall shirt good quality wears well wear it proudly	1
0	very nice basic clothing i think the size is fine i really like being able to find these shades of green though i have decided the lighter shade is really a feminine color this is the only brand that i can find these muted greens	1
0	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than 30 retail price even on sale was 60 the jacket arrived in about a week its nice and warm very good quality the upper torso shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear it fits great and looks good only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little but all in all i'm very pleased	1
1	these were not as expected there was no cap to cover the holes where the wheels are at so if he decided to take out the wheels there was just an open hole he has problems using these too !	1
1	unfortunately the pads made my skin break out and gave me a painful rash i think that if they work for you they would be wonderful but if you have sensitive skin they are not for you i love the idea i am a leaky faucet and i would love an easy breast pad that worked i am sick of sleeping with my bra on hopefully by the time i have my next child they will come up with something even more breathable	1

0	this is a lovely lovely bra it supports lifts and minimizes creating a flattering shape underneath clothing the wide straps are gentle on the shoulders leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear the back does n't ride up and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor the plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t shirt and dare i say it looks pretty sexy yes you can be well supported and attractive bless ye st olga	1

1	this is definitely not something i would want to wear while working out even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky and the fabric does not appear to breathe i 'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this for cooler weather i 'd prefer something like a good pair of tights \( sugoi for example \)	1
1	the little knobs in the sole of the sandals started breaking off soon after i got the sandals i have had these sandals before and this did n't happen maybe they redesigned the sole with narrower and thus more fragile nubs all i know is they are junk	1

0	i bought this for my wife as a throw in with more expensive items because it was so cheap i actualy forgot i even ordered it until it came in i was pleasantly surprised when she modeled it for me unlike a lot of stuff it looks exactly like the picture she is a size small and it fit perfect this not something most would wear out however as its insanly short which is great for me the only thing that could improve this piece is a matching thong which is hard to find in lime green so maybe black would be a better choice if your trying to match things up	1
1	accustomed to the zipper pull tab being on the right hand side all my other zippered garments come that way this turfer men 's endurance shell jacket has the pull tab on the left side which makes using it feel majorly awkward would not buy again for that reason this shell is otherwise nicely made	1

0	once while traveling i had a big blister on my heel and needed something that would n't rub my heel i happened to get a pair of crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front i was pleasantly surprised by the crocs very cushiony soft like walking on air also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet do n't get sweaty either i originally got the crocs for temporary use but now i look forward to slipping into them everyday when i get home it 's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step they 've replaced my slippers mocassins surf shoes and sandals	1

1	i bought this for a woman who is a small size eight one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose not this tiny shirt it looked all right when she opened the package but when she wore it it made the kid look as if she had flub it was inexpensive enough that i wo n't bother returning it but the item although well made was sized so small as to be useles	1
0	this polo is absolutely fabulous ! i love the length it comes down to my hips i bought it in the size i usually wear and it fits great ! i wore it under a little khaki jacket with jeans and it looked fantastic i ca n't wait to buy it in every color	1
0	love hush puppies they are comfortable and i can get a heel low enough for me to be comfortable	1
0	this is a heavy thick robe i expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly i am 5'8 and the sleeves are only slightly to long but i do n't even notice now the comfort level is amazing this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed i cant speak on durability as i 've only had it for a month or so but you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel i got the brown color and i love it i feel like grisly adams in this thing	1
1	these shoes were very cute as i thought they would be from the pictures but because of the sides being so short they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking especially when going up stairs i returned them after only wearing them for 1 day	1
1	i ordered the black one according to the photo provided it was supposed to be black with white seams but when i received it it was all black once i put it on it fitted perfectly but it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size	1
1	lookslike it would be a nice product but it 's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches my baby is very long and just does n't fit wish target amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing	1
1	shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige which leads you to think the color is mostly white the true color is neither ! there is absolutely no white in these shoes i purchased these shoes because i needed some white off white shoes not beige shoes no i did not return them it 's too much of a hassel to return things so i kept them and i have worn them once but do not like the color at all the style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain the materials are an excellent quality if you like beige earthtones you will like these shoes	1
1	ibought these socks for the purported thermal heating qualities i was still cold just a regular average socks easy to wash and dry so great for travelling nothing more	1
1	apparently there is an error in the item description these are not gore tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive i new they probably were not waterproof when i put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway stupid me	1
0	the disney cars shoes were awesome for my grandson he loved the racing lights and the wheels on the sides they are somewhat tight because of the elestic on the insides but they were a big hit for him	1
1	in the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable but it shows it in a smaller size than the one i wear so once i opened the box i was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome it could not possibly be worn with a low cut top which is why i bought it if you were a size 34d or above beware	1
1	i found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it 's worn the more it loses shape the shoulder straps i did n't find had enough support hooks for lift up i personally would n't recommend this bra	1
1	i ordered 5 of these belt buckles the company sent the wrong items 2 times before finally admitting they did n't actually have this belt i needed the belts for a deadline and if they had told me the first time that it was n't in stock i could have ordered it elsewhere	1
0	they were slightly small and a tad too stiff but very cut	1
0	i love these shoes they are so comfortable and give great support these are my second pair the merchant got them to me really fast and i appreciate that though when i ordered i thought the amazon site specified free shipping so i was surprised at that	1
0	i have owned and worn this for several months now and it is very durable and warm as well ! i would just be cautious about the unisex sizing as i am a medium sized person \( 10 12 \) and it does seem to be a little large yet i wear it anyways hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size	1
0	protects the vision m without restricting it 's use or synch connection flip screen provides extra protection but does n't always stay in place shipping took a little longer than expected \( more than a week \) but was reasonable	1
0	very good quality nice leather sturdy and can be used for anything big enough as a book bag great carry on a purse etc i am very satisfied with my purchase the bag is made in the states and a great price for a quality made item i highly recommend this leather bag	1
0	these sweatpants are extremely comfortable reasonably priced and come in a variety of colors definetly a great buy	1
1	i was very disappointed in the shoes i were them to work and within 1 hour then strap on them broke i love the way they look but not the quality of them i would take them in every color made if they were worth the money spent on them	1
0	i'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability i just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in arizona to wear them more often	1
0	my 9 year old nephew told me he wanted under armour for christmas i had no idea what he was talking about i asked under arm deoderant \? undershirt \? i was ever the un cool aunt for not knowing what he wanted i found out that 3 of my friends experienced the same thing \) the shirt runs very tight and even though my nephew is smaller for his age the large just barely fit him he asked for a second one for his birthday \( and so did my sister so she could get the shirt off of him and wash it \) the kid loves it and if he gives it 5 stars so do i	1
1	the pants that i ordered for my size were very small they were n't true to size at all i would not recommend this item to anyone	1
0	this is one of the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn the high top really supports your ankle and the shoe itself is form fitting and not one of those big bulkly tennis shoes it 's light weight and flexilble but still supportive well worth 30	1
0	i love the shoes they 're quite comfortable even though the heel is a little higher than what i like they 're a beautiful color something you do n't always see and quite eye catching and they just so happened to go very well with a suit i purchased months ago as a nine west fantatic thank you amazon for having them available !	1
0	i am very happy with my velour slippers they are a perfect fit and very comfortable i received my order promptly and plan to order again in the future	1
0	these were really easy for my little girl to put on herself they were well make and very light weight i like the ridges in the surface and hope they will help keep her feet dry and prevent the shoes from getting super stinky	1
0	great leggings i love the feel of these thicker than the regular cotton lycra leggings and they hold you in nicely one thing i like about danskin is the waist elastic is not tight it just rests on your waist it 's extremely comfortable gusseted cotton crotch is also a plus i wear these to yoga pilates on hikes with my dog and just about everywhere else oh and they look much more expensive than the cotton leggings i even wear them in 90 degree weather i just ca n't get enough of them i have always appreciated danskin quality just machine wash and dry and off you go	1
1	she said it was not very good and ended up not wearing it at all	1
1	the battery function did n't work discovered poor battery wiring inside i might try troubleshooting it myself with an ammeter and some soldering i'm not surprised by the crude construction from a 11 item however the hand grips themselves are worth the money no more cramped hands	1
0	these sunglasses are all right they were a little crooked but still cool	1
1	i bought a green ipod scok thinking the it would be that same as the picture they show at the top of the page but it ended up having a lighter green than what they showed and what i wanted	1
0	my son loves the shoes they are comfortable and very stylish they do not show dirt like other shoes they look to be made well and designed very nice too	1
1	these were a gift at christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much !	1
0	this was my first time using amazon and it was great i have bought other things over the net but by far this was the most seamless lets do it again next time lawhote	1
1	i ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever growing collection of credit cards grocery store cards insurance cards club cards hotel cards airline cards you get the point i was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the accardion from collapsing enough to zip close i ca n't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card i would not recommend this product	1
1	i bought one pair of shoes and returned them they were to large bought another pair and hoped that i would adjust to the shoe i haven t i have worn the shoes now and can not return them i plan to give them away to someone they may fit i will never order shoes again i learned my lesson i agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size i believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price i will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before i buy as i have in the past	1
1	this bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable the lace cups is n't feel like flour sack material	1
0	i am very pleased with these shoes they are very comfortable and look great as well	1
1	i have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable i could not wait to take it off champion should stick to making sports bra do not buy this bra or you will suffer plus it looks much thinner in the picture it is really thick it feels like a maternity bra ugh	1
1	bought one for my new ipod nano a total disappointment very poorly made only glued together not stiched up it already started to go apart you wo n't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one 's self when walking or working out it looks pretty but that is all	1
1	i absolutely agree with brett a warner these replacements feel horrible they do n't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 's on i bought them at a local store which did not take returns so they just sit in the closet if you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will i wear a 11 1 2	1
0	i was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years yet was n't going to take years to pay for ! \( ha ! ha ! \) this is a nice checkbook cover for the money my only complaint is that it needs to have a tab to keep your check register open to the page you are working on however it does have a loop to keep a pen inside you should desire to do so all in all a good buy	1
1	these broke within the first 3 days of use 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located	1
0	and i am very pleased with them they are very comfortable ! ! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	1
1	buying this was a mistake this bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt the straps are not comfortable it 's cuts deep into the shoulders it should be atleast padded def not what i expected from this product the material and pattern is the only thing i liked it has a sexy look to it	1
1	i agree with the other review i love the tag free feeling but that was about all i liked about this bra the fabric seems really cheap after maybe 6 washings my barely there cc tagfree was feeling flimsy and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill for what they charge for even basic bras these days i definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months ! i would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric	1
1	very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers relegated to cleaning after just one use	1
0	i give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle i ordered i like it delivery is fast i will order something else	1
1	the photo is quite deceiving this suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap shiny and is horrible to the touch my three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit	1
0	fit well great for all kinds of athletic workouts i'm ready to buy a couple more pairs	1
0	i love these boots ! i got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect i can fit pants in them or over them and i have not had a problem yet	1
0	the earmuffs are very nice quality and the color was perfect for my daughter	1
0	i was very pleased with the socks they were just what we were looking for ! thanks so much	1
0	as the weather has cooled for fall and winter i needed socks for my baby i initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just did n't hold up as well i have also tried socks with grips on the bottom but they were so thick my son just sweated in them the children 's place socks are not too thick and very durable also the non slip feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked the other socks did not ! i strongly recommend these socks for your child	1
0	i just recieved my shoes today and ca n't believe that these shoes fit perfectly the wide size 8 5 is just what i needed i am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as i would often have with other shoes i love the value as i purchased these for only 19 79	1
1	the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face however the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that i first used it it hasnt torn completely yet nevertheless i would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon i wouldnt suggest this produc	1
0	this is one of the most comfortable shoes i ever owned excellent quality and fit	1
0	this is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you 're dressed in a short sleeve over this one however i personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company	1
0	speedy delivery product as stated would buy from them agai	1
1	i am a 38 ff and i was hoping this would help hold me in while running not ! this bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price ! i'm still in search of the bra that will hold me in ! this one is going back	1
1	have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems this time was different they sent the wrong shorts i paid the shipping to send them back i asked please send the right shorts they credited my account an amount smaller than i paid and that was that certainly not satisfied	1
1	paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon this store never again !	1
1	i would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all the silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night	1
0	this is my 2nd set of these type of curlers the last ones stayed with me for three years they are so good i stopped using the big home set and use these type daily heat up fast great lasting curl \( particularly for hard to curl fine hair \) and do n't even need to leave them in that long would have given them a 5 but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl recommend getting or using a set of the old fashioned wire clips that come with most non travel sets if you want a smoother curl	1
1	after wearing the betula birkenstocks for about an hour the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked midwest wont take them back since i wore them	1
0	brand new tags and everything ! ! ! arrived within a week no glitches just like ordering new from catalog will search and order again for merchandise all at fairer price or even 50 cut of new brand name items that either are not in stock in your size or ca n't be found in store or are marked up 20 0r more ! luuvv itt ! ! ! ! ! ! ! bonni	1
1	i wish there were 0 star although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them after searching a lot for buying a present for my sister 's birthday i found this sandal and i decided to buy i ordered it on march 9th and after 20 days ! ! still i have n't received them ! ! ! ! ! ! i am getting my money back not only i have wasted my time but also i should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late ! ! ! ! conclusion these sandals are very beautiful but never fall for them	1
1	i loved the bathing suit the first time i laid eyes on it so i purchased it i'm actually small but i do have thick thighs so i got a medium but when it was delivered and i tried it on it was too small ! i should have gotten a large the medium made me look like i had these big love handles so please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger but other than that the bathing suit is great i'm just going to have to loose the love handles	1
1	did not fit well at all way too big around the ankles every step i took the boot would start to fall off they were the right size length wise and all just way too wide above my ankle they were about half as tall as they looked in the photo which was very disappointing i sent the boot back at my own expense the same day i would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first then ordering it off of here for cheaper	1
1	bah this skirt looks weird and cheap it is not sewn on the bottom just cut	1
0	i regret to say that i did not receive the shoes ! !	1
0	as a new 36dd \( ca n't wear underwire \) this is the most supportive and comfortable bra on the market for the past 5 years \( since my surgery \) i 've been searching for the perfect bra i have finally found it !	1
0	i liked the shoes they look nice my only concern when i first received them was the quality of the cover leather at the begining it looked like plastic but otherwise they fit perfectly	1
1	i just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs \( from another online company \) because they seemed inexpensive durable and came in many fun colors i was sorely disappointed the colors are pretty but the material is crummy its rough flimsy and feels like plastic the pastel colors \( citron cool mint etc \) are almost see through and definitely show patterned underwear the tops run quite large \( i wear a 6 8 on top and the medium is very roomy i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again \)	1
0	i purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months the shoes are very comfortable and look very professional love them strong and tough not to heavy has good grip on snow	1
0	these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look they also are easy on the feet i like the suede versions best personally but when winter hits its best to have the leather	1
0	comfy tough lightweight wrinkly \( like me \) surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is good stitching velcro back pockets will save your wallet ! does n't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear freak cargo pockets not for the tidy country club set who need creases on everything but just perfect for active soccer dads or when the family hound insists on playing fetch with muddy logs and the like	1
0	shirts are what i had expected and the service was grea	1
1	i ordered these white tank tops and 3 colored tank tops i have never received these white tank tops and have requested a refund and requested another size they had in stock and have received neither i have sent emails requesting this and still no resolve	1
0	i was very happy with my last order it was easy to order and did n't take long to get the product my grandson was a very happy little boy on christmas morning thank you so much for the great services i will use amazon again and tell my friends about i	1
0	this product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim \( so many types of luggage are similar in style and color we 've had trouble in the past \) several of our family members were given new luggage for christmas and these tags were included these tags are big bright lime green and can be easily seen no more headaches in trying to find our luggage	1
