1	oh my gosh.. bombbbbbbbb ! ! ! this place is so amazing ! ! the food is incredible ! i have had almost everything on the menu . they have milk shake happy hour every day between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. with half price milkshakes . the first time you go in , tell them its your first time and they will give you a sample of all of their different sauces . my two favorite are sweet heat and creamy garlic . the staff is incredibly friendly and personable . the restaurant is clean and the hand washing station is pretty neat . go check it out you will not be disappointed !	998
0	read up on shabu if you are n't familiar with it . it helps to have an idea . went here for my birthday . my friends thought we would try something different . it was nice to change it up . i 'm not an expert so i ca n't honestly say how this place compares to other shabu restaurants . i can only say that it is n't a place that i would frequent . the service was excellent . i 'm just not a fan of shabu , but the overall experience was a good one for my birthday .	285
0	worst mojito i have ever had , do they know what they are doing ? there was no syrup in it , it was just flat alcohol with soda , very nasty ; presentation wise , it was horrible as well . there was a shrunken leave `` hanging '' on the glass , was that supposed to be the garnish ?	1110
0	we came in on the same day as a jeep thing and everyone else was 2nd to them ! ! the bar tender was so rude and did n't even want to hear my complaint . i will never come back here and ill tell my friends to never go there ! !	1487
1	good coffee shop in the palazzo . the blended beverages had a very good flavor . average selection of baked goods and no warmer for bagels . also it was n't the fastest services ... but the convenience if you are staying at the palazzo is worth it .	2397
1	i 've had a capital one credit card for at least 20 years , and it 's one of my favorite businesses to deal with . always professional and great at sending out verification notices if they suspect fraud charges ... great company ! !	3236
0	absolutely appalling customer service . i waited almost a half as hour to exchange a tool and every one they had in stock was also broken . complete garbage . the staff seems completely uninterested in long wait and lines . i watched other customers stand and wait equally long for tools from the back warehouse . if you go , do n't be in a hurry and fully expect to return half of what you buy .	2267
1	i frequent this place about once a week when i just need a quick snack . they have lots of options to choose from and the bagels are always fresh . the staff is also super friendly : )	477
1	i 've always liked this place i think their burgers are way better than mcd . can get quite a few for around $ 4 but drunks are extra . my favorite is probably the portabella mushroom but i 've tried almost all of the different ones they offer and they are all good . chili is n't bad either . we never have any long wait here and of course they have one of the best milk shake around plus you can get them for half price during the week if you come at a certain time . i think between 1-4pm or something like that . staff here bas always been good to us and friendly . will be back again .	1068
1	let me tell you something , they make the best pho in the valley period ! feel free to order p3- '' double meat '' , great ! everything else is very good as well , and the prices are very reasonable . make sure you get there before the lunch rush otherwise be prepared to wait for a table .	205
0	would never ever recommend this place to anyone ! ! went in for pedicure and eyebrow wax and at the end of my pedicure she told me the lady who does waxing not in today ! ! should have told me before and would have gone to my regular place . know i have to go somewhere else and make an extra stop ! ! thank you for the inconvenience ! thank you for purposely taking my money first knowing what my needs were . so so unprofessional ! !	854
0	wish i could give no stars . we purchased a couch in july of 2015 . great service when purchasing , but that later changed . in february of 2016 , the frame broke in one corner and a spring popped . we called living spaces several times before even getting to talk to someone . and it took several more times to have a tech come out and evaluate the damage . the tech stated that it could be repaired . after no one called after 2 weeks , i called them . then i was told that they would not repair or replace the sofa . they said to buy a new couch . all they want is money !	2071
1	first timer , staff was awesome to work with . wait staff was perfect . family had a great time golfing . food was really good too . was nervous that it would be bar food at 9am when we went , pleasantly surprised with the breakfast selection available . kids had french toast and fruit . food was excellent . definitely be back !	1483
1	my favorite of all department stores ... ..shoe department is pretty good , especially during the anniversary sales !	1907
1	michael cordova and his law firm have helped my family in court on more than one occasion . the same level of professionalism , competence , and urgency has never left since we first hired them . they are dutiful in the areas of communication and accounting . whenever we have questions or concerns , they are answered within 24 hours . whenever we need paperwork , it is promptly signed off on and sent to the appropriate place . they remain compliant and this has benefited us in several cases . my family is very thankful ! best , bethany	3169
1	i am impressed with the professionalism of martin . he gave a five star service . he gave tips on how to maintain plumbing . he cares .	2748
0	i decided to try this place as i was on the go last sunday . what a disappointment it was for me ! the caucasian male barista/cashier was really rude and needs customer services training ! he did n't smile nor properly greeted me or the lady ahead of me ! i ordered the americano , in which he callously said `` we are out of that '' without apologizing . when i asked him what another item was on the menu and he was annoyed to have to answer my question . needless to say that i will not return to waste my money !	2219
0	the place could be more clean and staff more hospitable . the area had some smell . pizza is not great , raw at center . not returning again .	581
0	received a random email from them for a move ... the price was interesting and so i decided to call . they told me that the lady in charge was absent ( if she even exist ) and the most obnoxious little prick try to give me attitude because he could n't find my phone number to match the quote ... ... good luck with that kind of business !	3114
1	i have been here twice and both times i left feeling better than when i walked in.. staff is quick , pleasant and mostly attentive . the doctor does n't spend much time with u but , i guess that 's why it 's considered a `` quick care '' . on my second visit i did need an x-ray so it took a little bit longer which is understandable . i recommend this place to anyone in need of quick care.. locals , tourists , whatever . the fact that they are open 24 hours and take my insurance that i pay for through work.. i have no reason to go anywhere else .	2618
0	we were told this course was in great shape , then we arrive to notice after hole # 1 that the course is n't even real grass . it 's bermuda grass which is far more difficult to shoot off of . other than that it was pretty open and forgiving if you were to push one to the right or hook to the left . also very confusing to drive on the cart paths if you have never played there before . they need much better signage .	85
0	overpriced , miserable excues for a bar . 2 bud lights and 2 waters = $ 30.00 .	456
0	this place is scary and ghetto . first pulled up and the gal is pressuring about repairing a tiny crack even though my boyfriend said no then saying `` progressive is a pain in the ass anyway '' waiting in the convenient store/dmv and two employees are arguing about shifts right in front of me . then two more employees are yelling at each other and cursing loudly in the bay area . i was very uncomfortable and felt like i would be caught in the middle of a senseless fight or something . will not ever come back here again .	88
0	my parents ordered couches to be delivered to their home . upon arrival , they informed my mother that they would not move her old couches out of the way and just left two huge sofas in her living room with her two old sofas . she obviously could n't get around her house with all of the furniture and so she tried for several hours to move the couches , moving other furniture about and what not . i am so angry about this , i am shaking . how dare you not move these couches for my mother . that is your job ! they knew this was what was expected from them .	1794
0	this office is run very poorly . they never answer the phone and wo n't call you back forcing you to drive to their office to communicate with them .	1541
0	do n't come on your lunch break . took way too long . i have to go back to work and my food just came . food was messed up . disappointed . probably wo n't come back	1397
0	do n't ever use a credit or debit card here they hacked mine and a friend 's cards ! ! ! chicken fried rice is the bomb just pay with cash though it 's worth it . 0 stars for stealing my money but 5 star fried rice . 1 star customer service they suck here lol	1014
1	i have been seeing dr. torres as i get ready for my first baby . i have really enjoyed him as a doctor and have really felt like he taken his time to answer all my questions . i also met with sylvia a few times and she was also great . i gave them four stars however because several times i waited in the waiting room for close to an hour after my scheduled time . the office staff was n't always overly friendly or helpful . they often seemed very busy and acted like it was inconvenience to answer my questions .	3059
0	went in after calling and leaving message about purchasing a new arctic cat utv and no one would help me and was ignored by entire staff that was walking around talking to each other . will take my business elsewhere .	2601
0	great food ; the cod dish is phenomenal , as are the patatas bravas ( sp ? ) . service was horrible . there were 2 servers for the entire restaurant , fairly disorganized , with one server thinking the other had taken care of us . there are far too many amazing restaurants to deal with shoddy service .	1167
0	slop in a bright orange bowl . if you are craving chinese food , skip this place .	209
0	spent quite a bit for a haircut and still came out with split ends . not worth the money .	2340
1	huge selection of knives . owner and staff very knowledgeable . willing to take time to help you with your purchase . awesome store .	2927
0	this place has gone to hell ! i just paid $ 12.00 for a plate of fat and grissle , smothered in cheese . they call this carne azteca . not the first meal i 've complained about either . ever since martin left , this place is mediocre at best . we used to love their food . now we 're just happy if its edible ! i guess they think these small town gringos do n't know the difference between good food and garbage . we 'll just smother it in queso , and they 'll love it . get your shit together , and have some pride in your work .	1518
1	absolutely amazing ! ! ! ! ! the food was so delicious and we had such an amazing time ! ! the family that owns amalfi 's are such sweet and welcoming people ! ! we ca n't wait to go back the 40min drive is most definitely worth it !	768
0	old , overpriced , and hard to find . that 's all i can say about this place . skip it , ignore it , do n't waste your time ; get it on dvd in the worst case scenario !	2061
1	we arrived about 30 mins before they closed with intentions of just browsing . we ended up furnishing basically our whole new house . maria walked around with us and helped us pick out our furniture and the manager maricella hooked us up with amazing prices . she kept giving us more discounts and let us pick out accessories that did not come with the furniture sets . they were very patient with us and stayed until 11pm helping us when they closed at 9 . they were very nice and friendly and everything has been delivered on time and without damage .	1794
0	do not come here ! ! i came here to get my eyebrows done and it literally took the lady 2 minutes . i 've been growing my eyebrows out and they were finally nice . the lady just completely took my eyebrows off . now i just have two uneven lines on my face and she arched one of them ! ! i will definitely not be returning here . i hate when people rush at their jobs or just do n't care . like you 're messing up people 's appearances now i 'll have to draw my brows on everyday . i literally cried the entire way home .	3806
1	jessika checked my car in and had me on my way quickly , she had a big smile on her face and was amazingly friendly . will definitely make this my go to location in the future !	78
1	greatest experience i have ever had booking a flight . 1 ) you can still obtain frequent flyer points with your airline , which is awesome 2 ) i phone and they picked up instantly 3 ) my rate was no longer available , but they quickly found me an alternate route for the same price , within my very tight time constraints 4 ) they were able to book on the phone 5 ) i accidentally hung up , but they phoned me back twice ( i went ahead and booked online because i was worried i would lose the flight anyway ) seriously - this woman was fantastic ! !	1574
1	who 's your daddy ? ! ... love love ! ... the sushi tried every where else , nothing comes close to this place ... . food is awesome ! ...	408
1	excellent cold pilot grigio , and a very nice quinoa salad , not your usual thought , as i like lots of lettuce , and less quinoa . so it was perfect for my liking . and deliciously cold . great for a hot summer day . great for a pub style atmosphere .	480
1	i love the salmon bowl , a great choice for those who love raw salmon , and the katsu bowl is great for kids or those who are shy about asian food .	131
1	i needed to return a pair of shoes that had been worn twice . i was worried they would n't except them in exchange for something else but the manager angel was awesome to work with . he made the return and exchange very easy . his level of customer service and support speaks volumes . because of this experience i will be sure to give the az mills footlocker my business whenever i 'm in the market for a new pair of shoes . much respect for angel . give him a raise !	2348
0	i usually order a coffee from here when flying out . i switched up my routine and ordered a flat white . i was served essentially a cappuccino . i will go back to just getting coffee from this starbucks . staff was friendly , so they have that going for them .	3124
0	we used to frequent the total wine in summerlin . i always enjoyed the spectacular customer service and wonderful selection . there is a distinct difference with the new location on centennial . zero customer service . zero . in an area where there are two major liquor/wind stores within a mile radius , this is surprising . looks like we are new customers of the competitor . never again .	3199
1	my family had a christmas party this past week and the food was incredible . the amount of food that we received allowed us to have lunch for the following day . the atmosphere is inviting and our servers mary and janette were amazing . so friendly and helpful and lots of smiles . we will definitely be back again . the owner was seen walking around saying hi to people which is rare now a days . it was nice to see someone taking pride in their business . keep up the great work .	1386
0	do i even bother to give a review since your management just commented that whatever review is up here will just get taken down if it is negative ? not accountable - stay away	2682
1	i 've been here twice to this same location . the first time i was n't impressed and would probably give it three stars at the time . i came again last week and ordered the market hash ... oh my god it is the best thing ever . so so flavorful . must have ... go ... now ! anyway , they have a decent menu , something for everyone . whether you are a health nut or someone who just does not give a _____ , you will find something you like . service here is great , they can get busy but they do not neglect you . everyone is friendly . prices are fair and portions are filling .	1258
1	i use to come here a lot and it was not good service at all so i stopped coming but the last half year i have had one of the best continuos service that you can get at a bar . alex is probably one of the best bartenders you can get . only reason is 4 stars is because they switched their happy hour menu but it does not reflect on their customer service	1520
0	this place is the worst . i went around ten on saturday night and it was packed . it seems the place is intended to cater to rapey , nickelback-loving , popped-collar misogynists and the women who love them . there is no place to sit , no place to talk ( because it is loud ) and zero ambience . to its credit , though , i was served quickly ( because there were like 3000 bartenders ) and it was n't that expensive , but it would take much , much more than that for me to ever return to rape-central again .	1966
1	had my dog neutered there and not only was it a great price they took excellent care of my dog . drop off at 730 am and pick up at 330 pm .	2864
0	i would give these guys negative stars if i could . after going through a dispute over the long delayed delivery of my furniture , the owner called me and cussed me out repeatedly . do yourself a favor and find another dealer .	217
1	so good ! delicious noodle soups of different varieties . spicy dishes are actually a bit spicy . the mushroom and short rib is comfort food .	1329
1	this restaurant is clean , the service is very professional , and the food is good . i had the mango chicken and i recommend it .	1425
0	well this walgreen 's has all the stuff it needs for a pharmacy quick grab but i find that the employees at this location just do n't care . did you see that period over there , yeah this is just a job that they are here to get the pay check and that is it . i am not impressed and look forward to walgreen 's recovery at another location . i do want to mention that the pharmacy is very interactive and commutative and is a 360 from what the retail side of this store is . highly recommend the pharmacy	2871
0	i like donuts . not an expert but i definitely have had a good donut now and then . i heard about this place and anticipated that it would be great with all the fun toppings . it was n't . not really worth the drive across town . only positive thing hung are the hours ... maybe i ordered the wrong donuts or went on an off day . tasted kind of stale	2053
0	if you 're in ahwatukee , just go to the fry 's on chandler blvd instead . this fry 's has a smaller selection , is not as well-stocked and they often shut down the regular checkout lines at night , forcing you to use the self checkout lines . not fun when you 've got a full cart .	1967
1	this location does exist and is open for business ! it 's next to jersey mikes sandwich shop ! open 9-5 mon- thurs , 9-6 friday and 10-2 on saturday .	3054
0	pay for wash that has top roller , second consecutive time attendant did n't turn switch for top roller back on . getting ripped off on what i 'm paying for .	2939
1	i stopped by this hospital to do a drop in tour as a prospective employee , i did n't announce who i was when i signed in ; i was given a tour by a house supervisor who was very friendly & honest about the history of staff , building and services offered . i was impressed by the interactions i witnessed with pt . care and staff . i have been in this industry for 8 years and have worked for multiple companies and i can say promise phoenix ltac in mesa az . is very bright , friendly and attentive to pt care .	2413
1	i had a great time at this hotel while at the kraftmaid experience . only reason i did n't give 5 stars is the process for checking out was slow . when i asked for a receipt for the hold they put on my card , the girl insisted i did n't need one . then she printed out the room receipt , not the hold . bed was comfy , bathroom was n't too clean and the shower head was pointed out the shower so i got soaked just turning the shower on to heat the water .	3522
1	i prefer this location since it sometimes has a 5 minute wait . nice inside , somewhat helpful . i like verizon overall and especially now that they carry the iphone .	3179
1	awesome place to bring the kids . staff was amazing . my son ended up getting bumped and verria was so helpful and was so accommodating . i will definitely be back and recommend to friends	1095
1	the best pizza in vegas . if you like thick crust , you have to try the metro thick crust . it is amazing . the only negative with this place is the price , but sometimes you get what you pay for .	192
1	this was my first visit to a pickle barrel and i am now dreaming of when i can go back . service was impecible , food was absolutely delicious . highly recommend .	534
1	love this place ! i came in 30 min before closing and needed a pedi and full set , also my daughter wanted a mani and pedi and they took us without question , were quick , and did a wonderful job ! ivy is the best ! she made sure we were seen quickly and offered my daughter and i a drink while we were being taken care of . a great experience ! i will definitely be returning ! thank you ivy ! ! !	655
0	supposly this place closed at 10 i came at 9:48 and it is closed ... they closed earlier than they suppose to close ... yelp said they closed at 10:00 i drove to this place after work and it was closed ... i 'm so mad	721
1	after a bad experience with a different company with a very rude technician , i was very happy to have found zhora , he is the best technician i 've ever worked with , i 've been in vegas since 1997 . i wish more technicians are like him , very knowledgeable , nice and punctual and he sent me a text when he was on his way , very professional ! ! ! ask for him whenever you need appliances repair , he 's patient in explaining everything that needs to be done and his suggestions are very helpful . thanks zhora for all your help fixing my dryer ! ! !	3885
0	hands down the worst chicken wings i ( or anyone at my table ) has ever had . they were 1/4 the size of normal wings and were more breading than meat . i asked for buffalo sauce and they gave me some weird concoction i 've never tasted before . the server did n't know what was on tap and mumbled in the loud restaurant until i gave up on asking her to repeat herself . the owner/manager marched around overtly looking at us and our food which was kind of awkward .	2732
1	very nice food . complete value for money . we ordered for king pao chicken , orange chicken , veg chowmin . everything was delicious . would eat again when visit chandler .	237
0	i love steak n shake but this location lacks all the fundamentals that are practiced at the other locations . their milkshakes are soupy , the need to be trained on the breakfast menu pricing since everything is n't on the drive thru menu , and they get upset when you question then about misquoting the prices ! one time i ordered a sausage bagel and a breakfast burrito . the had the nerve to use a portion of the patty for the sandwich in the burrito ! unbelievable !	221
1	i 've been taking my 6 month old here for a couple months and although he 's still very young , vanessa , our instructor is always so positive and encouraging . she 's amazing with the children she works with and really pays attention to detail when she gives us our feedback at the end of each class . the facility is clean and the employees at the front desk are always helpful and willing to answer questions .	2521
0	what a scam . they charge you $ 30 to get in ( family of 3 ) then $ 10 a ride and then tow your car ( $ 100 ) . never coming back .	3251
0	went in for a basic wash , left with a repair bill over $ 500 . my whole experience was extremely disappointing from the front end greeters to the owner . i hate dealing with unscrupulous people and businesses .	1502
1	fun city with awesome entertainment . most of the entertainment is for adults but there 's quite a bit you can have kids do .	315
0	horrible service in this place . the lack of customer service shocks me . i have gone there a few times and land up leaving as i ca n't seem to attract service . you see workers talking in groups and just ignoring clients . very sad . this was on the men 's floor .	2979
1	fantastic sushi ! always know i am getting fresh product , great tasting , unique flavors . try the scallop heaven roll ! sashimi is very high quality . they treat their customers very good . they allow you to use the entertainment card unlimited . go there once per week and also pick-up food . they have your food ready pretty quickly . the same sushi `` creators '' behind the main bar for many years now . you know you are getting the same high quality product every visit when the same experienced people are creating your food . best sushi in north hills and could compete for best in pittsburgh .	1326
0	super friendly staff/that 2 employees only , lol , they do not have more/ but food isnt delicious the won ton soup was awful looked like vomit and tasted like that , they mixed everything into the miso base egg yolk and onion ... it was cheap but ended up in the trash therefore waste of money ... ..they were very slow and we had no time waiting for main course so we left , and in the meantime i heard their neighbor came by complaining that the water is leaking and they did not care at all ... poor guy ... lol	734
1	this will be the best deep dish you can get in madison . falbos-eh . pizza extreme-wet mess . we ordered a buffalo chicken pizza with pineapples instead of tomatoes and it was really good . they no longer offer it so we have n't found the opportunity to come back . it is a tad pricey but yummy . we need to address this very serious issue . where are the peppers ? no banana peppers . no jalepeno peppers . those two are extremely delicious and you refuse to offer them , meh i guess i 'll pick somewhere else .	705
1	for a circle k this place has it going on 2nd circle k that has impressed me . it 's close to home so i drop in for a little h2o or the occasional snack ... ..	2563
0	updated version from my prior review . the staff were very pleasant at this location . the work was not good unfortunately the gel mani lasted one day only . by day three i had not one nail intact . my cuticles were trimmed so closer that it was just painful for a week . i would n't go back to this site related to poor quality of the very simple work i had done and no have my cuticles nipped so close that they hurt with a nipper that did not come from a peel packed freaked me out .	1834
1	fuel pizza is usually decent . good drunk food . tonight i visited the college st . location sober and was pretty impressed with the quality of pie and quality of service . no over the top non-sense . just thorough delivery of solid pizza . it was around 9:50- did n't catch names . but goldberg looking fellow that brought out pizza and desserts was hauling ass . he deserves a beer or 8 .	902
1	cute cafe in the plateau . the barista was friendly & chatty . prices were on par with other independent coffee shops in montreal . i tried a turkish coffee - first time i 'd seen it on the menu in a montreal cafe . it was served in a cute cup . i wanted to try their simit but it looked more like a bagel & i had already started the morning with one at st viateur on my walk over . the coffee shop gets pretty busy & the tables are very close together ; it was sometimes hard to focus on my conversation over the noise . i liked the mural outside too .	1144
0	it 's one of two korean grocery stores in las vegas . i can find some stuff only at this store and that is the only reason i go . it 's a bit of a commute , it 's pricey , selection is n't that large and customer service is not a priority . - customer service - 2/5 - product selection - 2/5 - price - 2/5 ( pricey ) $ $ - fresh fish - 3/5 - produce 2/5 ( korean specific produce at times but not always ) - readymade food - 2.5/5 ( hot ) - always keep an eye out for the expiration date !	715
0	i agree with you nisha d. for the past year or so the service has been horrible . i 've only had 2 experiences that were considered ok . the management ca n't seem to handle the staff they hire , the girls are blatantly rude and abrasive with customers . do n't ask questions about the products because you will be ignored . we should boycott the store , there 's no reason to give money to people who ca n't train their staff or discipline them after a complaint is being made . you walk into the store in a happy mood and leave feeling shattered by the rudeness and the lack of customer service training .	2739
1	always friendly . always clean . neighborly . parking never a problem . nice people . good feel .	1072
0	place has shutdown . went today for my normal monthly haircut and place is dark . shame had a great barber in mark who i have been going to for a couple of years .	2136
1	one of the friendliest crew of mechanics i have ever met . it 's hard to just compliment one person when the whole staff was charming ! you ca n't find mechanics like that . most importantly they are honest and they do the job right the first time ! definitely going to have this place my regular place i go to for my lexus !	2981
1	food is always prices could be better and still worth it . sometimes need to double check that your order is correct especially when ordering to go . carne asada is all full of flavor .	857
0	been to a lot of denny 's and this is easily the worst of them all . the biggest beef was seeing our food waiting for easily 10 minutes under the warmer before being delivered to us . the service was slow even though the restaurant was nearly empty . the food was luke warm ( no surprise sitting under the warmers ) , pancakes were crusty on top ( no surprise sitting under the warmers ) , waitress never refilled drinks , and we had to ask for the bill . overall disappointing experience . i 'll be happy to get back my favorite denny 's in san jose , ca .	1504
0	first of all as a true hispanic , this place was nothing to brag about . the salsa was plain and had no kick to it . i had their carne asada burrito and the carne asada was also plain and was not juicy . their chips were too salty . the only thing that was good about it was the water so i can wash it down . finally it was wayyyyy over priced for the quality and taste . if you come here you might as well go to taco bell.the only thing nice about it was the interior of the place and the staff . i will never go back again .	562
1	if you need help in deciding where to look for speech therapy services , look no further than speech therapy center of excellence ! my son has been having sessions with arlene , and even in this short time he has improved greatly . she is very nice and thorough and my son is always so excited to be there , he always tries to run in . after being on their wait list for a while and looking into other places , my husband and i are glad we selected this location . if you need someone that specializes with speech for kids on the autism spectrum or any other special need , give them a call !	2782
0	this company deserves 0 stars . the director of operations angela kelley is not a person you want to deal with she is very arrogant and does not uphold the school policy enforced by bud crawley . she should be let go and replaced by someone with some standards like bud . bud passed away and would be appaulled by the way she is handling his students .	2880
0	terrible service ! last 2 times the waitress disappears and never returns , no drinks , food order was wrong and we had to get the manager to stop and fix it and then we have to chase them down to pay the bill .	201
0	skip this place . to even play in the tubes you have to pay to much . the food sucks . the immature staff are lazy and disrespectful . the kids were alright with it , but they did n't need to pay for the crap service .	1154
0	i really really wanted to love this ! i went there to try the chorizo burrito only to be told they did n't have the chorizo made yet . fair enough so i decided to go with the steak burrito as a second choice . it was good the pico was good cilantro was fresh . steak however was tough and grisely and i found it not to be seasoned at all . bummer . i will probably try again since everybody should get another chance . i hope next time they have the chorizo . till then i can say it 's just ok .	1421
0	never going there again ... i was glad i did n't just munch in cause i was so hungry , cause i found a plastic wrap in my soup bowl and to top it off , it took so long to get to my food . guess i caught them on a bad day .	673
1	love my nails ! patricia is very sweet . when you walk in , there are studios of other beauticians- patricia is in her own suite ( 219 ) so you have your own personal nail salon in a sense ! since you are the only person with her- she is very attentive to your needs- she played a movie that i wanted to watch during my gel pedicure and listened to relaxing music during my gel mani . overall a very beautiful and relaxing experience . 50 % off for new customers ! so my bill for a gel mani and gel pedi was $ 40 . ca n't be beat !	2742
1	i love this frys ! not only its near my house they also run alot of sales . i get the newspaper but they also send me exclusives deal ! we usually buy most of our itmes on this store then used our points at the end of the month on their gas . double whamey ! ! ! the only reason i took 1 star is that they decided to remove the spot where they sell nuts and chocolate covered items , like the one @ sprouts ! other than the change iam very hapoy that i live near this place ! !	3107
0	worst shopping experience ever . the staff in the store is so rude . had to buy some insoles for my scarpas but refused to buy anything else . never going here again .	3339
0	drew is a great guy , but my mechanic did not give me good service . felt rushed out even though my car was n't fully fixed and then steve , i think was his name , tried to charge me additional to look at a fuse behind the radio that was stopping it from working . ended up doing it myself , but service was horrible and unfriendly .	1604
1	awesome service the safelite team , south rainbow in las vegas ! got me in and out in about 40 minutes ! they changed my severely pitted windshield for me and it looks 100 % better than before . making an appointment with them was effortless . i only wish i had it replaced sooner . i will definitely be coming here for my other vehicle 's glass needs and telling others to so as well !	1052
0	worst $ 80 ever spent on my vehicle . all they did was cover everything with armorall . windows were streaked . bugs on the grill . plus it took two hours	127
1	if you are in the area and hungry , there is no better option than to order a quarter chicken and fries and ramados . montreal is home to some of the best portuguese rotisserie restaurants , but none offering charcoal-fired chicken at affordable prices like ramados . the combos are packed with generous servings of chicken , fries , and salad , so there are no worries of leaving unsatisfied . do n't forget to order some natas to finish your meal ! ramados is a take-out restaurant , but there are two or three tables inside . however , there is no better place to enjoy your saucy , charred chicken than the nearby park on a sunny afternoon !	1109
1	love this place ! amazing flavor on the steak . great happy hour deals , even on the steak ! waiters were on top of their game . great service . dessert was perfect ! had to find room for the cheesecake and mini donuts . only complaint : too dark to read the menu . had to use the flashlight on my phone . also saw a couple other tables doing the same thing . other than that ... one of the best steakhouses in vegas !	1414
0	horrible company ! charged me $ 500 to replace the springs on my door . which is more than double what it should have been . installed the wrong springs which cause to much tension on my opener . their stickers are placed all over my door , and i 'm told that they pay people to do this on new and used homes that are for sale so you will call them first . i wish i had looked them up first !	3291
0	i called the other day to make sure they would be open till 6pm . the girl on the phone told me yes . the website says 6 and chickie on the phone said 6 . i had a coupon for a christmas tree ... well guess what ? i got there at 5:30 and they were closed . you suck star nursery . i was going to give u my business because i wanted my christmas tree . home depot got my money instead . again , you suck .	2039
0	unnecessary mark up . went in for a plastic ammo can- $ 25 , and $ 35 for the one with an insert ( $ 10 for an insert ? ) . went home and bought 2 online for $ 30 . free shipping , you know the deal . they have some good supplies but you 're going to pay for it .	233
0	too busy on the weekend , no staff to watch the kids carefully , dodgeball room often not monitored at all . i do n't feel my kids are safe here . also it takes a long time to register at the front , even though i have come a few times before . this will be my last visit .	1664
1	this is my `` go to '' store when i need auto parts/accessories . i come here for gasoline treatment , air filters , replacement windshield wipers , and other stuff . http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qgxtuzc_i8do_p2xd7pp0q ? select=hq6js9srvsjulq1kj_7l4g http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qgxtuzc_i8do_p2xd7pp0q ? select=4_rjsnormz2ssov3xm0kbq the staff here are usually pretty cool and helpful ... ..plenty of parking in the lot and ko 's is next door ( restaurant/bar ) ... .what more could you ask for ? ! return factor - 90 %	360
0	i ate here with a group of 5 , one whom was the lovely ms katie m. see her review for more . bitch took ten minutes to bring me a cup of coffee , then disappeared until we asked her for the 15 % auto-gratuity . i did not order food , but what arrived looked like denny 's , only shittier and more expensive .	1515
0	service started rough when we were given dirty plates for our entree , service continued to be slow throughout the meal , our waiter came over once we had finished our meal to give us more water which we had been out of since our entree . overall poor service and overpriced food	102
1	my favourite ricky 's in calgary . always consistent . liver & onions there are my fave . the owner laura is wonderful .	660
1	so excited to finally have whlyd ass in phoenix . came in this morning and was greeted with the most friendly of service . food was on point as always . water is green as always . congratulations on the new place guys , we look forward to watching y'all grow !	1254
0	update - 6/20/16 . office is officially closed . dr posted a sign outside and basically gave all her patients less than 2 weeks to find a new doctor and transfer records . it 's been a nightmare . now we have to start all over & it 's been a fight to get allergy serum released . april 2016 - we have n't met with dr laura , but mary jo is wonderful and took good care of both my kids . my daughter starts allergy shots soon . so far the office has been great to work with .	2272
0	rude employees , never answer phones or return messages , maintenance calls are never resolved , stains or urine throughout halls , smell of mold in apartments .	818
0	a 40 % late fee on your monthly rent fee is ridiculous . after renting from them for several months , will be removing belongings & going elsewhere . manager here is cold & unwilling to understand that circumstances in people 's lives happen . stay away from this facility .	2065
1	ate here for restaurant week and lived it ! the food was great , service was great , and they had live music that night . people were dancing and having a great time . i definitely recommend this place to anyone look for a great meal and a great time . i had the lamb cops with mashed potatoes and finished it off with carrot cake . it was epic !	1147
1	i have been here many times and found the food to be ok . but this was the best visit yet . the waitress was very pleasant and attentive . maybe it was so good because i had lunch with my daughter and great grand daughter . had the 2 for you , reuben sandwich and cob salad , both good . great grand daughter had a fruit boy ( she is a healthy eater ) and whatever she could poach from the plates of the adults .	1258
0	i used to come here every month , but not anymore . every time i come here on the weekend i have to wait for a long time . so i tried to come on weekday , then the lady kept rushing me to pick out the color on my most recent visit . then she just rushed to finish her job so she can move on to the next customer ... pedicure done in 10 mins , and i realized she did n't polish it evenly until i get home..	786
1	wonderful service & company ! ! ! ramsey is super ! ! we had a bad experience with another local company , capital tint and ramsey fixed it & took really good care of us ! ! he comes to your home and his detail program miracle touch , is one of a kind ! ! if you have any scratches , rock chips , faded paint , etc. , please do not hesitate , this is your service ! ! ! he is awesome ! ! ! ! !	2888
0	well this is too bad . new owners ? first off , i walked in and the two women working were both talking loudly on their cell phones . took a minute for one of them to set their phone down for a second to take my order . my food was n't as good as it used to be . i used to love this place but after just this one interaction , i really do n't think i 'll come back - might be dramatic but i just hate employees being on their cell phones when there 's a customer ( and it does n't help that the food was n't great ! )	981
1	i took my 2013 kia sportage in for service last wee like i have taken all my cars i have owned since i have lived in surprise . they meet you at your car as soon as you drive up . they take good care of your car as they would treat one of there own cars . sam brown	624
0	i had the worst haircut of my life at this place and i travel all the time so i experience a ton of barber shops . maybe i just got the wrong guy but i seriously considered shaving my head afterwards . i asked for a low fade with a 1 one the bottom and half off the top . i do n't think thats a difficult haircut . the guy gave me a 4 all around and tapered the front near the sideburns . im glad a lot of other people had `` good '' experiences but i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .	2295
0	called the shop and got to talk to a guy called `` raffy . '' asked about a phone and said the he has it available and has only one left . got there and asked for the phone . he kept on looking in the back of his store but nothing . at one point even asked if i wanted a different one . made me wait for a long time with nothing . left the place ... wasted my time driving over there.. do n't go there . rude person .	1586
1	me and my cousin went to get our tattoo today at titan . chris was awesome , he was super friendly , patient and did exactly what we want , he even cleaned the whole area after we done . we trusted him 100 % and our tattoos turned out perfect . i do n't know why they got all bad reviews on yelp , well i guess you just have to be nice and respect people if you want to be treated the same way .	1658
0	update : three more stores have closed ! downgraded to 2 stars : - ( it 's sad to see this mall deteriorate year after year . there are still a decent number of stores left but in the whole it is pretty pathetic . the best thing about this mall is how kid friendly it is . nice play area . however , it does get super crowded in the summer . play area is for 42 '' and under . some parents ignore this but security will kick them out . dillard 's does a storytime on tuesdays at 10am and if you register they will give you a card that gives you free carousel rides on tuesday from 11am-1pm .	2815
0	they called to schedule an appointment for a home warranty claim . they told me they had to speak to my home warranty and would call me back- no one called me back . i called my home warranty and they had canceled my claim . ridiculous- i 'll replace my broken toilet myself . i would never use these people . very unprofessional . **this review is for correct company . they never called me back and i lost a day . that 's not how you run a business . now i have another company coming out to fix my problem .	1644
0	walked in for lunch at 2pm , waited at the counter and not a single employee spoke . 6 behind the counter and 2 drivers in white shirts standing at the counter with me , and no one spoke , i walked out .	1475
0	extremely bad service . $ 10 bottle of water . drinks expensive . plenty of other places in other casinos	2513
1	i love this place ! i would give a five star . great return exchange policy plus nice store very big lots selections . love it ! ! everyone is very nice . not rude	2443
0	awful place . average facilities and very pushy annoying staff . i was called after 10pm on two different nights by someone trying to schedule and push personal training passes on me . so many people i know are fans of good life and i wish i could be as it is so convenient , but i have had nothing but terrible experiences here . they refused to cancel my membership when i asked . do not recommend .	2370
0	horrible parking and not pedestrian friendly . some great restaurant and shopping options . if you can park . spots are tiny and they force you to valet .	387
0	this actually deserves zero stars because this repair shop did not do any repairs . i took a pair boots where the insoles were coming lose to glue them back . when i picked the boots up i checked and both insoles were still peeling . the man said there was nothing he could do and so now i have to find a new shop to fix my boots . the only good thing is that he had the decency not to charge me . seriously though ? how hard is it to put some glue on the bottom of a pair of insoles . ridiculous !	410
0	bad : -too much msg , we drink lots of tea , -simple salad dip in sodium , we re order one and is the same . -did n't refund the hair salad at the end need to be reminded -careless rice come with white plastic chip ( see photo ) -poor personal hygiene come with hair ( see picture ) -bad service not even a singe sorry about the hair . -the meat in the bun textured like sand -cost 40 $ per person good : -clean reno good lighting not worth going at all beware	943
0	ordered delivery to a nearby hotel and was promised 45 minutes or less . 1 and 1/2 hours later my pizza and salad arrived and both were the same temperature , that is to say slightly warm . pizza was ok , might have been better hot , but the salad was pretty poor . i realized afterward that they also overcharged me . overall poor value and service . try somewhere else if you are in this area as you ca n't do any worse .	718
0	not that great and definitely not worth the money . my dad got the kung pao vegan rice bowl and i got the organic veggie burger and it was not good . the rice bowl was extremely oily and the burger was subpar . they do n't specialize in vegan so if that 's what you want go elsewhere .	1402
0	came in there today an a lady named hengume was so rude told her thank you told her she did good and she ignored me the whole time . this place also always has only one person working which leaves them rushing trying to get to the next person .very unprofessional place	71
1	duffy 's provided beautiful flowers for our family reunion . we have used them many times in the past and have always been extremely satisfied with both their quality and service and this time was no exception . would highly recommend them for any flower needs big or small as we have used them for both and have always been glad we did . we have in the past used other 'big ' online florists and have been disappointed over and over again so we are especially grateful to find a florist that is so consistent and trustworthy !	657
1	great food for the price . i have been there five or six times to date . everything i have had has been good . i 'll agree with other reviews that complain about the parking lot and the weird ordering process , but the food is good and inexpensive . some of my personal favorites so far are the spinach friand , savory ham and cheese croissant , and the creme brûlée cheesecake .	1276
1	the former hilton is hands down the best place to watch games , especially on sundays for football central . they have a whole theater showing the games in addition to the sports book , the most reliable spreads for betting , and the cheapest beer ( priorities ) ; ) it 's the next best thing to actually being at the game ( even better actually cause the beers are cheaper ! ) especially when my team wins ... go panthers ; )	2271
0	go somewhere else ! i paid $ 39 for an hour of foot massage . two words : long fingernails . first , she worked on my scalp . it felt like my dog scratching my head . next , she worked on my arms and legs . she has only two pressures : barbaric and useless . i felt like she sprained my right wrist . finally , my foot massage . did n't even last one minute . and , she had the audacity to ask for tip . i gave her $ 5.00 just so she would n't chase me out the door . i could have done a better job massaging myself . for free .	1180
0	brought my dog in for a lameness issue . a slight limp was supposedly severe hip dysplasia . the dr would not let us see the x-rays and jumped straight to surgery . we stressed that we could not afford it so we left it at that . after a week of rest no more limping . we decided to take her to a new vet to get a second opinion . x-rays came back picture perfect . not a single arthritic change . very disappointed in this clinic . not sure if it was because of complete lack of education or for money but i will not be returning .	1588
0	lakes and sunrise are awesome if you 're looking for a great golf experience . if you 're looking to be talked down to by the guys at the pro shop then this is the place for you . was told over the phone twice they would honor casino rate and blew us off when we got there and said not on weekends . horrible attitudes from both of them . really shocked i was treated this way . love the course but not worth dealing with the pro shop . this is the third time they 've been extremely rude . wish i had the names of the two .	3869
1	this is the grocery store i usually go to , mainly because it is located close to my home . i can pretty much always find what i 'm looking for . some prices are a bit more than others but i can always get good quality fruit , vegetables and meat . they also have a pharmacy with great staff . of course like any grocery stores there are times that can be very busy but some nights are nice and quiet .	2402
1	this salon has been one i 've gone to over 19 years ago . my stylist was dawn . just gave her an idea of what i would like my hair would like . she gave very great advice and exceeded all my expectations . my hair looks much better now than before i walked in . she advised highlights with a trim that got rid of my frayed ends . my hair was a light color now it looks more natural and not so brassy . would definitely recommend this salon .	3182
0	i find this place very expensive and the food is mediocre . i bought a glass of wine , it was very expensive and they gave you very little . for a restaurant that is not in the downtown core , and on an industrial street , they could do better with the pricing and food quality .	257
1	seriously amazing food ! our server/bartender chris ( i think that 's his name ) was phenomenal , get the pear mule it will change your life . we ordered the brie and bacon app , pear pico , pacos pear tacos and the mushroom marsala and everything was amazing ! we will definitely be back to try something new . ( :	1458
1	well l needed some more glide to prevent heat rash when running . so i stopped in here . found some cool new running socks , hope they prevent blisters . my son bought a bb gun . sports authority overall is high priced to me , especially clothing . i checked in but forgot to use my 10.00 offer and now i am bummed . oh well . nice employees and helpful .	1832
1	we 've been back here several times in the last 2 weeks and just love it . the service is quick and the food fresh and delicious . the angry kimichi fries are a must and yesterday i got a buckeye dog which was delicious , though my favorite is the southern dog for sure !	1566
0	thereceptionist is awful ... i had to wait almost 20 minutes for my appointment to start . hair dresser was very unfriendly . my hair look decent , it took 3 hours just to do a press and style . from what i observed they can not do highlights . only weaves and haircuts . staff in general is rude . it was a waste of a drive there and my money . i would rather go some where else and pay more money . do n't waste your time ... it 's unfortunate the interior is so nice .	916
0	what horrible customer service . go to buy a bag of dental cat treats and they ring up as $ 0.01 . the girl asks her manager what to do and they tell me they ca n't sell it to me . do n't offer any alternatives . just ca n't sell it . first off all , what kind of store cant override a price ? second of all , your systems are messed up and i 'm the one who has to suffer for it ? and third of all , offer me an alternative ! you just lost a loyal customer .	2649
0	came in , guy acted like it was an inconvenience to see me and then when i took longer than 5 minutes to make a choice he literally said , `` just choose . '' definitely would have gotten something but refuse to give my money to someone who ca n't be bothered to do his job ...	3270
1	there is a wait even if you are seated immediately . friendly crew and they will correct any mistakes if you had one from a previous appointment without hassle .	786
0	horrible service , completely screwed up my hair shaved it beyond what i asked and went it came time for a line-up in the front the most crucial part of a haircut she lopped off a chunk of my hair and it 's the overall line up is crooked ! i basically paid to get the hell out of there i will never go back to this location ever ! management should speak to their stylists about paying attention to what 's in front of them not around them .	3557
1	this store has everything , love coming here . the workers are average some are really nice others are just rude w ith no personality . this location always has great items that you can find in regular grocery stores . love this 99 cent store	3423
1	a small dunkin donuts with some seating available inside . chocolate chip muffin and iced tea were great . service was fine , the place was n't too busy either . would definitely visit again !	618
0	very disappointed with this motel , came here for work and because i had 3 friends come and help me out with things i needed , bath essentials , a charger etc they said i had too much activity going on ! ! but yet they have hookers hopping in and out of cars all night in the parking lot ! they do n't provide shampoo conditioner toothbrush toothpaste nothing so basically if u do n't come prepared u have no choice but to stay dirty cuz god forbid u have a few friends come and bring u things necessities because u will be marked as a prostitute for strange activity even though my door remained open during those few times ! !	3772
0	nice people and atmosphere . the food absolutely is horrible . my wife and her friend had the best salad with chicken that was so drying was like chicken jerk . i had the chili reano that was so bad i had no idea what it was . no happy hour the cheese and meat board were lame . no thanks	1331
1	4.5 stars out 5 the facility is incredibly large and has beaches . there are so many great activities to be done here and there are more pools and spas then any other club in gta . i 'm a founding member here . after settling in here after four years this club feels much more like a resort .	2762
1	this is by far the best place to shop for and purchase firearms and supplies in the valley . fortunately , they are only about 20 minutes from where i live , but it is always worth the drive . the staff is knowledgeable , and willing to help without any high pressure sales . i recently purchased a new sig sauer from spartan arms ... and was having a difficult time field stripping it . they took the time to show me and to make sure i knew how before i left . spartan arms also offers many classes from live fire , to safety . i would n't shop anywhere else .	2247
0	i 've found this location very hit-or-miss in terms of delivery . the first time i ordered , i received the most amazing vegan pizza with roasted garlic , basil and tomato sauce . but i 've only received that one time . the other two times i have ordered delivery , the pizza has garlic powder and looks completely different from my first experience . i also received the wrong drink order . i 'm not sure i 'll order from here again . 1/3 is not a good enough percentage for me in terms of satisfaction .	1063
0	worst experience from the minute i walked in the door . unfortunately the only place around with no car and unfamiliar area . two staff members were doing nothing going back and fourth of who wants to do me . i wanted a mani/pedi but just came out with a pedi because the other one was too lazy to get up . another customer walks in , ignores i also needed a gel manicure and starts on her . rude ! ! ! i just told you i wanted both ! ! ! ! would never recommend would never come back ! ! ! ! horrible customer service ! ! ! ! !	1745
0	complete ripoff artists i wish i had checked yelp before being ripped off here . they will lie to you to get the sale and not provide services requested and overcharge . avoid ! ! ! !	3123
0	dirty , nasty and smelly . i would n't recommend this park at all . my kids were extremely disappointed and we left after 30 minutes . i was surprised by all the garbage all over the place . people are so disgusting and treat this park as if it is a big garbage can . the smell of dog urine is overpowering that it gave me a headache . we will never go back here !	367
1	amy was amazing ! ! i will definitely be back again ! ! came last minute with two others and were sat right away . very impressed !	3497
0	i do not know him on business maybe he is brilliant but with talking to people he is a disaster rode and not pleasant , be aware !	3126
1	what a spectacular view , beautiful patio with a wonderful fireplace . service was great could not have been treated any better , great wine selection and with 1/2 bottles on saturday nights makes it even better . the menu selection has great verity , i really enjoyed the sun devil salad and the fish tacos are wonderful .	751
1	the owners been there for 20 years working on bikes . it 's not a customer service oriented business so do n't expect him to be something that he 's not . he has the lowest prices in town so just mind your manners when your in his store	3156
0	i was super excited to try this place out , so i ordered the big katuna with what turned out to be too high expectations . there was wayyyy too much sauce on my bowl , all i tasted was salty ponzu . apparently mine was made by a new person , since she kept asking questions to another staff about how to put the ingredients together . i took it to go which was saving grace since i was at least able to mix it with other non salty things to finish the toppings . did n't eat the rest of the rice , too drenched in ponzu .	309
1	very honest and very good work . they made everything super easy for me and i am very comfortable with these guys . i am a lifetime customer now !	1210
1	great wings good service good value for ones money . my favourite wing place in vaughan	393
1	i have taken all my 4 dogs to dr. mccomb who is very knowledgeable and works with you as far as price and times you can take your pets in . the staff is very nice and helpful every time we have our appointments . there is no other place i would have my pets . we are now seeing dr. o and she is fantastic as well . i highly recommend crossroads veterinary to anyone .	2165
0	check other reviews and do yourself a favor and never order anything from this people . worse experience ever , sizes are not accurate . a medium size is more like a small junior and when i tried to exchange and sent back my order they never contacted me and never send me the exchanges i required . i have the tracking number when i returned the stuff and they did received but never send me the exchange items . they clearly do n't care about the customers .	2661
1	i give it a four star but here is the thing ... .. i hate all shows and somehow i liked it and what is even worse is im telling people i actually liked it ... . every other show i have been to has been absolutely terrible and a waste of my time and money just to keep the girl happy , but this time was different finally a win/win . it is nice that i can actually enjoy something ( for once ) that its only purpose was to make the ole battle axe happy ( kidding )	1771
0	attempted to visit this place due to great reviews but i got there at 515pm on friday and there doors already locked and closed ! tried to call 3x but all calls went to beeping voicemail . saw workers in there but still no answer . horrible service if you ask me . update your store hours if u plan on closing early for no reason ! !	2182
1	i am really not into cardio , but i 've been coming to this studio for the last 6 years and am simply addicted . every class is a new challenge and my only goal is to keep going . the instructors are motivating and inspiring and it 's always a great group of people that attend . this studio is unique and the classes are exciting and fun while actually focusing on a full body work-out and not just legs . enjoy !	3477
1	this is my new nail place ! ! they did such an amazing job and did n't even care how crazy my requests were , they treated my daughter and i like royalty and we will be be back ! ! i loved how wendy did my nails and toes and she did n't even cut me like the other place i went to . i 'm so glad that they are 10 mins from my house ! ! 10 stars ! ! !	3333
0	appears my views on sports authority are widely shared , the firm is now bankrupt and closing stores ! ( good riddance ! )	3911
0	an old plastic plate for $ 2 . clothes that are torn and worn with stains on them . i went there today to give it a second look . generally , disappointing .	747
1	i do n't like doing laundry but i do n't mind it at this place . it 's pretty clean and it 's not really hot like most laundromats . plus i never have to spend too long there because there are lot of washers and get dryers are big and always done really fast ! ! i think last time i was there i used like 50 cents to dry all my clothes ! ! ca n't beat that	2638
0	do n't bother coming here ... they are nice but they do n't respect appts . i had to wait 2 hours and i had an appt . i will go to scottsdale store from now on . bad mgt .	3231
0	they are a terrible company to work with . they sent the wrong springs that would not fit my door and using the `` spring 's are not returnable '' routine . stay away from this company . dealt with both bill chalfant and taylor millar . when north shore goes out of business , these two should definitely look into a different career than customer service .	3470
1	this is the most caring , reasonably priced veterinary clinic ! ! dr. edwards is thorough , honest , very skilled as a vet , personable , kind , and so very caring . the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable as well . i 'm so grateful to have found dr. edwards years ago , and so are my shelties !	2453
1	everything was hot and delicious . speedy , friendly delivery . i 'd give 5 stars but in my opinion it 's on the pricey side .	1191
1	i go through the drive thru and they are all very pleasant that work at the windows either taking your payment or handing your food and/or drink . the only complaint i have is fill the frappe drink up or any drink for that matter . i fell like i am getting cheated when it is almost a 1/4 missing . i can go to the dutch bros and get a full one from them and have never been cheated . also have your payment ready it will help the line move quicker .	504
0	c'est grand . c'est un peu bruyant . c'est pas mal . mais c'est surtout beaucoup moins bien que l'avenue !	243
1	we 've been going to this restaurant since it opened over 15 years ago . this is one of the only chinese restaurants that have kept their standards up . they 're staff is friendly and quick . the food prices have gone up with inflation , but is still a very good price for what you get . i 'm not a fan of the `` new '' plastic ware though as any left over debris shows up on the black plastic bowls . they 're veggies are always fresh compared to other similar type restaurants .	1173
0	the customer service was good however the way they stock their sunglasses is very unacceptable . i was interested in buying a pair of sunglasses . the only pair available was a display with a big scratch on it . the sales person went through their back stock to see if there was another pair , she pulled out a box with pairs of sunglasses just thrown in a small box . the only protection these sunglasses had were plastic sleeves . they should have been placed in their individual sunglasses cases . i have never seen a sunglass but organized like this !	2676
0	when we walked in our waitress greeted us in a rude manner just tossed the menus on the table . she was swearing every second word even calling he boss the c word . very unprofessional the food was very below average for the price . safe to say i will not be going back there .	1546
1	garner orthodontics went beyond my expectations . my son just got his braces off and i have 2 other kiddos starting on their journey . the staff is so helpful and accomodating . they are very patient with my kids and help explain the process and what to expect of each phase . if you have to cancel an appointment and need to reschedule , if they ca n't get you into one location , they try to get you into the other location . thank you to dr. garner and his staff for always being so helpful and informative .	2566
1	decided to have lunch here instead of going to my fave usual sushi place . everything from the service to the food was top notch ! me and my sister both got the dixie sushi lunch with a side of salmon sashimi . the sashimi was fresh and were a nice thick cut ( mmmm ! ) . the dynamite and california rolls were fresh and did not fall apart . the service throughout lunch was great ! the servers were always attentive and were very nice . you usually do n't get this kind of service at asian places . i think tako sushi is going to be my new fave usual place .	516
1	probably my favorite chinese bakery in all of west chinatown . fresh bread baked daily , with sufficient filling in each bun . although it is more expensive compared to the other bakeries , you 're paying for quality , and not quantity . always go first thing in the morning when the buns come out hot !	3110
1	we come to this location at least twice a week . we love the fresh food and quick service . never been disappointed . do n't eat the cookies unless you want to be hooked !	1161
1	this place is fyah everything is perfect here libby and the crew are the best . service , food and drinks are awesome . this place is really comfortable and chill perfect after work spot to relax definitely coming back that 's a automatic .	1229
1	i got my second tattoo from jeff , he was was quick , efficient , and knowledgeable . the result was good although it has faded substantially in just 6 months . dan the piercer is fantastic and super knowledgeable , i 've gotten two piercings from him and both healed quickly and without complication . would strongly recommend	3112
1	we love this place . friendly service , a little slow when busy , but the food is great and worth waiting for . the place is neat and the price is reasonable . would recommend to anyone ! ! !	237
1	we go for the wings-never the service until last night and we hope that this gal is working when we go in again- mariah ( please forgive me if i spelled it wrong ) . she was adorably polite , professional , and poised ! thank you again .	383
0	save your time if planning to donate goods . i called them ... they give an all day window for pick-up..great ! next , driver shows up and takes out a branch on my tree..wonderful . now they start to examine and cherry pick what they want . none of this was worthless junk mind you . so i told the driver to take a hike and sold the stuff on craigslist ! do n't waste your time with this chapter in cleveland . i 'm sure salvation army in general is a good organization but this chapter is not worth the bother . call goodwill ... they 're helpful and grateful for donations .	747
1	a relax place for a sunday breakfast . the restaurant is nicely decorated and the waitress is friendly . there 's a variety of selections of food and drinks for breakfast and lunch .	1060
0	the worst taco place i have been in my life . the place stinks first moment u walk in . the food was very bad and disgusting . i will never go back this place even though i love mexican food .	857
0	the service here was pretty bad . the kids working there were unhelpful . the clothes are cheap and so are the shoes . they had a fragrance there that looked like the gucci bottle but instead of gucci it was called `` gotcha . '' but hey , what are you gon na do right ? i wo n't come here again unless i get too drunk at garcia 's , spill bean dip all over my shirt and need a new one .	1833
1	i do n't know why this place does n't have a 5 star rating , this is hands down my favourite used clothing store around . the layout is beautiful , spacious and great quality clothing all around . i feel like i never leave without at least one item . price is decent and they have a lot of designer clothing . brought my boyfriend in here too and they had a great selection for men as well . ca n't wait to visit again !	1446
1	this is one of the most relaxing starbucks that i visit . it busy here , but has a calm vibe . the coffee is great as always !	44
1	i recently started taking my car here since moving to this side of town . the staff are always friendly and professional.ryan was great at explaining things to me . i would had given 5 stars because they do n't work on transmissions which i needed but overall is this a great place and have nothing negative to say .	2561
1	very good spot to grab a burger , fries and soda in a quaint , old-school atmosphere . order at the counter and they bring your food to you . my combo meal for lunch was a little over $ 8 and the burger and fries were both cooked perfectly . the employees were friendly . parking can be a little tight .	1461
1	wow i 'm going to miss ben ... so sad to hear he has moved out of state ! ! ever since i have been going to ben i 've gotten compliments practically on a daily basis ! ! i have nothing but great things to say about this salon - everyone is super friendly , considerate and talented . incredible head/neck massages ! ! ! i 've never seen a bad cut/color leave the salon ! ! i 'm looking forward to falling in love with another talented stylist at hypnotic ! thank you for giving us a place/talent we can depend on !	1617
1	what can i say ? the food is excellent and really showcases how quality ingredients make all the difference in simple food . the bigoli pasta and burrata pizzas are a must . add black truffle shavings to the pizza for an extra pep . service is great and the wine list both by the bottle and glass are superb . i 've been twice now and will be back again soon to try the whole branzino crudo . if i had to make one suggestion it would only be to increase the portions of their pasta dishes . other than that , perfecto !	833
1	there was leak due to the pipe not being installed previously by manny air properly on the ac unit and miguel from manny air came to fix it . he is very professional and extremely hard working . i would definitely suggest asking for miguel as your tech for all the work . he is also sending a painter to fix the the dry wall . miguel knows his stuff . update 8/4/17 - the painter ( jose dominguez 480-366-4589 ) did a very professional job of fixing and painting the dry wall . i do appreciate that manning air took full responsibility on fixing the problem .	3172
0	i would give this place 0 stars if possible . the owner , margarita could not have conducted herself in a worse way . my girlfriend went in to get her hair cut shorter , and margarita acted like it was the worst thing she has ever had do . after it was all said and done , the haircut was n't right and margarita did n't even say goodbye . then when we asked for someone to fix the haircut because it was wrong , margarita said that my girlfriend is n't welcomed back again . please never go support someone like this ! ! !	2056
0	i had bloodwork done for my 3 maltese before their dental cleaning . i went to pick up results a week later and the numbers on one of them was very high on wbc and lym and it was never mentioned to me ! i wo n't be back .	3030
0	i called to make a first time appointment for my three boys who need physicals for the new school year . after being put on hold for roughly five minutes i was informed that they can not accommodate three first time appointments in one day . i said i work and that means i 'd have to take off two days of work to have my kids seen . the appointment setter said yes that is correct . i suppose if you have one or two children then this could be a good practice for you . unfortunately this practices shortcomings have forced me to seek medical care elsewhere .	590
0	it has now been another 3 months for a total of 6 months that i have lived ere and have yet to have my patio ceiling fixed , and my bedroom cracks fixed ... add to it now i have water spots in my ceiling . i am beyond frustrated , i 've put in numerous work orders , about this and apparently a contractor has to come to my apartment . on the plus they did fix my dishwasher , after which they merely looked at the damages in my ceiling and told me about the contractor who was on site that day , well i never got a visit about my ceiling . if i could leave a half a star i would .	3467
1	typical theater , nothing too fancy . they recently opened a bar which is ok. my drink was kind of watered down , but all in all it 's not a bad theater .	3063
0	way overpriced for locals not to mention their costumer service sucks ! i bought a pax battery from then it did n't work to my fault i did n't return it right away they refused to exchange it or refund it ! if you are reading this go to oasis much better prices and service !	1025
1	love their selection of gel nails and supplies . i 've started doing my own and his place has the best selection anywhere . staff is knowledgeable and helpful . only drawback is they are closed on saturday 's . prices definitely beat anything online .	2182
0	i like how cheap the car wash is and the free vacuums ! but the employees are incompetent , rude and try to hit on you . dude , i 'm just trying to pay ... just trying to vacuum my car please stop coming over to me and talking to me . i like coming here just wish i was n't either getting hit on , being tried to be sold something or treated like i 'm stupid by the employees .	2093
0	first and last time in this barber shop . i took my son in for a haircut and we were turned away ! their business hours posted on the window says 9a - 7p it was 6:35pm there was only one customer getting a hair cut and two employees , and one of the employees said to me that they were already done for the day to come back tomorrow , awful customer service do not recommend	761
0	there a joke in this world ... wife went looking at a 2013 tacoma and they wanted $ 6000 down and $ 850 a month or with a cosigner $ 2000 down and $ 650 a month for 4 years ... she told them where to shove it and left..bad thing with them is you see post in craigslist for $ 500 and up to $ 1500 down , liers just like the rest of dealers , just these guys push it to the extreme	307
0	they are open till 1 am but if you want the food of you 're choice do n't go late because that definitely wo n't happen . i had driven across town for the food and it sucked that i was n't able to order it and had to result to something else	964
1	very good costumer service and professional tech . ..so frendly and also serve boba tea..love it ) )	544
1	the staff and doctors here are great . i have been coming for years with my cat and dog and have received excellent care .	1700
0	showed canceled after everyone is sitting down . they wait until everyone spends $ at the bar and souvenir shop and other places at paris and then inform people 5 minutes before start time that due to `` unforeseen circumstances '' the show is cancelled . they obviously knew and want to make money on extras . really shameful . do n't patronize this show .	570
1	awesome staff ! so friendly , honest and good at what they do . they really do put the customer first . will definitely be back	3842
0	`` security '' guard at the front would n't allow me to enter the store with my service dog even when i presented her certs . absolute garbage . lost my business for good .	3096
1	this place was good and bad . i went to las vages with my son and we played baseball . we were very happy to go and the batting cages were almost perfect . this place was a little dirty , the nets were ripped , but they were over all prety good . here are some pros and cons : ·close to strip ·pitches close to little league ·prices were too high ·equipment broken ·nice staff	3555
0	higher prices that some of the other locations . awkward layout . you pay and go through the wash , exit and get wiped down by one guy , then get directed to a garage , exit the vehicle , walk down a small hill , wait at a table outside , and the vacuum person drives your car around to the other side of the convenience store . weird ! the car cleaning was okay , nothing special , still dust in corners inside and smear marks on the outside with tons of lint left by the dirty rags .	2198
0	absolutely horrible . worst experience i 've ever had buying a car ! they sell me a 2005 nissan altima . a month after having it , i find out my brakes are metal to metal . christmas day , my car wo n't start . find out its my camshaft sensor . replaced that then my o2 sensor . today ( 6months owning the car ) find out my catalitiyc convertor is going out . guess who wo n't cover it ... . i 've invested more in this car then i ever have in any car . they 're very rude when you call and pretty much say oh well , its your problem . do not buy from here ! ! !	3305
0	i had high hopes because of all the good comments but i found the bagels pretty bland-tasting . the selection is also a bit limited in terms of bagel-variety for a bagel store . the shop lighting is pretty dark , and the service was slow . the bagel is only 1 dollar , which is the only positive . i probably wo n't go back unless a friend wanted to . disappointed .	995
0	food is amazing ! service is extremely poor . we ordered our food . mind you it was for three . the couple who came after us by 10 minutes received their food before us . would never recommend this place to anyone in vegas !	1319
1	i have to say i have read the other reviews and i can see how it may be hit or miss . we have been there several times and the food and service has always been good . there are many price points $ 8.95 to $ 30+ so mama mia 's can accommodate most budgets . we did go there one valentines day and did not care for the reduced selection `` special menu '' ( common for v-day ) and we did not stay . the reason i like this place is it is off the beaten path and you can find a quiet corner for a romantic date night .	1224
0	the line to check in was hour long from noon to 8 pm absolutly nuts	2976
1	very nice towers ! spacious condos , albeit very expensive , with expansive views of las vegas . door staff is first class .	3354
0	12/27/07 - mor furniture : `` well , we do n't have that furniture in stock , but we 'll order it for you and it should be here in 6-8 weeks , maybe sooner . '' 2/11/08 - mor furniture : `` your furniture should be in this weekend . '' 2/15/08 - mor furniture : `` it actually looks like your furniture should be here around march 1st . '' 2/29/08 - mor furniture : `` it 's actually looking more like it 'll be here mid-to-late april . '' see the review for ashley furniture homestore on bell road for the end of this story .	1640
1	i would like to start of by saying that mayes telles has an incredible and dedicated team that does a phenomenal job fighting for you . without a doubt , these folks are strategic , easy to reach , and always looking for a way to help get you a victory . i would highly recommend this law firm for anyone seeking justice . these folks truly care and will find a way to help . furthermore , they are staffed with excellent lawyers , paralegal 's , former prosecutors , etc . a special thank you to ms. castillo and mr. mayes for their efforts !	2391
1	excellent customer service n friendly salesmen for advises n many choices at design center . we picked what we want for our new home . prices is very reasonable	2071
1	went for the second time again this week and shared the hummus appetizer and my husband and i each had the ahi wrap . both were delicious . i had been in earlier this week and a friend had the ahi wrap and said how great it was , so we had to go back and try it . our new favorite . in a spinach tortilla , great seasonings , lots of ahi . getting hungry just thinking of it ! service as always was wonderful .	1529
0	the store is too small . horrible on a saturday . the manager is just ... no words . they never have what i need . so i have to end up ordering and using my pro discount online . mgr states they had to change their inventory over due to a new system . for 3 straight months ? they are horrible here . i do n't even bother . i visit the biltmore location instead .	2409
1	we went to ramada for spring training for my son 's tournament . we were dreading this hotel due to the bad reviews , however i must say this was a great hotel . no complaints whatsoever . we had about 6 other families staying at this hotel as well and we all had a great time ! i would totally stay here again !	1888
0	in one word : meh . the food was only okay . i got the grindhouse burger and shareable fries and rings . burger meat was a bit dry , but still tasty . the sauces that came with the fries were very good . in our group , more good things were said about their delicious mustard than their burgers . the ice cream sandwich was good , but nothing special . the waiter we had was very nice and accommodating .	1417
1	my husband and i are new in henderson and we 're desperately looking for a good sushi restaurant near our home . we were pleasantly surprised when we discovered the sushi ! we went about 3pm for a late lunch , great service ! we had the spicy garlic edamame to start and it was spicy and delicious ! we also tried `` something wrong , the caterpillar and what the hell rolls ... ... loved them all ! highly recommend `` something wrong '' absolutely nothing wrong there ! we will be back !	408
0	over rated . i liked the smooth putting greens and challenging ravine carries , but for $ 200+ you would n't expect a course of this expected caliber to have numerous yellowing spots consistent across all fairways . just because you plunk a golf course into the greater lv area does n't justify high fees . we golfed on thursday late morning and there were perhaps 5 groups on the entire course . drop your fees to $ 75 and expect an in flux .	1087
0	the reviews on here make me think my visit was a fluke ... ordered one of the specialty dogs and fries , fries were undercooked and one of the toppings on the hot dog had gone bad . i could smell it prior to eating ... being brave i figured maybe it was supposed to so i tried a bite but had to spit it out ... definitely not good ... maybe one of the ingredients had gone bad ... like to think that this one slipped through the cracks but who knows sadly , the reviews tell a different story than what i got but for me , i wo n't be back	1566
0	not impressed side door too small with a double elevator bad design and door always open ( bent at bottom ) so temperature controlled not so much and upstairs does get hot too . raise rent after less then a year good thing i was moving out anyway . much cheaper places near by as close as blue diamond should have did my research . automatic payment taken out every month on the 5 but when it was time to check out its the 1st . read fine print not sure would not recommend or use again and all over 17 dollars . my advice look some where else	3919
1	i do not recall the lady who did my nails but she 's located right away and the right side . she 's more short and very nice and gentle with your nails . everyone wants their nails all the way close to cuticles so i recommend this place . i go here all the time for my full sets and fills .	2525
1	well the store was open 24 hours and i needed a loofa so i could take a shower and not only did they have them but they were on sale for .99 so i bought like 6 what a deal woot woot ! ! ! the store was clean and the staff was friendly and thank god they were open because nothing else was open in the area . walgreens has all your everyday essentials and you can get in and out quickly	758
0	day 2 after getting my gels and 3 of my nails chipped.. it 's been a few days now and my cuticles are worse than when they went in . ugh	1288
0	it 's supposed to be $ 4 thursday ... however it 's thanksgiving . out of town ( visiting from san diego ) to catch this flick for the 2nd time since watching it this past saturday . unfortunately guy at the counter said the palms hotel is not honoring the $ 4 due to the holiday but the brendan theatre wanted to . we ended up paying $ 21 for my hubby & i instead of $ 8 ! way to honor your ad brendan theatres*sarcasm* . given , i did have the choice to not pay . seats need cleaning ; they are kinda dingy .	491
1	thanks tasha you are amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i did my single color and it turned out amazing with an awesome blowout ! ! ! ! ! everyone was nice and helpful i had a great time there ! ! ! ! !	636
1	i do n't understand the low ratings ? i come here weekly , am always in and out , i find the staff friendly and the beds high-end . i like this place .	3329
0	really shady operation . i emailed them back and forth a few times about getting counters put in our kitchen . when we were finally ready to go i confirmed the price and told them we could move forward . then i did n't hear back for a few days so i emailed to confirm . a few more days pass and still no response so i email back again . finally a week later i get a response ... '' unfortunately , all our prices went up since last week '' and it 's actually going to be 40 % more . needless to say i would n't recommend ever working with this company in any capacity .	743
0	sorry but not impressed . like the store frontage , but that is where it pretty much stops . only place offered to have a cup of coffee is the social table which frankly is not comfortable when sitting on hard stools . pour over coffee did not taste good , but was offered a drip house coffee instead . it was better but not great . a bit pricey on the coffee . rating this on coffee and experience only .	1332
0	they have no customer service ... went there to open a account and no one had greet us and we waited for 30 min and help .	3202
1	amaizing ! ! ! ! ! ! this place is the place to be if you want a perfect pedi , mani or any other services i went on sunday and even that it was very busy they did n't take to long to see us my pedi was amazing the guy did n't rush the massage was great and my feet look amazing i also got a gel manicure and i absolutely love it the best experience that i ever have with a nail salon ever ! ! ! ! ! i drove from casa grande to this place and it was totally worth it ! ! ! see you guys in 2 weeks	686
0	the manager was rude . we wanted to exchange something we purchased and he was being a smart ass about exchanging for something else . when he returned the money he kind of threw it into my mothers hand , defiantly not politely . not how a manager should represent a store .	1050
0	do not ask these people for help ! working for a auto parts store with no freakin clue of auto parts even with the help of a computer . they will sell you the wrong piece that will screw up your car so that an oil change now turns into am $ 800 part needing to be replaced . and when you tell them instead of trying to fix they problem that they have caused , just look at you and say they 're sorry . really ! ? ! ? so find somewhere else to shop ! save yourself time , aggravating , and money ! ! this store has idiots working for them .	1471
1	i love coming here after work . very relaxing environment inside , or if you prefer , enjoy outside . flavors are good , and the food is excellent . my only complaint is that sometimes the food comes out very slowly . other than that , i 've never had a bad experience here .	1229
1	i was reluctant to try this denny 's becayse of previous reviews but the food was good , served fast and hot . our server , dan , was great . would definitely go back !	1504
1	great food , great service . i ordered the hot stone bibimbap & it was delist . i 'll definitely recommend this restaurant & i 'll be going back .	435
1	a hidden gem with an assortment of delectable french pastries . the sandwiches were alright .	2327
0	walked in at 12pm ( with no appointment ) and left two hours later without a haircut for my son . they claim to be walk-in friendly but it seems like all blocks for the barbers are appointments or they know the barber and people just cut . they need a sign up sheet or a number system to keep track of customers . if you 're going to claim to be walk in , leave blocks open for that purpose . i understand i have to wait a little longer since i did n't make an appointment but two hours is ridiculous . the place is disorganized and the barbers are n't even that good at cutting hair . will be finding another barber .	2366
1	there are a bunch of cry babys if you cant not buy anything from whole foods dont shop there point blank go to walmart or smartshop i love this store they have the best meat and friut from our small frams i love it here its way cheaper then the whole foods nyc ... ..we should be proud we have this type supermarket	3874
0	went for dinner with a friend on friday . i wanted to love it , but ... ... the space is nice . the wines were n't all winners and the food was uninspiring . i considered the charcuterie plate but was underwhelmed when told that it consisted of salami , mortadella and chicken sausage . i had the mahi speacial . the fish was dry and flavorless . service was disengaged . they told us that they are re-doing the menu so maybe the new menu will be better ? with all the other options around not sure i 'll check back to see if that improves things .	296
1	good portions . staff was super friendly . came in right before it was about to close and they went out of their way to make sure i had a good experience without the guilt of keeping the kitchen open ( sorry fellas ) . it 's a new business and it looks like it . everything was super clean , including the bathrooms ( a big tell of how clean the kitchen is ) . prices were reasonable . not the best best sushi you can get - but it 's new and i expect it to grow . their maki was way better than their nigiri .	740
0	overhyped and overpriced . it 's a wannabe gourmet brasserie ... but at the end of the day it 's just another chain restauant.. the lighting was good though and atmosphere was ok .	670
1	the great thing about this gym is that , even during busy hours , it is n't completely packed . another great thing : the energizer bar . love the smoothies !	3912
0	ca n't but cookies ? ordered salad paid try to add some cookies to the order . told i had to go to the back of the line ? terrible service . .wo n't be back	701
1	wow - this place is incredible . it is huge , well lit , organized and everything is used and reasonably priced . saw this place on yelp and had to check it out . they advertise as an entertainment exchange store . they take trades on books , magazines , movies , cds , games ... ... i have never seen a used place this well , great . wish we had something comparable in denver .	3504
0	very disappointed with tire & battery service . came in at 7:30 and was told i had to wait 30 minutes for them to check my battery that i carried in .	2172
0	absolutely terrible . waited four hours for groceries to be delivered because delivery driver called wrong number when delivering . they were given the apartment number and told it was ok to leave at the door . instead driver leaves with no attempt to contact . absolute incompetence , pizza hut must not be hiring drivers .	1914
0	do n't come here ! ! ! really bad service with terrible attitude . they do n't know how to take care the customers . cars are not clean for multiple times even with ultimate plus wash . tired to deal with them just want to let everyone knows how bad they are . do n't waste your money !	127
0	went here once , was pretty good , so i came back a second time and food was not anywhere close to what it was the first time . unfortunately wo n't be back . check out greek wraps if you want great greek .	755
0	rude front desk coordinators , overall the place is clean and handicap accessible .	1620
0	horrible quality of work i paid 143 $ for a detailing package and my car was not clean at all i could 've done a way better job do not go here it was a complete waste of money # unitedstatesnavyveteran	199
1	yay ! they have opened , and they are close to my work . i had an arugula salad with chicken , and it was excellent . they had a nice patio to sit on that was less noisy than inside . good customer service . i was not feeling well that day , and the staff was nice to me . i was getting a migraine and probably looked like i was going to die . i look forward to coming back . i also hope they get their online ordering up and running because i will definately use that .	1161
0	if you are looking for selection and good prices go to buffalo exchange across the street which has 10 times the floor space . fruition has only a small rectangular space , with a rather limited amount of clothes on display . took less than 3 minutes to determine that our visit was a waste of time .	377
1	fabulous experience from the minute we met sales representative , tania . very knowledgable with great suggestions . we order 5 mallin bar stools and we were hoping they would be delivered before july 4th although no promises were made . we were so delighted to get tania 's call saying that we would have them by july 2nd . delivery was scheduled from 1-4 pm and at noon we received a call saying the driver was 30 minutes out . stools were delivered in perfect condition and the driver and assistant were very professional . the cushion color is perfect . we shopped around and pricing was very competitive . we are so happy we chose all american and highly recommend them .	217
0	went there on 1/3/2014 after purchasing vouchers for myself and 2 friends . the massage was not the best . the pressure was inadequate . after the massages for the 3 of us , they would not let us leave till we left the tips that they wanted $ 10-15 minimum . we had to comply in order to leave . it was very uncomfortable .	735
1	absolutely the best customer service i have ever received at a service department at a car dealership . i worked with colby , he was attentive to all my needs inquired if i had any concerns and kept me informed of the process along the way . the service department is so fancy ! they will make you a breakfast sandwich , serve you coffee , give you a bagel , and it 's very comfortable while you wait . it was an attack euler experience great job !	3065
0	our family stayed at this hotel during our visit to toronto . the front desk person was rude and refused to adjust our reasonable request . we ended up with the rooms we did not satisfy with . the lobby looks good . however , the rooms are really old . no better than a motel . the worse thing is that my room had a leaking toilet and the noise kept me from falling in asleep . my mom found several hairs on her bed . obviously , they did not change the sheet . bad experience , wo n't go there again .	2795
1	great place to get away ! the hotel was amazing ! it sat right next to the lake . mexican and luna bistro were really good places to eat at . will be back soon ! !	3916
0	very mediocre pizza . if you 're stranded in the brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you 're really hungry , you 'd be better off walking to the circle k and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives . to everyone who gave it lots of stars , you need to get out more and live a little ... and eat better pizza .	773
1	had my cleaning today and it was great and fast service ! i saw hieu , dr wong and zabee ! all great and the manner in which my grandparents and i were treated was pretty fantastic ! thanks for a stress free visit !	3292
1	shabu shabu paradise is an excellent alternate lunch for anyone wanting to try something new . a brief rundown , shabu shabu is a japanese meal where they bring a hot pot of water with meat and assorted vegetables to be dipped and cooked in the boiling water . you also receive different sauces to add flavor to the meat . their lunch special is a great deal that always leaves me satisfied at the end . also do n't forget , you can always ask for more vegetables to go with your meat . i definitely recommend checking out this restaurant !	285
0	sat for twenty minutes without an acknowledgement from a server . thank god for the busser bringing bread .	1224
0	i just has the most unpleasant experience in this outlet . the poor girl at the register was getting swamped and literally 4 male `` management '' members were just standing around by some shoes engaging in some very inappropriate work place conversation watching the line build . i waited 15 minutes to pay ! ! how ridiculous ! you should really invest your money in a management team that is n't full of a bunch of lazy and rude employees .	1846
0	the office staff is quite rude . they are very inflexible and act like you are lucky to be accepted as a client at all . i will be looking elsewhere .	1712
0	trying to book an appointment is impossible here , i 've called multiple times and was asked to come by a stylist at 10am and once i was here the receptionist with the ombré . latin maybe has been very rude from the start , always with an attitude . she told me that my stylist was already book when my stylist told me she was n't . every time i 've come in , this lady has an attitude . if you 're trying to book here i would n't , receptionists are very rude . and still i 've come back twice now , this place is 30 minutes from me and i still have n't gotten my hair done	354
0	online scheduling process was a breeze . scheduled my onsite replacement three days out ( first available time slot ) and they kept me updated via multiple email and phone calls along the way . safelite called 20 minutes prior to my appointment stating they were short staffed and would not be able make it - requiring a reschedule several more days out . i cancelled the replacement and found another company to complete my work the same day .	2444
1	very nice facility , and most importantly , clean . i used the level 5 bed , which was new and made for a quick and easy tan . the girl that helped me out was helpful and sweet . the prices are a bit more than other tannning spots but you get what you pay for . i definitely recommend this place .	3898
1	this place deserves 5 stars . always phenomenal customer service and consistently amazing coffee . never disappoints -- i highly recommend over any coffee place in phoenix	1484
1	this place is so good ! it just opened up and i loved it . it 's really chill which i love . the burger is n't as big as i thought it would be , but it 's super filling . especially with the amount of fries they give ! looks like fuku just got a new regular . ( ;	964
1	funny story , everything i wrote , i meant ! i accidentally used my husband 's yelp page , oops . i am kim & i love di luxe polish lounge !	1370
1	i came here to buy two new tires for my 2007 prius . all together , the bill was $ 215 . i did n't feel like i was getting ripped off . the people who work there were quite polite and efficient . they also pointed out that i did n't have an inspection sticker ( required by the state ) , so i 'm going back on monday to have those tests done .	3197
1	one of my favorite places to grab a few pints and a bite to eat . really laid back and chill atmosphere , great and friendly staff , good food . and u can always catch the game . great for large groups too .	1091
0	it was ... .. unforgettable . but not for anything awesome . corny , hair-metal , creepy , dark , sorta christmas-ish , stage show with hair whipping , lasers , flames , tigers and dragons . ( yes . dragons ) sounds like it should be a giant stocking stuffed with awesome . yeah ... not so much . that said , you 'll be talking about this mess for years to come .	2968
1	had an awesome time today . signed my son up for the intro to archery class . the instructor , tim , took time with each archer and gave helpful tips so everyone was able to hit the targets . terriffic way to spend an afternoon . will be signing up for more classes . the prices compared to overall value is a huge win !	471
1	love it ... . just need to get theirs booking partners on same page with check in check outs also they can a few smoking rooms only thing i was unhappy about but i was in heaven ... .	2973
0	went in to get some work done by chris . he was going to fill in two tattoos that were already stenciled out . paid 300 dollars to have him fill in one on my hand to have him dip out in the middle of our session . he added on a bunch of beads going down my hand in a line that was n't straight and tattooed over another artist work without my permission . my tattoo looks like shit and am now doing sessions costing me thousands to get it lasered off . cheers to the most expensive/shitiest tattoo on my body . thanks chris	1658
1	i love living here . last night my air went out . i called the after hours number and their maintenance guy can out at 10:30 at night and fixed my air-conditioning unit . the office staff is incredibly helpful and friendly . they make you feel very comfortable . highly recommend this place	2745
0	i did a deposit at this location today . the deposit machine was a mess ; there was a subway cup sitting right next to it , and numerous receipts from previous customers all over the surrounding counter . none of the employees seemed to be doing anything productive . you 'd think they could at least keep the place tidy . even the tellers booth had trash on it . i 've never been to such an unkempt bank ! the least they could do is acknowledge the existence of their customers , but not here .	2983
0	sad ... i was n't expecting great . i was expecting some service and maybe a drink now and again . when the place is packed and the food beats the first round of drinks to the table there is a problem . if you are looking for a drink and shot place , you are good ( at bar or door service only ) . if you are looking for anything slightly above a dive bar- this is not your place . lots of better options very close . downhill further and further the last few years .	2532
1	i really like this place . somewhere between a whole foods and hinens . they have a great meat selection to include lots of ohio local beef . the produce section is fantastic . they have a lot of those things you do n't find at the standard stores without paying whole paycheck prices . their international and seasonal section is great . lots of bbq sauce selections as well as hot sauces . their store brand pasta and sauces , cooler in the back by the bakery , is great . the prices are in line with ge , but much less then wf . selection much larger than tj ,	495
0	gave this ht a try after the remodel . my normal one is the east blvd location . horrible produce selection . more than one dairy/frozen item was close to expiring . i picked up a frozen pizza about to expire in 2 days . i would not have been a happy camper if i took it home and went to enjoy the home run inn goodness a week later and found it was expired . my purpose of the trip was to restock on fage yogurt . i could n't buy many as they were expiring in 4 days . i will stick to the east blvd and morrocroft locations . until publix opens closer , then i 'll give that a try .	1061
0	they can give you a venti cup but they dont have to fill it up . check your drinks in the drive thru	2358
0	horrible , tried to use my store credit that they wrote me and i even asked when they wrote it `` how long is it good for ? '' and they told me anytime its like cash . i 'm told that it is now only good for 1 month cause the old guy was fired . on top of losing out on my $ 60 the kid behind the counter acts like he is too busy talking to his girlfriend behind the counter about her friend to come help me . definitely gon na go other places	2342
0	do not buy the groupon for the jcpenney optical department . it 's not a good deal . it 's just to get you in the door . you ca n't buy a reasonable pair of eyeglasses for the groupon price .	223
0	this place is such a waste of money . think applebee 's atmosphere , with food that has no flavor whatsoever . i mean none . it 's like they went out of their way to make everything as bland as possible . i got the shrimp tacos.. with no flavor . my girlfriend got the chicken sandwich.. that tasted like it was made before seasoning was invented . you 've been warned : over priced , under spiced , and the most forgettable meal of my life .	201
0	this company is horrible ! ! ! ! the front desk receptionists have no manners . brandon was my go to guy and in charge of my unit and it was impossible to get anything fixed . i moved into a town home with no screens , broken glass , broken cabinets and cat hair and urine infested carpets . as soon as our year was up we moved out and got jipped my almost $ 900 deposit . worst experience ever and i do not recommend anyone to rent from this horrible company .	3451
1	this chinese dessert place always brings back old memories ! it 's been around for many years and it 's still very popular in the area . they make really good black sesame soup - not too sweet and rich with flavour . the fried milk is also delish - not too oily or heavy . they have a pretty comprehensive list of all the hk dessert favourites as well as savory items such as the street style rice rolls and claypot rice . good spot for some late night snacking .	1062
1	if you are looking for a good preschool check out granny 's little genius . it is like family with owners who love the children and the teachers are dedicated to learning . it seems like every time we drop off our child there is another experience for them . my son has a ball here !	3836
1	simply botox but after 15 years the best ! thank you to dr. ross stutman , md , i believe you get what you pay for and this will last ! i will be back for filler and trust in your services .	2099
0	my wife needed her nails done , went here and it was slow and they did a horrible job . paint all over her skin on every nail . treated her hands like a lawnmower blade and not like a human . rough . coarse and sloppy . she will not be going back .	2922
1	now , i know that not everyone is perfect ! so with that in mind , i have always had great service at the pepboys on rancho . if something did n't go how it should have or there were ever any problems , they were always quick to fix it and to make sure i was always happy ! ! now with that in mind , i just received a very nice gift for christmas from the fleet regional manager rick skarda . just the thought alone was a great gift ! so i guess what i 'm trying to say is , they take care of there people ! ! ! !	2263
1	we are new to the area and found jasmine buffet through yelp . good selection , friendly staff , and clean atmosphere .	1302
1	love this place , i bring my 3 dogs all the time they do a great job and staff treats them like their own .	3779
0	walked with some lady friends of mine . asked the bartender some simple questions about what 's available . it was obvious from her response that women of colour are not welcome in this establishment . people of colour and allies go elsewhere .	3077
0	this dentist office is one to stay clear of . the dentist missed a broken tooth my wife had . the hygienist did a bad job on both myself and my daughter . the dentist also missed a number of problems with my families teeth and the business office over-billed us and were very rude . stay away from this place .	3766
1	my first time going in i only had a pedicure , which was awesome ! ! my second time i returned to try nexgen nails which they promote a lot and is a bit more pricey than regular acrylic ( $ 35 ) . the set lasted me six weeks ! ! i had no lifting nor did my hair get stuck . definitely will be returning .	838
1	very helpful and friendly staff . they greeted us as soon as we came in and asked how they could help , offering coffee and a couch for my husband . they have good quality fabric and their selection was different from other shops i 've been in . i 'll definitely be going back !	3136
1	awesome service ! i accidentally sent my mobile order to a different location ( and i was already late for work ) and the team graciously offered to save me the trip and make my order anyways . made my morning ! : )	1532
1	i have been to this post office several times . the last time i was there the guy behind the counter was so friendly and helpful . he went above and beyond to make sure to help me find the best way to package something at the best price . i am impressed with the excellent customer service and kindness from them !	2034
1	i was a new patient here and they took my insurance ( bcbs ppo ) . i saw dr. suni ( sunildat maheshwari ) and he was amazing . he took time to talk to me about what i was there for - he set his clipboard aside and we talked for about 15 minutes . the staff is friendly , but a bit busy for my taste - which is of course a good sign . i have been looking for a new pcp for awhile now and i believe i 've found it . the parking is great , it 's in a nice part of town , and the hours are awesome : late hours mon-thurs , and open weekends .	1562
0	spoiled beer , rude service , and bad location . would n't recommend to my worst enemy . trust me , steer clear of this dump .	421
0	the only reason why this place gets one star is because it was really organized and clean . my mom bought some of there meat and there was some discoloration of the meat and the meat had a god awful smell to it . i ended up getting sick from the meat . never buying meat here.. a little disappointed because it was my first time	1595
1	good pizza at a great price . the all meat pizza was loaded with toppings and hit the spot . the homemade lasagna was some of the best i 've had .	459
1	they were recommended to me by a friend who lives here , we are from oregon and visit every year for a month or two we had some air conditioning problems , freon , and matthew help us and got us back on the road . as i was waiting , i watched matthew with other customers , he was very helpful , knowledgeable , and professional , because of him i would recommend autozone to others if they need help . thanks matthew , bill and nancy from oregon ( see next march )	2502
1	a very nice salad enjoyed vey much but the person with had to ask for bread to be grilled and more sauce as it was very little .	1212
1	i 've been coming here for a while now and have to say im never let down . food and service have always been impeccable .	431
0	came here today 9/1 to pick up some donuts and they were completely rude . did n't even get a hello entering and was basically ignored . the blond kid behind the register had no clue on how to use it . the older female took forever to pick out a dozen and i do n't see why it would take 2 people to to fill 1 order . as i waited patiently to be served , they continue to ignore me by serving another guy that had just walked in . talk about complete bullshit .	2053
1	dr deka is great , she really takes good care of her patients and is always available if you have any questions . i highly recommend her	1589
1	cecil was awesome and honest ! he diagnosed the problem and told us the best option . i would definitely call mojave air conditioning again for any of my a/c needs .	2031
1	part of the next part of our anniversary night we came here for dessert round 2 ! for smores and a really nice place to lounge and be all romantic was perfect . took a very long to get our smores but the waiter informed us it was because there were only a limited allowed smores fires to be used in that restaurant .	621
0	do not like the way they do eyebrows and i went twice nothing changed.. i even showed her a picture of what i want and i have really nice thick eyebrows i just wanted my arch raised a little higher and cleaned up still left there very unhappy , have n't been since	3140
1	i come to this fry 's about once or twice every month . i love that they have drop off childcare for while you shop . that makes `` boring '' grocery trips more tolerable for my kiddo . i am always pleasantly surprised by the level of customer service the employees here provide . everyone seems so chipper and friendly . i am glad it is tucked away and not too busy here ! if you live in the ahwatukee foothills , you should shop here !	1967
1	second time my husband and i have used them . we bought our first camera system from costco . great product . easy to use . tech support was very helpful when we had a question . we needed to buy a new dvr . because we had a problem with the old one we had for four years . again customer service was wonderful and very helpful . we bought a new dvr . we were given a delivery due date that was acceptable . we got our new dvr a week earlier than expected . we will continue to use them . we have friends and family we have turned onto lorextech for their home security system .	2131
0	went in for the $ 19.99 oil change . ended up with a $ 100 bill , a laundry list of stuff to fix on the car and to top it off they damaged the o ring on the oil filter causing a further oil leak . will not go back here again !	3379
1	what a great place . my daughter and i were visiting from toronto , went for frozen yogurt one night and saw this place . next day we decided we needed a spot to get a new set of nails for her and a fill for myself . i called ahead from our hotel and they said they would stay open for us which was incredibly kind . got there at 730 pm and we both received our services quickly and professionally . they did a great job for both of us . will be back any time we are in vegas !	1272
0	service was good when i could get it but they tried to sell you parts not really needed - e.g . run capacitor . scheduling is always an issue with these folks , even when you have a maintenance agreement . better figure on three months out and you have to call them to schedule the appointment . i 'm done - finding a closer service provider .	1718
1	excited about the new place in the northside . finally have a place to drink sunday night . great beer selection . had a burger which was done extremely well . only down side was no one was here . people help support this bar . pirates season will be amazing but i do n't want them to reduce the hours . how many times were you looking for a chill place to eat and drink on a sunday night .	839
0	simply put ... it 's ok. a quick stop if you 're thirsty and want to spend starbucks money for a mediocre level product . cashiers were friendly & accommodating but i wo n't be visiting again .	2204
1	lorenzo is the only place and person i trust for my watches and jewelry he 's honest . works hard . and is very reasonable for the quality work he has done he has refurbished my grandfathers omega constellation , changed out bands , and repaired my wife 's tennis bracelet wish there were more places like this in town !	2064
0	i drove past this place a few times , and it seemed to have some potential . boy was i wrong . awful . the steak was so overdone i could n't chew it . the grilled shrimp were average . the best part of the dish was the seasoned rice , so no , i wo n't be going back .	1486
1	eddie came to our residence promptly , spent a great deal of time diagnosing the issue . made two trips ( at no extra charge ) to a supplier . he was personable , informative , and very careful with our refrigerator . particularly in removal and re installation . although eddie went above and beyond in terms of repairs and services his price very reasonable and a bargain . we will use a-1 appliance and eddie from here on and we are telling all of our friends and relatives about him .	3879
1	one of the few good korean restaurant in this area . they cut back on some things from the last time i came . but the food was good . i 'll be back .	435
1	i do not come here often but today the service was very good . my cashier was very helpful and sweet with a very nice smile . i appreciate good service ! the restroom needed attention but other than that very nice .	1220
0	to many times i 've been in there and they are just to busy talking to each other to help anyone . yesterday i stood right in front of two employees and they both looked at me , turned away and kept talking . i went to leave and one yelled out asking if she could help me . i went elsewhere and spent a couple hundred dollars . i 've spent a lot of money on their over priced stuff because i like to shop locally . but if they do n't care if i spend my money elsewhere then why should i ?	3612
0	what type of bar serves drinks in a thimble you ask ? this one ! what a freaking rip off . sure the waitresses were hot , but in zona , apparently all of the girls are hot . well at least in the .5 mile radius . they must grow because of the sun . they probably use photosynthesis . the atmosphere was n't too bad , but it was your typical bar , with typical bar food , with typical douchebags . solid one star for the rip off drink amounts .	180
1	where have you been all my life ? for the pastry snob that is used to delicacy type pastries , french and european , this place does n't disappoint . from eclairs and french horns , macaroons to cupcakes , i will never eat pastries from anywhere else again . and need a custom cake ? they do that too ; and better than any others i 've ever seen . i will never have a dessert from anywhere else but baker wee now for the rest of my life . quality , but affordable . thank you for reviving my dessert taste buds !	868
0	unlimited data means unlimited - not after 26gigs we slow your data down to an unusable level - this rule has to go - it is wrong to advertise that data is unlimited when it is not true . the people want unlimited fast data at any cost so invest in your network and upgrade it to make it happen . the wifi rates are outrageous and do n't make any sense - a second unlimited phone data line cost $ 50/month but wifi is $ 95 for only 22 gigs	1032
1	oh how i love me some mamason ! i came to wigland to explore my options being i refuse to do a lot with my hair this summer . oh how i wish i knew the ladies name at this shop being she is the sweetest most helpful lady . i can say if you visit on a day she not there , the gentleman is not as nice and helpful and seems to get skittish if there are to many people in the in the store at one time . if the store is slow , he can be pretty helpful . i 'll be back in the near future for more shirley 's !	1873
0	i had to bring my daughter here , because she was sick , we just moved to az , so do n't have a pediatrician for her yet . the staff was friendly , great doctor . they did n't do much , regular check up . ear , throat , check her temperature , and charged us $ 150 ... . for urgent care ? ? ? ? ? i am used to paying $ 40 . and they do n't tell u that in advance . will never go back ...	3698
1	as an update to my original post - gold 's took notice of my initial review and called me personally to thank me for the kind words and for being such a great member ! it 's awesome to hear from them and it just reinforces my love for gold 's ! if anyone is new to pittsburgh and looking for a health club , i would strongly suggest you checking them out ! thanks again for the call , the free month of membership , and the tshirt !	2338
0	from a visit a few months ago ... .when it was still hot outside i had the bahn mi dog w/ fries . it was very good . only major complaint was that the a/c was not working in the restaurant , so it was very hot .	1566
1	getting refinance on my car . great service ask for shue he is the best for your banking needs i got my higher interest cc transferred to a lower no annual fee and no transfer fee up to 2 months so i am saving 400 dollars each month . i am a happy camper .	3202
0	i was not able to place a togo order at the bar . bartender told me she was `` slammed '' . i had to walk to togo area to place order . i have never experienced this in any restaurant before . server was rude and not very welcoming as well . i did not receive a thank you for stopping in or anything . food was good , but the hospitality was not there from the bartender-3/30/18	1189
1	do n't go here often but needed something fabric related for a little diy project i was doing . the staff was helpful ( i had no idea where to look ) and i was in and out pretty quick .	3943
0	our doctors office moved here ( dr/owner retired ) so we had no choice but to try 4c . we were with our former drs office 22 years , but we will be with 4c only 2 visits . the service levels are simply ho-hum to disappointing . bye bye .	938
1	been here a couple of time . people here are always nice . mocha red bean smoothy is good .	716
0	we often order bubble tea from formocha , their tea is good and it 's close to the office . but every time we order big , this time 21 drinks , there is always something wrong or maybe is a new type of drink , 3 of us ordered match milk tea ( photo attached ) , they came with the perfect description on each drink , the colour is not as traditional matcha is , instead it is yellow ( like mango yellow ) , perhaps it is the new matcha ?	989
0	if the service was greatly improved , i may consider going back . the wraps are delicious . having to wait over 10 minutes to get drink orders and another 15 or so for food orders is a little ridiculous . especially for a place that 's never too busy .	1319
0	should have known better when all the other places around were busy and their parking lot was empty.server sucked , no ice in our drinks , cold fries , nasty chili or dog food , over priced frozen bar food and our orders were incorrect . we had a party of 9 , even my daughters grilled cheese was cold and not grilled . huge bill for nasty food , weird service and a regret for not just going to harrolds . i could make a list of things wrong with the food but i would be typing all day . wo n't go back .	211
1	this location is pretty big ! two levels . the staff is usually nice , they greet you and help you as well . my only probably is that this place is always a mess . all their things are every where . other than that i do n't mind going to this location .	1872
1	food and atmosphere great but service terrible . saw the server 3 times in 1 hour . no second drink and no dirty plated taken . hope it was just him .	632
1	i have come to taylors a few times now for things here and there and gotten really great prices as well as customer service ! as sometimes it may happen i got a bad part about 2 weeks ago and my car overheated yesterday and i could not move it . two of the guys from taylors came all the way to my home to make it right and put a new radiator on again ! talk about above and beyond ! i am so grateful and will be continuing my business relationship here for all my cars needs ! thankyou don , mark and eric for today : )	2308
1	i am so impressed with the pediatric side of montevista hospital in las vegas , nv . for 3 yrs we have tried to get help for our grandson . no one in az has helped . finally , the long term care he is getting should help ! at the very least , we have a break from all his abuse to us ! the hospital is pristine in cleanliness , the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable , the psychiatrist was very easy to work with and finally someone is listening and seeing the hell we 've been through for 11 yrs .	2068
1	its ayt . love the steak burrito swimming in cheese and sauce . but it a $ 1 to be like that . not a fan of the lighting , i dont like eating in the dark .	1365
1	love that they give you a huge bowl and they fill it all the way up . the salad is made fresh right in front of you , service was fast and it was crowded . staff was friendly as well .	147
1	got my free birthday egg sandwich great customer service , will definitely be back if in the area and need a quick breakfast .	1214
1	this was amazing . i drove in for a quick wash . i was pleasantly surprised they had a drive-through option ! it was a great price , very quick and my car looks amazing . the quick wash got my car very clean ! i will definitely be back to this location .	127
1	went in and was going to get a new game but insisted to give me the used version so that o can return it if i do t like it and that was awesome how they try to save u money	3027
0	i placed an order for a carbon fiber hood . i completed the order process online , my card was charged the full amount plus $ 75 shipping . i was emailed the next day and told that i needed to pay an additional 135 for shipping . when i received the shipping notice email ( 2 weeks later ) i noticed the shipping amount was significantly less . when i questioned it i was told the additional was for sales tax and when i questioned that , i never heard back . i wo n't be doing business again with vividracing.com . that is a shady .	978
0	after buying $ 1,000 washing machine from these guys it broke . while it was still under warranty it took over eight weeks for them to come and fix it . can you imagine going 8 weeks without a washing machine ! i went to these guys because they were local and i wanted to support a local business but it will be the last time that i buy anything from them . they have great customer service until something goes wrong and then you 're sol .	3784
1	i think the main guy who works here is named mo . he was such a friendly and cool person to talk to . he gave me a sweet deal on a water pipe that i bought . i highly , highly recommend going to hi life . it definitely beats the smoke shop right behind it .	1556
0	customer service is terrible . needed to do an exchange and they were more concerned with keeping inventory straight . they make that situation the customers problem .	3780
1	very friendly service..went out of their way to make my order . gave me a free drink for my inconvience .	870
1	john helped us out this morning . he was charming , helpful and generous ! got us hooked up with a free upgrade to a mustang ( as it was available ) . it was very quick and pain free experience , not your usual when it comes to car rentals . thank you john ! the price was right , the service great ; this was the most streamlined car rental experience for us to date . do n't go to fox , spend the extra hundred for proper service and a quality vehicle .	2134
1	managed to get a great deal by booking several months in advance at this hotel and glad we did . the hotel appears to be brand new and is modern and elegantly designed . the rooms are well appointed and beautifully furnished ... there was a little noise from other guests , but not obtrusive . the free use of gold 's gym was also a great bonus ... all in all , we loved it and would not hesitate to return ...	3859
1	i was in town to play in a celebrity/ charity hockey tourney . met up with some boys from college and stayed here . the hotel was great . pool was fantastic . location was great . only down side was there was some construction going on outside and they started at 7am sharp . it sounded like it was right outside our rooms . the sliding doors were shut , but did n't help . thank god that was only friday morning as they were n't working sat and sun .	1859
1	this was a perfect hotel for a 4-day stay . hotel staff was nice . my room overlooked a park . it was really quiet all day and all night . the room was clean and tidy . there was plenty of parking . room was just a few steps away from my car . back entrances are access-controlled with the room key . good selection of television stations . price was awesome too !	2772
1	from my first encounter with cassie , my sales rep , through the final modifications to my in-floor cleaning system , ( thanks ron and jarod ) cdc pools demonstrated their ability to transform an old , worn out eyesore into a beautiful , showpiece . i am no longer embarrassed to have friends and family over for a swim party . instead , i welcome every opportunity to show off the terrific job done by cdc pools . the new tile , stair accents and micro-pebble tech finish look so nice that sometimes my wife and i sit out back with no intent of swimming , just to enjoy the oasis cdc has created for us . would i use cdc again , most definitely !	659
0	a storage locker is just a storage locker . the only thing that really makes one better than the next is price and customer service . i made the mistake of not shopping around and when i discovered that public storage on camelback is significantly more than its competitors , i still was n't motivated to relocate to more reasonable storage until the office staff became increasingly rude . paying more is irritating but there was no way i was going to continue to support staff who have no sense of customer satisfaction and basic courtesy . clearly they do n't realize that the bottom line is that it is the cusomter that pay their salary . never again , good riddance	3521
1	this has the be the best dentist office i have been to . they treat you with the utmost respect and are patient . i have had my wisdom teeth pulled and many other things completed and have never had an issue . they are very up to date with technology which is a plus for someone like me . they send you text reminders of appointments so you do n't have to answer a call on your busy work day . thank you dental depot for all you do !	3004
0	i have been a customer at this walgreens for over 15 years . the quality of the staff has gone back and forth during that time . but i had an experience this evening that needs to be recorded . roxeanne was rude and condescending during my transaction . i would not post a bad review under just any circumstances . but , she was what i would call `` flippant '' . she was snotty and disrespectful . she is not someone that i feel walgreens really wants as the `` face '' of their company .	1733
0	brought out cold food . to be fair , they changed it for us and apologized but did not taste good at all . i would 've been able to make a better pasta sauce and cutlet at home . the wine was also brought to us after the food because they did n't have enough wine glasses . a joke ! extremely overrated .	728
1	they do an amazing job ! i always receive compliments after i have them done there . the other time i was in utah and had them done , the person did a horrible job ... so came back to vegas and my girl did her thang ! would 've given 5 stars but as said on previous reviews ... the girls are a bit cold , unwelcoming and not very charismatic .	460
1	this experience was a joy . the food was great . service was great . i started out at the currito burrito . without borders . they were rude . went to marathon and they offered a frequent buyer card . such a great experience . i 'll be back here .	6
0	not sure how `` feelings '' are involved here . this is a business transaction . you delivered subpar amateurish work and were judged for it . deal with it and adjust . provide competant trained employees and screw the damn cap on . excuses do no one no good . your response offered nothing more than to further demonstrate your lack of accountability .	565
1	i lifted my boycott . i am a creepy guy . i like coming here and doing hoodrat stuff with my friends . http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qcqognqyxp4	2004
0	super shady business practices , getting out of a gym membership is easier than getting out of one of the packages ! they claim freezing or canceling is possible when you give a months notice but it 's a lie . the owner is rude . no thanks ! go anywhere else , there 's a ton of places around that do n't charge nearly as much and are much nicer .	1816
1	ordered by phone from the states . left vm the night before and was woken up the next morning by a chipper and helpful salesgirl who was ready with suggestions .	1927
0	i 'm member for two years . lately me and my wife we do not have the time to drive to the fitness because of the kids practise every other day . we decide to cancel the month to month contract . first takes over 20 minutes on the phone . second they will charge you for the next month fee because they need 30 days notice . third they will charge you a yearly fee . so it may looks affordable but if you decide to cancel does not look that audible anymore .	342
0	horrible cust . service there atms machines were down had my family all packed up to watch a movie with no consideration the manager says sorry there 's nothing we can do , i even asked can we eat h the movie and after pay after and he says nope ! but tell me to go across the street and use the atm there , my movie was about to start and i explained that also just think there was more he could of done then just shut us down so if off the amc we go ! ! !	2524
0	worst ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do not use ! ! ! i 've moved over 15 times in my life and this is by far the worst company i 've ever dealt with . lot 's of up charges after the fact ... they did a lot of damage . the sales people do there job and it all sounds great and then look out ! ! ! ! ! !	2975
0	possibly the most useless and indifferent gate staff . not helpful , not attentive . basically , check yourself in ... no explanation nor apology for flight delays ... uncomfortable seats , inefficient process .	1623
0	this place back in the early 2000 was much better tasting according to my memory . the squid and fish balls were larger and better tasting . same owner , but the place looks `` tired '' if you know what i mean . such a shame , i really enjoyed their noodle back then .	1477
1	these folks are great . they have dog and cat supplies too . great service to your car . they ask to help you . advice and assistance is freely offered .	530
0	i do n't care if it is good or it bites . i 've been waiting 45 min since ordering with no food served in a restaurant with only 4 of 25 tables occupied . never again	50
1	service is good . they are all kind and nice . and omgosh their massage was unforgettably great .	3559
0	the service at this location is slow , the prices are outrageous , the food is totally sub-par , the drinks are always made super duper weak , and they close really early . i do n't suggest coming here for a good time . the servers are nice , but i would suggest going to a more delicious location .	705
1	penguin air was perfect and steve was wonderful ! patiently explained the system , how it works and how to get the best and safest use from the equipment . will gladly have him back , thank you steve ! !	2203
0	came out to check my water softener . told me that the unit is disposable and not worth repairing . i was charged $ 90 for the 15 min it took to diagnose and tell me that . so now the new water softener will just be an extra $ 90 . do n't recommend .	3138
0	i was looking for a nice nail place and went here because of the reviews . i am not happy with my choice . they do horrible job . the lady was very fast at painting my nails and it looks messy . good thing i chose nail color that does n't show her messiness . i would n't recommend this place . if you like your nails neat , go somewhere else .	2977
0	this is the worst dealership i have ever done business with . had my car a couple of months . these people are unprofessional and a bunch of damn crooks . sold myself and my husband a car passenger side rear view mirror broke we were promised that it would get fixed . had this car for 7 months or so and still has n't been fixed . first they say they can fix it then they say they ca n't find a part so it will be a used part . everyone there are assholes and unprofessional .	1488
1	highly recommend focus plumbing ! jim was really nice and very helpful ! he gave us some good tips and i felt like he genuinely cared and not just there to get money . give them a call for all your pluming needs .	1714
1	first off land rover las vegas is a tier 1 establishment . second to none . after you buy a vehicle the person you interact with the most at the dealership is your service advisor . gary morris , my service advisor , has helped me over the years with 3 different vehicles . gary 's customer service is top notch and he always makes my visit as easy as possible . it 's people like this that bring value to a company and that have helped keep me and my family land rover customers .	2659
1	very good pizza , though the thin crust got soggy quickly . the thick crust might be the way to go , if you can handle all that dough . we had the quattro formagio on thin crust , and it was one of the best 4 cheese pizzas i 've eaten . sauce was good , cheese was great quality . only quibble is about that crust - i like my cracker thin and crispy ! service was reasonably quick and polite , maybe a bit better than we experienced other places in a tourist oriented town . one pizza fed 2 of us quite satisfactorily .	282
1	excellent food and great service . this is my favorite cora as there 's normally not a long wait ( if any ) for a table , and food arrives at a reasonable speed . the waitresses are very helpful also , and keeps checking back on us for refills on our coffee .	1060
1	adorable coffee shop on the west side . very eclectic & comfy cozy . good music & lots of interesting places to sit . the frappucchino is really wonderful too .	2219
0	this has to be the worst indian restaurant i 've ever eaten at . maybe they were having a bad night , but the food was atrocious . i ordered chicken tikka masala and the color of the masala looked like light brown dog food . the taste was super bland and i could only eat about one third of the meal before throwing it out . the chicken was dry , chewy and far from any kind of tenderness . we also had the chicken tikka and the chicken was also the same , hard and chewy . super disappointing meal !	640
0	this is now called zips car wash. we just got the cheapest car wash package ( $ 10 ) with free pre-big treatment . the whole car wash did very little . left dirt on the back , bird poop and bugs all over the front of the car . only good thing was the suction of the vacuum . i 'll go back taking my chances with a gas station car wash from now on .	3036
1	a surprise find with a great mission . food was delicious -- had the `` turkey day '' with cran-peña ( yes - cranberry & jalapeño ) sauce on super good sourdough bread comes with a salad that has homemade dressing and cherry tomatoes sliced on a mandolin ! my husband had a pot roast dip sandwich that was huge and it was actually was turkey - yet tasted like beef ! also enjoyed a lot ! their mission of working with three main charity organizations for assistance is touted and obvious inside the restaurant . great people work who are warm and very helpful . going back ! ! !	277
0	every time i go in there david helps me he needs to get a sense of humor change his attitude because he 's a bump on a log and is not inviting or friendly	2159
0	i contacted this business because they had such great reviews . i moved to arizona almost a year ago and did n't want to go another summer without protecting the paint on my suv . i asked for a quote for oxidation removal and protective coat on my toyota 4runner . the emailed response i received was `` sorry , we are booked a week out . '' really ? i only asked for a quote and would have waited for an appointment .	2382
1	i 'm always treated with respect when i go in . these people always remember my name and i 'm not a big tipper , i 'm on a budget . i plan to start using yelp more often and letting people know my opinions .	1783
0	me and my friend visit this place im not really crazy about this place its really old and dark inside , food is ok but not really in top of the line for restaurant like this ! and they can really use a big remodeling ,	717
0	the crab legs were delivered cold and with no krackers . no refills on drinks . waitress friendly but not accommodating in her profession . spoke to mgt but doubt it made difference . i hate leaving bad reviews because the person reading doesnt know the background or basis of my post . check my other reviews	201
1	i 've always liked mexican food but when i tried my first chipotle bowl , it absolutely blew me away . i love mexican food for sure . & with jalapeno sauce it is even better . this is definitely a place i can always stop by to grab a quick bite at .	214
1	great days of golf and two terrific meals outside with a sunset . great pace to get away for the day .	1138
1	this place is very organized , friendly and unique . staff was on the ball and made sure every customer was attended to . it is a bit pricey , but i will definitely go again .	3813
0	horrible property management company , one cheap chinese broker . kept our deposit and neglected thru out our stay . do not rent a property from these bogus cheap place . should be rated f+	3375
0	the security took the drink out of my hand even though it was 15 minutes before close . everyone else was great but the management was awful .	1176
0	i was a member here for years , loved the people . volunteered as a prayer chaplain . wow , lots of things have changed ! not 4 the good ! they now have a pastoral care minister from chicago who is extremely prejudiced against vegans , kicked me off the prayer chaplain program and asked me not to come back to worship ! consider me gone ! at least until this jimmy scott person is !	1899
1	defiantly the best car wash i 've ever been to ! i got a triple step wax by husam and he made my car feel like it had a brand new gloss finish and in the sun it looks like a mirror ! the service was amazing and he was super kind and confidant in his detailing . i really recommend coming to this car wash for all your detailing needs !	2198
0	i went in here to pick up some odds and ends and was trailed by the security guard like a bad smell . i am very familiar with the area and completely aware of the necessity for vigilance to avoid being robbed blind , but this was intense . i do n't think i look particularly sketchy especially in comparison to some of the other clientele . and i know i should n't take it personally , but hot damn it annoyed me and was enough to make me boycott this location permanently .	3384
1	the food and drinks here are pretty good , especially if you go for their lunch/dinner special ! but the service here is really bad , the servers do n't really pay attention . if you 're going during popular times you can expect a line up .	176
0	panda express food is awesome as it ever had been since i tried back in california , when i saw that they were now here in cleveland , i jumped with joy ! ! all was great ! except the employees , they are rude , they made fun of a gentleman just because he wanted more soy sauce in his plate , the girl went to her manager mocking that they did not have gravy at that location ! talk about culture shock for this girl ! ! even though i really like panda express , i will not return to this location cause of the rude employees ! learn to appreciate your customers and their culture !	1075
0	came to to bass pro shop to see santa ... . kids were very excited to see santa.. advertisement says santa will be there till 5 .. we got there like around 3:30 and line to santa was already closed.. it 's bullshit how they advertise something that ai n't even true.. we drove pretty far just for bs..	2601
1	this is a great place ! they sometimes do have a long line and some some extra cashiers but here 's a helpful hint : most times if there is a long line you can pay with a credit card inside the hotel . overall the staff is very friendly and helpful and the grooming salon is wonderful as is the banfield located in the store . their staff and nurses are some of the best we have experienced since we started using banfield ! !	2108
1	the best thai food on this side of town . i usually get the massaman curry or the pineapple fried rice and both are as good as you can get anywhere . it is a small mom and pop kind of place for dining in but great service and really good food .	1450
1	it 's the 3rd time i used their service , this time for my chihuahua mix and our new baby yorkie ! the tech was on time , friendly and helpful , she even gave me tips on what to do in between grooming visits . my babies look and smell so good ! i am very pleased !	1218
1	i received on time delivery which was professional and fast . they assembled my bed in less time than i thought it would take . they were friendly but took care of business . i love my new guest room bed .	3854
1	i set up an appointment online and got a call within 10 minutes . they showed up at my door in 20 . courteous and quick . they even walked through my irrigated yard to carry my junk to their truck . very affordable and professional . highly recommended . i 'd give them more stars if offered ! !	3663
0	service is very rushed . went to have an updo done for an event and the stylist took his time the first 35 minutes and then rushed the rest of it to try and get it done . he was clearly trying to make his appointment . i was not satisfied with my hair . one side looked great but the other was flat and he was rushing to pin it . stylists would benefit from more time allotted for updos . when paying that much , the client deserves the proper attention .	2509
0	the absolute worst management . the people are not happy , no one acts like they care if you shop there or not . they carry only the most basic items , as though it were a poorly run 7-11 . i tell myself every time i go , that it will be my last trip ... and then i forget since its so close to my home . but today they had there last chance at my money . i am done with them and safeway . no stars . but i had to choose at least one	2105
0	a real disappointment . the service was slow , our waiter was annoyingly arrogant , food was very average ( tuna was accompanied with potatoes in a tomato purée and some kind of spice that did n't match very well ) and it was over priced . tacky decor too . do n't waste your time .	971
0	1 star for the soda that was the best thing i had here . the asada taco did n't have no taste , and the pork taco was burnt . the cashier was rude .	791
0	worst customer experience i 've ever had . not only did they destroy my clothing , they tried blaming the high end manufacturer . take responsibility for your actions . the manufacturer would be out of business if the clothes got destroyed every time they were taken to a dry cleaner .	861
1	been meaning to try this place for a while and finally tonight my husband and i stopped in for dinner at the bar . the service was friendly , atmosphere was a nice surprise for such a small town and we both were really happy with our meals . we will definitely be back . a great local spot .	982
0	went here a while ago . it 's in a pretty bad area . my barber took for ever with my my hair . i made an appointment so no waiting . but he would talk at moments to others the . would focus back on my hair . and to be honest i did not like the haircut .	3574
0	ridiculously bad `` doctors . '' the internet helped me with my foot problem , but the `` doctor '' did n't seem to want to really help me at all with my real problem ( my foot ) , he really wanted me to say that i was depressed or anxious so that he could give me some meds ! `` so ... are you depressed ? '' `` no . '' `` are you sure ? ? ? ''	2631
0	poorly executed ... who serves coors , blue moon and cider at a mexican taco festival ? no mexican beer ? what the hell ? $ 6 for a crap beer and you have to eat standing up ! do n't waste your time .	1392
0	i took my bike there over the summer to have the brakes repaired and a general tune up . i was told it would take about a week . after twelve days i called and it still was n't ready . if it was going to take so long they could have just told me in the first place or at least called after a week or so to say it would be a few more days . i also had an issue with the seat that needed addressed , however that problem was not fixed , the seat still swivels back and forth when i ride . they did fix the brakes , but not sure if i would go there again .	1931
1	the manager , jason sanford , is the best ! friendly and knowledgable ! if you want a great experience , see him ! he 'll help you with all your needs !	1059
0	i 've never felt less welcomed at a gym in my life . a lot of the staff members are extremely rude and only care about making a sale . sleazy place , half of the pictures posted above are n't even this la fitness . overall , i 'd recommend looking at other gyms .	2066
1	i was recently referred to midas by autozone . unfortunately , this was a result of unintentional damage to the head lights in my car by an autozone employee . autozone corrected the problem by providing two new complete head lights assemblies which were installed by midas . the midas employees were friendly , worked very quickly , and the work was done to my satisfaction . i was in and out of the store in 25 minutes . i was very please with the service provided .	1055
0	unprofessional , expensive , sloppy work . do i need to say more ? ? most of the employees here are very unprofessional they like to be on there phones n talking to each other more then they talk to the customers . they really do n't know what good customer service is about and to top it off their work is pretty sloppy .	655
0	bought the teak butcher block . it is chipped and severely warped . you ca n't open the box to view it before purchasing . they will not refund our money for this bad product . one week before christmas even ! so now we are stuck with this faulty , non leveled countertop . do yourself a favor and go somewhere more reputable .	2763
1	super fast , efficient and knowledgable service . the owner was friendly and patiently answering passport and passport photo - related questions from the person he was serving before me , even though i 'm sure he 's repeated the same phrases a gazillion times . i waited in line , got my photo taken and was out the door in probably 5 mins . i 'm not exaggerating ! mondays at lunch hour seem to be a really good time to stop by .	2753
0	we walked to the dealership from our hotel ( 2miles ) and when we got there we thought it was a nice shop . when we were looking for our `` vegas '' harley shirt to purchase we continually got hassled from the pushy sales lady . we felt like we were doing something wrong . they must have a big theft issue in this store because the sales lady would n't leave us alone . we decided to leave and it was n't worth being bothered for a shirt .	3078
1	best bakery in arizona ! they made a delicious beautiful cake for my mom ! the cakes look gorgeous and taste incredible ! you will not be disappointed !	1806
0	i called rc willey after a home depot associate told me they carry gas burners for fireplaces so i called josephine in appliances and she said yes they did . i drove there and she walked me around the store and showed me electric fireplaces . why do these people make me waste my gas and time on wild goose chases . she should be reprimanded . three or four male appliance sales people bored out of their minds . no business . greeter on the way out says thanks for coming .	439
1	this is the place to go ! best sandwiches in the state of arizona no doubt ! i take all the ladies here cause it 's a guaranteed good experience . the workers are bad ass . 100 % come here for a perfect dcperixeb	277
1	if you are looking for a place to store your items in the west valley this is the place ! ! ! we moved cross country in the middle of the az summer with our entire house . you ca n't beat the indoor climate control and cleanliness of these units . the pricing was great as well . jeff was very helpful before we arrived as well as during our 5 months there ! ! security is top notch as well .	3288
1	this is a honest good hearted company ! ! the nurses truly care and the staff is genuinely concerned with your well being . and to top it off the food is really good for being in a hospital	2068
1	mmm crepes ! ! had the sweet potato crepe , and it was delicious . perfect amount of sweetness ( i had asked for the maple syrup on the side but ended up pouring most of it onto the crepe anyway ) . i tried a bit of my friend 's green tea red bean crepe and i was n't a big fan . it was a bit too sweet and dense for me . ordered a black forest latte as well . it was pretty sweet , and served lukewarm . i could probably do without the latte , but would come back for the crepes !	891
0	i wish i checked reviews before i went inside . i usually go up the road a bit , but my usual nail tech is on vacation so i tried this place . terrible . she put polish thinner in my polish and it still is n't completely dry , hours later . the topcoat is dry , so there all wrinkly looking . it 's terrible . they 're not even at all , every nail is different . none of them are smooth . do n't waste your money . plus a full took almost an hour and a half . usually i 'm out in 30-40 . no thank you !	2035
0	i went to this place in real pain and things were changing as far as pain levels and then he adjusted me and almost blew out a disk by over powering me to make an adjustment . i found a real healing doctor that explained that these pop and crack places are n't good for you if they do n't warm you up and loosen you up first .	3186
0	whatever you do , do not order delivery . the delivery driver will deliver half your order then tell you it 's your job to call to get it fixed then they will ask you to come in and get the items they forgot . contacted the restaurant and they said they 'd call right back . waited 20-30 mins and still no response . i wish there was a zero star option because what food we received was n't even warm . you have been warned !	459
0	good atmosphere for an intimate small party . food is n't great . there are some all you can eat japanese buffets that tastes better . and the prices are n't cheap either . for example , miso soup , cod , sashimi and ice cream is $ 55 . if you have coupons you must print them . also , try to check trip advisor and groupon , they have discounts for this place . overall , pricey for mediocre food but good atmosphere .	422
0	does n't come off like a real starbucks . the iced coffee is watered down ( tried over a couple different days to be sure ) and i had to teach them how to make a starbucks doubleshot on ice . i do n't get the impression they 're trained/managed like a typical starbucks and could use some supervision to bring them in line with the model . however , staff is nice and it 's a comfortable little location .	1351
1	mff installed granite in our kitchen and 3 baths . i had an idea of what i wanted and the took me to the slabs . they had exactly what i was looking for . the price was good and the installers were great and on time . i will go back for my next home .	3875
1	i really liked his salon .i walked in no appointment . i picked my colors and showed the nail tech what i was wanting and she did a great job . i had a manicure , pedicure and eyebrow wax . yes it 's a little expensive but the service was good and everyone was friendly .	786
0	had my car towed there because i was told on the phone they had a set of take-off tires in very good condition . after my car gets dropped off and i show up - these tires are dry rotted and in horrible shape . instead i asked them to just switch out the wheels with another set i had temporarily because i did not like my tire options . $ 60 bucks for some rubber valve stems that cost $ 1 - this place is a joke and will take advantage of you if you 're in a compromising situation .	88
1	cassablanca express is the best place to book travel with . over the past few years they have had my business and i am very impressed . just this past year , they booked me in the plaza hotel for basically nothing and i was very impressed with it . i recommend cassablanca express to anyone .	1777
0	i specifically ordered no onions on my salad , and of course , it came with a tons of onions . also , the menu stated that my salad came with fries and there were no fries on my salad . i ordered takeout so going back to the restaurant was n't an option for me . when i was standing at the counter , one of the cooks in the back got loud with someone i assume was the manager and said `` get off my back maryann . i do n't need to wear gloves every time i make a salad . '' very concerning . not happy with this experience at all .	608
1	excellent service . great staff and the manager mike is awesome , his customer service level is off the charts , they the best tire shop in las vegas , thank you mike !	3860
1	my experience with land rover in las vegas has always been good . they are a very trusted dealership . they do not try to push service or repairs you do not need . land rover keep up the great trusted work !	2659
0	great product of course but that is not the problem . cashiers ! can your hire some ? i 've been at this store three different times since thanksgiving and the lines are at least six people deep . i put down my purchases and left . i guess i am impatient but i would rather not wait that long . get your multi staff on the floor check out devices so that they can ring a customer out ! or add another register at the front .	1765
0	class was fun for a bachelorette but not nearly worth the endless telemarketers . they force you to sign `` release '' and then sell your information .	3629
1	j'adore aller à cette boutique c'est vrai que le service est impeccable tous les employés sont hyper brillant et connaissent bien leur matériel ! !	3579
0	do n't go to nybb ! the staff is is incompetent & lazy . told the counter person i had never been there before . they literally walked away without saying anything . they did n't offer any suggestions/help/explanations . my order was wrong when i got it . because it had the wrong condiments it tasted disgusting . nybb is extremely overpriced . do not go to nybb !	325
0	the service was really good . we came for dinner the food did n't have much flavor . the appetizers were the best part in particular causa rellena . overall great service the food was n't as tasty and a little expensive for the quality of food .	927
1	we have been taking my daugher here since she was born . we really like dr. patterson . she is very nice and friendly . also , she explains everything clearly to us . the assisntants are very professional and they are always making sure my daugher is fine and confortable . i love the attention we receive . great place and enviroment to take your kids for a good health care .	3893
1	anthony did an amazing job on my nails . especially because the previous job i had was horrible . he brought them back to life . i did have a 30 minute wait and i was there as soon as they opened i was the first one at the door . they did have appointments though so i was n't upset . i loved the color they had however a lot of their colors were dried out . luckily i found the perfect color : ) anthony always kept a convo and he 's a great business man . i enjoyed my first time there .	1429
1	update : thanks to the owner for helping me out . after reading my frustration on here it was definitely a miscommunication and a glitch in their system and they called me immediately and offered service for free since it was a mistake on the systems end . she was a sweetheart , i really enjoyed the wash and condition and the scalp massage . if i lived here i definitely would come back ! thank you for turning a frustrating situation around . i greatly appreciate it	1935
1	living spaces is a great place to look for furniture ! highlights for me would be their clearance section , staff is not on commission and thus are non-pressure , extremely friendly pickup department , and free assembly within 24 hour notice for pickup !	2071
0	these guys have nice clean bathrooms and are convenient to the bars up the street if you 're grossed out by the bathrooms at the bars . also , even if you 're just in the casino to use the restrooms , they do n't hassle you . but they sure do make a weak vodka tonic .	2500
1	i 've been in the store two times and both times i 've had great customer service . today there were quite a few people waiting ahead of me , but they have que set up and you can see on the tv 's where you are in line . demetrius helped me today and was very courteous and solved my problem quick . in the past stoan had helped me when i decided to switch from direct to cox . as many reviewers have said , do n't waist your time on the phone with cox customer service as they are n't the best . visit the cox store and you 'll get your problems resolved in fast and friendly way !	2633
1	went for free with houseseats.com ( strongly recommend them if you 're a local btw ) and we got seats in the very front just inches from the stage . i 've seen some of the more `` modern '' topless revues , but this one blows them away . the girls were classy and beautiful , the sets/costumes/effects were incredible , and it was such a fun night . this show is 100 % vegas.. cheese , sleeze , and glamour all rolled into one .	3069
1	i got so lucky finding toni & guy . they have the most convenient hours they 're open late and on sundays as well . adam is one of the owners and he did my hair . adam had me out in less than an hour . he gave me the best shampoo i ever had . he is way underpriced for the services he provides . i am so happy with my cut & style ( he was very respectful of my length ) . my hair has never felt so bouncy ! ! ! !	2274
1	i like this walgreens a lot , i do n't come here as often as i think i should because i dont think they 'll have what i 'm looking for but when i do go , they have everything i bought somewhere else ! it 's very clean , and the staff is always letting me know of any deals or specials happening : )	3923
1	awesome place to have coffee . had order a few hot drinks and all of them were very delicious . my hot chocolate was little too sweet and trust me i can take sweet , just a little . nice ambiance , friendly staff . very warm and cozy place . fireplace adds a nice touch though it 's very hard to actually find a place near one : ( amazing to see people displaying their artwork for sale on the walls . very creative .	2163
1	i 've been here three times now and i am continually pleased with my meal ! the food is fresh and flavorful , the sauces are yummy , and the shakes and malts are great ! plus , the workers are always nice and accommodating ! this is definitely a new favorite place of mine : )	998
0	people in town rave about this place so i decided to try them . ordered 1 large pizza ... .. took almost an hour to be delivered . they forgot to add the garlic sauce i had ordered , so the driver made a second trip to bring it back . the pizza was luke warm and barely any toppings . i honestly was disappointed . i 'm not really sure what people were raving about , abruzzo in richmond hill ( yonge and 7 area ) is much better .	1076
1	everyone at the summerlin branch is always helpful , friendly and accommodating . they go out of their way to assist members . tops in their field . best oncu office around ! !	1141
0	came here with a 9 year old , 12 , and 14 year old and the lady suggested to go into grossology exhibit . paid our 5 dollars and was extremely disappointed it was made for 3 year olds . really mad that the lady suggested this for us . wanted to ask for our money back . the rest of the museum was okay . had to ask a few times for them to refill some of their experiments .	3891
0	the patties are frozen store patties - that 's a big no no for me when i 'm paying more than what i would pay at mc'donalds or wendy 's . they 're not even good frozen patties either ! they 're bland mixed with more bland ! the seasoning needs a lot work as well , guess what ? it 's also pretty bland . i did what i always do when going to rate food , i follow it up with a mass produced version of what i had . so , i had a quarter pounder brought it home and added the ingredients that were missing . the qp was much better and it was 7 dollars !	992
1	the best vegetables in town . we price checked against metro and longos and whole foods is cheaper for produce -- and better quality .	3271
1	i love that they offer dollar sticks appetizer whole day . their isaw & liempo are really good .	817
1	huge beer list , good food , friendly service	3344
1	the team of sales reps at klas are the best . very knowledgable . they know the vegas marketplace . thank you for the great exposure klas ! ! !	1870
0	ca n't recommend . very few flavors and fruit toppings compared to yogurtland and the taste just is n't as good . and yogurtland provides free drinking water , menchies sells drinking water .	738
0	tons of picture dics . many records that you would find in dollar bins , priced like they were new . but , i guess if your the only store in town ... thank g i dont live in vegas .	2570
1	purchased a new car here after reading many mixed reviews i have to say my experience was great stuck to the deal over phone no bs in finance happy customer ! ! thank you kevin emmons	2210
1	i 'm not exactly sure why there is such reviews of this place . i 've been in constant contact with the realtor i 'm working with . we were able to get a home to lease that fit our budget at no time at all . the realtor had been nothing but nice & helpful to me throughout the process . he even made efforts during his vacation to answer his phone & meet me at the office the next day during a holiday . thank you for all that you 've done to make it a pleasurable experience .	3126
1	i love this restaurant . i have been going there for almost 12 yrs now . i have never had a bad experience with the food . only service 1-2 times that i 've been there . the hostess/manager is so nice & very warm to customers . the food , is delicious , i ca n't choose a fav because everything tastes so good & fresh . not many japanese restaurants have good terriyaki & sushi , but sagano certainly does . the view is spectacular , never mind that it 's scarborough & not the toronto skyline , it is beautiful ! !	422
0	good food , horrible service ! ! ordered take-out and it took 45 minutes to get our food and the manager `` scott '' blamed my husband for not speaking up sooner after he admitted he himself wondered why my husband was waiting up front for so long . they do n't care about customer service in the least , very rude and condescending .	408
1	the best ! honest , thorough , knowledgeable , priced right ! we are repeat customers , they are my first call every time i need help	3341
1	this is our favorite dim sum place in mississauga . great quality food , lots of variety , and cart service . very authentic and traditional dishes , as well as something new now and then ( like green tea sesame balls ) . love it !	338
1	i was looking for a pair of hiking shoes and decided to look in morgans . they had a great selection and prices . will definitely think of them in the future when i need shoes .	1627
0	not the same restaurant from a few years back . we went on christmas eve and the food was horrible . restroom smells foul . the whole place did moot feel clean	1264
1	we recently hired matt to paint the exterior of our 11-year old house in estrella . to say that he did a fabulous job would be an understatement . he and his crew were on time every day , and did their work methodically and efficiently . the end result makes us feel as if we have a brand new house . it is beautiful ! thank you , matt , for a job well done !	3915
0	the sushi here is ok . it is pricey for vaughan though ! i have no problem with higher prices if the portions are generous ... . but the portions are small ( relative to other japanese restaurants in dt toronto i frequent often ) .	733
0	my pedicure was n't high quality and the spa is n't sanitary . i had to ask the manager to put a towel down on the dirty platform when fixing my toes after he asked me to sit back in the spa chair . when i called to speak to corporate , kelly was extremely rude and hung up on me when i asked to speak to the owner . their customer service is terrible despite all the surrounding competition . the risk of infection and bad customer service scream run !	3652
0	horrible experience . i would give negative stars if possible . the doctor i saw was condescending , patronizing and uncompassionate . i will never return to this office or any goodman & partridge office . there are much better ob/gyns to be found in the valley .	2625
0	this place was recommended to us by a waiter at a restaurant ... i guess it was our mistake for asking a yuppity hipster where we should get our drinks . these guys could n't make a good drink if their bob marley posters depended on it . the bartenders clearly did n't want to be spending their friday night serving drinks . maybe find a new profession ? our drinks were weak . we left with $ 50 out of our pockets and sober enough to pass an alcohol test . we went to a small bar right down the street and got perfectly inebriated on $ 30 .	292
0	the worst service in the world . thousands spent and they can not even meet a gigantic 6 hour window . late by hours . horrible . avoid this rapidly deteriorating firm at all costs .	2071
1	not sure what the deal is with all the negative reviews for dr shaba ... i 've had nothing but good experiences with him ... he 's treated me for a couple of different things and is always friendly as well as the staff is very friendly and professional and courteous ... i will admit sometimes there is a pretty long wait but what doctors office does n't have you wait ? i would absolutely recommend him and his staff very very happy overall and a lifetime customer	2777
1	i will be honest , i was going to just get some papa johns to be safe , but after seeing the yelps on jesse 's i had to give it a try . damn glad i did . i had their large supreme and loved the thin crust and high quality ingredients . it will feed 3-4 hungry guys if you get some appetizers . we got the chicken fingers done with medium sauce and loved them . their garlic cheese bread is a hoagie bun sliced , so not large , but oh so delicious . this place is the best . if you are in thier delivery area there is no other option , not sure about dining in .	1399
0	i feel dirty saying this , but i ate lunch here on friday . i usually do n't stoop to eating at taco bell , unless i am really drunk , hungry , and it is the only place open . i was late for a meeting , broke , and it was the closest place i could get lunch for the $ 2.50 i had on me . i got two crunchy taco supremes , which are just tacos with sour cream . they were gross , and i hope the next time i am drunk i will remember this .	3
0	it was okay here . nothing special , great for big groups with no where to go since the service is really slow . i think the servers should be allowed to wear sneakers that might help improve the service . they tried to feed me pork when i specifically said that i do not want pork . good thing i was n't allergic	102
0	worst experience ever these asians are crooks and liars dont shop here . the dishwasher i bought did n't work and they wo n't refund my money . i 'm out 400 $ bbb said they are trying to shut them down they sell dented garbage that has manufacture defects . i did n't realize this if the product catches fire or floods your home they will not cover it . home depot should of been my first stop they sell recycled manufactured defective appliances scratch and dent turn backs beware people junk ! ! ! ! ! ! do your research do n't buy here	1636
0	customer service , not service at all . agent saw me coming and dropped her head no eye contact . ok so you do n't want to be bothered . there were only two of you available , so if you are too busy please hire more help this is your job '' customer service ''	948
0	extremely bad place to do business with no warranty on anything really bad attitudes cheap parts do n't even try to return anything there they will not take it back . never going back	2027
1	i love their pharmacy . my doctor erroneously filled a prescription for a cvs pharmacy in north carolina instead of this pharmacy . however , since we were in rock hill , this cvs pharmacy transferred the prescription order from north carolina to the rock hill cvs pharmacy . saved me a two hour commute to pick up the medication . i appreciated the excellent customer service in correcting the doctor 's mistake .	933
1	so many options ! i love building my own stir fry , buffet is kept very clean and all the sauce options are amazing .	209
1	let me start by saying i 'm from california and it 's hard to find good people who know what there doing , and this place here does amazing work.. i always get my nails done here , been going for almost 4 years now and everytime i get the best treatment anyone can ask for.. i always get my nails done by the owner , she does amazing work and i always leave super happy.. what 's even a bigger plus is my nails stay for longer then a month and i ca n't be any happier , i 'd rather see someone once a month then every 2 weeks.. thank you for your amazing service see you soon ! ! !	3831
0	rushed in rushed out . had to have my nails fixed twice because once the lady swiped them with a towel and once i messed up . the lady made the comment that i was making sure i got my monies worth . sat under the dryer for both my hands and my feet for 20 mins and still managed to walkout with messed up nails wtf . after the comment i sure did n't feel right asking them to be fixed ! well that was not worth the money . oh and my hands are dryer than when i went in .	3682
1	for the `` inn '' only : stayed here in the honeymoon suite for two nights leading up to my wedding . excellent and accommodating staff , nice old timey decor , and plenty comfy . there was lots of room for the ladies to get ready here on the wedding day . overall , excellent value with attentive staff for a boutique style b & b .	2818
1	i did so much driving that my tire pressure light switched on . i stopped here and jim helped me . he was very helpful . we went outside and he put air in my tires while it was raining . by the end of it he was soaked . after putting the air in my tires he told me i was good to go . i tried to pay him but he said it was fine . i really appreciated the honesty , he could have said something was wrong and i would have paid not knowing . i highly recommend this place because they are honest and care about their clients .	946
1	i like chipotle . this one just opened . the service was good . it tasted like it should . i tried some of my wife 's guacamole . they have outside seating , which was nice . the inside seating was cramped .	656
0	cinnamon roll could n't even be cut with large knife 20 minuted after buying . the apple fritter not much better . notified and they offered to make it right and have n't answered any message nor have contacted me . things happen but this was a major customer service fail . it 's been 3 days and no answer to my message . i will say bosa donuts are awesome .	2053
1	really a delightful little corner on the top floor of a lady-centric craft boutique . it 's just a little space but stuffed to the gills with vinyl treasures . the stacks are well curated and the prices are fair . found some choice stuff digging the crates including prince , echo and the bunnymen , parliament , queensryche , psychedelic furs and a 1956 hank williams pressing that was only $ 2.50 . surely something here for every taste .	2294
1	very nice people . seem very professional , and i heard other great reviews from women i met in the lobby . i 've only had botox here , and i 've been happy with it . may try other treatments	1961
0	i got a groupon & when trying to book an appointment , they told me to call back another week because their system was down . then when i did , they said they no longer offer the service of the groupon and they are having technical difficulties - for a mani/pedi ? ! ? the lady told me casually , maybe you can get a refund . um have you ever tried to get a groupon refund ! so difficult and tedious if you can even get one . *annoyed ... *	2995
1	i go here enough that the staff already know what i 'm getting . not sure if that 's a good or bad thing lol	1761
1	heavy on the atmosphere , heavy on the red sauce , light on the wallet . no , the food here is n't great . but it 's good , and i always make time to come here every time i come to vegas . it 's worth it just to see the piano bar . recommendations : chicken parm ( not veal for some reason , ) meatballs , gnocchi . also , they have a private dining room in which i 've had several successful events and make for a nice break from the typical trade show stuff -- and definitely gets people to remember you .	4
1	here 's the breakdown : +cheap on the strip +friendly staff +not stingy about portions +fast line	214
0	just walked in . i used to love boba tea house but i 'm not sure i 'm returning . this time the whole place was filthy . the counter was gross and you could visibly see footprints everywhere ! when i walked in the teenagers were sitting , when they should have been cleaning . grab a broom and a mop , and get to work .	490
1	best chicken caesar ever . i can have a piece of chicken with every bite and the salad will run out before the chicken . only down side is with tax the salad is over $ 20	1116
0	this starbucks has the worst set up for a drive-thru and is by far the slowest one i have ever sat in . it does n't matter what time of day , it takes forever to get through . i 'd get out and park , except that 's a nightmare too .	2778
0	tom , the store manager , was rude and condescending to me on 2 separate occasions . his customer service skills are severely lacking and the attitude he conveys to his customers is inexcusable . do yourself a favor and drive across the street for your pool supplies . good customer service and much cheaper prices !	3311
0	i really wanted to like this place . the patio was nice and cozy , i love the hanging plant baskets . the waiter was nice and helpful in making menu suggestions . what i did n't like is waiting 25 mins for my entree and it being cold when we got it . by the time i got the food i was so tired and not hungry anymore i took a few bites and then asked to pack the rest , including my dessert to go . i got home and threw it all away the next day .	918
0	this place is not amazing . she completely ruined my eyebrows , she made them way too thin and took off the whole front part and left hardly any shape to my eyebrows . i will never be back here again .	3907
0	horrible service my boyfriend and i wanted some questions answered about a phone and no one walked up to us for about 15 minutes . finally some one did come up to talk to us and he was completely rude when we had barely asked one question and after he just walked away without answering the rest of our questions . while some other staff were on there phones , laughing and not assisting anyone .	3192
0	worst car rental place i 've ever been to , tried calling the office 10 times and then the next few days and never answered , when i got there phones ringing the entire time , long lines and no other cars to choose from , advertise as giving a toyota or nissan then end up with a cheap hyundai with a broken fender which they said they would have to charge us for , until we argued about it then said that it had already been reported ... choose something closer to the airport even if they charge more	269
0	i drove all the way here expecting for some basic hookah and service but it was actually worse . the worst lounge in my opinion . owner was very rude to my group and we felt as if the servers just wanted to make their pay day and nothing else .	2073
0	good lord . girl barely speaks english . cashier looks like she 's been up for a week . all i asked was which sandwich was most popular and she could not understand . did n't have my order when i went to pay . wow	1214
1	great store ! great staff ! great product ! youll pay a little more tho ... .	3911
0	the people at wrap & grab have managed to turn an uncomplicated meal into a sopping mess . i ordered the falafel platter to go . the falafel balls were hard as a rock and were n't cooked fresh in front of me . though i try not to waste food i ended up throwing away most of the rice as it was stale and hard . my biggest restaurant annoyance is stale rice . it 's the easiest thing to cook in the world of cuisine , and there is no reason to have stale rice during the busiest hour of a weekday . as an added 'bonus ' , the staff shortchanged me .	775
1	great service , tons of seating . it 's a nice place to hang out with a group of friends . there are pool tables at the back of the bar . the menu is typical pub food . the fries are good and the drinks are cheap . i wish they put the volume up for sports games . i 'll have to come back and check out their live music though to see if it 's good . i would definitely go back .	2732
1	happy hour prices are unbeatable , $ 11 for half oysters & half clams , sign me up ! seafood is fresh and delicious . i saw a guy next to me order the shrimp cocktail , dang the shrimps are huge ! i will surely get that on my next trip . service is always good , the waiter had a big smile on his face the whole entire time , very inviting atmosphere .	1255
1	this is my third or fourth time doing business with brother 's tailors on tatum . our family has purchased three suits here and love all of them . they have a great selection and amazing service . on thursday , i brought a tux in that needed some alterations for a saturday event ( today ) . every other shop i called either could n't do it or was way more expensive for the work , which brother 's did perfectly , and at a better price . go see peter for a new suit !	442
0	do n't go there to wash your car ! they are not gentle with your car they do n't care , i 've got few scratches on my car since i used to go weekly ( and it was brand new car so no previous scratches on it ) ! also , each time i went there while i got home i had to clean after them , they do n't know how to clean ! ! never going back !	2198
0	have stayed in aloft before in denver , great ! upon my pre requested early check in , i was told no rooms were available because the hotel was full the night before . mmm , well not sure why early check in was an option . everyone 's time is valuable .	3522
1	came here because i was interested in buying a suit for a new job . everyone was so friendly . a guy named dee approached me and was very helpful . i did n't buy a suit but i 'll definitely be coming back in the near future for the excellent service .	1972
1	i visit this dunkin ' donuts every morning . they always get my drink correct and are very consistent with the way it tastes . the customer service is good , they know me by name and i have never had any problems at this location . my favorite employee is kable . she rocks .	1532
1	excellent food , price is amazing . always great ! we ordered the family size ginger beef , shanghai noodles in black bean sauce , spring rolls and salt and pepper squid . all delicious and price was under $ 40	1437
1	kathy and i have been to this spa numerous times since 2010 . they are now on the third owner and the place is looking better than ever . we had a massage and sea salt body scrub which was great today . devon is an excellent therapist . try this place if you are looking for a luxury spa at a reasonable price .	2917
0	i had switched to this nail salon due to being closer to my home . i got gel polish and unfortunately it peeled off in a week ( i have never had this happen previously ) , then i went to get them redone and mentioned the issues . she told me the polish was bad . offered no discount or refund . then , charged me an extra $ 5 for the color i picked out ( even though gel polish are priced at $ 20 ! ) . i wo n't be returning .	1783
0	i expect much better pasty at brazil bakery as after all it is a bakery . sadly both the pastel de nata and tarte de amendoa were just marginally good . almond tart just hard and tasted stale . i almost just want to trashed it after 1 bite but i think my yelp friend must be really hungry as he finished the whole thing ... and then telling me it was not good ? ! ( he must had been used to my cooking skill now ... ) pastel de nata had this thin crust that i like but the filling was just overly sweet and did n't have much substance . maybe i should just drink a coffee ... next time ...	3184
1	come on thursdays . 50 percent off the wholr menu . the shrimp diablo is amazing and there soup was insane . everything very fresh . the menu is in spanish but they were very helpful . highly recommend .	299
1	bargain shopper heaven . i went in here and had a ball , i 'm sure hubby did n't like that bill . lolol . i got 2 pairs of shoes , clothes , baby gear and some home decor . i saw so many things i want to go back and get for christmas gifts . they have something for everyone in the family and i still need to get gifts for my mom and sister so i shall return . i 've even gotten dog stuff out of here . i love a good bargain ! warning : do not go in here if you are in retail therapy .	3597
1	i came here for the first time on my birthday and had a wonderful experience . the marinara sauce was surprisingly delicious and tasted fresh . the bread was really good too . i had wanted to come here for awhile , so i was had i could finally get to try it . greta service , very attentive throughout the visit . i lie the atmosphere a lot . the restaurant is in an old house and there are tables in different rooms creating a very intimate setting . th tiramisu was one of the highlights of the evening . a very happy way to end my birthday dinner .	1224
1	we have used this business for watch batteries and decided to take them up on their free rhodium plating offer . the work was completed in an hour and they were friendly and courteous . we will definitely go back for any of our repair needs . thank you for the great quality service !	3533
0	low quality homes built by low quality trades . their sales people are disrespectful and dishonest . their design center is a ripoff . beware of their `` preferred '' third party builders . they are just as dishonest as fulton homes and will try to rip you off . their warranty department is a joke . it is really a mitigation department that tries to fight you over every repair . then the repairs are just as low quality as the build . buyers beware !	3043
0	we made reservations on june 21 at 1:25 and the person that took the call said that our reservation was made and when we arrive to the hotel the lady told my partner and i that we never made reservations . we stay at this hotel at least ones a week and this never happen before this is the first time that this happen and they have us waiting for 45 min to an our . i hope you guys can get a person that makes the reservation a responsable person	1335
0	this is the worst store . the employees are all super rude and to busy standing around to actually help you . when asking a question they all have a different answer . i 'm all for current good music but this store has it playing so loud you can barley think . i 'm not at a club just trying to buy some glasses . then on top of everything we bought a pair of swim trunks got them home and they did not even take off the security tag . really lady you had one job ! ! !	2480
0	we booked our hotel on priceline , which has yet to let us down . my boyfriend loved the hotel and thought it was great but i would have liked a little more . the staff was friendly and helpful , the hotel was clean and not too noisy or crowded . my main beef with this place is truly and first-world issue . my room smelled like someone had smoked before us and it was poorly covered up . it smelled like way too much febreeze . besides that , my sheets and blanket were scratchy and uncomfortable . those are my only complaints . other than that , it was a fairly decent hotel .	2540
1	this place is great , always a fresh sandwich.. must try number 13 , you will love it ! the employees always greet you and make sure you get what you want ! it sucks that they do n't toast but it is still good with the toppings , i get it `` mikes way ''	1528
1	our airbnb host suggested this charming bistro for breakfast . we went for lunch . we can only hope the owner gets tired of the heat and relocates to new jersey . creative menu of omelets , quiche , crepes and sandwiches , great selection of hot and cold drinks , and terrific pastries . warm friendly service , a real neighborhood gem . go .	93
0	the food tastes ok . the costumer service is terrible as well as the delivery . we are 5 minutes away from them and took over an hour for us to get the food . we did n't even get a courtesy call to inform us they were running late and when we called 3 times we were just told they would be there in 5 mins . we have ordered at least three times in the past and every time they will get lost . last time we order from there .	1581
1	i 've loved everything i 've tried here . they have interesting twists on classic sandwiches and salads . everything is fresh and delicious ! a little pricey especially considering the portion sizes of some of the items , but the quality of the food makes up for it . very cool atmosphere as well . i also wish the portion sizes of the sides were a little bigger because they 're so delicious ! still 5 stars for the taste and atmosphere .	1238
1	the gym is pretty chill and they have a good atmosphere . not to mention the 2 week guest pass which is very generous . btw the personal trainer director joe is the coolest dude . peace	1981
1	enjoy working with rachael smith and the weight loss team . been doing the program for 6 weeks and lost 12 pounds . slow and steady to keep it off and modify eating behavior staff is always friendly and helpful i recommend their weight loss program and the clinic in general for overall health	297
0	little caesars motto is `` hot and ready '' . this location is never hot and ready , always a 7 minute wait to cook a pizza . thank god for papa murphy 's coming into town . chris	519
0	i only came in here to work out but this place is filthy . it is not dirty as if in someone had not cleaned it for the day but actually not really clean . i did not get a massage after working out in the same location . the tropicana overall has real potential if they get their game on , but otherwise i i would recommend other options .	2317
1	best burger ! ! hands down the best burger i 've ever had . been coming here every friday for over 2 years now . try the ak47 my girlfriend loves the masala burger .	940
1	i have nothing much to say.. this is a good place . the only drawback is that there are nothing to do around here , unless yoir staying before flying out from clt airport . food is anothet issue , only few restaurant within walkin distance . but there is always room service . overall ... this is a nice place .	1348
0	i took a pair of courderoy jeans in for a simple 1/2 ' tear repair . the woman ran the sewing machine over the material about 50 times leavong a 2-3 inch mess of scarring over the material . -- -- when i asked her what she had done- she started screaming..at me ! ! -- -- i asked her to stop screaming and being rude- and she just got worse -- avoid the place ! ! !	2982
0	we decided to give this place a shot -- eating in the dark seemed really different . they have a cool concept where blind individuals are your servers.. make sure to tell your dates ! it was awkward a few times when people did n't know why servers wore sunglasses . when you first walk in , you are greeted by a not so friendly staff who make you wait in a dungeon-like atmosphere until your server is ready . server was very nice . food was ok at best . they loaded my plate up with mashed potatoes and there was barely any meat . unfortunately , i 'm not sure i would do this again .	449
1	my experience with royal appliance was awesome they were friendly and polite , they had a big selexiting of major appliances to choose from and and prices was great , check them out ... they 're great ! !	1236
0	worst experience and worst customer service . not only were the bridesmaid dresses fitted and sized wrong , but the brides dress had a blood stain and the beadwork was falling off . horrible experiences everytime for fittings . do not go here . the women are all rude and know nothing about customer service .	2938
0	we orders food for six people and after being 20 minutes late on having the order ready , they forgot three items . really poor services , do n't waste you time with this food chain .	1547
0	still waiting ... . they responded and so i responded ... . still no dice apparently off to sale used cheap furniture with no warranty .	1640
0	they should be shut down , filthy , they do not clean equipment & rude to customers ... i will not go back ! !	3332
1	courteous & speedy service ! went in for an oil change and the entire process was a breeze . charles & his team took great care of my car and had it all ready to go ( along with a courtesy call ) sooner than expected . will definitely be coming back here .	3379
0	they have hooked offer to get 2 donuts for a dollar . many a times , they do n't even have more than 3-4 donuts . what 's up with that ?	3636
0	they have again managed to cancel my installation order for the media stand i ordered in may . it was received in july and is still sitting in a box . i recommend avoiding purchasing anything from west elm as their customer service and business practices leave much to be desired .	1841
1	you want a slice bigger than your face ? if you answered `` yes . '' then this is the place for you . this is by my daughters ' school , so sometimes we 'll grab a bite there on our way home . the slice is enough for them to split and share . save yourself some money and order the lunch special .	417
0	working near by this is a frequented place when it 's too cold to walk anywhere else . this is a dirt cheap pizza joint.. and you definitely get what you pay for . if you 're looking for a great meal.. steer away . however if you 're on a budget their poutine is defiantly edible .	810
1	i love this place ! always very welcoming and comforting as well . i am always seen very quickly by the doctors and they have been extremely helpful ! thank you !	3598
0	the pickle barrel at yorkdale is the worst . the fish and chips and burger were cold , and the spanish paella was luke warm . sent back the fish and chips and burger . my new burger was still cold and the cheese not even melted , no flavor at all . the restaurant was like a sauna making it a very uncomfortable experience . the waiter was not attentive . when seated the utensils and napkins were placed in the middle of table , so we had to set the table ourselves . stay away from this restaurant .	534
0	terrible service . walked in to buy a 1911 and there was only one other customer with two employees . one guy was helping the customer while the other guy was just standing around . sat there for about 10 minutes waiting for someone to help me and no employee said a word , finally i walked out and dropped $ 1k somewhere else . i guess i did n't look `` gun nut '' enough for them . will never go back .	1561
0	we were just at your location on independence blvd . and complained to the manager about cleanliness . the last several times we ate there we had to request the waitress to clean the table and the floor is always sticky . tonight was the last straw because when the bill came the folio was greasy inside . there was no way for the waitress not to notice but she gave it to me anyway . then , when we complained to the manager he did not seem to care . we left and will never return .	209
0	meh . looked up pizza by the slice on yelp . this place came up . it 's not really pizza by the slice . you have to buy a $ 6 slice/drink combo . staff 's attitude is indifferent at best . slice came with a fortune cookie which is weird .	417
1	great for kids . good variety of games and activities . it was understaffed on the weekend we were there ... would add another star if they up the staffing by a few people .	3791
1	i left my pious prius in california and not missing the car-traffic angst that typically accompanies the expense of city car ownership . zipcar is my new love , as it is as close and easy as having a car without the bother or expense . the zipcar website has a very slick user interface that shows all locations of all cars within whatever parameters you choose . what 's not to like ?	2232
1	i ordered from this place with ubereats and it was such amazing delicious food ! i will definitely be dining in at this restaurant in the future ... also get the buffalo chicken mac & cheese ... . it 's to die for !	717
1	renovations are still underway , but outdoor drapes and curtains give the place a tropical , calssy , jamiaca-meets-south beach feel . the inside of the lounge now features a wooden dance floor , which helps the growing swing scene on fridays .	1672
1	this place is great . owner and staff are very nice . i have been coming here for years . good deals .	336
1	katie fearno is the world 's best pa. not only is she incredibly smart she is so kind , patient and understanding . her assistant chance is also great . i 'm normally very fearful of the doctor but this place is awesome !	356
0	came for lunch and waited forever for the waiter to come take our order of drinks . place was n't busy at all so that was weird . it took super long to get the drinks too . the margaritas were supposed to be blended , but came on the rocks and in plastic cups . one of the worse tasting margaritas i 've ever had .	704
1	i live in carlsbad have been using truly nolan for 2 years now . they have been awesome . from the moment you call , their customer service exceeds expectation . friendly , timely , and their rates are very fair . i have monthly pest control and annual termite inspection . i particularly like their service providers who very professional , respectful and helpful .	302
0	this is an extremely slow rental car firm . the staff is not organized and not very friendly	3129
1	if you ever wanted to eat in a palace , well then get back in line , because they only do takeout . ron 's is good pizza . nothing spectacular . i never expect spectacular out of my pizza , just my primanti 's .	110
1	love , love , love this office full of wonderful people ! went in for my first visit , to discuss pellets ... .i just could n't believe how friendly and genuine the entire staff was ! they took the time to explain the process , all my options and celebrate my decision with me ! got my first pellets `` installed '' and can honestly say , it was quick , pain free and i can hardly wait to feel the benefits ! highly recommend ! ! !	3243
0	this d & d is operating beyond its means . dirty . needed a cleaning . cashier was abrupt , snarky . she kept repeating `` i 'm never working 2nd shift again . '' said to another staffer `` just give em decaf they do n't know the difference '' did n't give me a receipt . expo practically threw the food at me . was hastily put together . see photo . other locations are much better .	3226
1	the best bar in the downtown phoenix area . great drinks , fantastic staff , awesome atmosphere . you wo n't be disappointed if you 're looking for a cool tucked-away place to grab a drink and hang out .	3562
1	i live close to the star nursery on blue diamond . moved here from deadwood about 6 months ago . i have to say that this is the best nursery i 've been to . i 've been dealing with marco there and he had the best advice on how much sod to buy and just how to prep the soil before i laid the sod down . i gave him the measurements of where i wanted it , and he was spot on with the amount i got . thank you marco and star nursery . the best ... .	2039
0	this place is not very nice . proving as usual that hilton has no consistency to their product . no bar at the moment some issue or construction going on .	1741
0	very disappointed in the quality of the food at this location . rolls were burnt and dry . tenders were very small and were practically all breading and no chicken . being from texas i 've had my fair share of bush 's chicken and it never disappoints . so when i saw they opened one in gilbert i was so excited . unfortunately this bush 's location in gilberts is a huge disappointment . based off this experience i will never go back .	862
1	i found this place on yelp when we moved to the area and it 's our go-to car maintenance place . since we live close we usually just drop off a vehicle and wait for them to call . they 're always friendly and trustworthy . we have n't had anything outside of routine care done here .	946
0	i was really excited to try this place . menu was cool and appealing . ate on a wednesday evening service was not that great . ordered wings hot ( almost flavorless ) and honey bbq which i tasted like sweet baby rays nothing special . also ordered sasha cheeses fires were dry and cheese was n't even melted : ( not impressed . very sad . i may try it again and order a burger but wings are fries were a let down .	68
0	stopped at pan asian just for drinks . thai iced tea perfect . thai iced coffee so so . the coffee was n't sweet and creamy enough and a little bitter . preferred the tea .	1203
1	this place is great ! offers awesome prices even when i told them i found something private party cheaper they gave me a good outlook and helped me not over pay for a used gun . always helpful and knowledgeable . i 've been in a couple times for smalls parts and ammo but always dream of the guns i want and they are patient and let me hold any of the guns knowing i 'm just dreaming at the time . definitely suggest this place over the other couple of places i 've been here in vegas even though this place is on the complete other side of town from me this is always my first stop !	2247
1	i have hit the age where i now have to wear glasses . all i can say was that the sales rep worked with me to help pick out some pretty cool frames . she ensured i received the best deal possible . what more can one ask !	3945
0	maybe i went on a bad day or i 'm being overly critical , but the service was horrible . the pho was also horrible . pho is pho . the noodles , meat and vegetables are the same everywhere you go . the only way you tell if the pho is good is through the broth . the pho here was translucent and tasteless even with all the msg they put in there to mask their laziness . but yeah , sure . if you 're an elderly white couple , then they will scream hello and thank you . i guess that means good service .	947
1	visited to have breakfast while i had my car worked on . it was delicious ! i ordered my skillet without mushrooms but it was delivered to me with . before i could even say anything , my waiter came back to correct it . great service !	1504
1	this is definitely a 'dive ' casino ... the machines are also very tight so i wo n't recommend coming here to win money but the food and drinks are good and they host a cheap home game type poker tournament friday and saturday were we have had a lot of fun ... nice vibe overall in here ... staff are friendly and helpful ...	2928
1	their customer service at las vegas check in counter is beyond excellent . my husband and i tried to check in for returning to ny , not realizing our flight was a day ahead ! ! a lady name levone kept the situation so cool and accommodate to rebook the flight for that day . on top of it , she somehow managed to cut our cost to zero . i have been traveling for many years yet , i have never experienced such curtesy and professional serives from any of the airlines . levone made us feel so safe and made her ways to clean up our mess . virgin america , and levone , a beautiful person , we really appreciate your help ! !	1623
0	wow has this place gone down hill . we 've been going here for years and used to recommend it to everyone . the last two times have been awful . given , the red curry is still tasty but tonight 's food came out at different times and each dish was literally slammed on our table , spilling each meal . the service has been so rude lately that i felt like i was bothering the waitress by just being there . oh , and forks and water would have been nice to receive on the first ask . i really hope they start changing their approach to customers or they will feel the same closure as their neighbors .	1450
0	google maps says that the restaurant closes at 10:00 pm and their restaurant time board says 9:30 pm . travelled 7 miles and reached by 9:00 pm they said only 3 kinds of biryani are available . since i am a vegetarian i was not left with much options but i was seeing food coming out and person in front of have also ordered all different kind of food . very disappointed with the kitchen staff . i really appreciate the lady at the front who was taking the order she has requested the chef but looks like he was tired and not in a mood to make any food , highly disappointed .	1540
0	horrific customer service & owning up to poor quality workmanship . manager ( very rude & snooty ) redirected & basically blamed bff that she must have stored it ( never used new ) incorrectly for the handle to leak glue & damage the purse . she wouldnt issue a credit & said it could n't be fixed w/o $ or guarantee . never buy lv ! buy gucci across the mall from them . too bad cause sales staff was great though .	1493
1	every time i come to this sonic i am impressed . the food is made to order and the service is excellent . i will specifically go out of my way to patronize this sonic .	844
1	first tine here . one flavor was better than the next ! very exotic mexican ice cream . had corn ice cream and some type of mexican fruit flavored ice cream . in a small strip center , easy to miss . you would think it would be on the south side of charleston , but it is on the north .	2559
1	we see dr. gerlach and she has been amazing every time ! she is always so sweet and caring with our son and always takes the time to answer any of our questions . we have also met a few other doctors and they all seem amazing . we are super happy we chose this office for our son .	3134
0	the doctor and his staff are really nice , but the establishment is either very new or had a very poor budget . not like a `` normal '' doctor office at all , massage bed as medical bed , fold up table used for all medical equipment , no sink , fold up chairs , etc . not very professional looking at all , but dr.scott is super nice .	235
0	ordered a mango mousse cake here recently for my brother 's birthday . the cake itself was very dry ! the mousse was okay , but the mango did n't seem that fresh as parts of it were a bit dark/turning brown . hoping this is a one time thing , but i 'm not sure if i 'll order cakes from here again .	2971
1	typical club with bottle service and things like that . security is pretty tight and on point within . had witnessed two lassies about to throw down , but security arrived to quell it quickly . nice mix of people in the crowd , was able to get a couple of dances with two different groups there ... would return on next trip . cover was i thing 10-15 , forgot how much the drinks were but i do not believe it will break your pockets	1282
1	thank goodness for the cutting garden ! i live in california , and needed flowers delivered for my husband 's relative in north olmsted . after having an awful experience with 1800 flowers , i decided to go with someone local . the cutting garden 's website was easy to use , and their friendly staff followed up with me to confirm . additionally , i provided the incorrect address for delivery ( the relative had moved and i was n't aware ) , and the cutting garden kindly re-delivered the flowers to the correct address , refusing my offer to compensate them for their time and trouble . what stellar service ! i will surely use their services again !	497
0	completely rude employees and owner . very inconsistent food/ingredients and they will screw up your order frequently . they screw up , they will not refund your money . never seen this before ever ! sometimes closer to the house is n't always better !	1521
1	i have been going to get my mani's/pedi 's here for years . they are always professional and do a good job . it is a very clean place as well ! tina , the owner is very sweet . i highly recommend visiting them for your next service .	3905
1	i initially discovered this place through postmates , and i 'm so happy i did . i 've tried a variety of things off the menu , and i have yet to be disappointed by anything ( however , my fave is def the smothered chicken ) . after ordering off postmates a few times , i decided to actually dine in , with the added company of my boyfriend . the service was great , the food was amazing ( boyf loved as well ) , and armadillo grill has some pretty happy customers here who are set on returning many many times . : )	717
0	no show ! ! for an airport run at 4:30am . filled out an online request , received a text , spoke to a dispatcher and all was set . called at 4:32 when the car had n't arrived to be told `` i do n't see you on my sheet '' yeah , ok . overpriced and unreliable !	2356
1	this place is awesome ! they helped me out so much ! really nice and affordable cars . i do n't have the best of credit and they still got me a great rate ! i highly recommend this place !	3518
1	had a wonderful adoption experience at the east valley animal control center this past saturday . i want to thank the east valley team for being so dedicated to the animals in their care ; the team is passionate about what they do & this is evident in the great amount of effort they put into their work .	2689
0	extremely disappointed . i order the large bouquet for my mom . the bouquet was delivered timely , however the bouquet was piecey , missing flowers and different flowers were used in the bouquet from the on-line picture ! i called 800flowers and rep said she will send out another bouquet ... ? ? ? so my mom will have a mediocre bouquet next to a better looking bouquet ? the shock and awe factor was destroyed .	38
0	this place is nasty they didnt disclose my cost up front..if i would have known i would have said no..then poom a $ 251 bill after insurance and they tossed me to a collection agency paid their azz today	188
0	the service was terrible and no one acknowledged us when we talked in . there were three people working and one was extremely rude . on the sale rack clothes were marked wrong saying a certain dress i wanted to purchase was $ 50 but when i went to check out it was $ 150 and they would n't honor the prices .	2153
0	i had a prescription for 21 tylenol 3s after a tooth extraction and was still visibly in pain with a swollen mouth and both the tech and the pharmacist refused to help me after labeling me a `` drug seeker '' . i have only used medications like this after surgeries and i 've only had three in my life ! never again will i return to this location . beware of megan !	1207
1	i had the chocolate covered banana , it was amazing ! will definitely being going back .	3813
0	this is your standard squashed burger . if you like that sort of thing , you might like this smashburger​ . i prefer burgers that are juicy and meaty , not crunchy and dry , but its a preference . i think the smashburger​ fries are sub-par​ too . limp and flavorless​ . not good food to travel on . just does n't sit that well . but what airport food does .	669
0	quick review of my dim sum experience at this establishment : food : 1/5 - i found all the fried food to be too greasy , taro cake tasted like chalk , the cold melon soup tasted like they used un-ripe cantaloupe service : 3/5 - the servers pushing the carts were friendly but the lady who took our bill was a bit of a witch ambiance : 2/5 - washrooms are disgusting , they need to clean the aquarium at the front where they keep the lobsters price : 1/5 - overpriced based on the poor quality of the food ... not coming back here anytime soon .	0
0	had the cronut , it was terrible . soggy and lacked any character . way too much sugar on top . was probably over a day old as i had it late in the day . if the original cronut from dominique ansel is a 10 , this was a 4 at best . might give it a try again if they had something fresher . this is just a storefront so not sure how fresh the rest of the goods are .	518
1	location is awesome . you can walk off the elevator and be right on the strip . great staff and the price to stay is great . right in the middle of everything and o shea 's is such a fun place . you do have to deal with some noise as there is a nightclub right out front . rooms still being updated but good enough .	2976
0	can i give zero for quest ? two individuals tried to get a blood culture from my 3 year old son and caused a vein to collapse . the website said this location does pediatric draw . do n't go to this location . my son is traumatized and his arm is in a lot of pain . we need to wait up to a week to try again but we do n't have that time . they are horrible .	1453
0	this was my favorite sushi place . i always ordered the tuna sashimi , and some days the chef would throw in a few extra pieces . their miso soup is good . today was the last time they will receive my business . the store smelled more `` fishy '' than usual but its a sushi place , so i thought nothing of it . i open my tray and am appalled at the fish . i tried one bite , and almost threw up . -- -edit -- - the owners have reached out to me privately , and have apologized for the poor food quality . i am going to give them a second chance this week .	24
1	this show was great ! the only thing is that they only really pay attention to bachelorettes/ birthday girls which is kind of disappointing because the majority of the crowd is not one of the two . however , me and my friend still had a blast & fell in love with the sexy dances ! recommended for a girls night out ! definitely pay extra for the vip tables , that 's where they spend 95 % of their time dancing !	2149
1	great place . had extra staff available when a large group came in . the quality of sandwiches is as good as any other subway .	778
0	extremely rude ! ! ! i called to schedule an appointment but told the gal to forget it . she was so rude , very short and full of herself , if that 's how the receptionist is i can only imagine how the doctors are and if they 're not they need to reel her in or replace her because she is not giving patients a good first impression . she is costing shepherd eye center patients and $ $ because of her unprofessional behavior ! ! if i could give them a zero rating i would ! !	1635
0	this is a gay bar ? should n't there be a sign or something ? place is old , kind of a classic dive , but , like i say , this is a gay bar ? oh well , the bartender is nice , the beer is cold . i rate only 2 stars because the facility is older and kind of grimy .	3252
0	i took my car in for an interior detail and they did a horrible job , my carpet and seats are stained bad and i didnt expect much from that but alot of the vinyl was dirty and you can tell there was no effort in removing the dirt from it . i will never take my cars there again which sucks but id rather drive a little further and get a better job done	2198
0	this place is very overpriced for the quality of the food . i had the burger and it was very bland and dry . it does n't come with any condiments on it , and my server did n't even ask if i wanted any . the side salad was very disappointing also , did n't seem very fresh and had a flavourless dressing . i wo n't be going back .	273
0	fantastic , unique clothes are overshadowed by the snotty attitudes of the staff ( not carine or randall ) . shopped there for the last time yesterday . not worth it . will spend my time and money at elan or mina 's .	1621
1	my husband and i recently bought a rocker recliner from this location . they priced matched an online business that was asking almost $ 600 less then the price in store . we were shocked and thrilled they were able to do this . we just got the chair home , it was an easy set up and looks great . we are very happy and will be visiting them for any future furniture purchase .	1794
1	i work at the airport and when i do n't bring a lunch , i always go to 360 . they are in the b gate and are impossible to miss . there is a little seating and counter space to put your luggage . well lit and smells pretty good . the food is pricey but it 's aiport food . it 's lways expensive . menu is big and a little confusing but it 's not too bad . i get the 360 chicken . it 's always good . the cashiers speak fluent english and spanish . i 'd suggest this to anyone stuck in the airport on a lay over or early for their flight in or around the b gate .	623
1	we had my daughters bday party here and they did a great job ! loved having the whole gym to ourselves : - ) my daughter said it was the best birthday party she 's ever had !	1427
0	you will be queen when u come after you make a purchase and you come back because there is something wrong with your bag , they blame you for it even if you 've had it for a few days . they try to make it seem like you 've done something wrong . the way i was treated by this store was horrible they belittled me and made me feel as if i was lesser . i 'm not recommend everyone to come lv scottdale cause the stupid service ...	1493
0	love the $ 3.00 tall draft beers . but wings are the smallest wings you will ever see and inconsistent service and taste of their wings . not enough sauce on the wings ever . i 'll probably go for the beers ... . but wo n't order the food anymore .	1285
1	great place . clean and new . i usually go to the sauna in the winter . there are signs that state no shows/gym clothes . it drives me crazy that they allow this on a consistent basis . it 's gross , but otherwise , great bang for your buck as far a gyms go .	3268
0	j'avais très hâte de d'essayer ce salon puisqu'il tienne la gamme de produits bioesthetique que j'adore . quelle déception ! un accueil frette sans sourire . on me parlait toujours en anglais alors que je répondais en français et en plus , le comble , mes cheveux ne sont pas égaux . ouf !	333
0	not that this store cares but you lost a sale today . at the smoothie bar there was one person helping 3 people . i needed something from the bakery , not only did this guy not acknowledge me at all , he left to show someone where something in the store was . i went over to the food counter and asked the guy if only one person was handling the bakery & smoothie bar , he replied i do n't know but pages someone for me to get help in the bakery , it never came so i left . what a poor way to do business .	433
0	we went here for the first time on father 's day at 10:30a . we ordered an omelette and some sort of breakfast special- certainly nothing out of the ordinary . after 85 minutes , we asked the waitress to cancel our order , as we had n't yet been served . the waitress was very apologetic and comped our bill ( which was only coffee ) and asked us to return for a complimentary meal in the future . very disappointing experience indeed .	57
1	what an amazing apartment ! moving in was quick and easy thanks to the help of eric in the leasing office ! the apartment itself was entirely upgraded as well as the property ! the four pools are beautiful and the tennis court makes it feel like you 're at a resort.. very clean , very professional and overall i 'm very happy with my experience ! in comparison to other apartments in the area , this is the best value . for the same price elsewhere , i was being shown run-down apartments with shady landlords . the leasing management here was very clear and formal . i would definitely recommend .	3148
0	wanted to try this place for a while . would give zero stars if i could . stood at the bar area to order a smoothie and got ignored while all the non-ethnic customers got helped . and they were n't even busy . guess south end is n't as progressive as i thought .	1127
1	i bought a kenwood car stereo . excellent ! great guys . they were a lot of help . i just needed a replacement for a old car . they did n't try to sell me something i did n't need . installed the next morning . great guys to to deal with . they showed me how everything worked . i would highly recommend audio express . manuel velducea is really knowable i would ask for him . all the guys are good .	2427
1	first time here . food was overall good . the warm mushroom salad was really good as was the cappuccino . yeah i know who has cappuccino with dinner . service was good . it was not super busy . they have put a lot into the decor . i suspect i should share a salad with my wife next time and order a pizza . the wood oven looks great .	858
0	got a to good to be true flier in the mail . said they would let me out of the last year of my lease and i could get a new lease on a new car at a lower price . .. all lies . be very careful	2210
0	kelly 's is a pretty average bar ... better than average music on some nights . the highlights of the place for me have always been the sweet potato fries , that they carry beer from the east end brewery , and usually the company i 'm with . it 's a convenient location if you 're coming from the highland park area . other food i 've had there- german style bar food was decent .	279
1	recently sgt . splatter 's has gone through many changes . i believe it 's new management and now this place is amazing . they have installed in brand new lights , so you can see what you are shooting and ref 's are fair on splitting teams . the price is slightly more then paintball city on sundays but worth checking it out . i will defiantly be there for sundays as many people come play after 2pm . keep up the great work !	2926
1	the drive thru lady was nice ( where u pay ) but the pick up food lady was like `` thanks ma'am , come back again . all while not looking at you	1162
1	wow the selection of beers on tap is amazing . they got the classics like spotted cow and leinenkugels and ur major brewers but then they got soooo many others ! there burgers are great too obviously cuz it 's a burger joint . had the kentucky bourbon burger or something like that . was outstanding . definitely need to go back to try more beers and burgers . atmosphere was great and waitstaff was attentive . try it !	957
1	what a great little barber shop ! ! ! i 've been meaning to come down , and finally found the time . got me a great haircut , neck shave and head massage all for under $ 20 ! ! ! each cutting station has it 's own personal tv , i was able to watch some football while getting a cut . it 's truly a nice barbershop , granite counter tops and the old school barber shop chairs . this is what 's it 's all about , small local businesses ! ! good work gentleman joe 's ! ! !	1862
1	came across this place randomly but so glad i did ! i love this bar ! the interior is super classy , there 's live music , and every drink we ordered off the menu was strong but masked by a great taste ! i got drunk off only 2 drinks but enjoyed every minute of my drink . the only reason i did n't give 5 stars is because the price was a little high . $ 14 for a cocktail , but even so the drinks were good ! i definitely would come back . one of my favorite bars in vegas to come , chill , and have a good time .	1992
1	there is n't enough stars to justify this place . let me just start by saying stuuupppppid fire best breakfast i 've had in las vegas staff was friendly chef made sure everything was good the bacon was so good the soft shell crab benedict was amazing	57
1	i bring 2 dogs and 2 cats to north royalton animal hospital . yes , i might pay $ 5 more for this or $ 10 more for that , but they saved our dog 's life , when another vet ignored the signs of his body shutting down ( they said it was allergies ) . i 'm not actually sure if they actually are more expensive than othr vets , but it isnt enough to make a huge difference , espcially when a furry life is involved .	2770
0	every time i go into this store , i feel like more of an annoyance than a customer . the employees just seem to care about talking to each other more than their actual clientele .	1884
0	went in there for dessert , horrible service , food quality was okay . i think server let restaurants reputation gone to it 's head ... ... there was no greeting , not even water were served to us . we asked him question and he never answer them , just said he will go check then we found him happily serving table of 6 besides us ... the next time we saw him was when he passed us the bill , not a thank you or how was the food ... . wow ... .	437
1	i love project cupcake ! best cupcakes in vegas ! the owner is a truly a nice guy . the cupcakes are baked to perfection . there 's no competition here !	1889
0	ordered 2 shrimp tacos , tasted terrible to say the least . the tacos will cost you $ 10 yet will be the size of tacos you can get for $ 1 on a taco tuesday . the sauce tasted unnatural and like it was made in a chemistry lab .	623
0	if you do n't need help with anything this store is ok . the hundred of associates walking around are inaccessible and uninterested in customer . i ca n't tell you how many times i went in there to buy something and had to leave to get some help somewhere else . long time best buy customer no more .	494
0	less than stellar . tried out pure pizza for the first time on a friday , when they were having a pop-up market . i was there at 1:00ish , before the 2:00 pop-up . after ordering , i found it strange i had to ask how long , considering i was to go ahead and be seated - but that 's extremely minor . pizza was brought to me piping hot - but also somewhat burnt . so after letting my pizza cool , the flavors were just ehhh . there was just nothing too special that would lure me back again , considering the plethora of other options out there .	809
0	knowledgeable . plays on your intelligence - you need to have good idea what your items are worth or what you are willing to consider a fair deal . must ask direct question to get answer as he answers question with question .	2032
0	i am not going to ramble , i think the pictures speak for themselves . this is the worse grooming experience my dog has ever had . whether or not my dog 's behavior played a factor , i believe this could have been handled differently before it led to nicks and bald spots all over .	2501
0	the 2 stars are because we were happy that there were no cages . we brought our large short haired dog because of shedding and expected him to come out brushed . when we picked him up we still had handfuls of hair in our hands . not worth it and we wo n't be back .	3615
1	the regular walgreens i go to was not open yet & i went to this store which is open 24-hrs . i need refill & ms. thuy was there to help me . since i used coupons for my rx , she was very detailed and professional in making sure i get my needed rx with discount . thank you !	1207
1	the employees were very friendly and the food was great as usual . i really felt they wanted to give every customer a good experience at their location . customer service at it 's finest !	3372
1	awesome ! best jerk ever ! in fact , this is probably the best quick lunch spot i 've been to in many , many years . this place is super good . it 's mostly a take-away business but either way , you ca n't go wrong . thanks yelp , for suggesting this place ! never would have noticed it otherwise .	1355
0	i wish i was treated with more respect . i do n't know what has happened over the last year but the professionalism has gone down significantly ... i 'll be going elsewhere : /	2096
0	i never thought i 'd see the day when walgreens became classier than cvs . this place used to develop photos , now it does n't . it 's just like every other stupid , gross , overpriced and useless cvs in the valley . employees are rude or just plain stupid and it 's in a terrible area of town , so i wo n't be going here or any other cvs for that matter .	3044
1	i have not personally been a patient at sw spine and sports but my wife has . i have gone to every single one of her appointments with her and the staff and providers have always been very helpful and friendly . dr. stone and dr. komar have taken really good care of my wife , the office is clean and easy to get to from the 101 , and the back office staff have always been friendly . i would definitely recommend sw spine and sports .	3566
1	apparently i 'm the only one to like this location ? i used to come here in the mornings before work and the girls working here were always so friendly and whenever i wanted something new but could n't make a decision they would help me come up with something off the menu that would turn out delicious . i ended up moving to the other side of mesa so i no longer go here and that kind of disappointed me since i liked it here so much .	1804
0	no one has any knowledge on skin , hair , men 's cosmetics.you can get only assistance on makeup , if you get lucky !	2479
0	we just purchased a house here in arizona and walked in to purchase some big appliances . we walked around for about 10 minutes without any sales person assisting us . during that time two additional customers walked in and were attended to promptly . felt very discriminated ! do not shop here !	2454
1	- extremely solid eats . - the seafood congee is freakishly amazing ! - also discovered fish paste cooked into the long donut thing ( it doesnt translate well ) ... . winner .	1173
0	i really want to like it ... been there twice cause i want to give it a second chance ... for someone who loves desserts it just was n't there ... certain things were dry other things were lacking flavor both times ... great decour and really nice service but the food quality is just not there	2410
1	jasmine has a little something for everyone at a good price . the hibachi grille is my favorite , where i can choose my own raw ingredients to be cooked on the spot . the sushi bar is n't bad . the buffet is quite large and is better than average . service is good and very efficient .	1302
0	i eat burgers all the time , as well as garlic and mushrooms , never have any problems . got the garlic mushroom burger here 6 months ago and felt extremely sick after . for some reason , i decided to give it another go ... and felt pretty sick again . would n't recommend it .	1461
0	tire shine still not shiny . but twice this week , the last roller brush that comes overhead after the multicolor soap has not been running . how is it allowed to give less services than were paid for on unlimited subscriptions ? ? ? they should disclose what parts are broken at the start so people can choose not to but a wash. and everytime an unlimited subscriber goes thru , it should refund part of the subscription price automatically when any parts inn the wash cycle are broken . getting paid for services not rendered . bbb.org complaint coming .	2939
0	i 've not used this place.nor will i.but i just want everyone to know that they support and offer ear cropping on little puppies ! ! it 's an absolutely barbaric practice.i cant believe vets still carry out this procedure ! please think twice before bringing your animal here.its all about the money ... ..	1864
1	place is quality hands down to science extractions done right thank you muv so much	1849
1	my friend wanted coffee at 11pm so i kidnapped her and brought her here ! it was our first time here but it wo n't be our last . she ordered the hot caramel macchiato and i ordered the hot white mocha which was so so good ! perfect hint of sweetness . we both shared a honey toast which the worker recommended to us , it complimented the coffee perfectly . the seating is not your average seating but it 's cozy nonetheless . i loved the decor as well ! cute little spot for a late night coffee .	2219
1	after a month of searching crappy places , internet sales , tent events , awkward warehouses , my boyfriend and i came across this places as we were tossing up the white flag on our way to ikea . it 's clean , straight forward , and chuck our sales guy was super helpful and not pushy . while they do have discounted and clearance mattresses they are the only ones i 've found that give a 10 year warranty and a 30 day comfort trial period on all their mattresses . how rad is that ? i 'd totally recommend them to anyone . : ) thanks guys for making this so easy , wish we came here first !	2003
1	always helpful . great service . amazing doctors and staff ! greeted as soon as you walk in and helped if needed . will always recommend this location to family and friends !	1590
1	i have been going to open arms going on almost six months i have a wonderful counselor who has been so amazing . the staff is a wonderful woman named veronica who also gets to know you personally and is an absolute delight . we still have lots of work `` for me '' lol but i have much faith that she will get me where i need to be . i look forward to our journey .	2629
1	grabbed two lunch specials for the first time and was pleasantly surprised . absolutely worth the $ 6.50 each . ordered via yelp and picked up at their side area inside the bounty hunter bar . they honored my special requests ( dressing on side , add lettuce and extra peperoncini ) . gyro and fries were tasty- garlicky taziki sauce tied it together . antipasto salad was very large with plenty of meat and cheese but lots of veggies too . soda came in 12oz cans . will be back to try more lunch specials .	987
1	good furnishings at a good price . purchased family room furniture and dinette set . very happy with service .	3738
1	great ice cream and good service . a bit expensive but portions are big to share . it 's usually packed and hard to get a table but that 's good sign , right ? enjoy !	3604
0	ha ha we stayed here a few years ago . my first time staying down town . the price was pretty good , but i would rather pay more and have more . i 'm not high maintenance but i do like my room service coffee in the morning at least , and they had no refrigerator in the room . the people here are run down old broke men , and last time we walked in to play a couple games it smelled sooo bad of old man farts we stopped dead in our tracks , turned around and left ! no more for me .	3630
0	food was good ... our waitress kelly . seemed a bit pissy.. and the bathrooms were just plain scary ! !	340
0	i ordered a talk loved green tea latte.. the cup was full of ice and all u got was 3 sips out if it ! ! ! and all the barrister said was sorry ! i officially hate/boycott starbucks ! ! ! ! !	2849
0	this place being `` new '' the only money spent to make is any better seems to have been all put in the sign on front . unless your bowling maybe after reading the other review they might give a shit about you . i was waiting playing pool on the rest of my party and the music is so old and tasteless that i going to leave . the food might have gotten better but the lack of service makes me not want to spend another dime here . this place is worse then before in my opinion . please make some improvements . p.s . the lighting sucks for playing pool and it 's over priced as shit !	3296
1	the banana base shakes are good , i had the chocolate shake and i really enjoyed it . it had a friendly staff which added to the place .	1134
1	i love this best buy in henderson . the staff is very friendly and the managers are very helpful . the location is located very convienently next to costco , galleria mall and about a mile away from target and toys r us . their price matching plan is pretty robust and they do match newegg and amazon . since , amazon started charging taxes , this has been my go to place for electronics .	494
0	this is my first time here and i must say i 'm a bit disappointed with this place . i came in for korean grill but very limited options for beef . i ordered short ribs but got strips and the waitress dumped the entire serving on the gas stove ( as shown in pic ) all the while we 've had servers come over to our table and turn off the stove without saying a word , leaving us wondering how should we continue cooking the food ! i would n't recommend based on their service .	1290
1	located in both the eastbound and westbound travel plazas along the ohio turnpike , they offer cajun style chicken , along with other southern cooking in a fast food setting . prices typical of highway travel .	1479
1	great customer service and unique flavors . i do n't know why so many others disagree but this is my 3rd time ordering a cake/cupcakes from this place so that says enough . a couple of my favorite flavors are the cookie monster , pink champagne , and recently a brownie chip with orange that was recommended . i recently ordered my graduation cake and 4 dozen cupcakes from here and was not disappointed at all . thank you ! ! ! ! ! : )	1806
1	you have n't really been to vegas until you 've see one of those shows where the girls are topless and wearing giant feathery headdresses . it 's classic vegas at its best . it 's not like any of the cirque shows . it 's good old fashion singing , dancing , and fully choreographed numbers . splashy costumes , chorus lines , it 's all there . it 's a fun show . they offer a 'kid-friendly ' version earlier in the evenings . i do n't remember , but i think there is a two drink minimum . it 's classic vegas in all its feather and rhinestones glory .	3069
1	we needed some grounding , warm , nourishing food after a long drive and this place hit the spot ! it was pretty quiet ( which we loved ) and our food came out promptly . the smells are enticing ! we were checked on by our waiters consistently and our waters were never less than half full . my husband got a lamb dish and the lamb was tender and flavorful . i got a vegetarian dish with peas ( forgot the name ) that hit the spot . lots of flavor and spices but not so spicy that you ca n't even taste your food . a wonderful find , we will definitely return !	640
0	we just moved in these apartments and we were excited butt we were told the pool would be done at the end of july and now it 's the middle of august and it 's been a week since we have seen anybody working on the pool . a apartment has already been broken into and parking sucks . are parking spot is far away and they wo n't do anything about it . the only ups is the apartment is nice but management sucks and no pool and parking sucks ! ! !	2684
1	of all the breakfast chains , vi is always my favorite . prompt service , pleasant waiters/waitresses , delicious food , plus pie . ca n't beat pie . i always get breakfast , the chicken fried steak skillet is my favorite , but the new chicken-bacon-avacado hash is superb as well ! i 've been to many different locations , and always have a great experience . if you can , ask for beth . she 's super sweet !	1029
1	was in the area for a birthday party today and wanted mexican . it was good & just exactly what we wanted .	189
0	came here for brunch yesterday . was seated right away and the server we had was friendly . we ordered off of the breakfast menu . it was okay . the eggs lacked some flavour ( needed salt ) . my boyfriend also had some hair at the bottom of his eggs ( so gross ) but we were done eating by the time he found it we did n't bother saying anything .	534
0	they gave me a cup to pour my own coffee out of those decanters where you pump the coffee using a lever on the top , like a cheesy hotel cafeteria . not very fresh , and a coffee was $ 2.50 . the `` bold ethiopian night '' coffee was not bold at all . watery . it 's too bad , i really wanted to like this place .	1140
0	if you had a bad experience with slash salon , visit arizona state board of cosmetology website to report your complaints . this business is already under investigation . their unethical and deceitful way of business practice should be ceased in our community .	3474
0	toilet ran snd gurgled constantly even though a repairman worked on it for an hour and never cam back . carpet was so dirty after 1hr my granddaughters feet were black . blood on master shower curtain was the disgusting top of our experience . we stopped and told front desk . no one cam up and replaced it . pool was cloudy . reported this to front desk and they said oh were sorry . with no sincerity this is why we did not take tour ... even with the $ 125.00 cash offer	1057
0	very rushed and unprofessional polish job . they try and make as much money as possible , they start the process then leave you waiting to help a new customer then rush back to quickly finish . had n't been to this place in years , now i remember why . needless to say i will never be back .	3213
0	ok , this is best option near me since quick pharmacy closed . they make a ton of $ on scripts with my family of 4 . called ahead and spoke with pharmacy rep on site ... asked timing for.a prescription that had been called in by my doc . pharmacy said 15 min ... now still here and its 15 min plus 45 more . pita .	1641
0	this place is a scam . my bill supposed to 420 $ put the they end up took 860 $ out mine credit card argue with them for weeks they only refund 130 $ .if you rent here becareful .	3595
1	enjoly is absolutely great ! she really listens and gives me exactly what i want in a haircut - even if i do n't know what that is myself !	1617
0	standard walgreens minus the slowest drive-thru pharmacy ever and the amount of beggars you 'll encounter .	1881
0	warning : go wild is sliding down hill quickly . i wo n't be back , especially with lucky fish now happening two miles away . quality is now below acceptable , roll size has shrunk , service is as bad as other reviewers mention . i had to sleuth out what was `` off '' in my roll . the culprit ? rotten carrot . well , at least it was n't rotten fish , but you know , if they ca n't do produce right , its not worth the gamble with the raw fish . sionara , go wild .	431
0	what a change ! from a first class restaurant to a mediocre one at best . the food may be ok but the smell of the bathroom may overwhelm your experience .	784
1	annie is the best tailor i 've found yet here . she not only did wonders with my bridal gown , she took the time to get to know me and even bought me a coffee to talk over ! i will never try any one else . she 's efficient , she 's resourceful and the best absolute priced ! i would recommend her time and again . kelly murtha	3401
0	sounds like things have n't changed . bad service bad attitude . just close for f 's sake .	718
1	this place is amazing ! they have great customer service however they do tell you that it will be next day - the reason why is there workers are at night or morning completed the dry cleaning due to weather in az . i can respect that .	1911
0	the order process went well and the delivery arrived in a timely manner . i saw a picture of the flowers my friend received and the arrangement was n't even close to what was pictured on the website ... a lot more filler flowers despite ordering the premium arrangement . i picked this place specifically because of what they offered despite other cheaper places in the area . i am disappointed because i wanted the best arrangement possible for my friend who is going through a tough time . i will not order from this place again .	3689
0	great job guys . i pay $ 160 for a buff and wax , as well as signed up for $ 30/mo car wash package . what i got was an unfinished wax job that was n't even finished . missed places all over the car . buffing compound and wax left on places all over the car . they said it would be done at noon . i show up at noon and they said they would have it done in 20 minutes . 2 hours later it was finally `` finished '' in this terrible condition . forget this place . what a bunch of jokers .	127
1	i 've been shopping here for years . the clothing is excellent . the quality is awesome . i 've had numerous outfits over the past years that are still in great condition . the staff is ok . but like i 've said the clothing is phenomenal . that what keeps me coming back . i swear by this store . i recommend it to all my gf 's in and out of the adult industry .	145
1	came here with a good friend of mine and made an appointment for a pedicure but they take walk-ins too . when we got there , picked our color and they sat us right away . seems very clean and they have the plastic liners for the pedicure basin . we got the spa package which includes sugar scrub , warm lotion , and hot stone massage , came to $ 30 and $ 20 for a basic pedicure . my guy was super nice and really cared about their service . brought us bottles of water when we sat down . and he giggled at me when i got ticklish ! cleanliness is very important in my opinion and this place looked great !	2886
0	honestly i get the creeps everytime i drive by this place now . about a year ago i stopped in to get a cookie dough ice cream cone , paid , looked down at it and matted in the ice cream was the largest wad of hair ever , i literally gagged . i handed it back to the girl and nicely asked for a refund , she rolled her eyes and gave it to me after seeing the hair and never even apologized . this place is disgusting ! !	2075
1	just wanted to highly recommend john at this location for those who get deep tissue massages . he was very thorough and my 90 minute massage was one of the best ive ever had . very professional and experienced !	3862
1	i love this place so much , and with the delivery to my work , i often eat here . the food is always good , the staff is lovely . the only complaint i have , is that with how often i order from jimmy johns , there 's no rewards or loyalty program for valued clients . i probably order from here once or twice a week , as it 's usually the only place i eat out at . i would love it so much better if there was some kind of consolation for buying so many sandwiches .	1475
0	been here twice now , and i ca n't seem to like it . i really wan na like this place - the masked mexican fighters , so cool , the idea of mixing mexican and asian , you 'd think it 's a hit . obviously i 'm in the minority here , but i just found the burrito overstuffed with rice and the noodles inside are still cold . it 's not like i just gave it 1 shot ... i returned a 2nd time . maybe i 'm just spoiled by burrito boyz .	834
0	bar has good choices , good service , crowd were high brow low iq sjw types unfamiliar to the art of open conversation amongst bar-goers , go if you like beer , avoid if you like shooting the shit with strangers and feeling welcome in a place meant for drunkenness and loose spitballing .	3077
0	the wi-fi is terrible at this location . even when there is no one in it . so close to a college as big as asu you would think they would upgrade it and add some plugs . been coming here fur years and it 's never gotten fixed.. please pass it on and get it fixed . thanks.. also bathrooms are always dirty	2218
0	the people at these locations and the online customer support are useless , and rude . i would not want to do business with any of these locations again . live and learn , and i wo n't be making the same mistake twice .	2208
1	we own a boxer . we had a bad experience at petsmart , so we tried grand grooming about a year ago . we keep going back because they do a great job on our dog 's nails , they are reasonably priced , and the staff is very friendly . they treat our dog with respect .	1247
1	great dinner . fast service . spanikopita was really good . would be a 5 if the server had a personality .	177
0	i wo n't waste time repeating everything everyone else has already said . it 's all true . if i did n't live in a place where there is only one other choice of airline for most destinations , i 'd never fly allegiant again . btw- if you choose a rental car with your tickets , be aware , there are a lot of hidden/excess costs in that . in vegas , we were charged 30 % more than the original price for taxes , fees , etc .	3127
1	i am the founder of a non profit holly ' z hope . i was looking to work with a spay and neuter clinic . i found spay neuter charlotte clinic online . i was nervous at first having not used them in the past . i was pleasantly surprised . the facility is very clean and the staff was great ! the clinic allows my organization to provide low cost spay and neuter service to dogs in my community , which helps prevent unwanted pups . thank you ! !	2864
1	i shop at best buy mainly to get new things for my camera . although the prices might be up there , i 've always had a decent experience with the sales people . i 'm not computer savvy , so when i ask questions about installation for photo programs , or about new accessories i get they are always helpful .	607
0	been there a lot of times over the years without issue but after having the recommended cajun chicken , i woke up this morning with food poisoning . i 'm going to be staying away for awhile , but do not order chicken from there !	670
1	it 's nice to see a filipino restaurant on the southwest side of town . staff was friendly , and service was quick , but my friend and i happen to go on a thursday evening where it was slow .	658
1	great , professional service ! easy to setup , they came out , communicated and fixed the chip in a bus windshield.. no up sell , no bs.. refreshing for vegas !	2036

1	habib always knows how to make me look great , my family and i have been relying on him to tailor our clothes and our weekly dry cleaning . he never disappoints , he has another location at bathurst and dupont	3391
1	this little record store has a good selection of both new and used records . while some of the prices may seem a tad high , they are selling them at a reasonable rate , considering . remember , this is a small store , not a major retailer . they are not out to do anything other than make a little money selling records . please support them . i found some great records in great condition for $ 4 , $ 6 , and $ 10 . not to bad eh ?	2570
0	what ever happened to customer service ? two huge issues attitude of cashier , who acted as if i were an interruption to her day ... . she was standing staring out of the window ... the other was no soap in the restroom , , when it was brought to the attention of the cashier , she asked her co-worker who was cooking.. her response `` we do n't supply soap '' . wtf ! ? ? not the type of thing you want to overhear in a food establishment ' ... not so cool bean '' s n cream . : (	2516
0	disgusting ! ! the tuna sashimi has a film on it and definitely not fresh . the spicy tuna rolls were filled with cucumber little tuna the edamame was cold and no salt . the sweet potato tempura was greasy this is not a restaurant operated by japanese people they would be ashamed of the quality and presentation , the price was in line with the quality low	516
1	chips and salsa are awesome . the queso was good with chips . we ordered the sample plater with queso cheese . naturally its crowded on this day and mistakes with orders are expected . but doesnt take away from the flavors . wore more salsa on my shirt than usual but hey i enjoyed it all .	1558
1	somewhat lower priced birth control , with really long waits . the centers are pretty much all the same here , just with different hours . the staff is friiendly , but so slow you 'd think they 're actually making your pills from scratch in the back . but , they are more affordable than your regular doc if you do n't have insurance .	2334
0	i 'm done going to this place . twice in a row and the service and food have been subpar . servers that do not write down my order do not impress me . we ordered an appetizer that never came . when we asked about it our food arrived so we chose not to wait for it . having just ordered soup and salad that was underwhelming i left hungry . there are too many places in monroeville to go there again .	1367
0	i 've shopped at this safeway store for almost 15 years and have always loved the clean store and excellent customer service . in the last few months that has changed - i 've had several bad experiences that i 've reported to the manager without seeing any change . very often the cashiers talk to each other without even greeting customers , baggers crush items and i 've even had to ask them to at least keep bagging while talking to each other so i can get out of the store ... even witnessed a bagger pick a ( verbal ) fight with a customer while waiting for a manager to resolve a problem . i 'm just consistently disappointed .	2785
1	not a big fan of the hollywood location but the vegas location has much better food and the service is excellent . the crowd is cheesy but hey this is vegas guys ! i had the sea bass which was perfect . the pretzel bread was to die for . the short ribs were a bit salty but they changed it and it was just fine . prices are high but it 's a pretty restaurant in the new aria so i would give it a shot for sure .	971
0	totally ripped me off . do not fall for being charged for diagnostic service so they can try to get u for ridiculous charges after . go elsewhere . wanted close to $ 2000 to get my vehicle running . i towed my vehicle to another place 2 miles away . $ 40.00 later my vehicle was on the road . they should be ashamed of themselves .	2084
1	i recently got my windshield replaced with safe auto glass and could n't be more pleased . it was smooth from the beginning till the end and my glass looks amazing . i received the promotions i was offered from the sales rep and would highly recommend this company for any auto glass needs !	200
0	very rude service ! 5 people after me got their coffees but nobody make my baby 's smoothie ! and no one feel sorry about it ! and after drinking just a quarter of the smoothie baby and i both started running bathroom !	3669
1	good ol ' starbucks ... . they have everything for every season . during the winter they have their seasonal drinks such as the famous pumpkin spice latte , peppermint mocha , creme brulee latte . or the refreshing flavors during the summer like the passion fruit tea and lemonade or the very berry hibiscus tea . my favorite however anytime throughout the year is the white chocolate mocha and the classic chai tea , hot please . best of all , free wifi ! ! ! every starbucks has tables and chairs and you can lounge as long as you want .	2950
0	i guess i should n't be surprised at a national chain auto shop like this trying to get more money out of customers than originally quoted but when you drop your vehicle off for a $ 10 tire rotation and pressure check and then get told they cant get some of the lug nuts off so they 're going to have to charge you to replace studs its a little ridiculous . so $ 10 was going to turn into more than $ 100 . their inspection also suggested $ 2300 more worth of work ... i 'll pass on ever returning to these guys again . fletcher 's should have never sold to these guys .	3795
0	place is over rated ! ! first let me start with the kids club ! ! it 's hard enough your a mom and get to the gym to work out ! ! only for them to send you home bc there is no room for your kid.. it 's pretty much unmotivated me to even go.. with that said , also machines are always full ! ! pretty much you get kicked off the machine before your even done.. they just keep on adding more people it 's over crowded.. machines are not kept clean ! !	3268
1	`` great service '' on saturday , i called to get brake parts , for my girlfriends car.i spoke with paul , he went out of his way to help me . i got all the right parts . and at a better price than pep boys . boyd and charles , are great guys to deal with , as well . if you are tired of dealing with rude , disrespectful people , and tired of getting the wrong parts . than give the auto zone at 6770 sky point drive , a call . thanks . steven jay	506
0	the experience i 've had in this place is literally the worst experience i 've had ever ! the staff was so rude and horrible to me and my wife and we only wanted to adopt a cat . we left with no cat whatsoever and the worst experience i 've received anywhere . they may say they are doing something good in the world but it does n't give the right to treat people like shit .	1787
0	car wash has been sold to a new company . they have been closed for weeks but that has n't stopped the new company quick quack from billing the monthly rate . after calling and trying to resolve the charges , turns out neither company wants to admit to billing me . not a good way to start things off . several other carwashes that are n't far away . i will be checking them out .	2044

1	the food is very good and fresh . the portions are big too . a nice little gem . if you want a great tasting healthy meal give it a try .	779
0	brought my husband 's truck to get washed , first time at this location we have the unlimited pass . as we sat there watching them attend to our truck we see the girls doing the windows and the guys standing and talking . they let our truck dry naturally , windows were half ass cleaned . and when we brought it to their attention they all just stood there looking at the truck and no response , yeah the truck was dry because of the wind not because they actually did anything . this is the worst service we had with cobblestone to the point we are now contemplating cancelling all together with . completely ridiculous when you spend the money you spend ...	988
0	this is terrible service . my mothers appointment was at 2pm she was n't seen for at least 45 minutes and that 's because we had to check in with the front desk of the doctor sharing the office with gupta . the staff is very irresponsible and just look miserable and they are n't very friendly or helpful . usually as a new patient they give you paperwork before entering the actual room . the nurse had my mom filling out paperwork at the same time he was trying to take her blood pressure and everything else . the doctor himself is very kind and helpful but his office staff and nurses do n't do him any justice .	297
1	i could n't have said it better than vivian s. she pretty much covered everything regarding the food court here . greenland supermarket is a little gem for visitors who want to experience something better ( like diversity of asian food , etc . ) than what 's offered on the las vegas strip . i was pleasantly surprised to take a short drive to this location to just browse through the aisles and aisles and aisles of hard to find asian products and foods that are n't so common in the south . the variety is tremendous and i definitely stocked up on my snacks . just go here .	715
0	the owner of the property we are renting engaged this company to replace a defective spa heater . when they finally came out , they started the work , and left the old heater and trash all over the place . it took them several weeks to finish the repairs and clean up the mess they made . we made numerous calls to find out what was going on , and got a different story each time . on the final visit john initially refused to even talk with us . when i approached him he finally let me know what he had did , however it was quite obvious he was not intending to do so . the entire process took almost two months .	827
1	disappointed but previous reviews . found this randomly on groupon and gave it a try while vacationing for a friend 's birthday . vicki was our host . amazing . she did n't anything and everything to accommodate everyone 's needs . she made the entire experience well worth it . definitely will do it again but will request for vicki ! ! !	2122
0	three days in a row i 've went in this place and they never have nothing they run out of bagels run out of stuff to put on the bagels there a joke i live on the east coast and dunkin ' donuts is there never run out of nothing if i had it my way i would give it a one star and the people there are rude	1131
1	i 'm writing this review based on training and shopping experience . i 've never had to groom , board , or use the vet facilities here though all look great . the training here is the best in charlotte . mr willie is wonderful- he turned my rambunctious crazy pup into an off-leash walker in less than 6 months . we started in his beginner class , went through intermediate and advanced , and are now in therapy dog classes , looking forward to taking the therapy dog test soon . willie can help you with any problem , from drooling to chewing to car sickness to aggression . he 's the caesar milan of charlotte . highly recommend ! ! !	514
1	i started getting my pedicures here a few months ago . i will absolutely not allow anyone else do my feet except tom . tom is a true gem . the best pedicures and foot massage ever . i 'm a client of tom 's forever ...	2128
1	very speedy urgent care . i go here exclusively , they are faster than my pcp and any other urgent care . the longest i 've spent total time in and out the door with my prescriptions is two hours and that with a full lobby of sick people . most of the time i 'm in and out of the urgent care in less than an hour . the staff are courteous and professional and seem to be genuinely concerned with my well being . i really appreciate have a place to take my family and know that i 'm not going to be there all day .	2580
0	horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like i was told i could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also	1561
1	came in thursday , and they were able to help me on saturday ! super fast ! the office is small not too fancy , but then again the price paid was less than half quoted everywhere else . i definitely recommend them for any process !	1932
1	as an update ... i was contacted a few months later by an executive of the company who apologized profusely for the poor service . after a conversation with him , i have to say i was very impressed and believe his words in `` that is not the way they do business . '' he was emphatic about it and i believe it now . he hoped that i would try to company again , and actually i really will now . in fact , based upon this follow-up , i have recommended this company to a friend . this is a good example of the fact that '' customer service is not a department ; it 's an attitude '' . good for you .	2833
0	pricey bread , too pricey for the quality.their sourdough baguette is just plain white bread , the brioche , blah . the decor is lovely , clientele , upscale ; more like chi chi hang out than anything else .	2327
1	awesome & delicious donut choices , cool atmosphere , excellent customer service ( shoutout to tj for the cotton candy donut recommendation , it was great ! ! )	2053
1	consistently great food from this gem in the south hills . vibrant atmosphere . we have been here several times over the last two years and the food is always terrific . try the beet salad and the grilled crab appetizer . fantastic .	1171
0	normally a decent mall . i was at southpark on fri , 3/11 during the evening hours and there are packs of juveniles running rampant on both levels . no security in sight . wo n't return here on a friday evening again !	492
1	i absolutely love this place ! they serve northern china style dishes here . i ordered the pork steamed dumpling , the braised fatty pork and some bao 's . i especially liked the thin wrap that they use for the pork steamed dumplings . everything tasted delicious , however , the food can be a bit heavy/greasy . their decor is pretty modern and the glass lets you see right into the kitchen . the seating is fairly roomy making it great for larger parties . will definitely come back !	943
1	this is a very nice target . it is clean , inviting , and the staff is very nice and helpful . i do a lot of shopping here based on the cleanliness and atmosphere . i would recommend this target to anyone looking for a nice place to shop .	2411
0	until they get rid of the company that takes care of the farm animals i will never go back . peta needs to shut this co down , i saw unbelievable crulity to these animals	759
0	i last paid a visit to this mcdonalds about a month ago and ordered breakfast . though it was n't busy , the cashier took us to a kiosk and said she her manager wants patrons to use the machine instead of ordering at the register because they are `` quicker . '' this was the second time this has happened and now we do n't go back . part of the experience of going to this mcdonalds are the nice cashiers and interacting with them ... especially when it 's not so busy in the morning .	1489
1	great food , good service , fun vibe , always busy for weekend brunch . worth the wait .	975
0	i live about 1000 miles from nearest conns store and have never shopped in one . yet they call me daily trying to collect money from me but wo n't tell me what i am supposed to owe for . judging from all the complaints out there , they are an appliance store covering for a pretty shady financial operation . ignore their calls and do n't give them any info .	2673
1	what a gem ! very kind staff and reasonable prices . they even gave me a pedicure kit to take home because they would n't use it ! we 'll be back for sure !	2481
1	this place was really good . it 's really hard to find organic options that are reasonably priced . they had very flavorful food and its prepared as healthy as possible . we 'll be back !	1402
1	you get what you pay for . i am not looking for first class accommodations when i fly usually . i am looking for an inexpensive and safe airline . i will usually research an airline before i fly them and allegiant has won awards for their maintenance . that is important to me . factor in that you can get a cheap ticket if you do n't mind not picking your own seat assignment and only taking a carry-on . i have flown them to pasco , ft. collins and colorado springs . usually on time and nice crews . i will fly them again .	3127
0	the worst customer service ever ! ! i had a coat getting altered and they messed it up and tried to blow me off for several days . the lady just tried to give me my coat back and say go somewhere else and the manager has no managerial skills at all . it took me to tell them i 'm going to call the news and take u to court to get my money back..which the manager tried to give me store credit first.and as i was leaving another customer had same problem with management ducking and dodging to take care of the customer.very very poor if i could give negative stars i would .	3032
1	i have been a patient of dr. schroeder 's for over 5 years . i love this office and my doctor . yes , there is usually a wait , but that 's because they are specialists and spend the time with you explaining everything . i do n't mind waiting as i know i will get the same service .	737
0	i asked for pizza at 5pm ... ... ..it is 805 pm ... ..still no pizza . they said , so sorry , we have it done by 6:45 . they did n't . so unreliable edit : '' no pizza till 9:30	1478
0	never going back to bonterra . this is the second time that we could n't eat at the restaurant due to a private party . very inconvenient . and the food are not that great . glad there are so many other choices now in charlotte .	886
0	i got a fairly expensive groupon and walked out looking with a rachel from friends . i understand the 90s are back , but i feel like i should be a soccer mom somewhere . i told her 3 times that i wanted bangs cut on an angle . she said she understood , but she went ahead and cut them flat . this haircut is terrible and i wish i could get my money back .	3686
1	deven did a great job . he was extremely attentive to my needs and kept me informed with the listing for the building that i was interested in . when we closed , he helped me look at the options for the management of my new property . very responsive .	3870
