1	good experience in good value ! especially with yelp discount . very good relaxing experience after an intense hike !	735
1	again , 100 % spot on . thank you so much for the best 2 hours i 've spent in years . i feel like a wet noodle . think it 's time for a nap . i love the staff . i love the hospitality . i love my masseuse . thank you to all of you . you are a great team .	1950
1	i 've been here a few times over the last week or so , and the daily choices for drip coffee have been fantastic . i love the variety , and each kind has been full of flavor . i 've had a few of the pastries as well , which were n't really anything special , but that 's okay ; i personally come just to seek my morning coffee , and am more than pleased .	1140
0	all you need to know is that the chicken was extremely dry . if a shawarma place ca n't get that right , is it really worth trying ?	1206
1	had the brunch . it comes with pastries , a glass of champagne , a starter , entree and dessert . had the pizza and wife had fish . tasty although pizza crust got very hard as it dried out . ambience is very cool and chi-chi . we liked it and will try happy hour if at the mall .	941
0	okay . so , yes , i did have high expectations . i waited more than a month to go to this place because of schedule conflict , not because it 's restaurant week . it was n't worth it . idk . maybe it 's because it 's restaurant week . but that 's not a good excuse . the interior did n't look much like what it looked like on the internet , the calamari was too cooked , my wife 's pasta was almost as hard as twizzlers and the desert was too sweet . i would not recommend this place to anyone .	886
1	i 'm really not sure what 's up with all the negative reviews . i had a very good experience with sixt . no arm twisting or belligerent scare tactics to shin on for additional accident protection . every employee from the shuttle driver to returns were as personal and helpful as can be . a nice selection of well maintained cars i will definitely use sixt again in cities they cover .	1905
0	i dropped my cardinals tickets off sunday morning with the agreement of 70/30 split in my favor . they called me back an hour later and said they made a mistake and it would be 70/30 in their favor . really ? ? ? i 'd rather eat my tickets than do business with someone that does n't keep their word . seller beware .	1995
1	hubby and i tried this just to see what it was not expecting much because we figured it was geared towards children . and although it is , we still had a fun time going in it . it also made for some cool pictures !	3060
0	the golden tee machine 's spin button is not working . how can you expect to make nice shots without controlling your ball ? also it was the masters today and they would n't put on the tv noise so we could n't hear the announcers . instead it was some rap type music . the food and service was fine otherwise though .	1177
0	are here twice and both times the wings were undercooked . the second time i even asked for the wings to be cooked longer and we 're still undercooked . never coming here again . be aware owner will respond to you for bad reviews telling you that you are wrong for feeling negatively about his business .	1397
1	dr. smith is amazing . i love him . he is the reason i keep coming back . very thorough . great job . dr. hererra very helpful . staff drops the ball . a lot . but the doctors ... .they are worth whatever issues you have to go thru to get to see them .	590
0	absolute worst grocery store . bakery has nothing fresh meat department has nothing priced well or fresh . no one will bake or cut anything fresh . they are banking on the convenience for mountains edge customers.also the deli never uses clean and covers after they are cleaning equipment . completely disappointed .	1904
0	the atmosphere was nice , but the service was poor with only one waitress serving the lounge . the food menu was also quite weak as it appeared to be made up of one small plate from each of the surrounding food venues . the alcohol menu suffered from the same problem as the other bars in the aria , no high end whiskey .	456
1	this is the best ac repair service in the valley . they were sent by my hone warranty . no hassel or up sale . my ac went out on the holiday and they came out the next day and had me up and running in 30 min .	2776
1	i love coming to this starbucks at the trails . it 's my 3rd place . my issue is this ... its 107Â° so i 'm not going to get coffee , hot or iced , and sit outside in this heat in the daytime . it 's now 8:00 pm , starbucks is closing and there are streams of people filing in to make it before they close . i think it 's time to convert to summer hours ! stay open until 10:00 ! keep it open ... they will come ! if you agree show some love ...	44
0	not taking this airlines again . was told here was a delay , but upon arrival was here was a 2.5 hour delay . this was known days ahead , but notification not provided until after check in . it would have been nice to have been advised before then ... as the delay ( construction at sf ) was/has already been going on . so in summary.. not disappointed in the delay ( this happens and i understand that ) , it was just the lack of communication .	1623
1	i have truly never felt more physically or mentally healthier since going to esos lifestyle center . i look fantastic & my depression is gone ! best decision i 've ever made ! sam , the owner is incredibly intelligent and has the best knowledge of the anatomy & physiology of the human body . thank you esos	3206
0	wow , location is horrible ! ! ! scary dungeon at night- so far from mccarran car rental shuttle - out in a dusty desert field.super long wait times - antiquated check in . do n't forget your insurance card ! the one star was for the actual car , which was fine . totally not worth the few dollars you save by not renting from a company actually at the mccarran rental car station- which would be a much cleaner faster and easier experience ! ! ! ! !	3576
1	the service here is excellent . they are very helpful and reasonable . they do n't try to sell you services you do n't need . i 've had 2 vehicles inspected and serviced here , both honda 's and the service here is much better than the dealership across the street . i will continue to take my vehicles here for anything needed .	2260
1	i have a review of one star at a different kfc location ( the one on 10000 block of west charleston ) but this location had the freshest tastiest chicken i have ever had . service was timely and courteous . i would drive out of my way for this location rather than go to the one in my neighborhood ( summerlin ) . kudos to the management )	1517
1	it 's alright . a convenient place to grab sushi before heading down to the lake or the garden which is located nearby .	41
0	not worth the money . dirty , equipment falling apart , just run down . you would think with the amount of money you pay , it would be clean and they would replace old equipment and fix the leaking roof . spend your money at another gym .	1620
1	this place is such a great breakfast option ! i had their french toast which came piled with fruit and a cup of fresh squeezed orange juice . the decor is very modern and features a spiral staircase leading to the upstairs seating . they have a huge menu ranging from just about every breakfast option you can think of . definitely a great place to stop in before a day of sightseeing in montreal .	243
1	i just found this store . if you are in need of costume jewelry , this is the place to check first . great selection . this is not very high end jewelry , so if you are on a budget it 's worth a look . why the manager would n't let me take a photo to post on facebook is a mystery . why pass up free advertising ? ? anyway , take a look .	3839
0	hire new security ! light skinned guy ( who i 'm not even sure was sober enough to be security ) was a little in his feelings and i guess had a bad night , decided to be rude for not reason to our party . mind you , i was with a group of super bowl champions , and this guy left a terrible taste in all of our mouths . he was a complete clown . even the police told me to call and complain . .	2728
0	employees really need to straighten up . one behind the counter is flipping off a coworker who 's smoking right outside the entrance while there 's a line of customers . i believe the one who was smoking said they 're cousins but nonetheless should n't be unprofessional .	1738
1	i 've been going to this location for a few years now . it 's recently been placed under new ownership and it could n't have come at a better time . the lady that now does my nails is so much better than anyone that was here previously . all the staff is brand new and they are definitely an upgrade !	3040
0	very good location : close to downtown and near the lake . the rooms need to be renovated : furniture was chipped and stained , draws could not stay closed . no complimentary internet - not even for elite spg members . usually spg properties allow you to use computers in the lobby or in the business center , but not here .	1859
1	this car wash just raised its rates 67 % to $ 5 . but they left the big 3 on their sign to deceive customers into thinking it was still $ 3 . the big 3 now stands for 3 minutes . we will be going elsewhere from now on .	3785
1	i think ive found my new favorite nail salon ! ! everybidu here is super sweet.. very patient and they actually listen ! ! ! ! i live in goodyear but work closer to mesa . i wanted to just relax a little before hitting the traffic back home and omg was i blown away ! ! prices are so reasonable and the work here is amazing ! ! ! i will honestly be coming back here from now on ! ! ! kevin is the best ! ! !	1783
1	another social sunday stop . popped in and got a couple pizzas to go . there was a line that moved quickly . we both opted for making our own pizza . i got pesto , pepperoni , mushrooms and olives . hubbs got marinara , pepperoni and sausage . both pizzas were good and not soggy , even after the long ride home . mine was salty but it was my own fault . i was n't thinking . the mushrooms were marinated , that plus the kalamata olives really put it over the top salty . it was still good just a little much . 800 degrees is a good deal even without the discount .	282
1	i 'm usually not very 'adventurous ' in my meals . but i 'll eat anything they make . the chicken tiki masala is the best i 've ever had .	640
0	if you like to spend 20 minutes between your order and when you get your drinks , and you really mean lukewarm when you mean hot , and you do n't really care about how they taste , then this place is perfect for you ! i would give it one star if they did n't have the tiramisu crepe cake , but if you find yourself here by mistake this is the one saving grace . great atmosphere though , perfect for the 20 minutes you will waste waiting with popcorn to watch your own sanity slip away .	344
1	great food and great service . my boyfriend and i had the pleasure of having austin as our server . he was so funny and personable . he is definitely an huge benefit to this restaurant . thank you , austin .	705
1	i needed a car on a saturday and did n't realize they close at 1 pm on saturdays , so i got there a few minutes before closing . the agent stayed late to help me out , which i really appreciated . no problem with the rental and return .	2371
0	quoted $ 153 and change to get my gear shift changed and mind you the part cost $ 12.99 , so $ 140 included labor . they open at 8a and i got here at 8:16a . it 's now 12:08p and the technician bret ca n't remember how to put it back together . wtf ! ! no one bothered to say anything or give me an update on the progress , until i asked at 11:05a . so on top of the $ 153 , i am having to use several hours of pto ! it 's now 12:10p and no car . maybe i 'll go play them the same 30 min youtube video i watched .	1957
1	been a member at this location for over 2years . today was specially extraordinary . her name is jenny ... and she 's awesome . think i grew a couple of inches . she was fantastic . the pain in my lower , sciatic nerve is gone . she used some special natural oils and i feel great . thank you jenny ! ! ! and as always , the rest of the staff is very professional . bought the new scented candle `` mistletoe kisses '' and it 's so christmasssy ! ! ! !	1950
1	this place is great ! was hesitant ordering from here and not a lowes or home depot but decided since the prices were better and staff was friendly . jay and brett have excellent customer service ! jay was really patient with me and all my questions and helped me figure out the exact things i needed for our project . i would say some items took a bit longer then they were supposed to but everything came in finally and correctly . anytime we need anything like this i will make sure to give this place my business !	1548
1	the best walgreens on rainbow blvd . the staff are knowledgable friendly & down to earth hospitable management is caring & will handle all customer service needs that come there way . ca n't say enough great things . to mention a few names . dara , camie , tanya , jackie , seth , melissa , karen . so many more that i have left out & i 'm sorry . kudos guys for being the best part of my day every-time i come in ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	3937
0	came on a saturday night for a friend 's birthday , definitely not what i expected . there was no cover fee , the place is really small - no dance floor . the music does not include top 40 , had to ask the dj to play some hip-hop . mainly light rock or metal . expected a lot better . 2/5	2237
1	this store was pretty good envoy helped me out . i had a check engine when i came by just for a code pull . we had his tech take a look . it was `` off '' when we looked at it i had envoy help me recheck it and i found out what the problem was i had a p0320 so i figured it out . his service was great he 's a very focused gentleman . i 'm on vacation for the weekend from la so i 'm glad he could help . thanks good on you bro	1778
0	i really wanted to give this one star , but dr. gorman was fantastic . everything else from service to follow up was terrible after . go there for the script , do n't bother ordering anything from them , you 're better off going to costco .	403
1	good mall for walking . there is a costco , movie theater and decent food court	2815
0	having eaten at the nyc bareburger i expected similar goodness . uh uh . i ordered some type of game meat that had no distinction whatsoever from ordinary beef . this was an expenisve very boring and tasteless meal with very ordinary fries . expensive and dull , perfect for toronto .	1417
0	upon entering this store , i found this place to be very cluttered and disorganized . the staff here is lacks knowledge but overall is friendly . however ? i could not give this place two stars due to the fact that they refused to sell me an item that i know is completely legal . i could basically buy anything in that store but one item . i find that this place could really could do better if the prices were a lot more competitive unlike the ad that is placed outside of sahara that everything states that everything is 30 percent off and that the employees should be current with nevada law .	2927
1	the only reason they got 4 stars is because of their 3d . the theater is very nice , and the seats are nice ( more comfortable than harkins in fact ) . in all fairness i am comparing their 3d to imax 's 3d . i saw the hobbit in imax real 3d and it blew us away . seeing oz in real 3d was not the same , and the 3d was not as good . for non 3d movies i would probably choose amc now over harkins due to the comfortable seating . as with any movie theater the prices were insane . $ 4.75 for a bottle of dasani ? ? ?	2406
1	i order taxi 's for various out of town consultants . typically they arrive within 15min and its cost effective . it works for our company .	3142
1	this was my first time trying poke and i decided to order the ninja and was not disappointed . the salmon was fresh and delicious and i was pleasantly surprised by the variety of toppings they offered . i was also happy to find out that they had a liquour licence and served asahi beer . nothing like poke and an ice cold asahi on a hot summer day . the staff were friendly and professional which is n't always the case in korea town ... i will definitely be back for more !	309
0	fun , tasty cakes and awful customer service ! stay in school kids ! we would n't go back if they were giving the cakes away for free !	18
1	i love this store because it has plenty of deals and things you will be happy to find , but it 's clean . i spent a lot of time in here and found some amazing items at fantastic prices . the only reason i did n't give them a 5 is because they do n't have any carts . it 's to their own detriment because people would buy more if they had carts . there 's more than sufficient parking and they always seem to have plenty of sales off their already amazing prices . the staff is also very kind .	3276
1	this place is okay . it 's pretty straightforward they close one day a week . i can walk in other days without any issues . there is going to be some wait on the weekends . saima is the girl who does eyebrows and is quite an expert at it . she is very quiet and an introvert . i do n't think that is being discourteous . they started with $ 7 eyebrow then went on to $ 9 and now back to $ 8 , cos of competition across the street . but at least it 's getting my work done and unlike other places where i have to make multiple calls to finalize an appointment .	1383
0	the women running the business is a very scary-looking and rude woman . she does n't even have nice teeth herself . the office was n't very professional looking at all and my teeth did n't even look much whiter after the procedure ( maybe 4 shades ? ) . groupon holders beware there are way better ways of getting whiter teeth for $ 100	2909
1	my spouse and i come here for our scions maintenance - very happy with such great service and the toyota warranty . i wish i came here and gotten my car from toyota instead of jeep . out of all dealerships - this dealership never made feel pressured with a kind `` here is my car , call me when you made your decision . '' i love my jeep but the customer service sucks at jeep miller . only if i could of forsee the future -- i would of purchased the rav 4 . keep up the good work guys !	307
1	pretty impressive they came through with 2 dozen pink and white cupcakes on late notice . everyone at the party loved our treats and im glad we had such a good experience . now i would recommend some sort of bulk discount because 2 dozen cupcakes to the time of $ 85 bucks is a little stretch , talk about the spoiled kids i have..	2024
0	a reply to their comment . he did not refuse to do surgery , in fact im a perfect candidate for this surgery . try actually reading my whole review before spewing stuff that does n't matter . such as addressing how rude he is . or how he wanted to do a procedure that was dangerous to my health . obviously he used to be good but that no longer seems to be the case .	557
0	i love museums . very disappointed in this one . expensive for the value of the exhibits . the bulk of the exhibits are photographs and digital displays . coat check is unsupervised - which i 'm accustomed to in some museums - and of all the lockers there are only two that work .	3847
0	horrible experience as a long-term spg traveler . one of the guest experience associates , refuse service for me 15 minutes before the end of the night . complete laziness and lack of personal attention.the front desk , while apologetic , did not do anything to help me . very unfortunate .	1690
0	sold me a car with damage to the a/c condenser . it was filled and sold . thanks again asshole .	2244
1	the service is good . very officiate and fast whether heading to the airport ( wait time 1 min or less ... or being picked up from the airport ( wait time within 5-7 mins . i gave 5 stars solely on the value with using groupon .	2531
1	quick and easy for the laser hair treatment . the office was big.. quiet.. had tvs and magazine to keep the ones waiting.. happily waiting . we did have a 630p appointment .	2631
0	i went at 230 on a monday . it was dimsum i hated every second i was there , the carts were going around but the ladies kept ignoring us and i do n't understand why . we got gar how & a spinach dumpling . after that not a single cart were go by and we sat for so long till i finally i gave up we went to pay and it was 14 $ which is soooo high for what we got ... ... i 'll never ever go back .. .. food was good though	0
1	great facility . the staff is very helpful and everything is clean . i also had a great experience with danny as a trainer . definitely recommend .	1802
1	biggest of thanks to matt at one stop wireless ! ! i called a ton of places before i came here so i could have my shattered iphone 6 screen fixed . everywhere offered me $ 150 or more & i would have to leave my phone with them for more than one week . not happening ! but at one stop wireless matt fixed my phone in one hour for half the price of those other places ! ! so grateful ! life saver	2930
1	this is a shout-out to matt & ashley at this location . they are awesome ! ! on a super cold day when it was already dark & snowing , matt completed my rental agreement , put on his coat , went outside to get my car & then drove it around so that i just had to hop in . ashley is also super nice & helpful , and was able to assist me with a larger car when i needed one . i hope corporate is reading these reviews , because the madison location of enterprise is doing it correctly ! thanks matt & ashley !	2345
0	great place really helpful techs ! ! however the younger girl who answered the phone was completely rude ! ! im a customer service manager my self and i get it answering the phone isnt fun , but dont make the person on the other end feel stupid for calling especially since i was calling to ask about adding another $ 200 in upgrades . i think i will just do them my self now .	3058
0	by far the worst customer service i have ever had to deal with . i have been a member of gold 's , la , and pure fitness . all were easy to deal with and simple to cancel . i have been trying to cancel my personal training for 2 and a half months with no luck and more charges . do your self a favor and save the headache , do n't sign up for personal training here ... i 'm not sure how canceling your regular membership is but i suspect it 's the same.. the gym itself is just a gym , smaller than most but it gets your workout done .	3298
0	i 'm very disappointed ! their yogurt does n't taste as good . not as creamy and flavorful as it used to be . i do n't know what changed but hopefully they fix it !	885
1	friendly staff , and rare movies make this theater a rare gem in the valley !	2450
0	i ordered through ubereats and was extremely disappointed . the perogies did n't even have potatoes in them , it was like a glue-like substance inside that had a slight potato flavouring . they pride themselves on the quality but nothing i ordered was good . everything was tasteless and it seems like they cut corners when it comes to quality . this place is extremely over-priced for the horrible food it produces . i was excited to have another gluten-free and vegan option near me but i was mistaken . do not order from here !	278
0	this is by far the worst pp health care center i 've been to . had an appt and still had to wait almost 1h to be seen . then i found out , almost a week later , that my prescription was never faxed to the pharmacy . when discussing the issue with the clinic 's supervisor , who refused to issue me a refund for the amount i paid for the appt in order to get the prescription , she stated that was only a `` minor mistake '' .	2334
1	we came here after other provider turned us down . the service was super quick , staffs went above and beyond to serve us , even got our windshield fixed . thank you guys , well earned 5 stars .	2544
1	our ac stopped working , so we gave polar air a call . they were able to schedule us for an appointment that same day and even called us back to send someone earlier than scheduled . memo is an incredible service technician ! he quickly diagnosed the problem , explained everything , answered my questions , and was very honest and straightforward . memo was friendly and professional and our experience with him was exceptional . we highly recommend polar air !	1564
0	3 stars for the hotel -1 because it does n't live up to a sheraton standard ... this is an old run down sheraton . still a nice place to stay , but it needs an update . nice pool btw ...	3166
0	these guys were great about a year or so back but now they seem to have had some front desk changes . i came in for a rotation and was told they cant rotate my tires as they were legally bald . i took it to not one but two other discount tire stores who said the tread was about 5 and that not only could they be rotated but they were good for another 7-10k miles . i 've lost trust in this place and will go back to discount for tires from now on .	3405
0	the service is great but the food is horrible ! ! ! our fish fry came out burnt . the cheeseburger we ordered medium . first it came out burnt . the second time it came out bloody . do n't recommend this cook	1253
0	i 've only been to a few advance screenings here , but i do n't really like the theater . i usually go to regal on rea rd . phillips place is an old theater that regal bought and upgraded . although they installed stadium seating , there still is n't enough room between the seats for me ( 6 ' 4 '' ) and the chairs are not comfortable . the parking can be bad too . it 's not worth $ 10 to see a movie here .	3680
1	saw this show twice now but 6 years apart from each time . the acts have been up'ed their game and the performance is much more entertaining now . they keep their material `` fresh '' ! not a bad seat in the house given how they set up the tables ! ! ! this place does scream of bachelorettes- there must have been 30 of them there when we went so if you are trying to get on stage , know that you need to set yourself apart somehow- dress your best and if u are going with a bachelorette and want her to get on stage , shout , point and put a veil or something on her to stand out in the crowd .	2149
0	worst place ever ! i was worried sick about my dog and i heard so many good things but when i walked in the place was empty and they could n't help us at all . stay away from this place . i recommend desert view animal hospital is a much better fit	2009
0	went here looking for business attire for an interview my daughter had . there does n't seem a rhyme or reason to the way this particular store is laid out . the worst was they gave my daughter two right shoes . perhaps she should have looked but did n't . when we got home she realized she had two right shoes . the cashier had checked the shoes at the register but missed it as well . the only reason i 'm giving two stars is because they stayed until we got back to exchange the shoes .	1608
0	we recently bought a house in peoria and hired gary/plumbnow to remove a walk-in tub and replace with a normal bathtub . the replacement tub he installed has cracked in a number of areas and we attempted to contact gary to make repairs . he quickly blocked our phone numbers and we now need to find a new plumber to make things right . overall an incredibly unprofessional , awful experience . i would give zero stars if possible .	1721
1	great el camino burger . split that and an order of garlic wings with my girlfriend and still had leftovers to take home . we also had onion rings that came out nice and hot with some good sauce for dipping . add a couple raspberry ices teas and our bill came out to $ 43 . no bad .	1487
0	i booked appointment through yelp and decided to buy a series of blow outs . made appointment at salon for 2 weeks later . i show up and front ca n't figure out what happened to my appointment . had charity event that same evening . what is the use of a blow out place if they ca n't get their act together for appointments . asked for refund for the credit i have . front workers said they could n't and i have to email owner . the email address was wrong and i called twice and got 2 different email address which was all incorrect . bad business on tatum and shea .	2190
0	do n't go by what they have online . express is no lotion and the scrub is more like a quick touch on your heel . the technicians were not friendly . when i pointed out the discrepancy on their website they argued and were rude . it 's not my website . i 've always had good service but only when i 've paid more . if you get the express do n't come here .	2372
1	i got the mocha chocolate chip frape mmmm sooooo good made my day un till i got stuck in the play house lol just kidding	1220
1	started going here in college with my roommates when they had $ 5 burger tuesdays . yeah its a chain but they seem to do it right . menu has the standard fare , with noticeable twists . they recently changed the recipes for some of their apps , not for the better in my opinion , but the green beean fries are my favorite . waiters are generally really good , and their stripes card gets you free chips and salsa , as well as points for free food and desserts . vanilla bean cheesecake is a wonderful way to end your tgif dining !	1187
1	my nieces attend gaa and they could n't be happier ! the curriculum and structure seem to be well balanced and challenging , and the teachers are engaging and pleasant . i especially love the innovation gaa uses to send home messages and homework . all schools will have challenges , and it seems gaa is great at tackling issues head on and resolving any conflict . the teachers are supported greatly by the administrators and all faculty are excellent communicators with the gaa community .	2640
1	the core institute is the only orthopedic facility with which i have had any experience . i can not rave enough about my experiences there . from the office staff to dr. myerthall and his assistants , everyone is efficient , courteous and knowledgeable . wait times have never been excessive . i have been consistently treated as a person , never a number . i honestly could not ask for any better treatment ; i ca n't think of any area in which they are lacking . i will consistently recommend the core institute and dr. steven myerthall to anyone needing orthopedic surgery .	2896
0	if safety is the first thing you 're looking for . i would n't try bishop glass . mike one of the driver/owners ? likes to cut people off in traffic . i figure if they 're driving is that unsafe and messy their work is probably the same . drive safer .	1516
0	this company used to be called golba and managed my property for nearly 3 years . during this time they did things like do repairs i did not approve , bring under qualified tenants who damaged my property . they were supposed to do quarterly inspections and provide a report on the property . that happened once a year . they changed ownership so often that i did not know who to hold responsible . bottom line take a look at the reviews under golba . they are poor excuse for property management .	3512
1	i recently bought a vespa from these folk , they are so nice ! i was feeling a bit sheepish cause i was n't ready for a heavy bike yet , i kind thought i 'd feel silly all the way through.. but not at all though . the sales guy was super knowledgeable and super cool and helpful , the owner came out and said hello , there was a dog there lol . they delivered my bike for me cause i still need to get my license and that guy was super nice and helpful too , walked me through my entire bike ! thanks guys !	94
1	i second cynthia c. i live in san francisco , and i love me some pho . # 1 's pho with beef and brisket is at least as good as that of my favorite pho place in sf ; however , # 1 looks like a real restaurant ; my pho place in sf looks like a lunch counter . a great spot for cold-weather lunches .	784
1	love nordie 's , best place to buy shoes , only place i really like to buy shoes ... i am probably the most picky person when it comes to shoes because my feet are weird , one is bigger than the other and my size is in between 6 1/2 and 7 ? ? ? so what to do and where to go to buy shoes ? nordstrom 's of course . they have the best return policy , if a pair of shoes do not work out , it is highly returnable , no questions asked ! now that is what i call customer service in its finest ! ! !	1907
0	my first review of this business was 12/6/17 . now that i found a new place to go , i wanted to share the day/night experience . after many calls i settled on nail design . remember that name . i had a 10:15 appt . i was 10 mins early . the door was open and the owner was standing there welcoming me . he greeted me with good morning said my name and asked if i would like coffee , tea , soda or water ? this was my first visit . i will say no more . tnt has not been introduced to customer service . good-bye tnt ! !	2892
0	oh my . i thought this service was suppose to be an improvement over taxi cabs . i tried uber and i got a filthy 10+ year old car and a driver that barely spoke english . i felt very unsafe in this vehicle . i would never allow a family member to use this uber thing . caveat emptor	2878
0	i went here yesterday and it was nothing like the dos gringos on priest . you can tell the manager at this location is lazy and does n't really care about the location at all . there were 4 dogs on the patio barking . there were children running around with cell phones as their parents were drinking , and the service was crap . bad location . go to the one on priest .	704
0	sat for fifteen minutes in a half empty diner while two waitresses walked purposefully past us avoiding eye contact and served other tables that had arrived after us , apologizing for their ( shorter ) wait . we finally took our business elsewhere since it is apparently not needed here .	406
0	first time joining sam 's club and i had a terrible experience ! we got a good deal on the membership but the place was so disorganized ! there was product on the floor , not much variety . and the lines were so long ! barely any employees around to help . i am just sticking with costco from now on .	2469
1	great atmosphere and delicious food . service is a little slow , but the staff were a sight for sore eyes ! i would go back ! !	634
1	been my doc for over 4 yrs . staff is always very friendly and helpful . he seems pretty straightforward when it comes to telling you what 's wrong and how to fix it . other doctors sugar coat things but not him . would recommend him to others .	965
0	literally zero stars . stopped by today about 1pm to grab a coffee and the service in the drive through was extremely disgusting . the `` boy '' actually said to me `` yeah ? '' when i ordered ! i get to the window and was looked at , provided my coffee and zero salutations ! i felt i was intruding on `` their '' time ! always the same low low standards !	1008
1	we have nothing but wonderful things to say about gymboree ! ! my daughter went for over a year and i 'm getting ready to put my son in a class there too ! just trying to figure out a sitter for my daughter . the teachers a amazing !	3460
1	what a great spot for a delicious , healthy lunch and/or smoothie . unique combinations that do n't taste like every other `` healthy '' spot out there . the staff are kind and friendly . love this joint . more of a takeout place as there 's no seating ( only a stand-up area where you can eat if you 'd like ) .	9
0	i was surprised they could n't dance , mostly they ran around . the choreographing needed serous updating . their bodes were great ! ( thus , the 2 stars ) though , i found myself bored . all the girls ( 12 ) in the wedding party felt the same , the entertainment factor was poor at best , sorry .	2149
1	the good place for shawarma . it comes wraped in warm toasted pita with all the veggies and served with a delicious tahini sauce . the hummos is ridiculously great . i use to always went there for shawarma sandwich for lunch .	275
0	noise from expressway is so loud you can not sleep . like trying to sleep at a racetrack : - ( would not recommend nor stay here again .	1190
0	awful . fatty meat , hard fries , no bread service and expensive . we got a cheeseburger that had hard parts in it and the hanger steak which was so fatty we could n't even chew most of it . disappointing .	1226
0	horrible service , unhygienic environment , and oily food . they have roaches that climb out of nowhere and when you scream , they try to act like they do n't understand the word `` roach '' ! ! like , really ? when a person is freaking out , that is not the time to pretend you do n't understand english . such a nasty place . they actually had to rebuild the a portion of the restaurant because an employee set the roach bomb ( s ) off incorrectly and a fire started .	895
0	i am very disappointed with these people . do not order from them and especially not from amazon online . i ordered several lanterns and then changed my mind but they tell me they were already processed , this was less than 20 minutes later . i sent them an email saying that i changed my mind and i wanted them in a couple days after they arrived seven more arrived . i sent them an email and they said i had to pay to send them back , it would cost me as much to send them back as i paying for them . very unfair and very uncooperative .	3854
0	the new management at the gramercy from newport beach has decided residents should walk around in the 100+ degree temperatures to get to the office . instead of using door from air condition hallways.clearly your head is still in newport beach and not in las vegas where the temperatures kill people .	2151
1	i found lucas lawn care on google when i was looking at getting my front yard turned from dirt to gravel . lucas lawn care quoted us at a reasonable price for what was being done , and did it with no hassles ! they did such a good job with it , we wound up having them cut down some trees for us , which they did for very cheap and did a great job at ! they did such a great job with those jobs , i hired them to do the maintenance for the yard too ! would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good landscaping company !	2091
1	best place to be for sports events . service and the location is amazing . great staff and the choice of food are huge . delicious foods and great drinks . back and front terrace with tv screens everywhere . the decor is beautiful . good for groups and co-workers .	574
1	i would have written a review back in early 2007 if i have discovered yelp sooner but hey better late than never ! : ) i was fully entertained . the casts can really sing . i give it a four stars since the 3 women next to me was damn loud clapping and singing along to the song . agh ! anyway , i truly enjoyed the whole musical . i just ca n't understand why the 1 and 2 stars given by some . too bad its closed now , i would love to go see it again ,	2752
0	do not go here they just butcherd my cuticles the guy did n't speak any english and the owners wife was yelling at me because i was upset with my service.. then she locked me in the place so i called the police on her and her husband.. they tryed to chase me and then locked me inside.. and i even payed her in full and she did n't even finish her job because she was yelling so loud in the place.. do not waste your time and money..lesson learned never to go to places like this ever again..	3682
0	this restaurant was just ok nothing special . appetizer for 3 pieces of shrimp tempura and veggies was $ 15 . a bit overpriced for what you get . tempura was also falling off the shrimp as if it was half breaded . also ordered orange chicken , but had to send it back because was chewy and not crunchy with on overbearing orange taste . would 've given 3 stars , but before we could even get up and leave the waitress proceeded to clear out our table reaching over us to gather dishes . i can see if the restaurant was packed , but it was not . not so friendly service .	1196
0	website says they can repair an apple nano screen . apparently they do n't and have been `` trying to get that removed from the site . '' i submitted a request this morning and provided my phone number that i would be in today . they could have called to let me know prior that they would be unable to accommodate .	3817
0	been here a few times . the service is always amazing but the food leaves a lot to be desired . i would go back just because of the location .	437
1	my family needed a new washer dryer . i did a ton of research before deciding on best buy . best buy offers free delivery , free set up of the new unit+ take away of the old ( if you mention that you were just at lowes- i do n't know why , just tell them ) . i was saving $ 100+ on that alone compared to sears and home depot . the washer and dryer was on sale ( they even have the older models , we opted for the newer ) and they price match . the staff were friendly and attentive . they knew their stuff , were patient with my family and got us in and out quick .	494
1	nothing like those fresh cookies upon arrival . we stopped over for one night on our way to dc . hotel was clean and staff friendly . pool was half indoor , half outdoor , which kids loved . bathroom in room was a little small/tight but overall we were very happy with our stay .	1741
1	i live close by to the location . i 've have gotten close with the staff fast . it 's always nice to come in and get greeted by your first name .	2843
1	great chicken ! great pizza ! this place is just great at quick and easy service . wish i knew abiut it when i moved to north hill . worth every inexpensive cent , for a meal worth more	1416
0	wtf this must be a target that the target headquarters forgot about . when you walk in it look like you 're in a kmart in the early 90 's , that 's bad btw . it has a strange smell and the employees must not realize they work in customer service bc asking anyone for help was awkward . i could i was annoying them . i will drive out of the way to avoid this target .	2859
0	party of 12 , orders wrong 5 times . sent back and uncooked . staff was apologetic but lost our business very quickly as we decided to move our group to a new venue . cool atmosphere for a beer , food is overpriced and tastes microwaved .	2732
1	everything fresh . best pizza in town come and give it a try you wo n't regret it . we visited this place twice while vacation in vegas . tasty , clean , great stuff . recommended for people who loves pizza .	282
0	this review is for my wife . what the hell happened to billy ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	2057
0	was just completely ignored for fifteen minutes at the men 's sunglasses case . not impressed . i 'll go someplace else with my impulse shopping .	1907
0	terrible service ! ! do n't use zippy shell ! ! no communication , no follow up , no resolution ! ! they really do n't care about the customer at all ! ! they pack what they want , even when you tell them not to pack something and leave things behind that go with what they 've already packed ! ! one big joke ! ! i 've been dealing this whole situation for 2 months now and i still do n't have my pods ! ! please whatever you do , do n't use this company ! !	1613
1	me and my girls had a great time on the tour ! /the clubs were ok ... hyde was the best of the three but we had much more fun on the bus . there was an open bar and lots of entertainment from guido torpedo . awesome host ! ! highly recommended tour .	2122
0	nakia was so sweet and nice during my first appointments , then she changed . nakia has the basic foundation for doing hair and may become better under mozell 's mentoring . the one thing you ca n't teach is professionalism , honesty and integrity . this is where nakia is sorely lacking . she handles her client concerns with a great lack of professionalism , maturity and respect . you would think as a new stylist to arizona and a professed number of years in this business and her professed beliefs , that her client communication and consideration would reflect much better . most unfortunate but ... i can not recommend her services .	82
1	the joint chiro in paradise valley is my regular spot . taylor the chiropractor gave me one of the best adjustments i have ever had and will go to him regularly .	3186
0	fuck this store . rude ass people . always some issues with this store . customer service sucks . people do n't know their own store policies and then the fucking self checkout machines charge you for shit you did n't even purchase . fuck this store .	583
1	came here with a friend on a wednesday , i have been here many times for lunch but i have to say the wednesday spaghetti was a great choice . excellent value super flavorful and absolutely worth the stop in . very friendly staff and inviting atmosphere , the patio was n't open which was a bummer but i absolutley advise stopping in with family friends or for lunch .	102
0	mediocre cake too much icing cracked uneven ... nice over the phone not so welcoming at pick up ... . it was not worth the price paid	782
0	jankiest full set of my life . all i wanted were short , natural looking acrylics ( i 'm a nail biter ) . my acrylics are about 1/4 inch thick and completely misshapen . i had to go home and file them myself because one hand the nails were longer than the other and the shape was horrid . one side was rounded while the other was square . i kept pointing it out and the girl would `` fix '' them but the shape was still awful . i will never ever return . i ca n't wait until i need a fill so i can go somewhere else and have them fixed . awful !	527
0	i called and had a great conversation about cool sculpting . i had decided to use a coupon that was extended to me so i called back and was really discouraged in getting cool sculpting . i was pretty bummed to say the least . two completely different points of view and conversations about the same subject . sad	1349
0	great furniture but absolutely horrid customer service . bought a living room set there . chatty sales person made several errors since she was talking and typing at the same time while she put in the the order . first wrong delivery address then attempted delivery way outside the delivery window . every time i call i 'm on hold forever with their contact center . sometimes those calls end in a hang up and sometimes they flip to the store in glendale which is no help . called the scottsdale store directly to speak to the manager who apparently does n't return phone calls . dont go here .	3738
0	randomly closed 45 minutes before posted hours indicate . sole employee watched me pull in , puzzled , and circle around the lot and decided to duck back inside the dark office . first - and last - attempt to patronize this business .	3819
0	crooks , angela had me go in on my day off in hope of getting rid of my car but that was a lie all these guys lie , told me i would get a free tank of gas for me going in but its all a lie dont believe anything these guys tell you there just shameless sales guys trying to make some money off you . hate this place for life for lying to me i hate liars	2754
0	this is without a doubt the worst car repair location in akron . i took my car in to get the tires balanced and rotated . they called me 2 hours later and told me i needed $ 1,500.00 of repairs none of which had anything to do with the tires . this was on a car with only 48,000 total miles and has been well cared for . took the car to another shop and they said none of the items they recommend where bad . they were so mad i did not have the repairs done they refused to balance the tires . stay clear of this place .	1055
1	we get take out from this place quite often and let me tell you , it 's so delicious ! great peanut chicken and peanut tofu , it 's cest bon ! ! the dumplings are some of the best i 've ever had . delicious delicious highly recommend .	649
0	i have been here twice , both at night time around 6-7 pm . the workers yelled and joked around with each other loudly in chinese . that 's fine . what 's not ok is i hear a lot of chinese profanity . i know that perhaps many could not understand those words , but chinese customers do ! i felt very uncomfortable and i suspect this is just their work culture . those shouting workers were front line at the food section and bakery , not in the back .	2069
1	makers & finders newest location is the perfect spot to grab a warm beverage whether you 're in line for santa photos or enjoying downtown summerlin 's nightly christmas parade . i love the mexican spice latte , but i 'll try to switch it up with the coconut turmeric soon . coffee may be the star , but the latin-influenced food menu is creative and unique . i 'm not usually a fan of caesar salad , but i crave m & f 's version made with kale .	1332
1	i love going to this place because i get to interact with animals ! it was pretty busy but the staff helped us out and were very nice !	1894
1	my family and i have been coming here since i was a kid . we get our rice , produce , and seasonings here . the staff is friendly and treat you like family .	2652
0	: (	74
1	great drinks , good service , baristas are kind and fair . wish they had more vegan offerings , but that is the only piece of critical feedback i can offer . beautiful cafe space .	2163
0	the plain tart is never working and tonight i got blackberries that were turned sour . better find another location .	885
1	one of my all time favorite hakka chinese restaurants . almost everything here taste amazing . some of my favourites are the seafood soup , chilli chicken , chilli shrimp , any of the manchurian dishes and fried rice , pakoras , wings , fried banana dessert and singapore noodles . * i would recommend dining in store rather than takeout only because the food is more fresh and you get large portions .	522
0	below average in most ways service quick food not fresh or quality - below average throughout wonton soup bad large room dimsum lunch may be slightly better than normal dinner items but i doubt its much better	0
1	i 've been a customer for over a decade and i love all the products , the cuts are always original and help me maintain my long look .	2156
1	this place was really good i got the waffles with strawberry and whip cream , scrambled eggs , sausage and kiwi drink . everything was so good no complaints . my husband got the waffles with chicken really good the strips were fresh and crispy taste really good . he got the strawberry lemonade drink bomb.com . overall really great food service was really good going back .	580
1	excellent pie . i had the sausage & peppers ; top notch . high quality toppings , chewy crust , super fast . my only disappointment was being charged $ 4.00 for a soda . pizza is reasonably priced . i 'd come back .	282
1	great hotel ! ! everyone was very helpful and friendly . i recommend this hotel in tempe az to anyone who wants a clean and safe hotel .	2283
1	wonderful place ! i ca n't wait to go back ! ! room was great , room service was awesome , view from the room was stunning .	2866
1	i like yogurt ! yoforia is cool . it 's in the epicenter . the best thing about it is the location . you can grab yogurt and sit inside or outside and people watch . it seems to be in the center of everything . the yogurt is also good . i had chocolate with more chocolate . you can never go wrong with that ! typical yogurt procedure . place yogurt on the scale and get charged more than you expected . the staff was nice . good seating . the place was clean , which was impressive for the amount of traffic they receive . i 'll be back .	1184
0	where do i begin , the woman who did my nails was less than delightful , terrible service , was made wait a half hour after the time i was scheduled , extremely rushed once i sat down and as a result my nails are all different shapes . to top it off , i was told my nails were completely dry and ready to go and they were n't , not even close . i 've been getting my nails done for at least 10 years now and i 've never had an experience so bad . the service was so terrible that i will be going to a different place first thing in the morning . i do not recommend this place to anyone !	655
0	two stars today , only because the do n't allow half-stars . i tried the new blt+a sandwich as part of a 'choose 2 ' combination . the salad portion of my combination was better than my expectations for this location , but the sandwich was , to put it mildly , a hot mess . imagine several strips of bacon stacked haphazardly on half of a thin slice of bread . add avocado , tomato , and lettuce . cover with a second half slice of bread and then squash the result . a nice idea for a sandwich but d- for the execution . never again	484
1	randomly landed here twice through yelp while on travel and enjoyed a quick nice meal ... a whole in the wall place that 's clean and offers good service . the afghan tikka on a snowy in calgary night was too good and so was the wednesday special haleem . i am coming back here for sure . give them a try !	1303
1	highly highly recommend ! first class everything . great , charming chic city hotel conveniently located to everywhere you want to be in the heart of the city . the event staff is superb , the spaces they 've created around the hotel for meetings , relaxing , dining are superb . i always look forward to coming back and bringing my friends from out of town , even just for drinks . just what our city needs ! : )	3859
1	i lived year for a few years a while back . i lived in the caseiana model with a garage . i absolutely loved the open floor plan . anytime we had a maintenance issue ( not often ) they were there right away . after our lease is up at veer towers we are actually thinking of moving back here . the pool is beautiful too . overall a great experience here !	2832
1	justin , the pharmacy manager , is far out . very dude , man . he gets it . there 's a lof of ins , a lot of outs , a lot of what-have-yous in the pharmacy business , but he abides . he helps out the little guy , those in need of a coupon or savings for their special medications . a worthy face of the walgreen empire .	1641
0	not sure about this place , the autotrader website listed them as a place to sell cars the used car dealer was a jerk , pulled a carfax and said there was a odometer issue when i asked to see it he just walked away , got home reviewed the report and it said right next to the entry clerical error , it was corrected ... . lots of cars on the lot no customers ... if you do n't have the money to buy the car just say so	855
0	awful . dr. brown was very cold and impersonal . she had a complete stranger ( another doctor i had never even seen ) that i was going to miscarry . the worst experience in my entire life .	2643
1	i am a new patient that just finished my wellness exam with dr wolfson . dr wolfson is a soft spoken caring doctor that you would keep as your doctor for years to come , and i would recommend him to everyone.his office staff is very courteous and professional .	3321
1	the large selection of overweight adults and chubby children as customers tells you how good the gelato is . excellent selection of flavors . service is super slow though .	164
0	its probably best to find another gym . some staff members are using drugs while handling the kids and the owners kids are just free do do whatever . there is a blind eye to the truth masked with more ideas and projects to the gym . consumer beware ! there is a lot of stuff going on and its best to find a gym that is up to par and not cutting corners.. many people like the gym but you guys are just all over the place . its not safe there and unprofessional . this gym could be great , just the wrong people are running it unfortunately . if your a laid back parent then go for it but keep a close eye .	2750
0	went to dine in with my wife on 8/30/17 . we told the cashier we will take a seat so that we can look at the menu and decide the items to order . my husband went to the counter to place the order . they told us they will come to our table to take the order . when they came to take the order they said sorry this table is reserved for someone . they wasted our time and money . we took a uber to go to their restaurant . really disappointed with their service . if a seat is reserved put a reserved sign on the table , do n't waste people 's time and money ! !	1303
0	they canceled my son 's appointment 3 times and they made no attempt to give us any options to reschedule . the office seems to not care about its patients well being .	3598
0	i have been there twice . the first time i went at 5:30 and i thought it was great . the second time i went at 9 and it was the worst of pittsburgh . the hours of operation say it is open until 10 . they had stopped reloading food by 8:30 and the sushi was actually dry and turning colors by 9 . they had broken down most of the food by 9:30 and the help was eating half of the food in order to get them out early before the buffet was closed . most items were out by 9:30 . i wanted my money back and it was disgusting . i have never seen such horrible planning .	165
1	this is one of those hidden gems that delivers amazingly delicious food , attentive service and a great wine selection . every dish from appetizers to main course to dessert was beautifully prepared . we had the best time in this relaxed bistro environment .	1160
1	this is my favorite museum . i remember going on field trips in grade 5 and loving this place and now , at 25 , i still get joy out of my visits there . there is so much to do there you could spend an entire day just looking at the exhibits . i would strongly recommend the science centre to any parents looking to educate their children in a fun way who have a bit of money to spend . the science centre can be pricey after admission prices , souvenirs and food .	2868
1	hands down the best pizza i 've had in vegas . they use fresh natural ingredients . sls is also a great location . prices are really good on the pies but they catch up on the beverages .	282
1	a truly custom experience . they installed a lift kit on my 06 4runner and did an outstanding job . had a couple hick ups with my vehicle being a little older , but they figured it out no problem . will go back for future upgrades and mod 's .	203
1	this is a relatively good ross location . they have an organized system with the line that they seem to have perfected , unlike many other ross locations . the store is typically well stocked and the employees are friendly .	10
0	if you are into people watching this is n't a bad place . well if by people i mean old ugly degenerates , it 's like a welfare convention meets a senior convention . no food , yes you can bring in food but screw it . the clientele is trash and you are too if you go here more than twice . the people really are what make this place a huge waste of space . otherwise it 'd be an okay bar . i just really ca n't stand how trashy and welfare the people are . i 'm sure there 's been more than one heroin overdose in the bathroom here .	2894
1	they seems to have store coupons every other week or something . go to their web site and print coupon $ 5 off when you spend $ 25.00 . also their eggs are cheap most the time . which are great because i 'm always baking/making things & need to buy 12 dozens or more . hehee they also have yoohoo 3pk for $ 1.00 which is pricey but it 's so hard to find it on the west coast so it 's ok i guess .	2154
1	just one visit turned me from a browser to a buyer . i could have stayed there a good while playing around with their wonderful selection of colors . got to try one of their blushes , which i ended up getting along with a lip paint and eyelashes . very impressed with oscar 's service with helping my friend find a red lipstick . so glad that they have a location here in the bay area .	3316
0	had a microdermabrasion and the student was 20 minutes late into the procedure , therefore i did not get the full treatment i paid for . arrived on time and this is the second scheduling appointment that they blamed on their computer error .	1701
0	i hired for some office furniture projects , they came , took cash , said they could help with future projects and never responded . no receipt , nothing , then i find out they broke the cubicle they were supposed to partially dissemble ... . broke it to the point the entire cubicle system no longer has electricity which costs thousands of dollars ! ! ! worst mistake ever was hiring this 'company ' for a simple job	917
0	worst care ever ! 1 . front office / scheduling is severely understaffed . insanely long hold times , available appointments are too far in the future ( no such thing as immediate care ) . 2 . follow up is ridiculous . doctors work in slow motion and results take far too long . i would never , ever recommend this place to anyone . complain to your insurance to find abetted alternative .	2176
0	air hoses to dry vehicles have had the pressure significantly reduced in the past week or so . so much that it takes 3 times as long to spray the water off . please put the air hose pressure back to where it was before . is it really saving money reducing that pressure ? towels have been running out often in the afternoons . is someone not manning the washing of the towels , or is there a sudden shortage of them ? please be sure to have the top roller brush resume after setting it to not go on during a particular vehicle . it is nice to get what one pays for . thanks .	2939
0	i ordered the omg salad with gyro meat and a drink my bill was $ 15 plus change . after i was done they asked me if i liked it i said no and i could only find two olives in my salad he told me they put two olives on the large salad and one olive on the small salad . the gyro meat was dry and too much dressing on salad i did not eat most of it . i would have expected more for that price . this is not a sit down restaurant you go to counter to order . the man told me i should have gotten the ceaser salad it is good .	875
1	the food here was really tasty - i had the shrimp and crab tortellini . however , the service was super slow .	423
0	i think this place has closed . no cars there for the last few days and their phone number does n't seem to work anymore .	1330
0	i have to workout about an hour before closing to avoid the night club social scene . this gym is slowly turning into a place to socialize and pick-up , using the weight machines as chairs to chat and text . they seriously need to build a lounge for these people and let the people that take their training seriously do their thing . front desk employees do n't greet anymore . i 'm only giving 2 stars for the personal training area that is the only place in the gym that is n't over crowded or has people sitting around . looking forward to the new mountain side fitness in queen creek to come .	3912
1	no doubt the best thai food i have had in charlotte . the staff is super friendly and the service is great .	50
0	this place has gone right down hill . you wait up to 15 mins to be served by disinterested bar staff who rarely bother to return to your table . i would not recommend sharkes now	3397
0	what can i say ? worst service ever . waited over an hr and a half for service , the guy in the front was very rude when we asked for an update , and then food took another hour , food tasted good but the overall evening left a sour taste in my mouth . never coming back .	440
0	hey jill , that 's awesome that your sales person notated that they called me but they did not in fact call . so is your point here to convince myself or someone else reading this review that we should be your customers by calling me a liar ?	2210
0	they deceive you & lie to you to make the `` sale . '' mike stated that one of my certificates expired and in order for me to make it active again i needed to put a deposit of $ 200 . what he did n't tell me was that he was really trying to make a sale . i 've been conned twice from them . last year and just recently . do n't do it or you 'll make the biggest mistake of your life . my mistakes is your gain and i hope you take my advice . i 'm fighting the battle to get my money back .	1777
1	i love his theater ! so comfy . they have reclining electric seats and they serve alcohol ! it 's not a full bar but good enough .	564
1	about once a week me and some friends order to go from here ! they always have the pj 's famous hamburger & fries and i usually have a grill cheese & creamy tomato soup ! such a fabulous idea , for them to deliver in forum shops and caesars palace ! if you 're in town , stop by , if you 're a local , this is the place to be for your treats ! also their happy hour with $ 1 oysters is the best in town ! enjoy !	1538
0	stopped by after work to buy my brother a bottle of rum for his birthday . should have been a fairly uneventful transaction except when i pulled out my credit card to pay was asked if i had cash or could pay debit . i did n't have enough cash on me and do n't own a debit card . now instead of being able to checked out i had to listen to a lecture about how minotti 's was losing money if they accepted my credit card and blah , blah , blah . then put a sign in the window that says no credit card purchases but do n't waste my time because you are clueless how to run a business .	256
0	not coming back again for sure ! it felt like we redeemed a free massage coupon with the service we received tonight unlike before ... my masseur basically rub my body , using his phone and coughing , and talking to the other masseur laughing and the other guy keeps on burping ! ! what a shame for your regular client . i used to love this place . maybe they are under a new management ? ? ? ?	735

1	i love this store . the employees are friendly and very helpful on finding me clothes that fit and make me look good . i went in wanting to buy just pjs and walked out spending over $ 100 . that 's good salesmanship if you ask me : ) i wish it was closer to my house be definitely worth the drive .	47
0	i really like road runner ; but not this location . no one would even talk to me . i went in with the intention to buy a new set of custom insoles and two pair of sneakers . but i waited around , tried to get some assistance , and nothing . the only person to acknowledge my presence was another customer . i do n't plan to ever visit this particular store again .	2557
