1	oh my gosh.. bombbbbbbbb ! ! ! this place is so amazing ! ! the food is incredible ! i have had almost everything on the menu . they have milk shake happy hour every day between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. with half price milkshakes . the first time you go in , tell them its your first time and they will give you a sample of all of their different sauces . my two favorite are sweet heat and creamy garlic . the staff is incredibly friendly and personable . the restaurant is clean and the hand washing station is pretty neat . go check it out you will not be disappointed !	998
0	read up on shabu if you are n't familiar with it . it helps to have an idea . went here for my birthday . my friends thought we would try something different . it was nice to change it up . i 'm not an expert so i ca n't honestly say how this place compares to other shabu restaurants . i can only say that it is n't a place that i would frequent . the service was excellent . i 'm just not a fan of shabu , but the overall experience was a good one for my birthday .	285
0	worst mojito i have ever had , do they know what they are doing ? there was no syrup in it , it was just flat alcohol with soda , very nasty ; presentation wise , it was horrible as well . there was a shrunken leave `` hanging '' on the glass , was that supposed to be the garnish ?	1110
0	we came in on the same day as a jeep thing and everyone else was 2nd to them ! ! the bar tender was so rude and did n't even want to hear my complaint . i will never come back here and ill tell my friends to never go there ! !	1487
1	good coffee shop in the palazzo . the blended beverages had a very good flavor . average selection of baked goods and no warmer for bagels . also it was n't the fastest services ... but the convenience if you are staying at the palazzo is worth it .	2397
1	i 've had a capital one credit card for at least 20 years , and it 's one of my favorite businesses to deal with . always professional and great at sending out verification notices if they suspect fraud charges ... great company ! !	3236
0	absolutely appalling customer service . i waited almost a half as hour to exchange a tool and every one they had in stock was also broken . complete garbage . the staff seems completely uninterested in long wait and lines . i watched other customers stand and wait equally long for tools from the back warehouse . if you go , do n't be in a hurry and fully expect to return half of what you buy .	2267
1	i frequent this place about once a week when i just need a quick snack . they have lots of options to choose from and the bagels are always fresh . the staff is also super friendly : )	477
1	i 've always liked this place i think their burgers are way better than mcd . can get quite a few for around $ 4 but drunks are extra . my favorite is probably the portabella mushroom but i 've tried almost all of the different ones they offer and they are all good . chili is n't bad either . we never have any long wait here and of course they have one of the best milk shake around plus you can get them for half price during the week if you come at a certain time . i think between 1-4pm or something like that . staff here bas always been good to us and friendly . will be back again .	1068
1	let me tell you something , they make the best pho in the valley period ! feel free to order p3- '' double meat '' , great ! everything else is very good as well , and the prices are very reasonable . make sure you get there before the lunch rush otherwise be prepared to wait for a table .	205
0	would never ever recommend this place to anyone ! ! went in for pedicure and eyebrow wax and at the end of my pedicure she told me the lady who does waxing not in today ! ! should have told me before and would have gone to my regular place . know i have to go somewhere else and make an extra stop ! ! thank you for the inconvenience ! thank you for purposely taking my money first knowing what my needs were . so so unprofessional ! !	854
0	wish i could give no stars . we purchased a couch in july of 2015 . great service when purchasing , but that later changed . in february of 2016 , the frame broke in one corner and a spring popped . we called living spaces several times before even getting to talk to someone . and it took several more times to have a tech come out and evaluate the damage . the tech stated that it could be repaired . after no one called after 2 weeks , i called them . then i was told that they would not repair or replace the sofa . they said to buy a new couch . all they want is money !	2071
1	first timer , staff was awesome to work with . wait staff was perfect . family had a great time golfing . food was really good too . was nervous that it would be bar food at 9am when we went , pleasantly surprised with the breakfast selection available . kids had french toast and fruit . food was excellent . definitely be back !	1483
1	my favorite of all department stores ... ..shoe department is pretty good , especially during the anniversary sales !	1907
1	michael cordova and his law firm have helped my family in court on more than one occasion . the same level of professionalism , competence , and urgency has never left since we first hired them . they are dutiful in the areas of communication and accounting . whenever we have questions or concerns , they are answered within 24 hours . whenever we need paperwork , it is promptly signed off on and sent to the appropriate place . they remain compliant and this has benefited us in several cases . my family is very thankful ! best , bethany	3169
1	i am impressed with the professionalism of martin . he gave a five star service . he gave tips on how to maintain plumbing . he cares .	2748
0	i decided to try this place as i was on the go last sunday . what a disappointment it was for me ! the caucasian male barista/cashier was really rude and needs customer services training ! he did n't smile nor properly greeted me or the lady ahead of me ! i ordered the americano , in which he callously said `` we are out of that '' without apologizing . when i asked him what another item was on the menu and he was annoyed to have to answer my question . needless to say that i will not return to waste my money !	2219
0	the place could be more clean and staff more hospitable . the area had some smell . pizza is not great , raw at center . not returning again .	581
0	received a random email from them for a move ... the price was interesting and so i decided to call . they told me that the lady in charge was absent ( if she even exist ) and the most obnoxious little prick try to give me attitude because he could n't find my phone number to match the quote ... ... good luck with that kind of business !	3114
1	i have been here twice and both times i left feeling better than when i walked in.. staff is quick , pleasant and mostly attentive . the doctor does n't spend much time with u but , i guess that 's why it 's considered a `` quick care '' . on my second visit i did need an x-ray so it took a little bit longer which is understandable . i recommend this place to anyone in need of quick care.. locals , tourists , whatever . the fact that they are open 24 hours and take my insurance that i pay for through work.. i have no reason to go anywhere else .	2618
0	we were told this course was in great shape , then we arrive to notice after hole # 1 that the course is n't even real grass . it 's bermuda grass which is far more difficult to shoot off of . other than that it was pretty open and forgiving if you were to push one to the right or hook to the left . also very confusing to drive on the cart paths if you have never played there before . they need much better signage .	85
0	overpriced , miserable excues for a bar . 2 bud lights and 2 waters = $ 30.00 .	456
0	this place is scary and ghetto . first pulled up and the gal is pressuring about repairing a tiny crack even though my boyfriend said no then saying `` progressive is a pain in the ass anyway '' waiting in the convenient store/dmv and two employees are arguing about shifts right in front of me . then two more employees are yelling at each other and cursing loudly in the bay area . i was very uncomfortable and felt like i would be caught in the middle of a senseless fight or something . will not ever come back here again .	88
0	my parents ordered couches to be delivered to their home . upon arrival , they informed my mother that they would not move her old couches out of the way and just left two huge sofas in her living room with her two old sofas . she obviously could n't get around her house with all of the furniture and so she tried for several hours to move the couches , moving other furniture about and what not . i am so angry about this , i am shaking . how dare you not move these couches for my mother . that is your job ! they knew this was what was expected from them .	1794
0	this office is run very poorly . they never answer the phone and wo n't call you back forcing you to drive to their office to communicate with them .	1541
0	do n't come on your lunch break . took way too long . i have to go back to work and my food just came . food was messed up . disappointed . probably wo n't come back	1397
0	do n't ever use a credit or debit card here they hacked mine and a friend 's cards ! ! ! chicken fried rice is the bomb just pay with cash though it 's worth it . 0 stars for stealing my money but 5 star fried rice . 1 star customer service they suck here lol	1014
1	i have been seeing dr. torres as i get ready for my first baby . i have really enjoyed him as a doctor and have really felt like he taken his time to answer all my questions . i also met with sylvia a few times and she was also great . i gave them four stars however because several times i waited in the waiting room for close to an hour after my scheduled time . the office staff was n't always overly friendly or helpful . they often seemed very busy and acted like it was inconvenience to answer my questions .	3059
0	went in after calling and leaving message about purchasing a new arctic cat utv and no one would help me and was ignored by entire staff that was walking around talking to each other . will take my business elsewhere .	2601
0	great food ; the cod dish is phenomenal , as are the patatas bravas ( sp ? ) . service was horrible . there were 2 servers for the entire restaurant , fairly disorganized , with one server thinking the other had taken care of us . there are far too many amazing restaurants to deal with shoddy service .	1167
0	slop in a bright orange bowl . if you are craving chinese food , skip this place .	209
0	spent quite a bit for a haircut and still came out with split ends . not worth the money .	2340
1	huge selection of knives . owner and staff very knowledgeable . willing to take time to help you with your purchase . awesome store .	2927
0	this place has gone to hell ! i just paid $ 12.00 for a plate of fat and grissle , smothered in cheese . they call this carne azteca . not the first meal i 've complained about either . ever since martin left , this place is mediocre at best . we used to love their food . now we 're just happy if its edible ! i guess they think these small town gringos do n't know the difference between good food and garbage . we 'll just smother it in queso , and they 'll love it . get your shit together , and have some pride in your work .	1518
1	absolutely amazing ! ! ! ! ! the food was so delicious and we had such an amazing time ! ! the family that owns amalfi 's are such sweet and welcoming people ! ! we ca n't wait to go back the 40min drive is most definitely worth it !	768
0	old , overpriced , and hard to find . that 's all i can say about this place . skip it , ignore it , do n't waste your time ; get it on dvd in the worst case scenario !	2061
1	we arrived about 30 mins before they closed with intentions of just browsing . we ended up furnishing basically our whole new house . maria walked around with us and helped us pick out our furniture and the manager maricella hooked us up with amazing prices . she kept giving us more discounts and let us pick out accessories that did not come with the furniture sets . they were very patient with us and stayed until 11pm helping us when they closed at 9 . they were very nice and friendly and everything has been delivered on time and without damage .	1794
0	do not come here ! ! i came here to get my eyebrows done and it literally took the lady 2 minutes . i 've been growing my eyebrows out and they were finally nice . the lady just completely took my eyebrows off . now i just have two uneven lines on my face and she arched one of them ! ! i will definitely not be returning here . i hate when people rush at their jobs or just do n't care . like you 're messing up people 's appearances now i 'll have to draw my brows on everyday . i literally cried the entire way home .	3806
1	jessika checked my car in and had me on my way quickly , she had a big smile on her face and was amazingly friendly . will definitely make this my go to location in the future !	78
1	greatest experience i have ever had booking a flight . 1 ) you can still obtain frequent flyer points with your airline , which is awesome 2 ) i phone and they picked up instantly 3 ) my rate was no longer available , but they quickly found me an alternate route for the same price , within my very tight time constraints 4 ) they were able to book on the phone 5 ) i accidentally hung up , but they phoned me back twice ( i went ahead and booked online because i was worried i would lose the flight anyway ) seriously - this woman was fantastic ! !	1574
1	who 's your daddy ? ! ... love love ! ... the sushi tried every where else , nothing comes close to this place ... . food is awesome ! ...	408
1	excellent cold pilot grigio , and a very nice quinoa salad , not your usual thought , as i like lots of lettuce , and less quinoa . so it was perfect for my liking . and deliciously cold . great for a hot summer day . great for a pub style atmosphere .	480
1	i love the salmon bowl , a great choice for those who love raw salmon , and the katsu bowl is great for kids or those who are shy about asian food .	131
1	i needed to return a pair of shoes that had been worn twice . i was worried they would n't except them in exchange for something else but the manager angel was awesome to work with . he made the return and exchange very easy . his level of customer service and support speaks volumes . because of this experience i will be sure to give the az mills footlocker my business whenever i 'm in the market for a new pair of shoes . much respect for angel . give him a raise !	2348
0	i usually order a coffee from here when flying out . i switched up my routine and ordered a flat white . i was served essentially a cappuccino . i will go back to just getting coffee from this starbucks . staff was friendly , so they have that going for them .	3124
0	we used to frequent the total wine in summerlin . i always enjoyed the spectacular customer service and wonderful selection . there is a distinct difference with the new location on centennial . zero customer service . zero . in an area where there are two major liquor/wind stores within a mile radius , this is surprising . looks like we are new customers of the competitor . never again .	3199
1	my family had a christmas party this past week and the food was incredible . the amount of food that we received allowed us to have lunch for the following day . the atmosphere is inviting and our servers mary and janette were amazing . so friendly and helpful and lots of smiles . we will definitely be back again . the owner was seen walking around saying hi to people which is rare now a days . it was nice to see someone taking pride in their business . keep up the great work .	1386
0	do i even bother to give a review since your management just commented that whatever review is up here will just get taken down if it is negative ? not accountable - stay away	2682
1	i 've been here twice to this same location . the first time i was n't impressed and would probably give it three stars at the time . i came again last week and ordered the market hash ... oh my god it is the best thing ever . so so flavorful . must have ... go ... now ! anyway , they have a decent menu , something for everyone . whether you are a health nut or someone who just does not give a _____ , you will find something you like . service here is great , they can get busy but they do not neglect you . everyone is friendly . prices are fair and portions are filling .	1258
1	i use to come here a lot and it was not good service at all so i stopped coming but the last half year i have had one of the best continuos service that you can get at a bar . alex is probably one of the best bartenders you can get . only reason is 4 stars is because they switched their happy hour menu but it does not reflect on their customer service	1520
0	this place is the worst . i went around ten on saturday night and it was packed . it seems the place is intended to cater to rapey , nickelback-loving , popped-collar misogynists and the women who love them . there is no place to sit , no place to talk ( because it is loud ) and zero ambience . to its credit , though , i was served quickly ( because there were like 3000 bartenders ) and it was n't that expensive , but it would take much , much more than that for me to ever return to rape-central again .	1966
1	had my dog neutered there and not only was it a great price they took excellent care of my dog . drop off at 730 am and pick up at 330 pm .	2864
0	i would give these guys negative stars if i could . after going through a dispute over the long delayed delivery of my furniture , the owner called me and cussed me out repeatedly . do yourself a favor and find another dealer .	217
1	so good ! delicious noodle soups of different varieties . spicy dishes are actually a bit spicy . the mushroom and short rib is comfort food .	1329
1	this restaurant is clean , the service is very professional , and the food is good . i had the mango chicken and i recommend it .	1425
0	well this walgreen 's has all the stuff it needs for a pharmacy quick grab but i find that the employees at this location just do n't care . did you see that period over there , yeah this is just a job that they are here to get the pay check and that is it . i am not impressed and look forward to walgreen 's recovery at another location . i do want to mention that the pharmacy is very interactive and commutative and is a 360 from what the retail side of this store is . highly recommend the pharmacy	2871
0	i like donuts . not an expert but i definitely have had a good donut now and then . i heard about this place and anticipated that it would be great with all the fun toppings . it was n't . not really worth the drive across town . only positive thing hung are the hours ... maybe i ordered the wrong donuts or went on an off day . tasted kind of stale	2053
0	if you 're in ahwatukee , just go to the fry 's on chandler blvd instead . this fry 's has a smaller selection , is not as well-stocked and they often shut down the regular checkout lines at night , forcing you to use the self checkout lines . not fun when you 've got a full cart .	1967
1	this location does exist and is open for business ! it 's next to jersey mikes sandwich shop ! open 9-5 mon- thurs , 9-6 friday and 10-2 on saturday .	3054
0	pay for wash that has top roller , second consecutive time attendant did n't turn switch for top roller back on . getting ripped off on what i 'm paying for .	2939
1	i stopped by this hospital to do a drop in tour as a prospective employee , i did n't announce who i was when i signed in ; i was given a tour by a house supervisor who was very friendly & honest about the history of staff , building and services offered . i was impressed by the interactions i witnessed with pt . care and staff . i have been in this industry for 8 years and have worked for multiple companies and i can say promise phoenix ltac in mesa az . is very bright , friendly and attentive to pt care .	2413
1	i had a great time at this hotel while at the kraftmaid experience . only reason i did n't give 5 stars is the process for checking out was slow . when i asked for a receipt for the hold they put on my card , the girl insisted i did n't need one . then she printed out the room receipt , not the hold . bed was comfy , bathroom was n't too clean and the shower head was pointed out the shower so i got soaked just turning the shower on to heat the water .	3522
1	i prefer this location since it sometimes has a 5 minute wait . nice inside , somewhat helpful . i like verizon overall and especially now that they carry the iphone .	3179
1	awesome place to bring the kids . staff was amazing . my son ended up getting bumped and verria was so helpful and was so accommodating . i will definitely be back and recommend to friends	1095
1	the best pizza in vegas . if you like thick crust , you have to try the metro thick crust . it is amazing . the only negative with this place is the price , but sometimes you get what you pay for .	192
1	this was my first visit to a pickle barrel and i am now dreaming of when i can go back . service was impecible , food was absolutely delicious . highly recommend .	534
1	love this place ! i came in 30 min before closing and needed a pedi and full set , also my daughter wanted a mani and pedi and they took us without question , were quick , and did a wonderful job ! ivy is the best ! she made sure we were seen quickly and offered my daughter and i a drink while we were being taken care of . a great experience ! i will definitely be returning ! thank you ivy ! ! !	655
0	supposly this place closed at 10 i came at 9:48 and it is closed ... they closed earlier than they suppose to close ... yelp said they closed at 10:00 i drove to this place after work and it was closed ... i 'm so mad	721
1	after a bad experience with a different company with a very rude technician , i was very happy to have found zhora , he is the best technician i 've ever worked with , i 've been in vegas since 1997 . i wish more technicians are like him , very knowledgeable , nice and punctual and he sent me a text when he was on his way , very professional ! ! ! ask for him whenever you need appliances repair , he 's patient in explaining everything that needs to be done and his suggestions are very helpful . thanks zhora for all your help fixing my dryer ! ! !	3885
0	hands down the worst chicken wings i ( or anyone at my table ) has ever had . they were 1/4 the size of normal wings and were more breading than meat . i asked for buffalo sauce and they gave me some weird concoction i 've never tasted before . the server did n't know what was on tap and mumbled in the loud restaurant until i gave up on asking her to repeat herself . the owner/manager marched around overtly looking at us and our food which was kind of awkward .	2732
1	very nice food . complete value for money . we ordered for king pao chicken , orange chicken , veg chowmin . everything was delicious . would eat again when visit chandler .	237
0	i love steak n shake but this location lacks all the fundamentals that are practiced at the other locations . their milkshakes are soupy , the need to be trained on the breakfast menu pricing since everything is n't on the drive thru menu , and they get upset when you question then about misquoting the prices ! one time i ordered a sausage bagel and a breakfast burrito . the had the nerve to use a portion of the patty for the sandwich in the burrito ! unbelievable !	221
1	i 've been taking my 6 month old here for a couple months and although he 's still very young , vanessa , our instructor is always so positive and encouraging . she 's amazing with the children she works with and really pays attention to detail when she gives us our feedback at the end of each class . the facility is clean and the employees at the front desk are always helpful and willing to answer questions .	2521
0	what a scam . they charge you $ 30 to get in ( family of 3 ) then $ 10 a ride and then tow your car ( $ 100 ) . never coming back .	3251
0	went in for a basic wash , left with a repair bill over $ 500 . my whole experience was extremely disappointing from the front end greeters to the owner . i hate dealing with unscrupulous people and businesses .	1502
1	fun city with awesome entertainment . most of the entertainment is for adults but there 's quite a bit you can have kids do .	315
0	horrible service in this place . the lack of customer service shocks me . i have gone there a few times and land up leaving as i ca n't seem to attract service . you see workers talking in groups and just ignoring clients . very sad . this was on the men 's floor .	2979
1	fantastic sushi ! always know i am getting fresh product , great tasting , unique flavors . try the scallop heaven roll ! sashimi is very high quality . they treat their customers very good . they allow you to use the entertainment card unlimited . go there once per week and also pick-up food . they have your food ready pretty quickly . the same sushi `` creators '' behind the main bar for many years now . you know you are getting the same high quality product every visit when the same experienced people are creating your food . best sushi in north hills and could compete for best in pittsburgh .	1326
0	super friendly staff/that 2 employees only , lol , they do not have more/ but food isnt delicious the won ton soup was awful looked like vomit and tasted like that , they mixed everything into the miso base egg yolk and onion ... it was cheap but ended up in the trash therefore waste of money ... ..they were very slow and we had no time waiting for main course so we left , and in the meantime i heard their neighbor came by complaining that the water is leaking and they did not care at all ... poor guy ... lol	734
1	this will be the best deep dish you can get in madison . falbos-eh . pizza extreme-wet mess . we ordered a buffalo chicken pizza with pineapples instead of tomatoes and it was really good . they no longer offer it so we have n't found the opportunity to come back . it is a tad pricey but yummy . we need to address this very serious issue . where are the peppers ? no banana peppers . no jalepeno peppers . those two are extremely delicious and you refuse to offer them , meh i guess i 'll pick somewhere else .	705
1	for a circle k this place has it going on 2nd circle k that has impressed me . it 's close to home so i drop in for a little h2o or the occasional snack ... ..	2563
0	updated version from my prior review . the staff were very pleasant at this location . the work was not good unfortunately the gel mani lasted one day only . by day three i had not one nail intact . my cuticles were trimmed so closer that it was just painful for a week . i would n't go back to this site related to poor quality of the very simple work i had done and no have my cuticles nipped so close that they hurt with a nipper that did not come from a peel packed freaked me out .	1834
1	fuel pizza is usually decent . good drunk food . tonight i visited the college st . location sober and was pretty impressed with the quality of pie and quality of service . no over the top non-sense . just thorough delivery of solid pizza . it was around 9:50- did n't catch names . but goldberg looking fellow that brought out pizza and desserts was hauling ass . he deserves a beer or 8 .	902
1	cute cafe in the plateau . the barista was friendly & chatty . prices were on par with other independent coffee shops in montreal . i tried a turkish coffee - first time i 'd seen it on the menu in a montreal cafe . it was served in a cute cup . i wanted to try their simit but it looked more like a bagel & i had already started the morning with one at st viateur on my walk over . the coffee shop gets pretty busy & the tables are very close together ; it was sometimes hard to focus on my conversation over the noise . i liked the mural outside too .	1144
0	it 's one of two korean grocery stores in las vegas . i can find some stuff only at this store and that is the only reason i go . it 's a bit of a commute , it 's pricey , selection is n't that large and customer service is not a priority . - customer service - 2/5 - product selection - 2/5 - price - 2/5 ( pricey ) $ $ - fresh fish - 3/5 - produce 2/5 ( korean specific produce at times but not always ) - readymade food - 2.5/5 ( hot ) - always keep an eye out for the expiration date !	715
0	i agree with you nisha d. for the past year or so the service has been horrible . i 've only had 2 experiences that were considered ok . the management ca n't seem to handle the staff they hire , the girls are blatantly rude and abrasive with customers . do n't ask questions about the products because you will be ignored . we should boycott the store , there 's no reason to give money to people who ca n't train their staff or discipline them after a complaint is being made . you walk into the store in a happy mood and leave feeling shattered by the rudeness and the lack of customer service training .	2739
1	always friendly . always clean . neighborly . parking never a problem . nice people . good feel .	1072
0	place has shutdown . went today for my normal monthly haircut and place is dark . shame had a great barber in mark who i have been going to for a couple of years .	2136
1	one of the friendliest crew of mechanics i have ever met . it 's hard to just compliment one person when the whole staff was charming ! you ca n't find mechanics like that . most importantly they are honest and they do the job right the first time ! definitely going to have this place my regular place i go to for my lexus !	2981
1	food is always prices could be better and still worth it . sometimes need to double check that your order is correct especially when ordering to go . carne asada is all full of flavor .	857
0	been to a lot of denny 's and this is easily the worst of them all . the biggest beef was seeing our food waiting for easily 10 minutes under the warmer before being delivered to us . the service was slow even though the restaurant was nearly empty . the food was luke warm ( no surprise sitting under the warmers ) , pancakes were crusty on top ( no surprise sitting under the warmers ) , waitress never refilled drinks , and we had to ask for the bill . overall disappointing experience . i 'll be happy to get back my favorite denny 's in san jose , ca .	1504
0	first of all as a true hispanic , this place was nothing to brag about . the salsa was plain and had no kick to it . i had their carne asada burrito and the carne asada was also plain and was not juicy . their chips were too salty . the only thing that was good about it was the water so i can wash it down . finally it was wayyyyy over priced for the quality and taste . if you come here you might as well go to taco bell.the only thing nice about it was the interior of the place and the staff . i will never go back again .	562
1	if you need help in deciding where to look for speech therapy services , look no further than speech therapy center of excellence ! my son has been having sessions with arlene , and even in this short time he has improved greatly . she is very nice and thorough and my son is always so excited to be there , he always tries to run in . after being on their wait list for a while and looking into other places , my husband and i are glad we selected this location . if you need someone that specializes with speech for kids on the autism spectrum or any other special need , give them a call !	2782
0	this company deserves 0 stars . the director of operations angela kelley is not a person you want to deal with she is very arrogant and does not uphold the school policy enforced by bud crawley . she should be let go and replaced by someone with some standards like bud . bud passed away and would be appaulled by the way she is handling his students .	2880
0	terrible service ! last 2 times the waitress disappears and never returns , no drinks , food order was wrong and we had to get the manager to stop and fix it and then we have to chase them down to pay the bill .	201
0	skip this place . to even play in the tubes you have to pay to much . the food sucks . the immature staff are lazy and disrespectful . the kids were alright with it , but they did n't need to pay for the crap service .	1154
0	i really really wanted to love this ! i went there to try the chorizo burrito only to be told they did n't have the chorizo made yet . fair enough so i decided to go with the steak burrito as a second choice . it was good the pico was good cilantro was fresh . steak however was tough and grisely and i found it not to be seasoned at all . bummer . i will probably try again since everybody should get another chance . i hope next time they have the chorizo . till then i can say it 's just ok .	1421
0	never going there again ... i was glad i did n't just munch in cause i was so hungry , cause i found a plastic wrap in my soup bowl and to top it off , it took so long to get to my food . guess i caught them on a bad day .	673
1	love my nails ! patricia is very sweet . when you walk in , there are studios of other beauticians- patricia is in her own suite ( 219 ) so you have your own personal nail salon in a sense ! since you are the only person with her- she is very attentive to your needs- she played a movie that i wanted to watch during my gel pedicure and listened to relaxing music during my gel mani . overall a very beautiful and relaxing experience . 50 % off for new customers ! so my bill for a gel mani and gel pedi was $ 40 . ca n't be beat !	2742
1	i love this frys ! not only its near my house they also run alot of sales . i get the newspaper but they also send me exclusives deal ! we usually buy most of our itmes on this store then used our points at the end of the month on their gas . double whamey ! ! ! the only reason i took 1 star is that they decided to remove the spot where they sell nuts and chocolate covered items , like the one @ sprouts ! other than the change iam very hapoy that i live near this place ! !	3107
0	worst shopping experience ever . the staff in the store is so rude . had to buy some insoles for my scarpas but refused to buy anything else . never going here again .	3339
0	drew is a great guy , but my mechanic did not give me good service . felt rushed out even though my car was n't fully fixed and then steve , i think was his name , tried to charge me additional to look at a fuse behind the radio that was stopping it from working . ended up doing it myself , but service was horrible and unfriendly .	1604
1	awesome service the safelite team , south rainbow in las vegas ! got me in and out in about 40 minutes ! they changed my severely pitted windshield for me and it looks 100 % better than before . making an appointment with them was effortless . i only wish i had it replaced sooner . i will definitely be coming here for my other vehicle 's glass needs and telling others to so as well !	1052
0	worst $ 80 ever spent on my vehicle . all they did was cover everything with armorall . windows were streaked . bugs on the grill . plus it took two hours	127
1	if you are in the area and hungry , there is no better option than to order a quarter chicken and fries and ramados . montreal is home to some of the best portuguese rotisserie restaurants , but none offering charcoal-fired chicken at affordable prices like ramados . the combos are packed with generous servings of chicken , fries , and salad , so there are no worries of leaving unsatisfied . do n't forget to order some natas to finish your meal ! ramados is a take-out restaurant , but there are two or three tables inside . however , there is no better place to enjoy your saucy , charred chicken than the nearby park on a sunny afternoon !	1109
1	love this place ! amazing flavor on the steak . great happy hour deals , even on the steak ! waiters were on top of their game . great service . dessert was perfect ! had to find room for the cheesecake and mini donuts . only complaint : too dark to read the menu . had to use the flashlight on my phone . also saw a couple other tables doing the same thing . other than that ... one of the best steakhouses in vegas !	1414
0	horrible company ! charged me $ 500 to replace the springs on my door . which is more than double what it should have been . installed the wrong springs which cause to much tension on my opener . their stickers are placed all over my door , and i 'm told that they pay people to do this on new and used homes that are for sale so you will call them first . i wish i had looked them up first !	3291
0	i called the other day to make sure they would be open till 6pm . the girl on the phone told me yes . the website says 6 and chickie on the phone said 6 . i had a coupon for a christmas tree ... well guess what ? i got there at 5:30 and they were closed . you suck star nursery . i was going to give u my business because i wanted my christmas tree . home depot got my money instead . again , you suck .	2039
0	unnecessary mark up . went in for a plastic ammo can- $ 25 , and $ 35 for the one with an insert ( $ 10 for an insert ? ) . went home and bought 2 online for $ 30 . free shipping , you know the deal . they have some good supplies but you 're going to pay for it .	233
0	too busy on the weekend , no staff to watch the kids carefully , dodgeball room often not monitored at all . i do n't feel my kids are safe here . also it takes a long time to register at the front , even though i have come a few times before . this will be my last visit .	1664
1	this is my `` go to '' store when i need auto parts/accessories . i come here for gasoline treatment , air filters , replacement windshield wipers , and other stuff . http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qgxtuzc_i8do_p2xd7pp0q ? select=hq6js9srvsjulq1kj_7l4g http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qgxtuzc_i8do_p2xd7pp0q ? select=4_rjsnormz2ssov3xm0kbq the staff here are usually pretty cool and helpful ... ..plenty of parking in the lot and ko 's is next door ( restaurant/bar ) ... .what more could you ask for ? ! return factor - 90 %	360
0	i ate here with a group of 5 , one whom was the lovely ms katie m. see her review for more . bitch took ten minutes to bring me a cup of coffee , then disappeared until we asked her for the 15 % auto-gratuity . i did not order food , but what arrived looked like denny 's , only shittier and more expensive .	1515
0	service started rough when we were given dirty plates for our entree , service continued to be slow throughout the meal , our waiter came over once we had finished our meal to give us more water which we had been out of since our entree . overall poor service and overpriced food	102
1	my favourite ricky 's in calgary . always consistent . liver & onions there are my fave . the owner laura is wonderful .	660
1	so excited to finally have whlyd ass in phoenix . came in this morning and was greeted with the most friendly of service . food was on point as always . water is green as always . congratulations on the new place guys , we look forward to watching y'all grow !	1254
0	update - 6/20/16 . office is officially closed . dr posted a sign outside and basically gave all her patients less than 2 weeks to find a new doctor and transfer records . it 's been a nightmare . now we have to start all over & it 's been a fight to get allergy serum released . april 2016 - we have n't met with dr laura , but mary jo is wonderful and took good care of both my kids . my daughter starts allergy shots soon . so far the office has been great to work with .	2272
0	rude employees , never answer phones or return messages , maintenance calls are never resolved , stains or urine throughout halls , smell of mold in apartments .	818
0	a 40 % late fee on your monthly rent fee is ridiculous . after renting from them for several months , will be removing belongings & going elsewhere . manager here is cold & unwilling to understand that circumstances in people 's lives happen . stay away from this facility .	2065
1	ate here for restaurant week and lived it ! the food was great , service was great , and they had live music that night . people were dancing and having a great time . i definitely recommend this place to anyone look for a great meal and a great time . i had the lamb cops with mashed potatoes and finished it off with carrot cake . it was epic !	1147
1	i have been here many times and found the food to be ok . but this was the best visit yet . the waitress was very pleasant and attentive . maybe it was so good because i had lunch with my daughter and great grand daughter . had the 2 for you , reuben sandwich and cob salad , both good . great grand daughter had a fruit boy ( she is a healthy eater ) and whatever she could poach from the plates of the adults .	1258
0	i used to come here every month , but not anymore . every time i come here on the weekend i have to wait for a long time . so i tried to come on weekday , then the lady kept rushing me to pick out the color on my most recent visit . then she just rushed to finish her job so she can move on to the next customer ... pedicure done in 10 mins , and i realized she did n't polish it evenly until i get home..	786
1	wonderful service & company ! ! ! ramsey is super ! ! we had a bad experience with another local company , capital tint and ramsey fixed it & took really good care of us ! ! he comes to your home and his detail program miracle touch , is one of a kind ! ! if you have any scratches , rock chips , faded paint , etc. , please do not hesitate , this is your service ! ! ! he is awesome ! ! ! ! !	2888
0	well this is too bad . new owners ? first off , i walked in and the two women working were both talking loudly on their cell phones . took a minute for one of them to set their phone down for a second to take my order . my food was n't as good as it used to be . i used to love this place but after just this one interaction , i really do n't think i 'll come back - might be dramatic but i just hate employees being on their cell phones when there 's a customer ( and it does n't help that the food was n't great ! )	981
1	i took my 2013 kia sportage in for service last wee like i have taken all my cars i have owned since i have lived in surprise . they meet you at your car as soon as you drive up . they take good care of your car as they would treat one of there own cars . sam brown	624
0	i had the worst haircut of my life at this place and i travel all the time so i experience a ton of barber shops . maybe i just got the wrong guy but i seriously considered shaving my head afterwards . i asked for a low fade with a 1 one the bottom and half off the top . i do n't think thats a difficult haircut . the guy gave me a 4 all around and tapered the front near the sideburns . im glad a lot of other people had `` good '' experiences but i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .	2295
0	called the shop and got to talk to a guy called `` raffy . '' asked about a phone and said the he has it available and has only one left . got there and asked for the phone . he kept on looking in the back of his store but nothing . at one point even asked if i wanted a different one . made me wait for a long time with nothing . left the place ... wasted my time driving over there.. do n't go there . rude person .	1586
1	me and my cousin went to get our tattoo today at titan . chris was awesome , he was super friendly , patient and did exactly what we want , he even cleaned the whole area after we done . we trusted him 100 % and our tattoos turned out perfect . i do n't know why they got all bad reviews on yelp , well i guess you just have to be nice and respect people if you want to be treated the same way .	1658
0	update : three more stores have closed ! downgraded to 2 stars : - ( it 's sad to see this mall deteriorate year after year . there are still a decent number of stores left but in the whole it is pretty pathetic . the best thing about this mall is how kid friendly it is . nice play area . however , it does get super crowded in the summer . play area is for 42 '' and under . some parents ignore this but security will kick them out . dillard 's does a storytime on tuesdays at 10am and if you register they will give you a card that gives you free carousel rides on tuesday from 11am-1pm .	2815
0	they called to schedule an appointment for a home warranty claim . they told me they had to speak to my home warranty and would call me back- no one called me back . i called my home warranty and they had canceled my claim . ridiculous- i 'll replace my broken toilet myself . i would never use these people . very unprofessional . **this review is for correct company . they never called me back and i lost a day . that 's not how you run a business . now i have another company coming out to fix my problem .	1644
0	walked in for lunch at 2pm , waited at the counter and not a single employee spoke . 6 behind the counter and 2 drivers in white shirts standing at the counter with me , and no one spoke , i walked out .	1475
0	extremely bad service . $ 10 bottle of water . drinks expensive . plenty of other places in other casinos	2513
1	i love this place ! i would give a five star . great return exchange policy plus nice store very big lots selections . love it ! ! everyone is very nice . not rude	2443
0	awful place . average facilities and very pushy annoying staff . i was called after 10pm on two different nights by someone trying to schedule and push personal training passes on me . so many people i know are fans of good life and i wish i could be as it is so convenient , but i have had nothing but terrible experiences here . they refused to cancel my membership when i asked . do not recommend .	2370
0	horrible parking and not pedestrian friendly . some great restaurant and shopping options . if you can park . spots are tiny and they force you to valet .	387
0	this actually deserves zero stars because this repair shop did not do any repairs . i took a pair boots where the insoles were coming lose to glue them back . when i picked the boots up i checked and both insoles were still peeling . the man said there was nothing he could do and so now i have to find a new shop to fix my boots . the only good thing is that he had the decency not to charge me . seriously though ? how hard is it to put some glue on the bottom of a pair of insoles . ridiculous !	410
0	bad : -too much msg , we drink lots of tea , -simple salad dip in sodium , we re order one and is the same . -did n't refund the hair salad at the end need to be reminded -careless rice come with white plastic chip ( see photo ) -poor personal hygiene come with hair ( see picture ) -bad service not even a singe sorry about the hair . -the meat in the bun textured like sand -cost 40 $ per person good : -clean reno good lighting not worth going at all beware	943
0	ordered delivery to a nearby hotel and was promised 45 minutes or less . 1 and 1/2 hours later my pizza and salad arrived and both were the same temperature , that is to say slightly warm . pizza was ok , might have been better hot , but the salad was pretty poor . i realized afterward that they also overcharged me . overall poor value and service . try somewhere else if you are in this area as you ca n't do any worse .	718
0	not that great and definitely not worth the money . my dad got the kung pao vegan rice bowl and i got the organic veggie burger and it was not good . the rice bowl was extremely oily and the burger was subpar . they do n't specialize in vegan so if that 's what you want go elsewhere .	1402
0	came in there today an a lady named hengume was so rude told her thank you told her she did good and she ignored me the whole time . this place also always has only one person working which leaves them rushing trying to get to the next person .very unprofessional place	71
1	duffy 's provided beautiful flowers for our family reunion . we have used them many times in the past and have always been extremely satisfied with both their quality and service and this time was no exception . would highly recommend them for any flower needs big or small as we have used them for both and have always been glad we did . we have in the past used other 'big ' online florists and have been disappointed over and over again so we are especially grateful to find a florist that is so consistent and trustworthy !	657
1	great food for the price . i have been there five or six times to date . everything i have had has been good . i 'll agree with other reviews that complain about the parking lot and the weird ordering process , but the food is good and inexpensive . some of my personal favorites so far are the spinach friand , savory ham and cheese croissant , and the creme brûlée cheesecake .	1276
1	the former hilton is hands down the best place to watch games , especially on sundays for football central . they have a whole theater showing the games in addition to the sports book , the most reliable spreads for betting , and the cheapest beer ( priorities ) ; ) it 's the next best thing to actually being at the game ( even better actually cause the beers are cheaper ! ) especially when my team wins ... go panthers ; )	2271
0	go somewhere else ! i paid $ 39 for an hour of foot massage . two words : long fingernails . first , she worked on my scalp . it felt like my dog scratching my head . next , she worked on my arms and legs . she has only two pressures : barbaric and useless . i felt like she sprained my right wrist . finally , my foot massage . did n't even last one minute . and , she had the audacity to ask for tip . i gave her $ 5.00 just so she would n't chase me out the door . i could have done a better job massaging myself . for free .	1180
0	brought my dog in for a lameness issue . a slight limp was supposedly severe hip dysplasia . the dr would not let us see the x-rays and jumped straight to surgery . we stressed that we could not afford it so we left it at that . after a week of rest no more limping . we decided to take her to a new vet to get a second opinion . x-rays came back picture perfect . not a single arthritic change . very disappointed in this clinic . not sure if it was because of complete lack of education or for money but i will not be returning .	1588
0	lakes and sunrise are awesome if you 're looking for a great golf experience . if you 're looking to be talked down to by the guys at the pro shop then this is the place for you . was told over the phone twice they would honor casino rate and blew us off when we got there and said not on weekends . horrible attitudes from both of them . really shocked i was treated this way . love the course but not worth dealing with the pro shop . this is the third time they 've been extremely rude . wish i had the names of the two .	3869
1	this is the grocery store i usually go to , mainly because it is located close to my home . i can pretty much always find what i 'm looking for . some prices are a bit more than others but i can always get good quality fruit , vegetables and meat . they also have a pharmacy with great staff . of course like any grocery stores there are times that can be very busy but some nights are nice and quiet .	2402
1	this salon has been one i 've gone to over 19 years ago . my stylist was dawn . just gave her an idea of what i would like my hair would like . she gave very great advice and exceeded all my expectations . my hair looks much better now than before i walked in . she advised highlights with a trim that got rid of my frayed ends . my hair was a light color now it looks more natural and not so brassy . would definitely recommend this salon .	3182
0	i find this place very expensive and the food is mediocre . i bought a glass of wine , it was very expensive and they gave you very little . for a restaurant that is not in the downtown core , and on an industrial street , they could do better with the pricing and food quality .	257
1	seriously amazing food ! our server/bartender chris ( i think that 's his name ) was phenomenal , get the pear mule it will change your life . we ordered the brie and bacon app , pear pico , pacos pear tacos and the mushroom marsala and everything was amazing ! we will definitely be back to try something new . ( :	1458
1	well l needed some more glide to prevent heat rash when running . so i stopped in here . found some cool new running socks , hope they prevent blisters . my son bought a bb gun . sports authority overall is high priced to me , especially clothing . i checked in but forgot to use my 10.00 offer and now i am bummed . oh well . nice employees and helpful .	1832
1	we 've been back here several times in the last 2 weeks and just love it . the service is quick and the food fresh and delicious . the angry kimichi fries are a must and yesterday i got a buckeye dog which was delicious , though my favorite is the southern dog for sure !	1566
0	thereceptionist is awful ... i had to wait almost 20 minutes for my appointment to start . hair dresser was very unfriendly . my hair look decent , it took 3 hours just to do a press and style . from what i observed they can not do highlights . only weaves and haircuts . staff in general is rude . it was a waste of a drive there and my money . i would rather go some where else and pay more money . do n't waste your time ... it 's unfortunate the interior is so nice .	916
0	what horrible customer service . go to buy a bag of dental cat treats and they ring up as $ 0.01 . the girl asks her manager what to do and they tell me they ca n't sell it to me . do n't offer any alternatives . just ca n't sell it . first off all , what kind of store cant override a price ? second of all , your systems are messed up and i 'm the one who has to suffer for it ? and third of all , offer me an alternative ! you just lost a loyal customer .	2649
0	came in , guy acted like it was an inconvenience to see me and then when i took longer than 5 minutes to make a choice he literally said , `` just choose . '' definitely would have gotten something but refuse to give my money to someone who ca n't be bothered to do his job ...	3270
1	there is a wait even if you are seated immediately . friendly crew and they will correct any mistakes if you had one from a previous appointment without hassle .	786
0	horrible service , completely screwed up my hair shaved it beyond what i asked and went it came time for a line-up in the front the most crucial part of a haircut she lopped off a chunk of my hair and it 's the overall line up is crooked ! i basically paid to get the hell out of there i will never go back to this location ever ! management should speak to their stylists about paying attention to what 's in front of them not around them .	3557
1	this store has everything , love coming here . the workers are average some are really nice others are just rude w ith no personality . this location always has great items that you can find in regular grocery stores . love this 99 cent store	3423
1	a small dunkin donuts with some seating available inside . chocolate chip muffin and iced tea were great . service was fine , the place was n't too busy either . would definitely visit again !	618
0	very disappointed with this motel , came here for work and because i had 3 friends come and help me out with things i needed , bath essentials , a charger etc they said i had too much activity going on ! ! but yet they have hookers hopping in and out of cars all night in the parking lot ! they do n't provide shampoo conditioner toothbrush toothpaste nothing so basically if u do n't come prepared u have no choice but to stay dirty cuz god forbid u have a few friends come and bring u things necessities because u will be marked as a prostitute for strange activity even though my door remained open during those few times ! !	3772
0	nice people and atmosphere . the food absolutely is horrible . my wife and her friend had the best salad with chicken that was so drying was like chicken jerk . i had the chili reano that was so bad i had no idea what it was . no happy hour the cheese and meat board were lame . no thanks	1331
1	4.5 stars out 5 the facility is incredibly large and has beaches . there are so many great activities to be done here and there are more pools and spas then any other club in gta . i 'm a founding member here . after settling in here after four years this club feels much more like a resort .	2762
1	this is by far the best place to shop for and purchase firearms and supplies in the valley . fortunately , they are only about 20 minutes from where i live , but it is always worth the drive . the staff is knowledgeable , and willing to help without any high pressure sales . i recently purchased a new sig sauer from spartan arms ... and was having a difficult time field stripping it . they took the time to show me and to make sure i knew how before i left . spartan arms also offers many classes from live fire , to safety . i would n't shop anywhere else .	2247
0	i 've found this location very hit-or-miss in terms of delivery . the first time i ordered , i received the most amazing vegan pizza with roasted garlic , basil and tomato sauce . but i 've only received that one time . the other two times i have ordered delivery , the pizza has garlic powder and looks completely different from my first experience . i also received the wrong drink order . i 'm not sure i 'll order from here again . 1/3 is not a good enough percentage for me in terms of satisfaction .	1063
0	worst experience from the minute i walked in the door . unfortunately the only place around with no car and unfamiliar area . two staff members were doing nothing going back and fourth of who wants to do me . i wanted a mani/pedi but just came out with a pedi because the other one was too lazy to get up . another customer walks in , ignores i also needed a gel manicure and starts on her . rude ! ! ! i just told you i wanted both ! ! ! ! would never recommend would never come back ! ! ! ! horrible customer service ! ! ! ! !	1745
0	complete ripoff artists i wish i had checked yelp before being ripped off here . they will lie to you to get the sale and not provide services requested and overcharge . avoid ! ! ! !	3123
0	dirty , nasty and smelly . i would n't recommend this park at all . my kids were extremely disappointed and we left after 30 minutes . i was surprised by all the garbage all over the place . people are so disgusting and treat this park as if it is a big garbage can . the smell of dog urine is overpowering that it gave me a headache . we will never go back here !	367
1	amy was amazing ! ! i will definitely be back again ! ! came last minute with two others and were sat right away . very impressed !	3497
0	i do not know him on business maybe he is brilliant but with talking to people he is a disaster rode and not pleasant , be aware !	3126
1	what a spectacular view , beautiful patio with a wonderful fireplace . service was great could not have been treated any better , great wine selection and with 1/2 bottles on saturday nights makes it even better . the menu selection has great verity , i really enjoyed the sun devil salad and the fish tacos are wonderful .	751
1	the owners been there for 20 years working on bikes . it 's not a customer service oriented business so do n't expect him to be something that he 's not . he has the lowest prices in town so just mind your manners when your in his store	3156
0	i was super excited to try this place out , so i ordered the big katuna with what turned out to be too high expectations . there was wayyyy too much sauce on my bowl , all i tasted was salty ponzu . apparently mine was made by a new person , since she kept asking questions to another staff about how to put the ingredients together . i took it to go which was saving grace since i was at least able to mix it with other non salty things to finish the toppings . did n't eat the rest of the rice , too drenched in ponzu .	309
1	very honest and very good work . they made everything super easy for me and i am very comfortable with these guys . i am a lifetime customer now !	1210
1	great wings good service good value for ones money . my favourite wing place in vaughan	393
1	i have taken all my 4 dogs to dr. mccomb who is very knowledgeable and works with you as far as price and times you can take your pets in . the staff is very nice and helpful every time we have our appointments . there is no other place i would have my pets . we are now seeing dr. o and she is fantastic as well . i highly recommend crossroads veterinary to anyone .	2165
0	check other reviews and do yourself a favor and never order anything from this people . worse experience ever , sizes are not accurate . a medium size is more like a small junior and when i tried to exchange and sent back my order they never contacted me and never send me the exchanges i required . i have the tracking number when i returned the stuff and they did received but never send me the exchange items . they clearly do n't care about the customers .	2661
1	i give it a four star but here is the thing ... .. i hate all shows and somehow i liked it and what is even worse is im telling people i actually liked it ... . every other show i have been to has been absolutely terrible and a waste of my time and money just to keep the girl happy , but this time was different finally a win/win . it is nice that i can actually enjoy something ( for once ) that its only purpose was to make the ole battle axe happy ( kidding )	1771
0	attempted to visit this place due to great reviews but i got there at 515pm on friday and there doors already locked and closed ! tried to call 3x but all calls went to beeping voicemail . saw workers in there but still no answer . horrible service if you ask me . update your store hours if u plan on closing early for no reason ! !	2182
1	i am really not into cardio , but i 've been coming to this studio for the last 6 years and am simply addicted . every class is a new challenge and my only goal is to keep going . the instructors are motivating and inspiring and it 's always a great group of people that attend . this studio is unique and the classes are exciting and fun while actually focusing on a full body work-out and not just legs . enjoy !	3477
1	this is my new nail place ! ! they did such an amazing job and did n't even care how crazy my requests were , they treated my daughter and i like royalty and we will be be back ! ! i loved how wendy did my nails and toes and she did n't even cut me like the other place i went to . i 'm so glad that they are 10 mins from my house ! ! 10 stars ! ! !	3333
0	appears my views on sports authority are widely shared , the firm is now bankrupt and closing stores ! ( good riddance ! )	3911
0	an old plastic plate for $ 2 . clothes that are torn and worn with stains on them . i went there today to give it a second look . generally , disappointing .	747
1	i do n't like doing laundry but i do n't mind it at this place . it 's pretty clean and it 's not really hot like most laundromats . plus i never have to spend too long there because there are lot of washers and get dryers are big and always done really fast ! ! i think last time i was there i used like 50 cents to dry all my clothes ! ! ca n't beat that	2638
0	do n't bother coming here ... they are nice but they do n't respect appts . i had to wait 2 hours and i had an appt . i will go to scottsdale store from now on . bad mgt .	3231
0	they are a terrible company to work with . they sent the wrong springs that would not fit my door and using the `` spring 's are not returnable '' routine . stay away from this company . dealt with both bill chalfant and taylor millar . when north shore goes out of business , these two should definitely look into a different career than customer service .	3470
1	this is the most caring , reasonably priced veterinary clinic ! ! dr. edwards is thorough , honest , very skilled as a vet , personable , kind , and so very caring . the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable as well . i 'm so grateful to have found dr. edwards years ago , and so are my shelties !	2453
1	everything was hot and delicious . speedy , friendly delivery . i 'd give 5 stars but in my opinion it 's on the pricey side .	1191
1	i go through the drive thru and they are all very pleasant that work at the windows either taking your payment or handing your food and/or drink . the only complaint i have is fill the frappe drink up or any drink for that matter . i fell like i am getting cheated when it is almost a 1/4 missing . i can go to the dutch bros and get a full one from them and have never been cheated . also have your payment ready it will help the line move quicker .	504
0	c'est grand . c'est un peu bruyant . c'est pas mal . mais c'est surtout beaucoup moins bien que l'avenue !	243
1	we 've been going to this restaurant since it opened over 15 years ago . this is one of the only chinese restaurants that have kept their standards up . they 're staff is friendly and quick . the food prices have gone up with inflation , but is still a very good price for what you get . i 'm not a fan of the `` new '' plastic ware though as any left over debris shows up on the black plastic bowls . they 're veggies are always fresh compared to other similar type restaurants .	1173
0	the customer service was good however the way they stock their sunglasses is very unacceptable . i was interested in buying a pair of sunglasses . the only pair available was a display with a big scratch on it . the sales person went through their back stock to see if there was another pair , she pulled out a box with pairs of sunglasses just thrown in a small box . the only protection these sunglasses had were plastic sleeves . they should have been placed in their individual sunglasses cases . i have never seen a sunglass but organized like this !	2676
0	when we walked in our waitress greeted us in a rude manner just tossed the menus on the table . she was swearing every second word even calling he boss the c word . very unprofessional the food was very below average for the price . safe to say i will not be going back there .	1546
1	garner orthodontics went beyond my expectations . my son just got his braces off and i have 2 other kiddos starting on their journey . the staff is so helpful and accomodating . they are very patient with my kids and help explain the process and what to expect of each phase . if you have to cancel an appointment and need to reschedule , if they ca n't get you into one location , they try to get you into the other location . thank you to dr. garner and his staff for always being so helpful and informative .	2566
1	decided to have lunch here instead of going to my fave usual sushi place . everything from the service to the food was top notch ! me and my sister both got the dixie sushi lunch with a side of salmon sashimi . the sashimi was fresh and were a nice thick cut ( mmmm ! ) . the dynamite and california rolls were fresh and did not fall apart . the service throughout lunch was great ! the servers were always attentive and were very nice . you usually do n't get this kind of service at asian places . i think tako sushi is going to be my new fave usual place .	516
1	probably my favorite chinese bakery in all of west chinatown . fresh bread baked daily , with sufficient filling in each bun . although it is more expensive compared to the other bakeries , you 're paying for quality , and not quantity . always go first thing in the morning when the buns come out hot !	3110
1	we come to this location at least twice a week . we love the fresh food and quick service . never been disappointed . do n't eat the cookies unless you want to be hooked !	1161
1	this place is fyah everything is perfect here libby and the crew are the best . service , food and drinks are awesome . this place is really comfortable and chill perfect after work spot to relax definitely coming back that 's a automatic .	1229
1	i got my second tattoo from jeff , he was was quick , efficient , and knowledgeable . the result was good although it has faded substantially in just 6 months . dan the piercer is fantastic and super knowledgeable , i 've gotten two piercings from him and both healed quickly and without complication . would strongly recommend	3112
1	we love this place . friendly service , a little slow when busy , but the food is great and worth waiting for . the place is neat and the price is reasonable . would recommend to anyone ! ! !	237
1	we go for the wings-never the service until last night and we hope that this gal is working when we go in again- mariah ( please forgive me if i spelled it wrong ) . she was adorably polite , professional , and poised ! thank you again .	383
0	save your time if planning to donate goods . i called them ... they give an all day window for pick-up..great ! next , driver shows up and takes out a branch on my tree..wonderful . now they start to examine and cherry pick what they want . none of this was worthless junk mind you . so i told the driver to take a hike and sold the stuff on craigslist ! do n't waste your time with this chapter in cleveland . i 'm sure salvation army in general is a good organization but this chapter is not worth the bother . call goodwill ... they 're helpful and grateful for donations .	747
1	a relax place for a sunday breakfast . the restaurant is nicely decorated and the waitress is friendly . there 's a variety of selections of food and drinks for breakfast and lunch .	1060
0	the worst taco place i have been in my life . the place stinks first moment u walk in . the food was very bad and disgusting . i will never go back this place even though i love mexican food .	857
0	the service here was pretty bad . the kids working there were unhelpful . the clothes are cheap and so are the shoes . they had a fragrance there that looked like the gucci bottle but instead of gucci it was called `` gotcha . '' but hey , what are you gon na do right ? i wo n't come here again unless i get too drunk at garcia 's , spill bean dip all over my shirt and need a new one .	1833
1	i do n't know why this place does n't have a 5 star rating , this is hands down my favourite used clothing store around . the layout is beautiful , spacious and great quality clothing all around . i feel like i never leave without at least one item . price is decent and they have a lot of designer clothing . brought my boyfriend in here too and they had a great selection for men as well . ca n't wait to visit again !	1446
1	this is one of the most relaxing starbucks that i visit . it busy here , but has a calm vibe . the coffee is great as always !	44
1	i recently started taking my car here since moving to this side of town . the staff are always friendly and professional.ryan was great at explaining things to me . i would had given 5 stars because they do n't work on transmissions which i needed but overall is this a great place and have nothing negative to say .	2561
1	very good spot to grab a burger , fries and soda in a quaint , old-school atmosphere . order at the counter and they bring your food to you . my combo meal for lunch was a little over $ 8 and the burger and fries were both cooked perfectly . the employees were friendly . parking can be a little tight .	1461
1	wow i 'm going to miss ben ... so sad to hear he has moved out of state ! ! ever since i have been going to ben i 've gotten compliments practically on a daily basis ! ! i have nothing but great things to say about this salon - everyone is super friendly , considerate and talented . incredible head/neck massages ! ! ! i 've never seen a bad cut/color leave the salon ! ! i 'm looking forward to falling in love with another talented stylist at hypnotic ! thank you for giving us a place/talent we can depend on !	1617
1	what can i say ? the food is excellent and really showcases how quality ingredients make all the difference in simple food . the bigoli pasta and burrata pizzas are a must . add black truffle shavings to the pizza for an extra pep . service is great and the wine list both by the bottle and glass are superb . i 've been twice now and will be back again soon to try the whole branzino crudo . if i had to make one suggestion it would only be to increase the portions of their pasta dishes . other than that , perfecto !	833
1	there was leak due to the pipe not being installed previously by manny air properly on the ac unit and miguel from manny air came to fix it . he is very professional and extremely hard working . i would definitely suggest asking for miguel as your tech for all the work . he is also sending a painter to fix the the dry wall . miguel knows his stuff . update 8/4/17 - the painter ( jose dominguez 480-366-4589 ) did a very professional job of fixing and painting the dry wall . i do appreciate that manning air took full responsibility on fixing the problem .	3172
0	i would give this place 0 stars if possible . the owner , margarita could not have conducted herself in a worse way . my girlfriend went in to get her hair cut shorter , and margarita acted like it was the worst thing she has ever had do . after it was all said and done , the haircut was n't right and margarita did n't even say goodbye . then when we asked for someone to fix the haircut because it was wrong , margarita said that my girlfriend is n't welcomed back again . please never go support someone like this ! ! !	2056
0	i had bloodwork done for my 3 maltese before their dental cleaning . i went to pick up results a week later and the numbers on one of them was very high on wbc and lym and it was never mentioned to me ! i wo n't be back .	3030
0	i called to make a first time appointment for my three boys who need physicals for the new school year . after being put on hold for roughly five minutes i was informed that they can not accommodate three first time appointments in one day . i said i work and that means i 'd have to take off two days of work to have my kids seen . the appointment setter said yes that is correct . i suppose if you have one or two children then this could be a good practice for you . unfortunately this practices shortcomings have forced me to seek medical care elsewhere .	590
0	it has now been another 3 months for a total of 6 months that i have lived ere and have yet to have my patio ceiling fixed , and my bedroom cracks fixed ... add to it now i have water spots in my ceiling . i am beyond frustrated , i 've put in numerous work orders , about this and apparently a contractor has to come to my apartment . on the plus they did fix my dishwasher , after which they merely looked at the damages in my ceiling and told me about the contractor who was on site that day , well i never got a visit about my ceiling . if i could leave a half a star i would .	3467
1	typical theater , nothing too fancy . they recently opened a bar which is ok. my drink was kind of watered down , but all in all it 's not a bad theater .	3063
0	way overpriced for locals not to mention their costumer service sucks ! i bought a pax battery from then it did n't work to my fault i did n't return it right away they refused to exchange it or refund it ! if you are reading this go to oasis much better prices and service !	1025
1	love their selection of gel nails and supplies . i 've started doing my own and his place has the best selection anywhere . staff is knowledgeable and helpful . only drawback is they are closed on saturday 's . prices definitely beat anything online .	2182
0	i like how cheap the car wash is and the free vacuums ! but the employees are incompetent , rude and try to hit on you . dude , i 'm just trying to pay ... just trying to vacuum my car please stop coming over to me and talking to me . i like coming here just wish i was n't either getting hit on , being tried to be sold something or treated like i 'm stupid by the employees .	2093
0	first and last time in this barber shop . i took my son in for a haircut and we were turned away ! their business hours posted on the window says 9a - 7p it was 6:35pm there was only one customer getting a hair cut and two employees , and one of the employees said to me that they were already done for the day to come back tomorrow , awful customer service do not recommend	761
0	there a joke in this world ... wife went looking at a 2013 tacoma and they wanted $ 6000 down and $ 850 a month or with a cosigner $ 2000 down and $ 650 a month for 4 years ... she told them where to shove it and left..bad thing with them is you see post in craigslist for $ 500 and up to $ 1500 down , liers just like the rest of dealers , just these guys push it to the extreme	307
0	they are open till 1 am but if you want the food of you 're choice do n't go late because that definitely wo n't happen . i had driven across town for the food and it sucked that i was n't able to order it and had to result to something else	964
1	very good costumer service and professional tech . ..so frendly and also serve boba tea..love it ) )	544
1	the staff and doctors here are great . i have been coming for years with my cat and dog and have received excellent care .	1700
0	showed canceled after everyone is sitting down . they wait until everyone spends $ at the bar and souvenir shop and other places at paris and then inform people 5 minutes before start time that due to `` unforeseen circumstances '' the show is cancelled . they obviously knew and want to make money on extras . really shameful . do n't patronize this show .	570
1	awesome staff ! so friendly , honest and good at what they do . they really do put the customer first . will definitely be back	3842
0	`` security '' guard at the front would n't allow me to enter the store with my service dog even when i presented her certs . absolute garbage . lost my business for good .	3096
1	this place was good and bad . i went to las vages with my son and we played baseball . we were very happy to go and the batting cages were almost perfect . this place was a little dirty , the nets were ripped , but they were over all prety good . here are some pros and cons : ·close to strip ·pitches close to little league ·prices were too high ·equipment broken ·nice staff	3555
0	higher prices that some of the other locations . awkward layout . you pay and go through the wash , exit and get wiped down by one guy , then get directed to a garage , exit the vehicle , walk down a small hill , wait at a table outside , and the vacuum person drives your car around to the other side of the convenience store . weird ! the car cleaning was okay , nothing special , still dust in corners inside and smear marks on the outside with tons of lint left by the dirty rags .	2198
0	absolutely horrible . worst experience i 've ever had buying a car ! they sell me a 2005 nissan altima . a month after having it , i find out my brakes are metal to metal . christmas day , my car wo n't start . find out its my camshaft sensor . replaced that then my o2 sensor . today ( 6months owning the car ) find out my catalitiyc convertor is going out . guess who wo n't cover it ... . i 've invested more in this car then i ever have in any car . they 're very rude when you call and pretty much say oh well , its your problem . do not buy from here ! ! !	3305
0	i had high hopes because of all the good comments but i found the bagels pretty bland-tasting . the selection is also a bit limited in terms of bagel-variety for a bagel store . the shop lighting is pretty dark , and the service was slow . the bagel is only 1 dollar , which is the only positive . i probably wo n't go back unless a friend wanted to . disappointed .	995
0	food is amazing ! service is extremely poor . we ordered our food . mind you it was for three . the couple who came after us by 10 minutes received their food before us . would never recommend this place to anyone in vegas !	1319
1	i have to say i have read the other reviews and i can see how it may be hit or miss . we have been there several times and the food and service has always been good . there are many price points $ 8.95 to $ 30+ so mama mia 's can accommodate most budgets . we did go there one valentines day and did not care for the reduced selection `` special menu '' ( common for v-day ) and we did not stay . the reason i like this place is it is off the beaten path and you can find a quiet corner for a romantic date night .	1224
0	the line to check in was hour long from noon to 8 pm absolutly nuts	2976
1	very nice towers ! spacious condos , albeit very expensive , with expansive views of las vegas . door staff is first class .	3354
0	12/27/07 - mor furniture : `` well , we do n't have that furniture in stock , but we 'll order it for you and it should be here in 6-8 weeks , maybe sooner . '' 2/11/08 - mor furniture : `` your furniture should be in this weekend . '' 2/15/08 - mor furniture : `` it actually looks like your furniture should be here around march 1st . '' 2/29/08 - mor furniture : `` it 's actually looking more like it 'll be here mid-to-late april . '' see the review for ashley furniture homestore on bell road for the end of this story .	1640
1	i would like to start of by saying that mayes telles has an incredible and dedicated team that does a phenomenal job fighting for you . without a doubt , these folks are strategic , easy to reach , and always looking for a way to help get you a victory . i would highly recommend this law firm for anyone seeking justice . these folks truly care and will find a way to help . furthermore , they are staffed with excellent lawyers , paralegal 's , former prosecutors , etc . a special thank you to ms. castillo and mr. mayes for their efforts !	2391
1	excellent customer service n friendly salesmen for advises n many choices at design center . we picked what we want for our new home . prices is very reasonable	2071
1	went for the second time again this week and shared the hummus appetizer and my husband and i each had the ahi wrap . both were delicious . i had been in earlier this week and a friend had the ahi wrap and said how great it was , so we had to go back and try it . our new favorite . in a spinach tortilla , great seasonings , lots of ahi . getting hungry just thinking of it ! service as always was wonderful .	1529
0	the store is too small . horrible on a saturday . the manager is just ... no words . they never have what i need . so i have to end up ordering and using my pro discount online . mgr states they had to change their inventory over due to a new system . for 3 straight months ? they are horrible here . i do n't even bother . i visit the biltmore location instead .	2409
1	we went to ramada for spring training for my son 's tournament . we were dreading this hotel due to the bad reviews , however i must say this was a great hotel . no complaints whatsoever . we had about 6 other families staying at this hotel as well and we all had a great time ! i would totally stay here again !	1888
0	in one word : meh . the food was only okay . i got the grindhouse burger and shareable fries and rings . burger meat was a bit dry , but still tasty . the sauces that came with the fries were very good . in our group , more good things were said about their delicious mustard than their burgers . the ice cream sandwich was good , but nothing special . the waiter we had was very nice and accommodating .	1417
1	my husband and i are new in henderson and we 're desperately looking for a good sushi restaurant near our home . we were pleasantly surprised when we discovered the sushi ! we went about 3pm for a late lunch , great service ! we had the spicy garlic edamame to start and it was spicy and delicious ! we also tried `` something wrong , the caterpillar and what the hell rolls ... ... loved them all ! highly recommend `` something wrong '' absolutely nothing wrong there ! we will be back !	408
0	over rated . i liked the smooth putting greens and challenging ravine carries , but for $ 200+ you would n't expect a course of this expected caliber to have numerous yellowing spots consistent across all fairways . just because you plunk a golf course into the greater lv area does n't justify high fees . we golfed on thursday late morning and there were perhaps 5 groups on the entire course . drop your fees to $ 75 and expect an in flux .	1087
0	the reviews on here make me think my visit was a fluke ... ordered one of the specialty dogs and fries , fries were undercooked and one of the toppings on the hot dog had gone bad . i could smell it prior to eating ... being brave i figured maybe it was supposed to so i tried a bite but had to spit it out ... definitely not good ... maybe one of the ingredients had gone bad ... like to think that this one slipped through the cracks but who knows sadly , the reviews tell a different story than what i got but for me , i wo n't be back	1566
0	not impressed side door too small with a double elevator bad design and door always open ( bent at bottom ) so temperature controlled not so much and upstairs does get hot too . raise rent after less then a year good thing i was moving out anyway . much cheaper places near by as close as blue diamond should have did my research . automatic payment taken out every month on the 5 but when it was time to check out its the 1st . read fine print not sure would not recommend or use again and all over 17 dollars . my advice look some where else	3919
1	i do not recall the lady who did my nails but she 's located right away and the right side . she 's more short and very nice and gentle with your nails . everyone wants their nails all the way close to cuticles so i recommend this place . i go here all the time for my full sets and fills .	2525
1	well the store was open 24 hours and i needed a loofa so i could take a shower and not only did they have them but they were on sale for .99 so i bought like 6 what a deal woot woot ! ! ! the store was clean and the staff was friendly and thank god they were open because nothing else was open in the area . walgreens has all your everyday essentials and you can get in and out quickly	758
0	day 2 after getting my gels and 3 of my nails chipped.. it 's been a few days now and my cuticles are worse than when they went in . ugh	1288
0	it 's supposed to be $ 4 thursday ... however it 's thanksgiving . out of town ( visiting from san diego ) to catch this flick for the 2nd time since watching it this past saturday . unfortunately guy at the counter said the palms hotel is not honoring the $ 4 due to the holiday but the brendan theatre wanted to . we ended up paying $ 21 for my hubby & i instead of $ 8 ! way to honor your ad brendan theatres*sarcasm* . given , i did have the choice to not pay . seats need cleaning ; they are kinda dingy .	491
1	thanks tasha you are amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i did my single color and it turned out amazing with an awesome blowout ! ! ! ! ! everyone was nice and helpful i had a great time there ! ! ! ! !	636
1	i do n't understand the low ratings ? i come here weekly , am always in and out , i find the staff friendly and the beds high-end . i like this place .	3329
0	really shady operation . i emailed them back and forth a few times about getting counters put in our kitchen . when we were finally ready to go i confirmed the price and told them we could move forward . then i did n't hear back for a few days so i emailed to confirm . a few more days pass and still no response so i email back again . finally a week later i get a response ... '' unfortunately , all our prices went up since last week '' and it 's actually going to be 40 % more . needless to say i would n't recommend ever working with this company in any capacity .	743
0	sorry but not impressed . like the store frontage , but that is where it pretty much stops . only place offered to have a cup of coffee is the social table which frankly is not comfortable when sitting on hard stools . pour over coffee did not taste good , but was offered a drip house coffee instead . it was better but not great . a bit pricey on the coffee . rating this on coffee and experience only .	1332
0	they have no customer service ... went there to open a account and no one had greet us and we waited for 30 min and help .	3202
1	amaizing ! ! ! ! ! ! this place is the place to be if you want a perfect pedi , mani or any other services i went on sunday and even that it was very busy they did n't take to long to see us my pedi was amazing the guy did n't rush the massage was great and my feet look amazing i also got a gel manicure and i absolutely love it the best experience that i ever have with a nail salon ever ! ! ! ! ! i drove from casa grande to this place and it was totally worth it ! ! ! see you guys in 2 weeks	686
0	the manager was rude . we wanted to exchange something we purchased and he was being a smart ass about exchanging for something else . when he returned the money he kind of threw it into my mothers hand , defiantly not politely . not how a manager should represent a store .	1050
0	do not ask these people for help ! working for a auto parts store with no freakin clue of auto parts even with the help of a computer . they will sell you the wrong piece that will screw up your car so that an oil change now turns into am $ 800 part needing to be replaced . and when you tell them instead of trying to fix they problem that they have caused , just look at you and say they 're sorry . really ! ? ! ? so find somewhere else to shop ! save yourself time , aggravating , and money ! ! this store has idiots working for them .	1471
1	i love coming here after work . very relaxing environment inside , or if you prefer , enjoy outside . flavors are good , and the food is excellent . my only complaint is that sometimes the food comes out very slowly . other than that , i 've never had a bad experience here .	1229
1	i was reluctant to try this denny 's becayse of previous reviews but the food was good , served fast and hot . our server , dan , was great . would definitely go back !	1504
1	great food , great service . i ordered the hot stone bibimbap & it was delist . i 'll definitely recommend this restaurant & i 'll be going back .	435
1	a hidden gem with an assortment of delectable french pastries . the sandwiches were alright .	2327
0	walked in at 12pm ( with no appointment ) and left two hours later without a haircut for my son . they claim to be walk-in friendly but it seems like all blocks for the barbers are appointments or they know the barber and people just cut . they need a sign up sheet or a number system to keep track of customers . if you 're going to claim to be walk in , leave blocks open for that purpose . i understand i have to wait a little longer since i did n't make an appointment but two hours is ridiculous . the place is disorganized and the barbers are n't even that good at cutting hair . will be finding another barber .	2366
1	there are a bunch of cry babys if you cant not buy anything from whole foods dont shop there point blank go to walmart or smartshop i love this store they have the best meat and friut from our small frams i love it here its way cheaper then the whole foods nyc ... ..we should be proud we have this type supermarket	3874
0	went for dinner with a friend on friday . i wanted to love it , but ... ... the space is nice . the wines were n't all winners and the food was uninspiring . i considered the charcuterie plate but was underwhelmed when told that it consisted of salami , mortadella and chicken sausage . i had the mahi speacial . the fish was dry and flavorless . service was disengaged . they told us that they are re-doing the menu so maybe the new menu will be better ? with all the other options around not sure i 'll check back to see if that improves things .	296
1	good portions . staff was super friendly . came in right before it was about to close and they went out of their way to make sure i had a good experience without the guilt of keeping the kitchen open ( sorry fellas ) . it 's a new business and it looks like it . everything was super clean , including the bathrooms ( a big tell of how clean the kitchen is ) . prices were reasonable . not the best best sushi you can get - but it 's new and i expect it to grow . their maki was way better than their nigiri .	740
0	overhyped and overpriced . it 's a wannabe gourmet brasserie ... but at the end of the day it 's just another chain restauant.. the lighting was good though and atmosphere was ok .	670
1	the great thing about this gym is that , even during busy hours , it is n't completely packed . another great thing : the energizer bar . love the smoothies !	3912
0	ca n't but cookies ? ordered salad paid try to add some cookies to the order . told i had to go to the back of the line ? terrible service . .wo n't be back	701
1	wow - this place is incredible . it is huge , well lit , organized and everything is used and reasonably priced . saw this place on yelp and had to check it out . they advertise as an entertainment exchange store . they take trades on books , magazines , movies , cds , games ... ... i have never seen a used place this well , great . wish we had something comparable in denver .	3504
0	very disappointed with tire & battery service . came in at 7:30 and was told i had to wait 30 minutes for them to check my battery that i carried in .	2172
0	absolutely terrible . waited four hours for groceries to be delivered because delivery driver called wrong number when delivering . they were given the apartment number and told it was ok to leave at the door . instead driver leaves with no attempt to contact . absolute incompetence , pizza hut must not be hiring drivers .	1914
0	do n't come here ! ! ! really bad service with terrible attitude . they do n't know how to take care the customers . cars are not clean for multiple times even with ultimate plus wash . tired to deal with them just want to let everyone knows how bad they are . do n't waste your money !	127
0	went here once , was pretty good , so i came back a second time and food was not anywhere close to what it was the first time . unfortunately wo n't be back . check out greek wraps if you want great greek .	755
0	rude front desk coordinators , overall the place is clean and handicap accessible .	1620
0	horrible quality of work i paid 143 $ for a detailing package and my car was not clean at all i could 've done a way better job do not go here it was a complete waste of money # unitedstatesnavyveteran	199
1	yay ! they have opened , and they are close to my work . i had an arugula salad with chicken , and it was excellent . they had a nice patio to sit on that was less noisy than inside . good customer service . i was not feeling well that day , and the staff was nice to me . i was getting a migraine and probably looked like i was going to die . i look forward to coming back . i also hope they get their online ordering up and running because i will definately use that .	1161
0	if you are looking for selection and good prices go to buffalo exchange across the street which has 10 times the floor space . fruition has only a small rectangular space , with a rather limited amount of clothes on display . took less than 3 minutes to determine that our visit was a waste of time .	377
1	fabulous experience from the minute we met sales representative , tania . very knowledgable with great suggestions . we order 5 mallin bar stools and we were hoping they would be delivered before july 4th although no promises were made . we were so delighted to get tania 's call saying that we would have them by july 2nd . delivery was scheduled from 1-4 pm and at noon we received a call saying the driver was 30 minutes out . stools were delivered in perfect condition and the driver and assistant were very professional . the cushion color is perfect . we shopped around and pricing was very competitive . we are so happy we chose all american and highly recommend them .	217
0	went there on 1/3/2014 after purchasing vouchers for myself and 2 friends . the massage was not the best . the pressure was inadequate . after the massages for the 3 of us , they would not let us leave till we left the tips that they wanted $ 10-15 minimum . we had to comply in order to leave . it was very uncomfortable .	735
1	absolutely the best customer service i have ever received at a service department at a car dealership . i worked with colby , he was attentive to all my needs inquired if i had any concerns and kept me informed of the process along the way . the service department is so fancy ! they will make you a breakfast sandwich , serve you coffee , give you a bagel , and it 's very comfortable while you wait . it was an attack euler experience great job !	3065
0	our family stayed at this hotel during our visit to toronto . the front desk person was rude and refused to adjust our reasonable request . we ended up with the rooms we did not satisfy with . the lobby looks good . however , the rooms are really old . no better than a motel . the worse thing is that my room had a leaking toilet and the noise kept me from falling in asleep . my mom found several hairs on her bed . obviously , they did not change the sheet . bad experience , wo n't go there again .	2795
1	great place to get away ! the hotel was amazing ! it sat right next to the lake . mexican and luna bistro were really good places to eat at . will be back soon ! !	3916
0	very mediocre pizza . if you 're stranded in the brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you 're really hungry , you 'd be better off walking to the circle k and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives . to everyone who gave it lots of stars , you need to get out more and live a little ... and eat better pizza .	773
1	had my cleaning today and it was great and fast service ! i saw hieu , dr wong and zabee ! all great and the manner in which my grandparents and i were treated was pretty fantastic ! thanks for a stress free visit !	3292
1	shabu shabu paradise is an excellent alternate lunch for anyone wanting to try something new . a brief rundown , shabu shabu is a japanese meal where they bring a hot pot of water with meat and assorted vegetables to be dipped and cooked in the boiling water . you also receive different sauces to add flavor to the meat . their lunch special is a great deal that always leaves me satisfied at the end . also do n't forget , you can always ask for more vegetables to go with your meat . i definitely recommend checking out this restaurant !	285
0	sat for twenty minutes without an acknowledgement from a server . thank god for the busser bringing bread .	1224
0	i just has the most unpleasant experience in this outlet . the poor girl at the register was getting swamped and literally 4 male `` management '' members were just standing around by some shoes engaging in some very inappropriate work place conversation watching the line build . i waited 15 minutes to pay ! ! how ridiculous ! you should really invest your money in a management team that is n't full of a bunch of lazy and rude employees .	1846
0	the office staff is quite rude . they are very inflexible and act like you are lucky to be accepted as a client at all . i will be looking elsewhere .	1712
0	trying to book an appointment is impossible here , i 've called multiple times and was asked to come by a stylist at 10am and once i was here the receptionist with the ombré . latin maybe has been very rude from the start , always with an attitude . she told me that my stylist was already book when my stylist told me she was n't . every time i 've come in , this lady has an attitude . if you 're trying to book here i would n't , receptionists are very rude . and still i 've come back twice now , this place is 30 minutes from me and i still have n't gotten my hair done	354
0	online scheduling process was a breeze . scheduled my onsite replacement three days out ( first available time slot ) and they kept me updated via multiple email and phone calls along the way . safelite called 20 minutes prior to my appointment stating they were short staffed and would not be able make it - requiring a reschedule several more days out . i cancelled the replacement and found another company to complete my work the same day .	2444
1	very nice facility , and most importantly , clean . i used the level 5 bed , which was new and made for a quick and easy tan . the girl that helped me out was helpful and sweet . the prices are a bit more than other tannning spots but you get what you pay for . i definitely recommend this place .	3898
1	this place deserves 5 stars . always phenomenal customer service and consistently amazing coffee . never disappoints -- i highly recommend over any coffee place in phoenix	1484
1	this place is so good ! it just opened up and i loved it . it 's really chill which i love . the burger is n't as big as i thought it would be , but it 's super filling . especially with the amount of fries they give ! looks like fuku just got a new regular . ( ;	964
1	funny story , everything i wrote , i meant ! i accidentally used my husband 's yelp page , oops . i am kim & i love di luxe polish lounge !	1370
1	i came here to buy two new tires for my 2007 prius . all together , the bill was $ 215 . i did n't feel like i was getting ripped off . the people who work there were quite polite and efficient . they also pointed out that i did n't have an inspection sticker ( required by the state ) , so i 'm going back on monday to have those tests done .	3197
1	one of my favorite places to grab a few pints and a bite to eat . really laid back and chill atmosphere , great and friendly staff , good food . and u can always catch the game . great for large groups too .	1091
0	it was ... .. unforgettable . but not for anything awesome . corny , hair-metal , creepy , dark , sorta christmas-ish , stage show with hair whipping , lasers , flames , tigers and dragons . ( yes . dragons ) sounds like it should be a giant stocking stuffed with awesome . yeah ... not so much . that said , you 'll be talking about this mess for years to come .	2968
1	had an awesome time today . signed my son up for the intro to archery class . the instructor , tim , took time with each archer and gave helpful tips so everyone was able to hit the targets . terriffic way to spend an afternoon . will be signing up for more classes . the prices compared to overall value is a huge win !	471
1	love it ... . just need to get theirs booking partners on same page with check in check outs also they can a few smoking rooms only thing i was unhappy about but i was in heaven ... .	2973
0	went in to get some work done by chris . he was going to fill in two tattoos that were already stenciled out . paid 300 dollars to have him fill in one on my hand to have him dip out in the middle of our session . he added on a bunch of beads going down my hand in a line that was n't straight and tattooed over another artist work without my permission . my tattoo looks like shit and am now doing sessions costing me thousands to get it lasered off . cheers to the most expensive/shitiest tattoo on my body . thanks chris	1658
1	i love living here . last night my air went out . i called the after hours number and their maintenance guy can out at 10:30 at night and fixed my air-conditioning unit . the office staff is incredibly helpful and friendly . they make you feel very comfortable . highly recommend this place	2745
0	i did a deposit at this location today . the deposit machine was a mess ; there was a subway cup sitting right next to it , and numerous receipts from previous customers all over the surrounding counter . none of the employees seemed to be doing anything productive . you 'd think they could at least keep the place tidy . even the tellers booth had trash on it . i 've never been to such an unkempt bank ! the least they could do is acknowledge the existence of their customers , but not here .	2983
0	sad ... i was n't expecting great . i was expecting some service and maybe a drink now and again . when the place is packed and the food beats the first round of drinks to the table there is a problem . if you are looking for a drink and shot place , you are good ( at bar or door service only ) . if you are looking for anything slightly above a dive bar- this is not your place . lots of better options very close . downhill further and further the last few years .	2532
1	i really like this place . somewhere between a whole foods and hinens . they have a great meat selection to include lots of ohio local beef . the produce section is fantastic . they have a lot of those things you do n't find at the standard stores without paying whole paycheck prices . their international and seasonal section is great . lots of bbq sauce selections as well as hot sauces . their store brand pasta and sauces , cooler in the back by the bakery , is great . the prices are in line with ge , but much less then wf . selection much larger than tj ,	495
0	gave this ht a try after the remodel . my normal one is the east blvd location . horrible produce selection . more than one dairy/frozen item was close to expiring . i picked up a frozen pizza about to expire in 2 days . i would not have been a happy camper if i took it home and went to enjoy the home run inn goodness a week later and found it was expired . my purpose of the trip was to restock on fage yogurt . i could n't buy many as they were expiring in 4 days . i will stick to the east blvd and morrocroft locations . until publix opens closer , then i 'll give that a try .	1061
0	they can give you a venti cup but they dont have to fill it up . check your drinks in the drive thru	2358
0	horrible , tried to use my store credit that they wrote me and i even asked when they wrote it `` how long is it good for ? '' and they told me anytime its like cash . i 'm told that it is now only good for 1 month cause the old guy was fired . on top of losing out on my $ 60 the kid behind the counter acts like he is too busy talking to his girlfriend behind the counter about her friend to come help me . definitely gon na go other places	2342
0	do not buy the groupon for the jcpenney optical department . it 's not a good deal . it 's just to get you in the door . you ca n't buy a reasonable pair of eyeglasses for the groupon price .	223
0	this place is such a waste of money . think applebee 's atmosphere , with food that has no flavor whatsoever . i mean none . it 's like they went out of their way to make everything as bland as possible . i got the shrimp tacos.. with no flavor . my girlfriend got the chicken sandwich.. that tasted like it was made before seasoning was invented . you 've been warned : over priced , under spiced , and the most forgettable meal of my life .	201
0	this company is horrible ! ! ! ! the front desk receptionists have no manners . brandon was my go to guy and in charge of my unit and it was impossible to get anything fixed . i moved into a town home with no screens , broken glass , broken cabinets and cat hair and urine infested carpets . as soon as our year was up we moved out and got jipped my almost $ 900 deposit . worst experience ever and i do not recommend anyone to rent from this horrible company .	3451
1	this chinese dessert place always brings back old memories ! it 's been around for many years and it 's still very popular in the area . they make really good black sesame soup - not too sweet and rich with flavour . the fried milk is also delish - not too oily or heavy . they have a pretty comprehensive list of all the hk dessert favourites as well as savory items such as the street style rice rolls and claypot rice . good spot for some late night snacking .	1062
1	if you are looking for a good preschool check out granny 's little genius . it is like family with owners who love the children and the teachers are dedicated to learning . it seems like every time we drop off our child there is another experience for them . my son has a ball here !	3836
1	simply botox but after 15 years the best ! thank you to dr. ross stutman , md , i believe you get what you pay for and this will last ! i will be back for filler and trust in your services .	2099
0	my wife needed her nails done , went here and it was slow and they did a horrible job . paint all over her skin on every nail . treated her hands like a lawnmower blade and not like a human . rough . coarse and sloppy . she will not be going back .	2922
1	now , i know that not everyone is perfect ! so with that in mind , i have always had great service at the pepboys on rancho . if something did n't go how it should have or there were ever any problems , they were always quick to fix it and to make sure i was always happy ! ! now with that in mind , i just received a very nice gift for christmas from the fleet regional manager rick skarda . just the thought alone was a great gift ! so i guess what i 'm trying to say is , they take care of there people ! ! ! !	2263
1	we are new to the area and found jasmine buffet through yelp . good selection , friendly staff , and clean atmosphere .	1302
1	love this place , i bring my 3 dogs all the time they do a great job and staff treats them like their own .	3779
0	walked with some lady friends of mine . asked the bartender some simple questions about what 's available . it was obvious from her response that women of colour are not welcome in this establishment . people of colour and allies go elsewhere .	3077
0	this dentist office is one to stay clear of . the dentist missed a broken tooth my wife had . the hygienist did a bad job on both myself and my daughter . the dentist also missed a number of problems with my families teeth and the business office over-billed us and were very rude . stay away from this place .	3766
1	my first time going in i only had a pedicure , which was awesome ! ! my second time i returned to try nexgen nails which they promote a lot and is a bit more pricey than regular acrylic ( $ 35 ) . the set lasted me six weeks ! ! i had no lifting nor did my hair get stuck . definitely will be returning .	838
1	very helpful and friendly staff . they greeted us as soon as we came in and asked how they could help , offering coffee and a couch for my husband . they have good quality fabric and their selection was different from other shops i 've been in . i 'll definitely be going back !	3136
1	awesome service ! i accidentally sent my mobile order to a different location ( and i was already late for work ) and the team graciously offered to save me the trip and make my order anyways . made my morning ! : )	1532
1	i have been to this post office several times . the last time i was there the guy behind the counter was so friendly and helpful . he went above and beyond to make sure to help me find the best way to package something at the best price . i am impressed with the excellent customer service and kindness from them !	2034
1	i was a new patient here and they took my insurance ( bcbs ppo ) . i saw dr. suni ( sunildat maheshwari ) and he was amazing . he took time to talk to me about what i was there for - he set his clipboard aside and we talked for about 15 minutes . the staff is friendly , but a bit busy for my taste - which is of course a good sign . i have been looking for a new pcp for awhile now and i believe i 've found it . the parking is great , it 's in a nice part of town , and the hours are awesome : late hours mon-thurs , and open weekends .	1562
0	spoiled beer , rude service , and bad location . would n't recommend to my worst enemy . trust me , steer clear of this dump .	421
0	the only reason why this place gets one star is because it was really organized and clean . my mom bought some of there meat and there was some discoloration of the meat and the meat had a god awful smell to it . i ended up getting sick from the meat . never buying meat here.. a little disappointed because it was my first time	1595
1	good pizza at a great price . the all meat pizza was loaded with toppings and hit the spot . the homemade lasagna was some of the best i 've had .	459
1	they were recommended to me by a friend who lives here , we are from oregon and visit every year for a month or two we had some air conditioning problems , freon , and matthew help us and got us back on the road . as i was waiting , i watched matthew with other customers , he was very helpful , knowledgeable , and professional , because of him i would recommend autozone to others if they need help . thanks matthew , bill and nancy from oregon ( see next march )	2502
1	a very nice salad enjoyed vey much but the person with had to ask for bread to be grilled and more sauce as it was very little .	1212
1	i 've been coming here for a while now and have to say im never let down . food and service have always been impeccable .	431
0	came here today 9/1 to pick up some donuts and they were completely rude . did n't even get a hello entering and was basically ignored . the blond kid behind the register had no clue on how to use it . the older female took forever to pick out a dozen and i do n't see why it would take 2 people to to fill 1 order . as i waited patiently to be served , they continue to ignore me by serving another guy that had just walked in . talk about complete bullshit .	2053
1	dr deka is great , she really takes good care of her patients and is always available if you have any questions . i highly recommend her	1589
1	cecil was awesome and honest ! he diagnosed the problem and told us the best option . i would definitely call mojave air conditioning again for any of my a/c needs .	2031
1	part of the next part of our anniversary night we came here for dessert round 2 ! for smores and a really nice place to lounge and be all romantic was perfect . took a very long to get our smores but the waiter informed us it was because there were only a limited allowed smores fires to be used in that restaurant .	621
0	do not like the way they do eyebrows and i went twice nothing changed.. i even showed her a picture of what i want and i have really nice thick eyebrows i just wanted my arch raised a little higher and cleaned up still left there very unhappy , have n't been since	3140
1	i come to this fry 's about once or twice every month . i love that they have drop off childcare for while you shop . that makes `` boring '' grocery trips more tolerable for my kiddo . i am always pleasantly surprised by the level of customer service the employees here provide . everyone seems so chipper and friendly . i am glad it is tucked away and not too busy here ! if you live in the ahwatukee foothills , you should shop here !	1967
1	second time my husband and i have used them . we bought our first camera system from costco . great product . easy to use . tech support was very helpful when we had a question . we needed to buy a new dvr . because we had a problem with the old one we had for four years . again customer service was wonderful and very helpful . we bought a new dvr . we were given a delivery due date that was acceptable . we got our new dvr a week earlier than expected . we will continue to use them . we have friends and family we have turned onto lorextech for their home security system .	2131
0	went in for the $ 19.99 oil change . ended up with a $ 100 bill , a laundry list of stuff to fix on the car and to top it off they damaged the o ring on the oil filter causing a further oil leak . will not go back here again !	3379
1	what a great place . my daughter and i were visiting from toronto , went for frozen yogurt one night and saw this place . next day we decided we needed a spot to get a new set of nails for her and a fill for myself . i called ahead from our hotel and they said they would stay open for us which was incredibly kind . got there at 730 pm and we both received our services quickly and professionally . they did a great job for both of us . will be back any time we are in vegas !	1272
0	service was good when i could get it but they tried to sell you parts not really needed - e.g . run capacitor . scheduling is always an issue with these folks , even when you have a maintenance agreement . better figure on three months out and you have to call them to schedule the appointment . i 'm done - finding a closer service provider .	1718
1	excited about the new place in the northside . finally have a place to drink sunday night . great beer selection . had a burger which was done extremely well . only down side was no one was here . people help support this bar . pirates season will be amazing but i do n't want them to reduce the hours . how many times were you looking for a chill place to eat and drink on a sunday night .	839
0	simply put ... it 's ok. a quick stop if you 're thirsty and want to spend starbucks money for a mediocre level product . cashiers were friendly & accommodating but i wo n't be visiting again .	2204
1	lorenzo is the only place and person i trust for my watches and jewelry he 's honest . works hard . and is very reasonable for the quality work he has done he has refurbished my grandfathers omega constellation , changed out bands , and repaired my wife 's tennis bracelet wish there were more places like this in town !	2064
0	i drove past this place a few times , and it seemed to have some potential . boy was i wrong . awful . the steak was so overdone i could n't chew it . the grilled shrimp were average . the best part of the dish was the seasoned rice , so no , i wo n't be going back .	1486
1	eddie came to our residence promptly , spent a great deal of time diagnosing the issue . made two trips ( at no extra charge ) to a supplier . he was personable , informative , and very careful with our refrigerator . particularly in removal and re installation . although eddie went above and beyond in terms of repairs and services his price very reasonable and a bargain . we will use a-1 appliance and eddie from here on and we are telling all of our friends and relatives about him .	3879
1	one of the few good korean restaurant in this area . they cut back on some things from the last time i came . but the food was good . i 'll be back .	435
1	i do not come here often but today the service was very good . my cashier was very helpful and sweet with a very nice smile . i appreciate good service ! the restroom needed attention but other than that very nice .	1220
0	to many times i 've been in there and they are just to busy talking to each other to help anyone . yesterday i stood right in front of two employees and they both looked at me , turned away and kept talking . i went to leave and one yelled out asking if she could help me . i went elsewhere and spent a couple hundred dollars . i 've spent a lot of money on their over priced stuff because i like to shop locally . but if they do n't care if i spend my money elsewhere then why should i ?	3612
0	what type of bar serves drinks in a thimble you ask ? this one ! what a freaking rip off . sure the waitresses were hot , but in zona , apparently all of the girls are hot . well at least in the .5 mile radius . they must grow because of the sun . they probably use photosynthesis . the atmosphere was n't too bad , but it was your typical bar , with typical bar food , with typical douchebags . solid one star for the rip off drink amounts .	180
1	where have you been all my life ? for the pastry snob that is used to delicacy type pastries , french and european , this place does n't disappoint . from eclairs and french horns , macaroons to cupcakes , i will never eat pastries from anywhere else again . and need a custom cake ? they do that too ; and better than any others i 've ever seen . i will never have a dessert from anywhere else but baker wee now for the rest of my life . quality , but affordable . thank you for reviving my dessert taste buds !	868
0	unlimited data means unlimited - not after 26gigs we slow your data down to an unusable level - this rule has to go - it is wrong to advertise that data is unlimited when it is not true . the people want unlimited fast data at any cost so invest in your network and upgrade it to make it happen . the wifi rates are outrageous and do n't make any sense - a second unlimited phone data line cost $ 50/month but wifi is $ 95 for only 22 gigs	1032
1	oh how i love me some mamason ! i came to wigland to explore my options being i refuse to do a lot with my hair this summer . oh how i wish i knew the ladies name at this shop being she is the sweetest most helpful lady . i can say if you visit on a day she not there , the gentleman is not as nice and helpful and seems to get skittish if there are to many people in the in the store at one time . if the store is slow , he can be pretty helpful . i 'll be back in the near future for more shirley 's !	1873
0	i had to bring my daughter here , because she was sick , we just moved to az , so do n't have a pediatrician for her yet . the staff was friendly , great doctor . they did n't do much , regular check up . ear , throat , check her temperature , and charged us $ 150 ... . for urgent care ? ? ? ? ? i am used to paying $ 40 . and they do n't tell u that in advance . will never go back ...	3698
1	as an update to my original post - gold 's took notice of my initial review and called me personally to thank me for the kind words and for being such a great member ! it 's awesome to hear from them and it just reinforces my love for gold 's ! if anyone is new to pittsburgh and looking for a health club , i would strongly suggest you checking them out ! thanks again for the call , the free month of membership , and the tshirt !	2338
0	from a visit a few months ago ... .when it was still hot outside i had the bahn mi dog w/ fries . it was very good . only major complaint was that the a/c was not working in the restaurant , so it was very hot .	1566
1	getting refinance on my car . great service ask for shue he is the best for your banking needs i got my higher interest cc transferred to a lower no annual fee and no transfer fee up to 2 months so i am saving 400 dollars each month . i am a happy camper .	3202
0	i was not able to place a togo order at the bar . bartender told me she was `` slammed '' . i had to walk to togo area to place order . i have never experienced this in any restaurant before . server was rude and not very welcoming as well . i did not receive a thank you for stopping in or anything . food was good , but the hospitality was not there from the bartender-3/30/18	1189
1	do n't go here often but needed something fabric related for a little diy project i was doing . the staff was helpful ( i had no idea where to look ) and i was in and out pretty quick .	3943
0	our doctors office moved here ( dr/owner retired ) so we had no choice but to try 4c . we were with our former drs office 22 years , but we will be with 4c only 2 visits . the service levels are simply ho-hum to disappointing . bye bye .	938
1	been here a couple of time . people here are always nice . mocha red bean smoothy is good .	716
0	we often order bubble tea from formocha , their tea is good and it 's close to the office . but every time we order big , this time 21 drinks , there is always something wrong or maybe is a new type of drink , 3 of us ordered match milk tea ( photo attached ) , they came with the perfect description on each drink , the colour is not as traditional matcha is , instead it is yellow ( like mango yellow ) , perhaps it is the new matcha ?	989
0	if the service was greatly improved , i may consider going back . the wraps are delicious . having to wait over 10 minutes to get drink orders and another 15 or so for food orders is a little ridiculous . especially for a place that 's never too busy .	1319
0	should have known better when all the other places around were busy and their parking lot was empty.server sucked , no ice in our drinks , cold fries , nasty chili or dog food , over priced frozen bar food and our orders were incorrect . we had a party of 9 , even my daughters grilled cheese was cold and not grilled . huge bill for nasty food , weird service and a regret for not just going to harrolds . i could make a list of things wrong with the food but i would be typing all day . wo n't go back .	211
1	this location is pretty big ! two levels . the staff is usually nice , they greet you and help you as well . my only probably is that this place is always a mess . all their things are every where . other than that i do n't mind going to this location .	1872
1	food and atmosphere great but service terrible . saw the server 3 times in 1 hour . no second drink and no dirty plated taken . hope it was just him .	632
1	i have come to taylors a few times now for things here and there and gotten really great prices as well as customer service ! as sometimes it may happen i got a bad part about 2 weeks ago and my car overheated yesterday and i could not move it . two of the guys from taylors came all the way to my home to make it right and put a new radiator on again ! talk about above and beyond ! i am so grateful and will be continuing my business relationship here for all my cars needs ! thankyou don , mark and eric for today : )	2308
1	i am so impressed with the pediatric side of montevista hospital in las vegas , nv . for 3 yrs we have tried to get help for our grandson . no one in az has helped . finally , the long term care he is getting should help ! at the very least , we have a break from all his abuse to us ! the hospital is pristine in cleanliness , the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable , the psychiatrist was very easy to work with and finally someone is listening and seeing the hell we 've been through for 11 yrs .	2068
1	its ayt . love the steak burrito swimming in cheese and sauce . but it a $ 1 to be like that . not a fan of the lighting , i dont like eating in the dark .	1365
1	love that they give you a huge bowl and they fill it all the way up . the salad is made fresh right in front of you , service was fast and it was crowded . staff was friendly as well .	147
1	got my free birthday egg sandwich great customer service , will definitely be back if in the area and need a quick breakfast .	1214
1	this was amazing . i drove in for a quick wash . i was pleasantly surprised they had a drive-through option ! it was a great price , very quick and my car looks amazing . the quick wash got my car very clean ! i will definitely be back to this location .	127
1	went in and was going to get a new game but insisted to give me the used version so that o can return it if i do t like it and that was awesome how they try to save u money	3027
0	i placed an order for a carbon fiber hood . i completed the order process online , my card was charged the full amount plus $ 75 shipping . i was emailed the next day and told that i needed to pay an additional 135 for shipping . when i received the shipping notice email ( 2 weeks later ) i noticed the shipping amount was significantly less . when i questioned it i was told the additional was for sales tax and when i questioned that , i never heard back . i wo n't be doing business again with vividracing.com . that is a shady .	978
0	after buying $ 1,000 washing machine from these guys it broke . while it was still under warranty it took over eight weeks for them to come and fix it . can you imagine going 8 weeks without a washing machine ! i went to these guys because they were local and i wanted to support a local business but it will be the last time that i buy anything from them . they have great customer service until something goes wrong and then you 're sol .	3784
1	i think the main guy who works here is named mo . he was such a friendly and cool person to talk to . he gave me a sweet deal on a water pipe that i bought . i highly , highly recommend going to hi life . it definitely beats the smoke shop right behind it .	1556
0	customer service is terrible . needed to do an exchange and they were more concerned with keeping inventory straight . they make that situation the customers problem .	3780
1	very friendly service..went out of their way to make my order . gave me a free drink for my inconvience .	870
1	john helped us out this morning . he was charming , helpful and generous ! got us hooked up with a free upgrade to a mustang ( as it was available ) . it was very quick and pain free experience , not your usual when it comes to car rentals . thank you john ! the price was right , the service great ; this was the most streamlined car rental experience for us to date . do n't go to fox , spend the extra hundred for proper service and a quality vehicle .	2134
1	managed to get a great deal by booking several months in advance at this hotel and glad we did . the hotel appears to be brand new and is modern and elegantly designed . the rooms are well appointed and beautifully furnished ... there was a little noise from other guests , but not obtrusive . the free use of gold 's gym was also a great bonus ... all in all , we loved it and would not hesitate to return ...	3859
1	i was in town to play in a celebrity/ charity hockey tourney . met up with some boys from college and stayed here . the hotel was great . pool was fantastic . location was great . only down side was there was some construction going on outside and they started at 7am sharp . it sounded like it was right outside our rooms . the sliding doors were shut , but did n't help . thank god that was only friday morning as they were n't working sat and sun .	1859
1	this was a perfect hotel for a 4-day stay . hotel staff was nice . my room overlooked a park . it was really quiet all day and all night . the room was clean and tidy . there was plenty of parking . room was just a few steps away from my car . back entrances are access-controlled with the room key . good selection of television stations . price was awesome too !	2772
1	from my first encounter with cassie , my sales rep , through the final modifications to my in-floor cleaning system , ( thanks ron and jarod ) cdc pools demonstrated their ability to transform an old , worn out eyesore into a beautiful , showpiece . i am no longer embarrassed to have friends and family over for a swim party . instead , i welcome every opportunity to show off the terrific job done by cdc pools . the new tile , stair accents and micro-pebble tech finish look so nice that sometimes my wife and i sit out back with no intent of swimming , just to enjoy the oasis cdc has created for us . would i use cdc again , most definitely !	659
0	a storage locker is just a storage locker . the only thing that really makes one better than the next is price and customer service . i made the mistake of not shopping around and when i discovered that public storage on camelback is significantly more than its competitors , i still was n't motivated to relocate to more reasonable storage until the office staff became increasingly rude . paying more is irritating but there was no way i was going to continue to support staff who have no sense of customer satisfaction and basic courtesy . clearly they do n't realize that the bottom line is that it is the cusomter that pay their salary . never again , good riddance	3521
1	this has the be the best dentist office i have been to . they treat you with the utmost respect and are patient . i have had my wisdom teeth pulled and many other things completed and have never had an issue . they are very up to date with technology which is a plus for someone like me . they send you text reminders of appointments so you do n't have to answer a call on your busy work day . thank you dental depot for all you do !	3004
0	i have been a customer at this walgreens for over 15 years . the quality of the staff has gone back and forth during that time . but i had an experience this evening that needs to be recorded . roxeanne was rude and condescending during my transaction . i would not post a bad review under just any circumstances . but , she was what i would call `` flippant '' . she was snotty and disrespectful . she is not someone that i feel walgreens really wants as the `` face '' of their company .	1733
0	brought out cold food . to be fair , they changed it for us and apologized but did not taste good at all . i would 've been able to make a better pasta sauce and cutlet at home . the wine was also brought to us after the food because they did n't have enough wine glasses . a joke ! extremely overrated .	728
1	they do an amazing job ! i always receive compliments after i have them done there . the other time i was in utah and had them done , the person did a horrible job ... so came back to vegas and my girl did her thang ! would 've given 5 stars but as said on previous reviews ... the girls are a bit cold , unwelcoming and not very charismatic .	460
1	this experience was a joy . the food was great . service was great . i started out at the currito burrito . without borders . they were rude . went to marathon and they offered a frequent buyer card . such a great experience . i 'll be back here .	6
0	not sure how `` feelings '' are involved here . this is a business transaction . you delivered subpar amateurish work and were judged for it . deal with it and adjust . provide competant trained employees and screw the damn cap on . excuses do no one no good . your response offered nothing more than to further demonstrate your lack of accountability .	565
1	i lifted my boycott . i am a creepy guy . i like coming here and doing hoodrat stuff with my friends . http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qcqognqyxp4	2004
0	super shady business practices , getting out of a gym membership is easier than getting out of one of the packages ! they claim freezing or canceling is possible when you give a months notice but it 's a lie . the owner is rude . no thanks ! go anywhere else , there 's a ton of places around that do n't charge nearly as much and are much nicer .	1816
1	ordered by phone from the states . left vm the night before and was woken up the next morning by a chipper and helpful salesgirl who was ready with suggestions .	1927
0	i 'm member for two years . lately me and my wife we do not have the time to drive to the fitness because of the kids practise every other day . we decide to cancel the month to month contract . first takes over 20 minutes on the phone . second they will charge you for the next month fee because they need 30 days notice . third they will charge you a yearly fee . so it may looks affordable but if you decide to cancel does not look that audible anymore .	342
0	horrible cust . service there atms machines were down had my family all packed up to watch a movie with no consideration the manager says sorry there 's nothing we can do , i even asked can we eat h the movie and after pay after and he says nope ! but tell me to go across the street and use the atm there , my movie was about to start and i explained that also just think there was more he could of done then just shut us down so if off the amc we go ! ! !	2524
0	worst ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do not use ! ! ! i 've moved over 15 times in my life and this is by far the worst company i 've ever dealt with . lot 's of up charges after the fact ... they did a lot of damage . the sales people do there job and it all sounds great and then look out ! ! ! ! ! !	2975
0	possibly the most useless and indifferent gate staff . not helpful , not attentive . basically , check yourself in ... no explanation nor apology for flight delays ... uncomfortable seats , inefficient process .	1623
0	this place back in the early 2000 was much better tasting according to my memory . the squid and fish balls were larger and better tasting . same owner , but the place looks `` tired '' if you know what i mean . such a shame , i really enjoyed their noodle back then .	1477
1	these folks are great . they have dog and cat supplies too . great service to your car . they ask to help you . advice and assistance is freely offered .	530
0	i do n't care if it is good or it bites . i 've been waiting 45 min since ordering with no food served in a restaurant with only 4 of 25 tables occupied . never again	50
1	service is good . they are all kind and nice . and omgosh their massage was unforgettably great .	3559
0	the service at this location is slow , the prices are outrageous , the food is totally sub-par , the drinks are always made super duper weak , and they close really early . i do n't suggest coming here for a good time . the servers are nice , but i would suggest going to a more delicious location .	705
1	penguin air was perfect and steve was wonderful ! patiently explained the system , how it works and how to get the best and safest use from the equipment . will gladly have him back , thank you steve ! !	2203
0	came out to check my water softener . told me that the unit is disposable and not worth repairing . i was charged $ 90 for the 15 min it took to diagnose and tell me that . so now the new water softener will just be an extra $ 90 . do n't recommend .	3138
0	i was looking for a nice nail place and went here because of the reviews . i am not happy with my choice . they do horrible job . the lady was very fast at painting my nails and it looks messy . good thing i chose nail color that does n't show her messiness . i would n't recommend this place . if you like your nails neat , go somewhere else .	2977
0	this is the worst dealership i have ever done business with . had my car a couple of months . these people are unprofessional and a bunch of damn crooks . sold myself and my husband a car passenger side rear view mirror broke we were promised that it would get fixed . had this car for 7 months or so and still has n't been fixed . first they say they can fix it then they say they ca n't find a part so it will be a used part . everyone there are assholes and unprofessional .	1488
1	highly recommend focus plumbing ! jim was really nice and very helpful ! he gave us some good tips and i felt like he genuinely cared and not just there to get money . give them a call for all your pluming needs .	1714
1	first off land rover las vegas is a tier 1 establishment . second to none . after you buy a vehicle the person you interact with the most at the dealership is your service advisor . gary morris , my service advisor , has helped me over the years with 3 different vehicles . gary 's customer service is top notch and he always makes my visit as easy as possible . it 's people like this that bring value to a company and that have helped keep me and my family land rover customers .	2659
1	very good pizza , though the thin crust got soggy quickly . the thick crust might be the way to go , if you can handle all that dough . we had the quattro formagio on thin crust , and it was one of the best 4 cheese pizzas i 've eaten . sauce was good , cheese was great quality . only quibble is about that crust - i like my cracker thin and crispy ! service was reasonably quick and polite , maybe a bit better than we experienced other places in a tourist oriented town . one pizza fed 2 of us quite satisfactorily .	282
1	excellent food and great service . this is my favorite cora as there 's normally not a long wait ( if any ) for a table , and food arrives at a reasonable speed . the waitresses are very helpful also , and keeps checking back on us for refills on our coffee .	1060
1	adorable coffee shop on the west side . very eclectic & comfy cozy . good music & lots of interesting places to sit . the frappucchino is really wonderful too .	2219
0	this has to be the worst indian restaurant i 've ever eaten at . maybe they were having a bad night , but the food was atrocious . i ordered chicken tikka masala and the color of the masala looked like light brown dog food . the taste was super bland and i could only eat about one third of the meal before throwing it out . the chicken was dry , chewy and far from any kind of tenderness . we also had the chicken tikka and the chicken was also the same , hard and chewy . super disappointing meal !	640
0	this is now called zips car wash. we just got the cheapest car wash package ( $ 10 ) with free pre-big treatment . the whole car wash did very little . left dirt on the back , bird poop and bugs all over the front of the car . only good thing was the suction of the vacuum . i 'll go back taking my chances with a gas station car wash from now on .	3036
1	a surprise find with a great mission . food was delicious -- had the `` turkey day '' with cran-peña ( yes - cranberry & jalapeño ) sauce on super good sourdough bread comes with a salad that has homemade dressing and cherry tomatoes sliced on a mandolin ! my husband had a pot roast dip sandwich that was huge and it was actually was turkey - yet tasted like beef ! also enjoyed a lot ! their mission of working with three main charity organizations for assistance is touted and obvious inside the restaurant . great people work who are warm and very helpful . going back ! ! !	277
0	every time i go in there david helps me he needs to get a sense of humor change his attitude because he 's a bump on a log and is not inviting or friendly	2159
0	i contacted this business because they had such great reviews . i moved to arizona almost a year ago and did n't want to go another summer without protecting the paint on my suv . i asked for a quote for oxidation removal and protective coat on my toyota 4runner . the emailed response i received was `` sorry , we are booked a week out . '' really ? i only asked for a quote and would have waited for an appointment .	2382
1	i 'm always treated with respect when i go in . these people always remember my name and i 'm not a big tipper , i 'm on a budget . i plan to start using yelp more often and letting people know my opinions .	1783
0	me and my friend visit this place im not really crazy about this place its really old and dark inside , food is ok but not really in top of the line for restaurant like this ! and they can really use a big remodeling ,	717
0	the crab legs were delivered cold and with no krackers . no refills on drinks . waitress friendly but not accommodating in her profession . spoke to mgt but doubt it made difference . i hate leaving bad reviews because the person reading doesnt know the background or basis of my post . check my other reviews	201
1	i 've always liked mexican food but when i tried my first chipotle bowl , it absolutely blew me away . i love mexican food for sure . & with jalapeno sauce it is even better . this is definitely a place i can always stop by to grab a quick bite at .	214
1	great days of golf and two terrific meals outside with a sunset . great pace to get away for the day .	1138
1	this place is very organized , friendly and unique . staff was on the ball and made sure every customer was attended to . it is a bit pricey , but i will definitely go again .	3813
0	horrible property management company , one cheap chinese broker . kept our deposit and neglected thru out our stay . do not rent a property from these bogus cheap place . should be rated f+	3375
0	the security took the drink out of my hand even though it was 15 minutes before close . everyone else was great but the management was awful .	1176
0	i was a member here for years , loved the people . volunteered as a prayer chaplain . wow , lots of things have changed ! not 4 the good ! they now have a pastoral care minister from chicago who is extremely prejudiced against vegans , kicked me off the prayer chaplain program and asked me not to come back to worship ! consider me gone ! at least until this jimmy scott person is !	1899
1	defiantly the best car wash i 've ever been to ! i got a triple step wax by husam and he made my car feel like it had a brand new gloss finish and in the sun it looks like a mirror ! the service was amazing and he was super kind and confidant in his detailing . i really recommend coming to this car wash for all your detailing needs !	2198
0	i went in here to pick up some odds and ends and was trailed by the security guard like a bad smell . i am very familiar with the area and completely aware of the necessity for vigilance to avoid being robbed blind , but this was intense . i do n't think i look particularly sketchy especially in comparison to some of the other clientele . and i know i should n't take it personally , but hot damn it annoyed me and was enough to make me boycott this location permanently .	3384
1	the food and drinks here are pretty good , especially if you go for their lunch/dinner special ! but the service here is really bad , the servers do n't really pay attention . if you 're going during popular times you can expect a line up .	176
0	panda express food is awesome as it ever had been since i tried back in california , when i saw that they were now here in cleveland , i jumped with joy ! ! all was great ! except the employees , they are rude , they made fun of a gentleman just because he wanted more soy sauce in his plate , the girl went to her manager mocking that they did not have gravy at that location ! talk about culture shock for this girl ! ! even though i really like panda express , i will not return to this location cause of the rude employees ! learn to appreciate your customers and their culture !	1075
0	came to to bass pro shop to see santa ... . kids were very excited to see santa.. advertisement says santa will be there till 5 .. we got there like around 3:30 and line to santa was already closed.. it 's bullshit how they advertise something that ai n't even true.. we drove pretty far just for bs..	2601
1	this is a great place ! they sometimes do have a long line and some some extra cashiers but here 's a helpful hint : most times if there is a long line you can pay with a credit card inside the hotel . overall the staff is very friendly and helpful and the grooming salon is wonderful as is the banfield located in the store . their staff and nurses are some of the best we have experienced since we started using banfield ! !	2108
1	the best thai food on this side of town . i usually get the massaman curry or the pineapple fried rice and both are as good as you can get anywhere . it is a small mom and pop kind of place for dining in but great service and really good food .	1450
1	it 's the 3rd time i used their service , this time for my chihuahua mix and our new baby yorkie ! the tech was on time , friendly and helpful , she even gave me tips on what to do in between grooming visits . my babies look and smell so good ! i am very pleased !	1218
1	i received on time delivery which was professional and fast . they assembled my bed in less time than i thought it would take . they were friendly but took care of business . i love my new guest room bed .	3854
1	i set up an appointment online and got a call within 10 minutes . they showed up at my door in 20 . courteous and quick . they even walked through my irrigated yard to carry my junk to their truck . very affordable and professional . highly recommended . i 'd give them more stars if offered ! !	3663
0	service is very rushed . went to have an updo done for an event and the stylist took his time the first 35 minutes and then rushed the rest of it to try and get it done . he was clearly trying to make his appointment . i was not satisfied with my hair . one side looked great but the other was flat and he was rushing to pin it . stylists would benefit from more time allotted for updos . when paying that much , the client deserves the proper attention .	2509
0	the absolute worst management . the people are not happy , no one acts like they care if you shop there or not . they carry only the most basic items , as though it were a poorly run 7-11 . i tell myself every time i go , that it will be my last trip ... and then i forget since its so close to my home . but today they had there last chance at my money . i am done with them and safeway . no stars . but i had to choose at least one	2105
0	a real disappointment . the service was slow , our waiter was annoyingly arrogant , food was very average ( tuna was accompanied with potatoes in a tomato purée and some kind of spice that did n't match very well ) and it was over priced . tacky decor too . do n't waste your time .	971
0	1 star for the soda that was the best thing i had here . the asada taco did n't have no taste , and the pork taco was burnt . the cashier was rude .	791
0	worst customer experience i 've ever had . not only did they destroy my clothing , they tried blaming the high end manufacturer . take responsibility for your actions . the manufacturer would be out of business if the clothes got destroyed every time they were taken to a dry cleaner .	861
1	been meaning to try this place for a while and finally tonight my husband and i stopped in for dinner at the bar . the service was friendly , atmosphere was a nice surprise for such a small town and we both were really happy with our meals . we will definitely be back . a great local spot .	982
0	went here a while ago . it 's in a pretty bad area . my barber took for ever with my my hair . i made an appointment so no waiting . but he would talk at moments to others the . would focus back on my hair . and to be honest i did not like the haircut .	3574
0	ridiculously bad `` doctors . '' the internet helped me with my foot problem , but the `` doctor '' did n't seem to want to really help me at all with my real problem ( my foot ) , he really wanted me to say that i was depressed or anxious so that he could give me some meds ! `` so ... are you depressed ? '' `` no . '' `` are you sure ? ? ? ''	2631
0	poorly executed ... who serves coors , blue moon and cider at a mexican taco festival ? no mexican beer ? what the hell ? $ 6 for a crap beer and you have to eat standing up ! do n't waste your time .	1392
0	i took my bike there over the summer to have the brakes repaired and a general tune up . i was told it would take about a week . after twelve days i called and it still was n't ready . if it was going to take so long they could have just told me in the first place or at least called after a week or so to say it would be a few more days . i also had an issue with the seat that needed addressed , however that problem was not fixed , the seat still swivels back and forth when i ride . they did fix the brakes , but not sure if i would go there again .	1931
1	the manager , jason sanford , is the best ! friendly and knowledgable ! if you want a great experience , see him ! he 'll help you with all your needs !	1059
0	i 've never felt less welcomed at a gym in my life . a lot of the staff members are extremely rude and only care about making a sale . sleazy place , half of the pictures posted above are n't even this la fitness . overall , i 'd recommend looking at other gyms .	2066
1	i was recently referred to midas by autozone . unfortunately , this was a result of unintentional damage to the head lights in my car by an autozone employee . autozone corrected the problem by providing two new complete head lights assemblies which were installed by midas . the midas employees were friendly , worked very quickly , and the work was done to my satisfaction . i was in and out of the store in 25 minutes . i was very please with the service provided .	1055
0	unprofessional , expensive , sloppy work . do i need to say more ? ? most of the employees here are very unprofessional they like to be on there phones n talking to each other more then they talk to the customers . they really do n't know what good customer service is about and to top it off their work is pretty sloppy .	655
0	bought the teak butcher block . it is chipped and severely warped . you ca n't open the box to view it before purchasing . they will not refund our money for this bad product . one week before christmas even ! so now we are stuck with this faulty , non leveled countertop . do yourself a favor and go somewhere more reputable .	2763
1	super fast , efficient and knowledgable service . the owner was friendly and patiently answering passport and passport photo - related questions from the person he was serving before me , even though i 'm sure he 's repeated the same phrases a gazillion times . i waited in line , got my photo taken and was out the door in probably 5 mins . i 'm not exaggerating ! mondays at lunch hour seem to be a really good time to stop by .	2753
0	we walked to the dealership from our hotel ( 2miles ) and when we got there we thought it was a nice shop . when we were looking for our `` vegas '' harley shirt to purchase we continually got hassled from the pushy sales lady . we felt like we were doing something wrong . they must have a big theft issue in this store because the sales lady would n't leave us alone . we decided to leave and it was n't worth being bothered for a shirt .	3078
1	best bakery in arizona ! they made a delicious beautiful cake for my mom ! the cakes look gorgeous and taste incredible ! you will not be disappointed !	1806
0	i called rc willey after a home depot associate told me they carry gas burners for fireplaces so i called josephine in appliances and she said yes they did . i drove there and she walked me around the store and showed me electric fireplaces . why do these people make me waste my gas and time on wild goose chases . she should be reprimanded . three or four male appliance sales people bored out of their minds . no business . greeter on the way out says thanks for coming .	439
1	this is the place to go ! best sandwiches in the state of arizona no doubt ! i take all the ladies here cause it 's a guaranteed good experience . the workers are bad ass . 100 % come here for a perfect dcperixeb	277
1	if you are looking for a place to store your items in the west valley this is the place ! ! ! we moved cross country in the middle of the az summer with our entire house . you ca n't beat the indoor climate control and cleanliness of these units . the pricing was great as well . jeff was very helpful before we arrived as well as during our 5 months there ! ! security is top notch as well .	3288
1	this is a honest good hearted company ! ! the nurses truly care and the staff is genuinely concerned with your well being . and to top it off the food is really good for being in a hospital	2068
1	mmm crepes ! ! had the sweet potato crepe , and it was delicious . perfect amount of sweetness ( i had asked for the maple syrup on the side but ended up pouring most of it onto the crepe anyway ) . i tried a bit of my friend 's green tea red bean crepe and i was n't a big fan . it was a bit too sweet and dense for me . ordered a black forest latte as well . it was pretty sweet , and served lukewarm . i could probably do without the latte , but would come back for the crepes !	891
0	i wish i checked reviews before i went inside . i usually go up the road a bit , but my usual nail tech is on vacation so i tried this place . terrible . she put polish thinner in my polish and it still is n't completely dry , hours later . the topcoat is dry , so there all wrinkly looking . it 's terrible . they 're not even at all , every nail is different . none of them are smooth . do n't waste your money . plus a full took almost an hour and a half . usually i 'm out in 30-40 . no thank you !	2035
0	i went to this place in real pain and things were changing as far as pain levels and then he adjusted me and almost blew out a disk by over powering me to make an adjustment . i found a real healing doctor that explained that these pop and crack places are n't good for you if they do n't warm you up and loosen you up first .	3186
0	whatever you do , do not order delivery . the delivery driver will deliver half your order then tell you it 's your job to call to get it fixed then they will ask you to come in and get the items they forgot . contacted the restaurant and they said they 'd call right back . waited 20-30 mins and still no response . i wish there was a zero star option because what food we received was n't even warm . you have been warned !	459
0	good atmosphere for an intimate small party . food is n't great . there are some all you can eat japanese buffets that tastes better . and the prices are n't cheap either . for example , miso soup , cod , sashimi and ice cream is $ 55 . if you have coupons you must print them . also , try to check trip advisor and groupon , they have discounts for this place . overall , pricey for mediocre food but good atmosphere .	422
0	does n't come off like a real starbucks . the iced coffee is watered down ( tried over a couple different days to be sure ) and i had to teach them how to make a starbucks doubleshot on ice . i do n't get the impression they 're trained/managed like a typical starbucks and could use some supervision to bring them in line with the model . however , staff is nice and it 's a comfortable little location .	1351
1	mff installed granite in our kitchen and 3 baths . i had an idea of what i wanted and the took me to the slabs . they had exactly what i was looking for . the price was good and the installers were great and on time . i will go back for my next home .	3875
1	i really liked his salon .i walked in no appointment . i picked my colors and showed the nail tech what i was wanting and she did a great job . i had a manicure , pedicure and eyebrow wax . yes it 's a little expensive but the service was good and everyone was friendly .	786
0	had my car towed there because i was told on the phone they had a set of take-off tires in very good condition . after my car gets dropped off and i show up - these tires are dry rotted and in horrible shape . instead i asked them to just switch out the wheels with another set i had temporarily because i did not like my tire options . $ 60 bucks for some rubber valve stems that cost $ 1 - this place is a joke and will take advantage of you if you 're in a compromising situation .	88
1	cassablanca express is the best place to book travel with . over the past few years they have had my business and i am very impressed . just this past year , they booked me in the plaza hotel for basically nothing and i was very impressed with it . i recommend cassablanca express to anyone .	1777
0	i specifically ordered no onions on my salad , and of course , it came with a tons of onions . also , the menu stated that my salad came with fries and there were no fries on my salad . i ordered takeout so going back to the restaurant was n't an option for me . when i was standing at the counter , one of the cooks in the back got loud with someone i assume was the manager and said `` get off my back maryann . i do n't need to wear gloves every time i make a salad . '' very concerning . not happy with this experience at all .	608
1	excellent service . great staff and the manager mike is awesome , his customer service level is off the charts , they the best tire shop in las vegas , thank you mike !	3860
1	my experience with land rover in las vegas has always been good . they are a very trusted dealership . they do not try to push service or repairs you do not need . land rover keep up the great trusted work !	2659
0	great product of course but that is not the problem . cashiers ! can your hire some ? i 've been at this store three different times since thanksgiving and the lines are at least six people deep . i put down my purchases and left . i guess i am impatient but i would rather not wait that long . get your multi staff on the floor check out devices so that they can ring a customer out ! or add another register at the front .	1765
0	class was fun for a bachelorette but not nearly worth the endless telemarketers . they force you to sign `` release '' and then sell your information .	3629
1	j'adore aller à cette boutique c'est vrai que le service est impeccable tous les employés sont hyper brillant et connaissent bien leur matériel ! !	3579
0	do n't go to nybb ! the staff is is incompetent & lazy . told the counter person i had never been there before . they literally walked away without saying anything . they did n't offer any suggestions/help/explanations . my order was wrong when i got it . because it had the wrong condiments it tasted disgusting . nybb is extremely overpriced . do not go to nybb !	325
0	the service was really good . we came for dinner the food did n't have much flavor . the appetizers were the best part in particular causa rellena . overall great service the food was n't as tasty and a little expensive for the quality of food .	927
1	we have been taking my daugher here since she was born . we really like dr. patterson . she is very nice and friendly . also , she explains everything clearly to us . the assisntants are very professional and they are always making sure my daugher is fine and confortable . i love the attention we receive . great place and enviroment to take your kids for a good health care .	3893
1	anthony did an amazing job on my nails . especially because the previous job i had was horrible . he brought them back to life . i did have a 30 minute wait and i was there as soon as they opened i was the first one at the door . they did have appointments though so i was n't upset . i loved the color they had however a lot of their colors were dried out . luckily i found the perfect color : ) anthony always kept a convo and he 's a great business man . i enjoyed my first time there .	1429
1	update : thanks to the owner for helping me out . after reading my frustration on here it was definitely a miscommunication and a glitch in their system and they called me immediately and offered service for free since it was a mistake on the systems end . she was a sweetheart , i really enjoyed the wash and condition and the scalp massage . if i lived here i definitely would come back ! thank you for turning a frustrating situation around . i greatly appreciate it	1935
1	living spaces is a great place to look for furniture ! highlights for me would be their clearance section , staff is not on commission and thus are non-pressure , extremely friendly pickup department , and free assembly within 24 hour notice for pickup !	2071
0	these guys have nice clean bathrooms and are convenient to the bars up the street if you 're grossed out by the bathrooms at the bars . also , even if you 're just in the casino to use the restrooms , they do n't hassle you . but they sure do make a weak vodka tonic .	2500
1	i 've been in the store two times and both times i 've had great customer service . today there were quite a few people waiting ahead of me , but they have que set up and you can see on the tv 's where you are in line . demetrius helped me today and was very courteous and solved my problem quick . in the past stoan had helped me when i decided to switch from direct to cox . as many reviewers have said , do n't waist your time on the phone with cox customer service as they are n't the best . visit the cox store and you 'll get your problems resolved in fast and friendly way !	2633
1	went for free with houseseats.com ( strongly recommend them if you 're a local btw ) and we got seats in the very front just inches from the stage . i 've seen some of the more `` modern '' topless revues , but this one blows them away . the girls were classy and beautiful , the sets/costumes/effects were incredible , and it was such a fun night . this show is 100 % vegas.. cheese , sleeze , and glamour all rolled into one .	3069
1	i got so lucky finding toni & guy . they have the most convenient hours they 're open late and on sundays as well . adam is one of the owners and he did my hair . adam had me out in less than an hour . he gave me the best shampoo i ever had . he is way underpriced for the services he provides . i am so happy with my cut & style ( he was very respectful of my length ) . my hair has never felt so bouncy ! ! ! !	2274
1	i like this walgreens a lot , i do n't come here as often as i think i should because i dont think they 'll have what i 'm looking for but when i do go , they have everything i bought somewhere else ! it 's very clean , and the staff is always letting me know of any deals or specials happening : )	3923
1	awesome place to have coffee . had order a few hot drinks and all of them were very delicious . my hot chocolate was little too sweet and trust me i can take sweet , just a little . nice ambiance , friendly staff . very warm and cozy place . fireplace adds a nice touch though it 's very hard to actually find a place near one : ( amazing to see people displaying their artwork for sale on the walls . very creative .	2163
1	i 've been here three times now and i am continually pleased with my meal ! the food is fresh and flavorful , the sauces are yummy , and the shakes and malts are great ! plus , the workers are always nice and accommodating ! this is definitely a new favorite place of mine : )	998
0	people in town rave about this place so i decided to try them . ordered 1 large pizza ... .. took almost an hour to be delivered . they forgot to add the garlic sauce i had ordered , so the driver made a second trip to bring it back . the pizza was luke warm and barely any toppings . i honestly was disappointed . i 'm not really sure what people were raving about , abruzzo in richmond hill ( yonge and 7 area ) is much better .	1076
1	everyone at the summerlin branch is always helpful , friendly and accommodating . they go out of their way to assist members . tops in their field . best oncu office around ! !	1141
0	came here with a 9 year old , 12 , and 14 year old and the lady suggested to go into grossology exhibit . paid our 5 dollars and was extremely disappointed it was made for 3 year olds . really mad that the lady suggested this for us . wanted to ask for our money back . the rest of the museum was okay . had to ask a few times for them to refill some of their experiments .	3891
0	the patties are frozen store patties - that 's a big no no for me when i 'm paying more than what i would pay at mc'donalds or wendy 's . they 're not even good frozen patties either ! they 're bland mixed with more bland ! the seasoning needs a lot work as well , guess what ? it 's also pretty bland . i did what i always do when going to rate food , i follow it up with a mass produced version of what i had . so , i had a quarter pounder brought it home and added the ingredients that were missing . the qp was much better and it was 7 dollars !	992
1	the best vegetables in town . we price checked against metro and longos and whole foods is cheaper for produce -- and better quality .	3271
1	i love that they offer dollar sticks appetizer whole day . their isaw & liempo are really good .	817
1	huge beer list , good food , friendly service	3344
1	the team of sales reps at klas are the best . very knowledgable . they know the vegas marketplace . thank you for the great exposure klas ! ! !	1870
0	ca n't recommend . very few flavors and fruit toppings compared to yogurtland and the taste just is n't as good . and yogurtland provides free drinking water , menchies sells drinking water .	738
0	tons of picture dics . many records that you would find in dollar bins , priced like they were new . but , i guess if your the only store in town ... thank g i dont live in vegas .	2570
1	purchased a new car here after reading many mixed reviews i have to say my experience was great stuck to the deal over phone no bs in finance happy customer ! ! thank you kevin emmons	2210
1	i 'm not exactly sure why there is such reviews of this place . i 've been in constant contact with the realtor i 'm working with . we were able to get a home to lease that fit our budget at no time at all . the realtor had been nothing but nice & helpful to me throughout the process . he even made efforts during his vacation to answer his phone & meet me at the office the next day during a holiday . thank you for all that you 've done to make it a pleasurable experience .	3126
1	i love this restaurant . i have been going there for almost 12 yrs now . i have never had a bad experience with the food . only service 1-2 times that i 've been there . the hostess/manager is so nice & very warm to customers . the food , is delicious , i ca n't choose a fav because everything tastes so good & fresh . not many japanese restaurants have good terriyaki & sushi , but sagano certainly does . the view is spectacular , never mind that it 's scarborough & not the toronto skyline , it is beautiful ! !	422
0	good food , horrible service ! ! ordered take-out and it took 45 minutes to get our food and the manager `` scott '' blamed my husband for not speaking up sooner after he admitted he himself wondered why my husband was waiting up front for so long . they do n't care about customer service in the least , very rude and condescending .	408
1	the best ! honest , thorough , knowledgeable , priced right ! we are repeat customers , they are my first call every time i need help	3341
1	this is our favorite dim sum place in mississauga . great quality food , lots of variety , and cart service . very authentic and traditional dishes , as well as something new now and then ( like green tea sesame balls ) . love it !	338
1	i was looking for a pair of hiking shoes and decided to look in morgans . they had a great selection and prices . will definitely think of them in the future when i need shoes .	1627
0	not the same restaurant from a few years back . we went on christmas eve and the food was horrible . restroom smells foul . the whole place did moot feel clean	1264
1	we recently hired matt to paint the exterior of our 11-year old house in estrella . to say that he did a fabulous job would be an understatement . he and his crew were on time every day , and did their work methodically and efficiently . the end result makes us feel as if we have a brand new house . it is beautiful ! thank you , matt , for a job well done !	3915
0	the sushi here is ok . it is pricey for vaughan though ! i have no problem with higher prices if the portions are generous ... . but the portions are small ( relative to other japanese restaurants in dt toronto i frequent often ) .	733
0	my pedicure was n't high quality and the spa is n't sanitary . i had to ask the manager to put a towel down on the dirty platform when fixing my toes after he asked me to sit back in the spa chair . when i called to speak to corporate , kelly was extremely rude and hung up on me when i asked to speak to the owner . their customer service is terrible despite all the surrounding competition . the risk of infection and bad customer service scream run !	3652
0	horrible experience . i would give negative stars if possible . the doctor i saw was condescending , patronizing and uncompassionate . i will never return to this office or any goodman & partridge office . there are much better ob/gyns to be found in the valley .	2625
0	this place was recommended to us by a waiter at a restaurant ... i guess it was our mistake for asking a yuppity hipster where we should get our drinks . these guys could n't make a good drink if their bob marley posters depended on it . the bartenders clearly did n't want to be spending their friday night serving drinks . maybe find a new profession ? our drinks were weak . we left with $ 50 out of our pockets and sober enough to pass an alcohol test . we went to a small bar right down the street and got perfectly inebriated on $ 30 .	292
0	the worst service in the world . thousands spent and they can not even meet a gigantic 6 hour window . late by hours . horrible . avoid this rapidly deteriorating firm at all costs .	2071
1	not sure what the deal is with all the negative reviews for dr shaba ... i 've had nothing but good experiences with him ... he 's treated me for a couple of different things and is always friendly as well as the staff is very friendly and professional and courteous ... i will admit sometimes there is a pretty long wait but what doctors office does n't have you wait ? i would absolutely recommend him and his staff very very happy overall and a lifetime customer	2777
1	i will be honest , i was going to just get some papa johns to be safe , but after seeing the yelps on jesse 's i had to give it a try . damn glad i did . i had their large supreme and loved the thin crust and high quality ingredients . it will feed 3-4 hungry guys if you get some appetizers . we got the chicken fingers done with medium sauce and loved them . their garlic cheese bread is a hoagie bun sliced , so not large , but oh so delicious . this place is the best . if you are in thier delivery area there is no other option , not sure about dining in .	1399
0	i feel dirty saying this , but i ate lunch here on friday . i usually do n't stoop to eating at taco bell , unless i am really drunk , hungry , and it is the only place open . i was late for a meeting , broke , and it was the closest place i could get lunch for the $ 2.50 i had on me . i got two crunchy taco supremes , which are just tacos with sour cream . they were gross , and i hope the next time i am drunk i will remember this .	3
0	it was okay here . nothing special , great for big groups with no where to go since the service is really slow . i think the servers should be allowed to wear sneakers that might help improve the service . they tried to feed me pork when i specifically said that i do not want pork . good thing i was n't allergic	102
0	worst experience ever these asians are crooks and liars dont shop here . the dishwasher i bought did n't work and they wo n't refund my money . i 'm out 400 $ bbb said they are trying to shut them down they sell dented garbage that has manufacture defects . i did n't realize this if the product catches fire or floods your home they will not cover it . home depot should of been my first stop they sell recycled manufactured defective appliances scratch and dent turn backs beware people junk ! ! ! ! ! ! do your research do n't buy here	1636
0	customer service , not service at all . agent saw me coming and dropped her head no eye contact . ok so you do n't want to be bothered . there were only two of you available , so if you are too busy please hire more help this is your job '' customer service ''	948
0	extremely bad place to do business with no warranty on anything really bad attitudes cheap parts do n't even try to return anything there they will not take it back . never going back	2027
1	i love their pharmacy . my doctor erroneously filled a prescription for a cvs pharmacy in north carolina instead of this pharmacy . however , since we were in rock hill , this cvs pharmacy transferred the prescription order from north carolina to the rock hill cvs pharmacy . saved me a two hour commute to pick up the medication . i appreciated the excellent customer service in correcting the doctor 's mistake .	933
1	so many options ! i love building my own stir fry , buffet is kept very clean and all the sauce options are amazing .	209
1	let me start by saying i 'm from california and it 's hard to find good people who know what there doing , and this place here does amazing work.. i always get my nails done here , been going for almost 4 years now and everytime i get the best treatment anyone can ask for.. i always get my nails done by the owner , she does amazing work and i always leave super happy.. what 's even a bigger plus is my nails stay for longer then a month and i ca n't be any happier , i 'd rather see someone once a month then every 2 weeks.. thank you for your amazing service see you soon ! ! !	3831
0	rushed in rushed out . had to have my nails fixed twice because once the lady swiped them with a towel and once i messed up . the lady made the comment that i was making sure i got my monies worth . sat under the dryer for both my hands and my feet for 20 mins and still managed to walkout with messed up nails wtf . after the comment i sure did n't feel right asking them to be fixed ! well that was not worth the money . oh and my hands are dryer than when i went in .	3682
1	for the `` inn '' only : stayed here in the honeymoon suite for two nights leading up to my wedding . excellent and accommodating staff , nice old timey decor , and plenty comfy . there was lots of room for the ladies to get ready here on the wedding day . overall , excellent value with attentive staff for a boutique style b & b .	2818
1	i did so much driving that my tire pressure light switched on . i stopped here and jim helped me . he was very helpful . we went outside and he put air in my tires while it was raining . by the end of it he was soaked . after putting the air in my tires he told me i was good to go . i tried to pay him but he said it was fine . i really appreciated the honesty , he could have said something was wrong and i would have paid not knowing . i highly recommend this place because they are honest and care about their clients .	946
1	i like chipotle . this one just opened . the service was good . it tasted like it should . i tried some of my wife 's guacamole . they have outside seating , which was nice . the inside seating was cramped .	656
0	cinnamon roll could n't even be cut with large knife 20 minuted after buying . the apple fritter not much better . notified and they offered to make it right and have n't answered any message nor have contacted me . things happen but this was a major customer service fail . it 's been 3 days and no answer to my message . i will say bosa donuts are awesome .	2053
1	really a delightful little corner on the top floor of a lady-centric craft boutique . it 's just a little space but stuffed to the gills with vinyl treasures . the stacks are well curated and the prices are fair . found some choice stuff digging the crates including prince , echo and the bunnymen , parliament , queensryche , psychedelic furs and a 1956 hank williams pressing that was only $ 2.50 . surely something here for every taste .	2294
1	very nice people . seem very professional , and i heard other great reviews from women i met in the lobby . i 've only had botox here , and i 've been happy with it . may try other treatments	1961
0	i got a groupon & when trying to book an appointment , they told me to call back another week because their system was down . then when i did , they said they no longer offer the service of the groupon and they are having technical difficulties - for a mani/pedi ? ! ? the lady told me casually , maybe you can get a refund . um have you ever tried to get a groupon refund ! so difficult and tedious if you can even get one . *annoyed ... *	2995
1	i go here enough that the staff already know what i 'm getting . not sure if that 's a good or bad thing lol	1761
1	heavy on the atmosphere , heavy on the red sauce , light on the wallet . no , the food here is n't great . but it 's good , and i always make time to come here every time i come to vegas . it 's worth it just to see the piano bar . recommendations : chicken parm ( not veal for some reason , ) meatballs , gnocchi . also , they have a private dining room in which i 've had several successful events and make for a nice break from the typical trade show stuff -- and definitely gets people to remember you .	4
1	here 's the breakdown : +cheap on the strip +friendly staff +not stingy about portions +fast line	214
0	just walked in . i used to love boba tea house but i 'm not sure i 'm returning . this time the whole place was filthy . the counter was gross and you could visibly see footprints everywhere ! when i walked in the teenagers were sitting , when they should have been cleaning . grab a broom and a mop , and get to work .	490
1	best chicken caesar ever . i can have a piece of chicken with every bite and the salad will run out before the chicken . only down side is with tax the salad is over $ 20	1116
0	this starbucks has the worst set up for a drive-thru and is by far the slowest one i have ever sat in . it does n't matter what time of day , it takes forever to get through . i 'd get out and park , except that 's a nightmare too .	2778
0	tom , the store manager , was rude and condescending to me on 2 separate occasions . his customer service skills are severely lacking and the attitude he conveys to his customers is inexcusable . do yourself a favor and drive across the street for your pool supplies . good customer service and much cheaper prices !	3311
0	i really wanted to like this place . the patio was nice and cozy , i love the hanging plant baskets . the waiter was nice and helpful in making menu suggestions . what i did n't like is waiting 25 mins for my entree and it being cold when we got it . by the time i got the food i was so tired and not hungry anymore i took a few bites and then asked to pack the rest , including my dessert to go . i got home and threw it all away the next day .	918
0	this place is not amazing . she completely ruined my eyebrows , she made them way too thin and took off the whole front part and left hardly any shape to my eyebrows . i will never be back here again .	3907
0	horrible service my boyfriend and i wanted some questions answered about a phone and no one walked up to us for about 15 minutes . finally some one did come up to talk to us and he was completely rude when we had barely asked one question and after he just walked away without answering the rest of our questions . while some other staff were on there phones , laughing and not assisting anyone .	3192
0	worst car rental place i 've ever been to , tried calling the office 10 times and then the next few days and never answered , when i got there phones ringing the entire time , long lines and no other cars to choose from , advertise as giving a toyota or nissan then end up with a cheap hyundai with a broken fender which they said they would have to charge us for , until we argued about it then said that it had already been reported ... choose something closer to the airport even if they charge more	269
0	i drove all the way here expecting for some basic hookah and service but it was actually worse . the worst lounge in my opinion . owner was very rude to my group and we felt as if the servers just wanted to make their pay day and nothing else .	2073
0	good lord . girl barely speaks english . cashier looks like she 's been up for a week . all i asked was which sandwich was most popular and she could not understand . did n't have my order when i went to pay . wow	1214
1	great store ! great staff ! great product ! youll pay a little more tho ... .	3911
0	the people at wrap & grab have managed to turn an uncomplicated meal into a sopping mess . i ordered the falafel platter to go . the falafel balls were hard as a rock and were n't cooked fresh in front of me . though i try not to waste food i ended up throwing away most of the rice as it was stale and hard . my biggest restaurant annoyance is stale rice . it 's the easiest thing to cook in the world of cuisine , and there is no reason to have stale rice during the busiest hour of a weekday . as an added 'bonus ' , the staff shortchanged me .	775
1	great service , tons of seating . it 's a nice place to hang out with a group of friends . there are pool tables at the back of the bar . the menu is typical pub food . the fries are good and the drinks are cheap . i wish they put the volume up for sports games . i 'll have to come back and check out their live music though to see if it 's good . i would definitely go back .	2732
1	happy hour prices are unbeatable , $ 11 for half oysters & half clams , sign me up ! seafood is fresh and delicious . i saw a guy next to me order the shrimp cocktail , dang the shrimps are huge ! i will surely get that on my next trip . service is always good , the waiter had a big smile on his face the whole entire time , very inviting atmosphere .	1255
1	this is my third or fourth time doing business with brother 's tailors on tatum . our family has purchased three suits here and love all of them . they have a great selection and amazing service . on thursday , i brought a tux in that needed some alterations for a saturday event ( today ) . every other shop i called either could n't do it or was way more expensive for the work , which brother 's did perfectly , and at a better price . go see peter for a new suit !	442
0	do n't go there to wash your car ! they are not gentle with your car they do n't care , i 've got few scratches on my car since i used to go weekly ( and it was brand new car so no previous scratches on it ) ! also , each time i went there while i got home i had to clean after them , they do n't know how to clean ! ! never going back !	2198
0	have stayed in aloft before in denver , great ! upon my pre requested early check in , i was told no rooms were available because the hotel was full the night before . mmm , well not sure why early check in was an option . everyone 's time is valuable .	3522
1	came here because i was interested in buying a suit for a new job . everyone was so friendly . a guy named dee approached me and was very helpful . i did n't buy a suit but i 'll definitely be coming back in the near future for the excellent service .	1972
1	i visit this dunkin ' donuts every morning . they always get my drink correct and are very consistent with the way it tastes . the customer service is good , they know me by name and i have never had any problems at this location . my favorite employee is kable . she rocks .	1532
1	excellent food , price is amazing . always great ! we ordered the family size ginger beef , shanghai noodles in black bean sauce , spring rolls and salt and pepper squid . all delicious and price was under $ 40	1437
1	kathy and i have been to this spa numerous times since 2010 . they are now on the third owner and the place is looking better than ever . we had a massage and sea salt body scrub which was great today . devon is an excellent therapist . try this place if you are looking for a luxury spa at a reasonable price .	2917
0	i had switched to this nail salon due to being closer to my home . i got gel polish and unfortunately it peeled off in a week ( i have never had this happen previously ) , then i went to get them redone and mentioned the issues . she told me the polish was bad . offered no discount or refund . then , charged me an extra $ 5 for the color i picked out ( even though gel polish are priced at $ 20 ! ) . i wo n't be returning .	1783
0	i expect much better pasty at brazil bakery as after all it is a bakery . sadly both the pastel de nata and tarte de amendoa were just marginally good . almond tart just hard and tasted stale . i almost just want to trashed it after 1 bite but i think my yelp friend must be really hungry as he finished the whole thing ... and then telling me it was not good ? ! ( he must had been used to my cooking skill now ... ) pastel de nata had this thin crust that i like but the filling was just overly sweet and did n't have much substance . maybe i should just drink a coffee ... next time ...	3184
1	come on thursdays . 50 percent off the wholr menu . the shrimp diablo is amazing and there soup was insane . everything very fresh . the menu is in spanish but they were very helpful . highly recommend .	299
1	bargain shopper heaven . i went in here and had a ball , i 'm sure hubby did n't like that bill . lolol . i got 2 pairs of shoes , clothes , baby gear and some home decor . i saw so many things i want to go back and get for christmas gifts . they have something for everyone in the family and i still need to get gifts for my mom and sister so i shall return . i 've even gotten dog stuff out of here . i love a good bargain ! warning : do not go in here if you are in retail therapy .	3597
1	i came here for the first time on my birthday and had a wonderful experience . the marinara sauce was surprisingly delicious and tasted fresh . the bread was really good too . i had wanted to come here for awhile , so i was had i could finally get to try it . greta service , very attentive throughout the visit . i lie the atmosphere a lot . the restaurant is in an old house and there are tables in different rooms creating a very intimate setting . th tiramisu was one of the highlights of the evening . a very happy way to end my birthday dinner .	1224
1	we have used this business for watch batteries and decided to take them up on their free rhodium plating offer . the work was completed in an hour and they were friendly and courteous . we will definitely go back for any of our repair needs . thank you for the great quality service !	3533
0	low quality homes built by low quality trades . their sales people are disrespectful and dishonest . their design center is a ripoff . beware of their `` preferred '' third party builders . they are just as dishonest as fulton homes and will try to rip you off . their warranty department is a joke . it is really a mitigation department that tries to fight you over every repair . then the repairs are just as low quality as the build . buyers beware !	3043
0	we made reservations on june 21 at 1:25 and the person that took the call said that our reservation was made and when we arrive to the hotel the lady told my partner and i that we never made reservations . we stay at this hotel at least ones a week and this never happen before this is the first time that this happen and they have us waiting for 45 min to an our . i hope you guys can get a person that makes the reservation a responsable person	1335
0	this is the worst store . the employees are all super rude and to busy standing around to actually help you . when asking a question they all have a different answer . i 'm all for current good music but this store has it playing so loud you can barley think . i 'm not at a club just trying to buy some glasses . then on top of everything we bought a pair of swim trunks got them home and they did not even take off the security tag . really lady you had one job ! ! !	2480
0	we booked our hotel on priceline , which has yet to let us down . my boyfriend loved the hotel and thought it was great but i would have liked a little more . the staff was friendly and helpful , the hotel was clean and not too noisy or crowded . my main beef with this place is truly and first-world issue . my room smelled like someone had smoked before us and it was poorly covered up . it smelled like way too much febreeze . besides that , my sheets and blanket were scratchy and uncomfortable . those are my only complaints . other than that , it was a fairly decent hotel .	2540
1	this place is great , always a fresh sandwich.. must try number 13 , you will love it ! the employees always greet you and make sure you get what you want ! it sucks that they do n't toast but it is still good with the toppings , i get it `` mikes way ''	1528
1	our airbnb host suggested this charming bistro for breakfast . we went for lunch . we can only hope the owner gets tired of the heat and relocates to new jersey . creative menu of omelets , quiche , crepes and sandwiches , great selection of hot and cold drinks , and terrific pastries . warm friendly service , a real neighborhood gem . go .	93
0	the food tastes ok . the costumer service is terrible as well as the delivery . we are 5 minutes away from them and took over an hour for us to get the food . we did n't even get a courtesy call to inform us they were running late and when we called 3 times we were just told they would be there in 5 mins . we have ordered at least three times in the past and every time they will get lost . last time we order from there .	1581
1	i 've loved everything i 've tried here . they have interesting twists on classic sandwiches and salads . everything is fresh and delicious ! a little pricey especially considering the portion sizes of some of the items , but the quality of the food makes up for it . very cool atmosphere as well . i also wish the portion sizes of the sides were a little bigger because they 're so delicious ! still 5 stars for the taste and atmosphere .	1238
1	the gym is pretty chill and they have a good atmosphere . not to mention the 2 week guest pass which is very generous . btw the personal trainer director joe is the coolest dude . peace	1981
1	enjoy working with rachael smith and the weight loss team . been doing the program for 6 weeks and lost 12 pounds . slow and steady to keep it off and modify eating behavior staff is always friendly and helpful i recommend their weight loss program and the clinic in general for overall health	297
0	little caesars motto is `` hot and ready '' . this location is never hot and ready , always a 7 minute wait to cook a pizza . thank god for papa murphy 's coming into town . chris	519
0	i only came in here to work out but this place is filthy . it is not dirty as if in someone had not cleaned it for the day but actually not really clean . i did not get a massage after working out in the same location . the tropicana overall has real potential if they get their game on , but otherwise i i would recommend other options .	2317
1	best burger ! ! hands down the best burger i 've ever had . been coming here every friday for over 2 years now . try the ak47 my girlfriend loves the masala burger .	940
1	i have nothing much to say.. this is a good place . the only drawback is that there are nothing to do around here , unless yoir staying before flying out from clt airport . food is anothet issue , only few restaurant within walkin distance . but there is always room service . overall ... this is a nice place .	1348
0	i took a pair of courderoy jeans in for a simple 1/2 ' tear repair . the woman ran the sewing machine over the material about 50 times leavong a 2-3 inch mess of scarring over the material . -- -- when i asked her what she had done- she started screaming..at me ! ! -- -- i asked her to stop screaming and being rude- and she just got worse -- avoid the place ! ! !	2982
0	we decided to give this place a shot -- eating in the dark seemed really different . they have a cool concept where blind individuals are your servers.. make sure to tell your dates ! it was awkward a few times when people did n't know why servers wore sunglasses . when you first walk in , you are greeted by a not so friendly staff who make you wait in a dungeon-like atmosphere until your server is ready . server was very nice . food was ok at best . they loaded my plate up with mashed potatoes and there was barely any meat . unfortunately , i 'm not sure i would do this again .	449
1	my experience with royal appliance was awesome they were friendly and polite , they had a big selexiting of major appliances to choose from and and prices was great , check them out ... they 're great ! !	1236
0	worst experience and worst customer service . not only were the bridesmaid dresses fitted and sized wrong , but the brides dress had a blood stain and the beadwork was falling off . horrible experiences everytime for fittings . do not go here . the women are all rude and know nothing about customer service .	2938
0	we orders food for six people and after being 20 minutes late on having the order ready , they forgot three items . really poor services , do n't waste you time with this food chain .	1547
0	still waiting ... . they responded and so i responded ... . still no dice apparently off to sale used cheap furniture with no warranty .	1640
0	they should be shut down , filthy , they do not clean equipment & rude to customers ... i will not go back ! !	3332
1	courteous & speedy service ! went in for an oil change and the entire process was a breeze . charles & his team took great care of my car and had it all ready to go ( along with a courtesy call ) sooner than expected . will definitely be coming back here .	3379
0	they have hooked offer to get 2 donuts for a dollar . many a times , they do n't even have more than 3-4 donuts . what 's up with that ?	3636
0	they have again managed to cancel my installation order for the media stand i ordered in may . it was received in july and is still sitting in a box . i recommend avoiding purchasing anything from west elm as their customer service and business practices leave much to be desired .	1841
1	you want a slice bigger than your face ? if you answered `` yes . '' then this is the place for you . this is by my daughters ' school , so sometimes we 'll grab a bite there on our way home . the slice is enough for them to split and share . save yourself some money and order the lunch special .	417
0	working near by this is a frequented place when it 's too cold to walk anywhere else . this is a dirt cheap pizza joint.. and you definitely get what you pay for . if you 're looking for a great meal.. steer away . however if you 're on a budget their poutine is defiantly edible .	810
1	i love this place ! always very welcoming and comforting as well . i am always seen very quickly by the doctors and they have been extremely helpful ! thank you !	3598
0	the pickle barrel at yorkdale is the worst . the fish and chips and burger were cold , and the spanish paella was luke warm . sent back the fish and chips and burger . my new burger was still cold and the cheese not even melted , no flavor at all . the restaurant was like a sauna making it a very uncomfortable experience . the waiter was not attentive . when seated the utensils and napkins were placed in the middle of table , so we had to set the table ourselves . stay away from this restaurant .	534
0	terrible service . walked in to buy a 1911 and there was only one other customer with two employees . one guy was helping the customer while the other guy was just standing around . sat there for about 10 minutes waiting for someone to help me and no employee said a word , finally i walked out and dropped $ 1k somewhere else . i guess i did n't look `` gun nut '' enough for them . will never go back .	1561
0	we were just at your location on independence blvd . and complained to the manager about cleanliness . the last several times we ate there we had to request the waitress to clean the table and the floor is always sticky . tonight was the last straw because when the bill came the folio was greasy inside . there was no way for the waitress not to notice but she gave it to me anyway . then , when we complained to the manager he did not seem to care . we left and will never return .	209
0	meh . looked up pizza by the slice on yelp . this place came up . it 's not really pizza by the slice . you have to buy a $ 6 slice/drink combo . staff 's attitude is indifferent at best . slice came with a fortune cookie which is weird .	417
1	great for kids . good variety of games and activities . it was understaffed on the weekend we were there ... would add another star if they up the staffing by a few people .	3791
1	i left my pious prius in california and not missing the car-traffic angst that typically accompanies the expense of city car ownership . zipcar is my new love , as it is as close and easy as having a car without the bother or expense . the zipcar website has a very slick user interface that shows all locations of all cars within whatever parameters you choose . what 's not to like ?	2232
1	i ordered from this place with ubereats and it was such amazing delicious food ! i will definitely be dining in at this restaurant in the future ... also get the buffalo chicken mac & cheese ... . it 's to die for !	717
1	renovations are still underway , but outdoor drapes and curtains give the place a tropical , calssy , jamiaca-meets-south beach feel . the inside of the lounge now features a wooden dance floor , which helps the growing swing scene on fridays .	1672
1	this place is great . owner and staff are very nice . i have been coming here for years . good deals .	336
1	katie fearno is the world 's best pa. not only is she incredibly smart she is so kind , patient and understanding . her assistant chance is also great . i 'm normally very fearful of the doctor but this place is awesome !	356
0	came for lunch and waited forever for the waiter to come take our order of drinks . place was n't busy at all so that was weird . it took super long to get the drinks too . the margaritas were supposed to be blended , but came on the rocks and in plastic cups . one of the worse tasting margaritas i 've ever had .	704
1	i live in carlsbad have been using truly nolan for 2 years now . they have been awesome . from the moment you call , their customer service exceeds expectation . friendly , timely , and their rates are very fair . i have monthly pest control and annual termite inspection . i particularly like their service providers who very professional , respectful and helpful .	302
0	this is an extremely slow rental car firm . the staff is not organized and not very friendly	3129
1	if you ever wanted to eat in a palace , well then get back in line , because they only do takeout . ron 's is good pizza . nothing spectacular . i never expect spectacular out of my pizza , just my primanti 's .	110
1	love , love , love this office full of wonderful people ! went in for my first visit , to discuss pellets ... .i just could n't believe how friendly and genuine the entire staff was ! they took the time to explain the process , all my options and celebrate my decision with me ! got my first pellets `` installed '' and can honestly say , it was quick , pain free and i can hardly wait to feel the benefits ! highly recommend ! ! !	3243
0	this d & d is operating beyond its means . dirty . needed a cleaning . cashier was abrupt , snarky . she kept repeating `` i 'm never working 2nd shift again . '' said to another staffer `` just give em decaf they do n't know the difference '' did n't give me a receipt . expo practically threw the food at me . was hastily put together . see photo . other locations are much better .	3226
1	the best bar in the downtown phoenix area . great drinks , fantastic staff , awesome atmosphere . you wo n't be disappointed if you 're looking for a cool tucked-away place to grab a drink and hang out .	3562
1	i live close to the star nursery on blue diamond . moved here from deadwood about 6 months ago . i have to say that this is the best nursery i 've been to . i 've been dealing with marco there and he had the best advice on how much sod to buy and just how to prep the soil before i laid the sod down . i gave him the measurements of where i wanted it , and he was spot on with the amount i got . thank you marco and star nursery . the best ... .	2039
0	this place is not very nice . proving as usual that hilton has no consistency to their product . no bar at the moment some issue or construction going on .	1741
0	very disappointed in the quality of the food at this location . rolls were burnt and dry . tenders were very small and were practically all breading and no chicken . being from texas i 've had my fair share of bush 's chicken and it never disappoints . so when i saw they opened one in gilbert i was so excited . unfortunately this bush 's location in gilberts is a huge disappointment . based off this experience i will never go back .	862
1	i found this place on yelp when we moved to the area and it 's our go-to car maintenance place . since we live close we usually just drop off a vehicle and wait for them to call . they 're always friendly and trustworthy . we have n't had anything outside of routine care done here .	946
0	i was really excited to try this place . menu was cool and appealing . ate on a wednesday evening service was not that great . ordered wings hot ( almost flavorless ) and honey bbq which i tasted like sweet baby rays nothing special . also ordered sasha cheeses fires were dry and cheese was n't even melted : ( not impressed . very sad . i may try it again and order a burger but wings are fries were a let down .	68
0	stopped at pan asian just for drinks . thai iced tea perfect . thai iced coffee so so . the coffee was n't sweet and creamy enough and a little bitter . preferred the tea .	1203
1	this place is great ! offers awesome prices even when i told them i found something private party cheaper they gave me a good outlook and helped me not over pay for a used gun . always helpful and knowledgeable . i 've been in a couple times for smalls parts and ammo but always dream of the guns i want and they are patient and let me hold any of the guns knowing i 'm just dreaming at the time . definitely suggest this place over the other couple of places i 've been here in vegas even though this place is on the complete other side of town from me this is always my first stop !	2247
1	i have hit the age where i now have to wear glasses . all i can say was that the sales rep worked with me to help pick out some pretty cool frames . she ensured i received the best deal possible . what more can one ask !	3945
0	maybe i went on a bad day or i 'm being overly critical , but the service was horrible . the pho was also horrible . pho is pho . the noodles , meat and vegetables are the same everywhere you go . the only way you tell if the pho is good is through the broth . the pho here was translucent and tasteless even with all the msg they put in there to mask their laziness . but yeah , sure . if you 're an elderly white couple , then they will scream hello and thank you . i guess that means good service .	947
1	visited to have breakfast while i had my car worked on . it was delicious ! i ordered my skillet without mushrooms but it was delivered to me with . before i could even say anything , my waiter came back to correct it . great service !	1504
1	this is definitely a 'dive ' casino ... the machines are also very tight so i wo n't recommend coming here to win money but the food and drinks are good and they host a cheap home game type poker tournament friday and saturday were we have had a lot of fun ... nice vibe overall in here ... staff are friendly and helpful ...	2928
1	their customer service at las vegas check in counter is beyond excellent . my husband and i tried to check in for returning to ny , not realizing our flight was a day ahead ! ! a lady name levone kept the situation so cool and accommodate to rebook the flight for that day . on top of it , she somehow managed to cut our cost to zero . i have been traveling for many years yet , i have never experienced such curtesy and professional serives from any of the airlines . levone made us feel so safe and made her ways to clean up our mess . virgin america , and levone , a beautiful person , we really appreciate your help ! !	1623
0	wow has this place gone down hill . we 've been going here for years and used to recommend it to everyone . the last two times have been awful . given , the red curry is still tasty but tonight 's food came out at different times and each dish was literally slammed on our table , spilling each meal . the service has been so rude lately that i felt like i was bothering the waitress by just being there . oh , and forks and water would have been nice to receive on the first ask . i really hope they start changing their approach to customers or they will feel the same closure as their neighbors .	1450
0	google maps says that the restaurant closes at 10:00 pm and their restaurant time board says 9:30 pm . travelled 7 miles and reached by 9:00 pm they said only 3 kinds of biryani are available . since i am a vegetarian i was not left with much options but i was seeing food coming out and person in front of have also ordered all different kind of food . very disappointed with the kitchen staff . i really appreciate the lady at the front who was taking the order she has requested the chef but looks like he was tired and not in a mood to make any food , highly disappointed .	1540
0	horrific customer service & owning up to poor quality workmanship . manager ( very rude & snooty ) redirected & basically blamed bff that she must have stored it ( never used new ) incorrectly for the handle to leak glue & damage the purse . she wouldnt issue a credit & said it could n't be fixed w/o $ or guarantee . never buy lv ! buy gucci across the mall from them . too bad cause sales staff was great though .	1493
1	every time i come to this sonic i am impressed . the food is made to order and the service is excellent . i will specifically go out of my way to patronize this sonic .	844
1	first tine here . one flavor was better than the next ! very exotic mexican ice cream . had corn ice cream and some type of mexican fruit flavored ice cream . in a small strip center , easy to miss . you would think it would be on the south side of charleston , but it is on the north .	2559
1	we see dr. gerlach and she has been amazing every time ! she is always so sweet and caring with our son and always takes the time to answer any of our questions . we have also met a few other doctors and they all seem amazing . we are super happy we chose this office for our son .	3134
0	the doctor and his staff are really nice , but the establishment is either very new or had a very poor budget . not like a `` normal '' doctor office at all , massage bed as medical bed , fold up table used for all medical equipment , no sink , fold up chairs , etc . not very professional looking at all , but dr.scott is super nice .	235
0	ordered a mango mousse cake here recently for my brother 's birthday . the cake itself was very dry ! the mousse was okay , but the mango did n't seem that fresh as parts of it were a bit dark/turning brown . hoping this is a one time thing , but i 'm not sure if i 'll order cakes from here again .	2971
1	typical club with bottle service and things like that . security is pretty tight and on point within . had witnessed two lassies about to throw down , but security arrived to quell it quickly . nice mix of people in the crowd , was able to get a couple of dances with two different groups there ... would return on next trip . cover was i thing 10-15 , forgot how much the drinks were but i do not believe it will break your pockets	1282
1	thank goodness for the cutting garden ! i live in california , and needed flowers delivered for my husband 's relative in north olmsted . after having an awful experience with 1800 flowers , i decided to go with someone local . the cutting garden 's website was easy to use , and their friendly staff followed up with me to confirm . additionally , i provided the incorrect address for delivery ( the relative had moved and i was n't aware ) , and the cutting garden kindly re-delivered the flowers to the correct address , refusing my offer to compensate them for their time and trouble . what stellar service ! i will surely use their services again !	497
0	completely rude employees and owner . very inconsistent food/ingredients and they will screw up your order frequently . they screw up , they will not refund your money . never seen this before ever ! sometimes closer to the house is n't always better !	1521
1	i have been going to get my mani's/pedi 's here for years . they are always professional and do a good job . it is a very clean place as well ! tina , the owner is very sweet . i highly recommend visiting them for your next service .	3905
1	i initially discovered this place through postmates , and i 'm so happy i did . i 've tried a variety of things off the menu , and i have yet to be disappointed by anything ( however , my fave is def the smothered chicken ) . after ordering off postmates a few times , i decided to actually dine in , with the added company of my boyfriend . the service was great , the food was amazing ( boyf loved as well ) , and armadillo grill has some pretty happy customers here who are set on returning many many times . : )	717
0	no show ! ! for an airport run at 4:30am . filled out an online request , received a text , spoke to a dispatcher and all was set . called at 4:32 when the car had n't arrived to be told `` i do n't see you on my sheet '' yeah , ok . overpriced and unreliable !	2356
1	this place is awesome ! they helped me out so much ! really nice and affordable cars . i do n't have the best of credit and they still got me a great rate ! i highly recommend this place !	3518
1	had a wonderful adoption experience at the east valley animal control center this past saturday . i want to thank the east valley team for being so dedicated to the animals in their care ; the team is passionate about what they do & this is evident in the great amount of effort they put into their work .	2689
0	extremely disappointed . i order the large bouquet for my mom . the bouquet was delivered timely , however the bouquet was piecey , missing flowers and different flowers were used in the bouquet from the on-line picture ! i called 800flowers and rep said she will send out another bouquet ... ? ? ? so my mom will have a mediocre bouquet next to a better looking bouquet ? the shock and awe factor was destroyed .	38
0	this place is nasty they didnt disclose my cost up front..if i would have known i would have said no..then poom a $ 251 bill after insurance and they tossed me to a collection agency paid their azz today	188
0	the service was terrible and no one acknowledged us when we talked in . there were three people working and one was extremely rude . on the sale rack clothes were marked wrong saying a certain dress i wanted to purchase was $ 50 but when i went to check out it was $ 150 and they would n't honor the prices .	2153
0	i had a prescription for 21 tylenol 3s after a tooth extraction and was still visibly in pain with a swollen mouth and both the tech and the pharmacist refused to help me after labeling me a `` drug seeker '' . i have only used medications like this after surgeries and i 've only had three in my life ! never again will i return to this location . beware of megan !	1207
1	i had the chocolate covered banana , it was amazing ! will definitely being going back .	3813
0	this is your standard squashed burger . if you like that sort of thing , you might like this smashburger​ . i prefer burgers that are juicy and meaty , not crunchy and dry , but its a preference . i think the smashburger​ fries are sub-par​ too . limp and flavorless​ . not good food to travel on . just does n't sit that well . but what airport food does .	669
0	quick review of my dim sum experience at this establishment : food : 1/5 - i found all the fried food to be too greasy , taro cake tasted like chalk , the cold melon soup tasted like they used un-ripe cantaloupe service : 3/5 - the servers pushing the carts were friendly but the lady who took our bill was a bit of a witch ambiance : 2/5 - washrooms are disgusting , they need to clean the aquarium at the front where they keep the lobsters price : 1/5 - overpriced based on the poor quality of the food ... not coming back here anytime soon .	0
0	had the cronut , it was terrible . soggy and lacked any character . way too much sugar on top . was probably over a day old as i had it late in the day . if the original cronut from dominique ansel is a 10 , this was a 4 at best . might give it a try again if they had something fresher . this is just a storefront so not sure how fresh the rest of the goods are .	518
1	location is awesome . you can walk off the elevator and be right on the strip . great staff and the price to stay is great . right in the middle of everything and o shea 's is such a fun place . you do have to deal with some noise as there is a nightclub right out front . rooms still being updated but good enough .	2976
0	can i give zero for quest ? two individuals tried to get a blood culture from my 3 year old son and caused a vein to collapse . the website said this location does pediatric draw . do n't go to this location . my son is traumatized and his arm is in a lot of pain . we need to wait up to a week to try again but we do n't have that time . they are horrible .	1453
0	this was my favorite sushi place . i always ordered the tuna sashimi , and some days the chef would throw in a few extra pieces . their miso soup is good . today was the last time they will receive my business . the store smelled more `` fishy '' than usual but its a sushi place , so i thought nothing of it . i open my tray and am appalled at the fish . i tried one bite , and almost threw up . -- -edit -- - the owners have reached out to me privately , and have apologized for the poor food quality . i am going to give them a second chance this week .	24
1	this show was great ! the only thing is that they only really pay attention to bachelorettes/ birthday girls which is kind of disappointing because the majority of the crowd is not one of the two . however , me and my friend still had a blast & fell in love with the sexy dances ! recommended for a girls night out ! definitely pay extra for the vip tables , that 's where they spend 95 % of their time dancing !	2149
1	great place . had extra staff available when a large group came in . the quality of sandwiches is as good as any other subway .	778
0	extremely rude ! ! ! i called to schedule an appointment but told the gal to forget it . she was so rude , very short and full of herself , if that 's how the receptionist is i can only imagine how the doctors are and if they 're not they need to reel her in or replace her because she is not giving patients a good first impression . she is costing shepherd eye center patients and $ $ because of her unprofessional behavior ! ! if i could give them a zero rating i would ! !	1635
0	this is a gay bar ? should n't there be a sign or something ? place is old , kind of a classic dive , but , like i say , this is a gay bar ? oh well , the bartender is nice , the beer is cold . i rate only 2 stars because the facility is older and kind of grimy .	3252
0	i took my car in for an interior detail and they did a horrible job , my carpet and seats are stained bad and i didnt expect much from that but alot of the vinyl was dirty and you can tell there was no effort in removing the dirt from it . i will never take my cars there again which sucks but id rather drive a little further and get a better job done	2198
0	this place is very overpriced for the quality of the food . i had the burger and it was very bland and dry . it does n't come with any condiments on it , and my server did n't even ask if i wanted any . the side salad was very disappointing also , did n't seem very fresh and had a flavourless dressing . i wo n't be going back .	273
0	fantastic , unique clothes are overshadowed by the snotty attitudes of the staff ( not carine or randall ) . shopped there for the last time yesterday . not worth it . will spend my time and money at elan or mina 's .	1621
1	my husband and i recently bought a rocker recliner from this location . they priced matched an online business that was asking almost $ 600 less then the price in store . we were shocked and thrilled they were able to do this . we just got the chair home , it was an easy set up and looks great . we are very happy and will be visiting them for any future furniture purchase .	1794
1	i work at the airport and when i do n't bring a lunch , i always go to 360 . they are in the b gate and are impossible to miss . there is a little seating and counter space to put your luggage . well lit and smells pretty good . the food is pricey but it 's aiport food . it 's lways expensive . menu is big and a little confusing but it 's not too bad . i get the 360 chicken . it 's always good . the cashiers speak fluent english and spanish . i 'd suggest this to anyone stuck in the airport on a lay over or early for their flight in or around the b gate .	623
1	we had my daughters bday party here and they did a great job ! loved having the whole gym to ourselves : - ) my daughter said it was the best birthday party she 's ever had !	1427
0	you will be queen when u come after you make a purchase and you come back because there is something wrong with your bag , they blame you for it even if you 've had it for a few days . they try to make it seem like you 've done something wrong . the way i was treated by this store was horrible they belittled me and made me feel as if i was lesser . i 'm not recommend everyone to come lv scottdale cause the stupid service ...	1493
0	love the $ 3.00 tall draft beers . but wings are the smallest wings you will ever see and inconsistent service and taste of their wings . not enough sauce on the wings ever . i 'll probably go for the beers ... . but wo n't order the food anymore .	1285
1	great place . clean and new . i usually go to the sauna in the winter . there are signs that state no shows/gym clothes . it drives me crazy that they allow this on a consistent basis . it 's gross , but otherwise , great bang for your buck as far a gyms go .	3268
0	j'avais très hâte de d'essayer ce salon puisqu'il tienne la gamme de produits bioesthetique que j'adore . quelle déception ! un accueil frette sans sourire . on me parlait toujours en anglais alors que je répondais en français et en plus , le comble , mes cheveux ne sont pas égaux . ouf !	333
0	not that this store cares but you lost a sale today . at the smoothie bar there was one person helping 3 people . i needed something from the bakery , not only did this guy not acknowledge me at all , he left to show someone where something in the store was . i went over to the food counter and asked the guy if only one person was handling the bakery & smoothie bar , he replied i do n't know but pages someone for me to get help in the bakery , it never came so i left . what a poor way to do business .	433
0	we went here for the first time on father 's day at 10:30a . we ordered an omelette and some sort of breakfast special- certainly nothing out of the ordinary . after 85 minutes , we asked the waitress to cancel our order , as we had n't yet been served . the waitress was very apologetic and comped our bill ( which was only coffee ) and asked us to return for a complimentary meal in the future . very disappointing experience indeed .	57
1	what an amazing apartment ! moving in was quick and easy thanks to the help of eric in the leasing office ! the apartment itself was entirely upgraded as well as the property ! the four pools are beautiful and the tennis court makes it feel like you 're at a resort.. very clean , very professional and overall i 'm very happy with my experience ! in comparison to other apartments in the area , this is the best value . for the same price elsewhere , i was being shown run-down apartments with shady landlords . the leasing management here was very clear and formal . i would definitely recommend .	3148
0	wanted to try this place for a while . would give zero stars if i could . stood at the bar area to order a smoothie and got ignored while all the non-ethnic customers got helped . and they were n't even busy . guess south end is n't as progressive as i thought .	1127
1	i bought a kenwood car stereo . excellent ! great guys . they were a lot of help . i just needed a replacement for a old car . they did n't try to sell me something i did n't need . installed the next morning . great guys to to deal with . they showed me how everything worked . i would highly recommend audio express . manuel velducea is really knowable i would ask for him . all the guys are good .	2427
1	first time here . food was overall good . the warm mushroom salad was really good as was the cappuccino . yeah i know who has cappuccino with dinner . service was good . it was not super busy . they have put a lot into the decor . i suspect i should share a salad with my wife next time and order a pizza . the wood oven looks great .	858
0	got a to good to be true flier in the mail . said they would let me out of the last year of my lease and i could get a new lease on a new car at a lower price . .. all lies . be very careful	2210
0	kelly 's is a pretty average bar ... better than average music on some nights . the highlights of the place for me have always been the sweet potato fries , that they carry beer from the east end brewery , and usually the company i 'm with . it 's a convenient location if you 're coming from the highland park area . other food i 've had there- german style bar food was decent .	279
1	recently sgt . splatter 's has gone through many changes . i believe it 's new management and now this place is amazing . they have installed in brand new lights , so you can see what you are shooting and ref 's are fair on splitting teams . the price is slightly more then paintball city on sundays but worth checking it out . i will defiantly be there for sundays as many people come play after 2pm . keep up the great work !	2926
1	the drive thru lady was nice ( where u pay ) but the pick up food lady was like `` thanks ma'am , come back again . all while not looking at you	1162
1	wow the selection of beers on tap is amazing . they got the classics like spotted cow and leinenkugels and ur major brewers but then they got soooo many others ! there burgers are great too obviously cuz it 's a burger joint . had the kentucky bourbon burger or something like that . was outstanding . definitely need to go back to try more beers and burgers . atmosphere was great and waitstaff was attentive . try it !	957
1	what a great little barber shop ! ! ! i 've been meaning to come down , and finally found the time . got me a great haircut , neck shave and head massage all for under $ 20 ! ! ! each cutting station has it 's own personal tv , i was able to watch some football while getting a cut . it 's truly a nice barbershop , granite counter tops and the old school barber shop chairs . this is what 's it 's all about , small local businesses ! ! good work gentleman joe 's ! ! !	1862
1	came across this place randomly but so glad i did ! i love this bar ! the interior is super classy , there 's live music , and every drink we ordered off the menu was strong but masked by a great taste ! i got drunk off only 2 drinks but enjoyed every minute of my drink . the only reason i did n't give 5 stars is because the price was a little high . $ 14 for a cocktail , but even so the drinks were good ! i definitely would come back . one of my favorite bars in vegas to come , chill , and have a good time .	1992
1	there is n't enough stars to justify this place . let me just start by saying stuuupppppid fire best breakfast i 've had in las vegas staff was friendly chef made sure everything was good the bacon was so good the soft shell crab benedict was amazing	57
1	i bring 2 dogs and 2 cats to north royalton animal hospital . yes , i might pay $ 5 more for this or $ 10 more for that , but they saved our dog 's life , when another vet ignored the signs of his body shutting down ( they said it was allergies ) . i 'm not actually sure if they actually are more expensive than othr vets , but it isnt enough to make a huge difference , espcially when a furry life is involved .	2770
0	every time i go into this store , i feel like more of an annoyance than a customer . the employees just seem to care about talking to each other more than their actual clientele .	1884
0	went in there for dessert , horrible service , food quality was okay . i think server let restaurants reputation gone to it 's head ... ... there was no greeting , not even water were served to us . we asked him question and he never answer them , just said he will go check then we found him happily serving table of 6 besides us ... the next time we saw him was when he passed us the bill , not a thank you or how was the food ... . wow ... .	437
1	i love project cupcake ! best cupcakes in vegas ! the owner is a truly a nice guy . the cupcakes are baked to perfection . there 's no competition here !	1889
0	ordered 2 shrimp tacos , tasted terrible to say the least . the tacos will cost you $ 10 yet will be the size of tacos you can get for $ 1 on a taco tuesday . the sauce tasted unnatural and like it was made in a chemistry lab .	623
0	if you do n't need help with anything this store is ok . the hundred of associates walking around are inaccessible and uninterested in customer . i ca n't tell you how many times i went in there to buy something and had to leave to get some help somewhere else . long time best buy customer no more .	494
0	less than stellar . tried out pure pizza for the first time on a friday , when they were having a pop-up market . i was there at 1:00ish , before the 2:00 pop-up . after ordering , i found it strange i had to ask how long , considering i was to go ahead and be seated - but that 's extremely minor . pizza was brought to me piping hot - but also somewhat burnt . so after letting my pizza cool , the flavors were just ehhh . there was just nothing too special that would lure me back again , considering the plethora of other options out there .	809
0	knowledgeable . plays on your intelligence - you need to have good idea what your items are worth or what you are willing to consider a fair deal . must ask direct question to get answer as he answers question with question .	2032
0	i am not going to ramble , i think the pictures speak for themselves . this is the worse grooming experience my dog has ever had . whether or not my dog 's behavior played a factor , i believe this could have been handled differently before it led to nicks and bald spots all over .	2501
0	the 2 stars are because we were happy that there were no cages . we brought our large short haired dog because of shedding and expected him to come out brushed . when we picked him up we still had handfuls of hair in our hands . not worth it and we wo n't be back .	3615
1	the regular walgreens i go to was not open yet & i went to this store which is open 24-hrs . i need refill & ms. thuy was there to help me . since i used coupons for my rx , she was very detailed and professional in making sure i get my needed rx with discount . thank you !	1207
1	the employees were very friendly and the food was great as usual . i really felt they wanted to give every customer a good experience at their location . customer service at it 's finest !	3372
1	awesome ! best jerk ever ! in fact , this is probably the best quick lunch spot i 've been to in many , many years . this place is super good . it 's mostly a take-away business but either way , you ca n't go wrong . thanks yelp , for suggesting this place ! never would have noticed it otherwise .	1355
0	i wish i was treated with more respect . i do n't know what has happened over the last year but the professionalism has gone down significantly ... i 'll be going elsewhere : /	2096
0	i never thought i 'd see the day when walgreens became classier than cvs . this place used to develop photos , now it does n't . it 's just like every other stupid , gross , overpriced and useless cvs in the valley . employees are rude or just plain stupid and it 's in a terrible area of town , so i wo n't be going here or any other cvs for that matter .	3044
1	i have not personally been a patient at sw spine and sports but my wife has . i have gone to every single one of her appointments with her and the staff and providers have always been very helpful and friendly . dr. stone and dr. komar have taken really good care of my wife , the office is clean and easy to get to from the 101 , and the back office staff have always been friendly . i would definitely recommend sw spine and sports .	3566
1	apparently i 'm the only one to like this location ? i used to come here in the mornings before work and the girls working here were always so friendly and whenever i wanted something new but could n't make a decision they would help me come up with something off the menu that would turn out delicious . i ended up moving to the other side of mesa so i no longer go here and that kind of disappointed me since i liked it here so much .	1804
0	no one has any knowledge on skin , hair , men 's cosmetics.you can get only assistance on makeup , if you get lucky !	2479
0	we just purchased a house here in arizona and walked in to purchase some big appliances . we walked around for about 10 minutes without any sales person assisting us . during that time two additional customers walked in and were attended to promptly . felt very discriminated ! do not shop here !	2454
1	- extremely solid eats . - the seafood congee is freakishly amazing ! - also discovered fish paste cooked into the long donut thing ( it doesnt translate well ) ... . winner .	1173
0	i really want to like it ... been there twice cause i want to give it a second chance ... for someone who loves desserts it just was n't there ... certain things were dry other things were lacking flavor both times ... great decour and really nice service but the food quality is just not there	2410
1	jasmine has a little something for everyone at a good price . the hibachi grille is my favorite , where i can choose my own raw ingredients to be cooked on the spot . the sushi bar is n't bad . the buffet is quite large and is better than average . service is good and very efficient .	1302
0	i eat burgers all the time , as well as garlic and mushrooms , never have any problems . got the garlic mushroom burger here 6 months ago and felt extremely sick after . for some reason , i decided to give it another go ... and felt pretty sick again . would n't recommend it .	1461
0	tire shine still not shiny . but twice this week , the last roller brush that comes overhead after the multicolor soap has not been running . how is it allowed to give less services than were paid for on unlimited subscriptions ? ? ? they should disclose what parts are broken at the start so people can choose not to but a wash. and everytime an unlimited subscriber goes thru , it should refund part of the subscription price automatically when any parts inn the wash cycle are broken . getting paid for services not rendered . bbb.org complaint coming .	2939
0	i 've not used this place.nor will i.but i just want everyone to know that they support and offer ear cropping on little puppies ! ! it 's an absolutely barbaric practice.i cant believe vets still carry out this procedure ! please think twice before bringing your animal here.its all about the money ... ..	1864
1	place is quality hands down to science extractions done right thank you muv so much	1849
1	my friend wanted coffee at 11pm so i kidnapped her and brought her here ! it was our first time here but it wo n't be our last . she ordered the hot caramel macchiato and i ordered the hot white mocha which was so so good ! perfect hint of sweetness . we both shared a honey toast which the worker recommended to us , it complimented the coffee perfectly . the seating is not your average seating but it 's cozy nonetheless . i loved the decor as well ! cute little spot for a late night coffee .	2219
1	after a month of searching crappy places , internet sales , tent events , awkward warehouses , my boyfriend and i came across this places as we were tossing up the white flag on our way to ikea . it 's clean , straight forward , and chuck our sales guy was super helpful and not pushy . while they do have discounted and clearance mattresses they are the only ones i 've found that give a 10 year warranty and a 30 day comfort trial period on all their mattresses . how rad is that ? i 'd totally recommend them to anyone . : ) thanks guys for making this so easy , wish we came here first !	2003
1	always helpful . great service . amazing doctors and staff ! greeted as soon as you walk in and helped if needed . will always recommend this location to family and friends !	1590
1	i have been going to open arms going on almost six months i have a wonderful counselor who has been so amazing . the staff is a wonderful woman named veronica who also gets to know you personally and is an absolute delight . we still have lots of work `` for me '' lol but i have much faith that she will get me where i need to be . i look forward to our journey .	2629
1	grabbed two lunch specials for the first time and was pleasantly surprised . absolutely worth the $ 6.50 each . ordered via yelp and picked up at their side area inside the bounty hunter bar . they honored my special requests ( dressing on side , add lettuce and extra peperoncini ) . gyro and fries were tasty- garlicky taziki sauce tied it together . antipasto salad was very large with plenty of meat and cheese but lots of veggies too . soda came in 12oz cans . will be back to try more lunch specials .	987
1	good furnishings at a good price . purchased family room furniture and dinette set . very happy with service .	3738
1	great ice cream and good service . a bit expensive but portions are big to share . it 's usually packed and hard to get a table but that 's good sign , right ? enjoy !	3604
0	ha ha we stayed here a few years ago . my first time staying down town . the price was pretty good , but i would rather pay more and have more . i 'm not high maintenance but i do like my room service coffee in the morning at least , and they had no refrigerator in the room . the people here are run down old broke men , and last time we walked in to play a couple games it smelled sooo bad of old man farts we stopped dead in our tracks , turned around and left ! no more for me .	3630
0	food was good ... our waitress kelly . seemed a bit pissy.. and the bathrooms were just plain scary ! !	340
0	i ordered a talk loved green tea latte.. the cup was full of ice and all u got was 3 sips out if it ! ! ! and all the barrister said was sorry ! i officially hate/boycott starbucks ! ! ! ! !	2849
0	this place being `` new '' the only money spent to make is any better seems to have been all put in the sign on front . unless your bowling maybe after reading the other review they might give a shit about you . i was waiting playing pool on the rest of my party and the music is so old and tasteless that i going to leave . the food might have gotten better but the lack of service makes me not want to spend another dime here . this place is worse then before in my opinion . please make some improvements . p.s . the lighting sucks for playing pool and it 's over priced as shit !	3296
1	the banana base shakes are good , i had the chocolate shake and i really enjoyed it . it had a friendly staff which added to the place .	1134
1	i love this best buy in henderson . the staff is very friendly and the managers are very helpful . the location is located very convienently next to costco , galleria mall and about a mile away from target and toys r us . their price matching plan is pretty robust and they do match newegg and amazon . since , amazon started charging taxes , this has been my go to place for electronics .	494
0	this is my first time here and i must say i 'm a bit disappointed with this place . i came in for korean grill but very limited options for beef . i ordered short ribs but got strips and the waitress dumped the entire serving on the gas stove ( as shown in pic ) all the while we 've had servers come over to our table and turn off the stove without saying a word , leaving us wondering how should we continue cooking the food ! i would n't recommend based on their service .	1290
1	located in both the eastbound and westbound travel plazas along the ohio turnpike , they offer cajun style chicken , along with other southern cooking in a fast food setting . prices typical of highway travel .	1479
1	great customer service and unique flavors . i do n't know why so many others disagree but this is my 3rd time ordering a cake/cupcakes from this place so that says enough . a couple of my favorite flavors are the cookie monster , pink champagne , and recently a brownie chip with orange that was recommended . i recently ordered my graduation cake and 4 dozen cupcakes from here and was not disappointed at all . thank you ! ! ! ! ! : )	1806
1	you have n't really been to vegas until you 've see one of those shows where the girls are topless and wearing giant feathery headdresses . it 's classic vegas at its best . it 's not like any of the cirque shows . it 's good old fashion singing , dancing , and fully choreographed numbers . splashy costumes , chorus lines , it 's all there . it 's a fun show . they offer a 'kid-friendly ' version earlier in the evenings . i do n't remember , but i think there is a two drink minimum . it 's classic vegas in all its feather and rhinestones glory .	3069
1	we needed some grounding , warm , nourishing food after a long drive and this place hit the spot ! it was pretty quiet ( which we loved ) and our food came out promptly . the smells are enticing ! we were checked on by our waiters consistently and our waters were never less than half full . my husband got a lamb dish and the lamb was tender and flavorful . i got a vegetarian dish with peas ( forgot the name ) that hit the spot . lots of flavor and spices but not so spicy that you ca n't even taste your food . a wonderful find , we will definitely return !	640
0	we just moved in these apartments and we were excited butt we were told the pool would be done at the end of july and now it 's the middle of august and it 's been a week since we have seen anybody working on the pool . a apartment has already been broken into and parking sucks . are parking spot is far away and they wo n't do anything about it . the only ups is the apartment is nice but management sucks and no pool and parking sucks ! ! !	2684
1	of all the breakfast chains , vi is always my favorite . prompt service , pleasant waiters/waitresses , delicious food , plus pie . ca n't beat pie . i always get breakfast , the chicken fried steak skillet is my favorite , but the new chicken-bacon-avacado hash is superb as well ! i 've been to many different locations , and always have a great experience . if you can , ask for beth . she 's super sweet !	1029
1	was in the area for a birthday party today and wanted mexican . it was good & just exactly what we wanted .	189
0	came here for brunch yesterday . was seated right away and the server we had was friendly . we ordered off of the breakfast menu . it was okay . the eggs lacked some flavour ( needed salt ) . my boyfriend also had some hair at the bottom of his eggs ( so gross ) but we were done eating by the time he found it we did n't bother saying anything .	534
0	they gave me a cup to pour my own coffee out of those decanters where you pump the coffee using a lever on the top , like a cheesy hotel cafeteria . not very fresh , and a coffee was $ 2.50 . the `` bold ethiopian night '' coffee was not bold at all . watery . it 's too bad , i really wanted to like this place .	1140
0	if you had a bad experience with slash salon , visit arizona state board of cosmetology website to report your complaints . this business is already under investigation . their unethical and deceitful way of business practice should be ceased in our community .	3474
0	toilet ran snd gurgled constantly even though a repairman worked on it for an hour and never cam back . carpet was so dirty after 1hr my granddaughters feet were black . blood on master shower curtain was the disgusting top of our experience . we stopped and told front desk . no one cam up and replaced it . pool was cloudy . reported this to front desk and they said oh were sorry . with no sincerity this is why we did not take tour ... even with the $ 125.00 cash offer	1057
0	very rushed and unprofessional polish job . they try and make as much money as possible , they start the process then leave you waiting to help a new customer then rush back to quickly finish . had n't been to this place in years , now i remember why . needless to say i will never be back .	3213
0	ok , this is best option near me since quick pharmacy closed . they make a ton of $ on scripts with my family of 4 . called ahead and spoke with pharmacy rep on site ... asked timing for.a prescription that had been called in by my doc . pharmacy said 15 min ... now still here and its 15 min plus 45 more . pita .	1641
0	this place is a scam . my bill supposed to 420 $ put the they end up took 860 $ out mine credit card argue with them for weeks they only refund 130 $ .if you rent here becareful .	3595
1	enjoly is absolutely great ! she really listens and gives me exactly what i want in a haircut - even if i do n't know what that is myself !	1617
0	standard walgreens minus the slowest drive-thru pharmacy ever and the amount of beggars you 'll encounter .	1881
0	warning : go wild is sliding down hill quickly . i wo n't be back , especially with lucky fish now happening two miles away . quality is now below acceptable , roll size has shrunk , service is as bad as other reviewers mention . i had to sleuth out what was `` off '' in my roll . the culprit ? rotten carrot . well , at least it was n't rotten fish , but you know , if they ca n't do produce right , its not worth the gamble with the raw fish . sionara , go wild .	431
0	what a change ! from a first class restaurant to a mediocre one at best . the food may be ok but the smell of the bathroom may overwhelm your experience .	784
1	annie is the best tailor i 've found yet here . she not only did wonders with my bridal gown , she took the time to get to know me and even bought me a coffee to talk over ! i will never try any one else . she 's efficient , she 's resourceful and the best absolute priced ! i would recommend her time and again . kelly murtha	3401
0	sounds like things have n't changed . bad service bad attitude . just close for f 's sake .	718
1	this place is amazing ! they have great customer service however they do tell you that it will be next day - the reason why is there workers are at night or morning completed the dry cleaning due to weather in az . i can respect that .	1911
0	the order process went well and the delivery arrived in a timely manner . i saw a picture of the flowers my friend received and the arrangement was n't even close to what was pictured on the website ... a lot more filler flowers despite ordering the premium arrangement . i picked this place specifically because of what they offered despite other cheaper places in the area . i am disappointed because i wanted the best arrangement possible for my friend who is going through a tough time . i will not order from this place again .	3689
0	great job guys . i pay $ 160 for a buff and wax , as well as signed up for $ 30/mo car wash package . what i got was an unfinished wax job that was n't even finished . missed places all over the car . buffing compound and wax left on places all over the car . they said it would be done at noon . i show up at noon and they said they would have it done in 20 minutes . 2 hours later it was finally `` finished '' in this terrible condition . forget this place . what a bunch of jokers .	127
1	i 've been shopping here for years . the clothing is excellent . the quality is awesome . i 've had numerous outfits over the past years that are still in great condition . the staff is ok . but like i 've said the clothing is phenomenal . that what keeps me coming back . i swear by this store . i recommend it to all my gf 's in and out of the adult industry .	145
1	came here with a good friend of mine and made an appointment for a pedicure but they take walk-ins too . when we got there , picked our color and they sat us right away . seems very clean and they have the plastic liners for the pedicure basin . we got the spa package which includes sugar scrub , warm lotion , and hot stone massage , came to $ 30 and $ 20 for a basic pedicure . my guy was super nice and really cared about their service . brought us bottles of water when we sat down . and he giggled at me when i got ticklish ! cleanliness is very important in my opinion and this place looked great !	2886
0	honestly i get the creeps everytime i drive by this place now . about a year ago i stopped in to get a cookie dough ice cream cone , paid , looked down at it and matted in the ice cream was the largest wad of hair ever , i literally gagged . i handed it back to the girl and nicely asked for a refund , she rolled her eyes and gave it to me after seeing the hair and never even apologized . this place is disgusting ! !	2075
1	just wanted to highly recommend john at this location for those who get deep tissue massages . he was very thorough and my 90 minute massage was one of the best ive ever had . very professional and experienced !	3862
1	i love this place so much , and with the delivery to my work , i often eat here . the food is always good , the staff is lovely . the only complaint i have , is that with how often i order from jimmy johns , there 's no rewards or loyalty program for valued clients . i probably order from here once or twice a week , as it 's usually the only place i eat out at . i would love it so much better if there was some kind of consolation for buying so many sandwiches .	1475
0	been here twice now , and i ca n't seem to like it . i really wan na like this place - the masked mexican fighters , so cool , the idea of mixing mexican and asian , you 'd think it 's a hit . obviously i 'm in the minority here , but i just found the burrito overstuffed with rice and the noodles inside are still cold . it 's not like i just gave it 1 shot ... i returned a 2nd time . maybe i 'm just spoiled by burrito boyz .	834
0	bar has good choices , good service , crowd were high brow low iq sjw types unfamiliar to the art of open conversation amongst bar-goers , go if you like beer , avoid if you like shooting the shit with strangers and feeling welcome in a place meant for drunkenness and loose spitballing .	3077
0	the wi-fi is terrible at this location . even when there is no one in it . so close to a college as big as asu you would think they would upgrade it and add some plugs . been coming here fur years and it 's never gotten fixed.. please pass it on and get it fixed . thanks.. also bathrooms are always dirty	2218
0	the people at these locations and the online customer support are useless , and rude . i would not want to do business with any of these locations again . live and learn , and i wo n't be making the same mistake twice .	2208
1	we own a boxer . we had a bad experience at petsmart , so we tried grand grooming about a year ago . we keep going back because they do a great job on our dog 's nails , they are reasonably priced , and the staff is very friendly . they treat our dog with respect .	1247
1	great dinner . fast service . spanikopita was really good . would be a 5 if the server had a personality .	177
0	i wo n't waste time repeating everything everyone else has already said . it 's all true . if i did n't live in a place where there is only one other choice of airline for most destinations , i 'd never fly allegiant again . btw- if you choose a rental car with your tickets , be aware , there are a lot of hidden/excess costs in that . in vegas , we were charged 30 % more than the original price for taxes , fees , etc .	3127
1	i am the founder of a non profit holly ' z hope . i was looking to work with a spay and neuter clinic . i found spay neuter charlotte clinic online . i was nervous at first having not used them in the past . i was pleasantly surprised . the facility is very clean and the staff was great ! the clinic allows my organization to provide low cost spay and neuter service to dogs in my community , which helps prevent unwanted pups . thank you ! !	2864
1	i shop at best buy mainly to get new things for my camera . although the prices might be up there , i 've always had a decent experience with the sales people . i 'm not computer savvy , so when i ask questions about installation for photo programs , or about new accessories i get they are always helpful .	607
0	been there a lot of times over the years without issue but after having the recommended cajun chicken , i woke up this morning with food poisoning . i 'm going to be staying away for awhile , but do not order chicken from there !	670
1	it 's nice to see a filipino restaurant on the southwest side of town . staff was friendly , and service was quick , but my friend and i happen to go on a thursday evening where it was slow .	658
1	great , professional service ! easy to setup , they came out , communicated and fixed the chip in a bus windshield.. no up sell , no bs.. refreshing for vegas !	2036

1	habib always knows how to make me look great , my family and i have been relying on him to tailor our clothes and our weekly dry cleaning . he never disappoints , he has another location at bathurst and dupont	3391
1	this little record store has a good selection of both new and used records . while some of the prices may seem a tad high , they are selling them at a reasonable rate , considering . remember , this is a small store , not a major retailer . they are not out to do anything other than make a little money selling records . please support them . i found some great records in great condition for $ 4 , $ 6 , and $ 10 . not to bad eh ?	2570
0	what ever happened to customer service ? two huge issues attitude of cashier , who acted as if i were an interruption to her day ... . she was standing staring out of the window ... the other was no soap in the restroom , , when it was brought to the attention of the cashier , she asked her co-worker who was cooking.. her response `` we do n't supply soap '' . wtf ! ? ? not the type of thing you want to overhear in a food establishment ' ... not so cool bean '' s n cream . : (	2516
0	disgusting ! ! the tuna sashimi has a film on it and definitely not fresh . the spicy tuna rolls were filled with cucumber little tuna the edamame was cold and no salt . the sweet potato tempura was greasy this is not a restaurant operated by japanese people they would be ashamed of the quality and presentation , the price was in line with the quality low	516
1	chips and salsa are awesome . the queso was good with chips . we ordered the sample plater with queso cheese . naturally its crowded on this day and mistakes with orders are expected . but doesnt take away from the flavors . wore more salsa on my shirt than usual but hey i enjoyed it all .	1558
1	somewhat lower priced birth control , with really long waits . the centers are pretty much all the same here , just with different hours . the staff is friiendly , but so slow you 'd think they 're actually making your pills from scratch in the back . but , they are more affordable than your regular doc if you do n't have insurance .	2334
0	i 'm done going to this place . twice in a row and the service and food have been subpar . servers that do not write down my order do not impress me . we ordered an appetizer that never came . when we asked about it our food arrived so we chose not to wait for it . having just ordered soup and salad that was underwhelming i left hungry . there are too many places in monroeville to go there again .	1367
0	i 've shopped at this safeway store for almost 15 years and have always loved the clean store and excellent customer service . in the last few months that has changed - i 've had several bad experiences that i 've reported to the manager without seeing any change . very often the cashiers talk to each other without even greeting customers , baggers crush items and i 've even had to ask them to at least keep bagging while talking to each other so i can get out of the store ... even witnessed a bagger pick a ( verbal ) fight with a customer while waiting for a manager to resolve a problem . i 'm just consistently disappointed .	2785
1	not a big fan of the hollywood location but the vegas location has much better food and the service is excellent . the crowd is cheesy but hey this is vegas guys ! i had the sea bass which was perfect . the pretzel bread was to die for . the short ribs were a bit salty but they changed it and it was just fine . prices are high but it 's a pretty restaurant in the new aria so i would give it a shot for sure .	971
0	totally ripped me off . do not fall for being charged for diagnostic service so they can try to get u for ridiculous charges after . go elsewhere . wanted close to $ 2000 to get my vehicle running . i towed my vehicle to another place 2 miles away . $ 40.00 later my vehicle was on the road . they should be ashamed of themselves .	2084
1	i recently got my windshield replaced with safe auto glass and could n't be more pleased . it was smooth from the beginning till the end and my glass looks amazing . i received the promotions i was offered from the sales rep and would highly recommend this company for any auto glass needs !	200
0	very rude service ! 5 people after me got their coffees but nobody make my baby 's smoothie ! and no one feel sorry about it ! and after drinking just a quarter of the smoothie baby and i both started running bathroom !	3669
1	good ol ' starbucks ... . they have everything for every season . during the winter they have their seasonal drinks such as the famous pumpkin spice latte , peppermint mocha , creme brulee latte . or the refreshing flavors during the summer like the passion fruit tea and lemonade or the very berry hibiscus tea . my favorite however anytime throughout the year is the white chocolate mocha and the classic chai tea , hot please . best of all , free wifi ! ! ! every starbucks has tables and chairs and you can lounge as long as you want .	2950
0	i guess i should n't be surprised at a national chain auto shop like this trying to get more money out of customers than originally quoted but when you drop your vehicle off for a $ 10 tire rotation and pressure check and then get told they cant get some of the lug nuts off so they 're going to have to charge you to replace studs its a little ridiculous . so $ 10 was going to turn into more than $ 100 . their inspection also suggested $ 2300 more worth of work ... i 'll pass on ever returning to these guys again . fletcher 's should have never sold to these guys .	3795
0	place is over rated ! ! first let me start with the kids club ! ! it 's hard enough your a mom and get to the gym to work out ! ! only for them to send you home bc there is no room for your kid.. it 's pretty much unmotivated me to even go.. with that said , also machines are always full ! ! pretty much you get kicked off the machine before your even done.. they just keep on adding more people it 's over crowded.. machines are not kept clean ! !	3268
1	`` great service '' on saturday , i called to get brake parts , for my girlfriends car.i spoke with paul , he went out of his way to help me . i got all the right parts . and at a better price than pep boys . boyd and charles , are great guys to deal with , as well . if you are tired of dealing with rude , disrespectful people , and tired of getting the wrong parts . than give the auto zone at 6770 sky point drive , a call . thanks . steven jay	506
0	the experience i 've had in this place is literally the worst experience i 've had ever ! the staff was so rude and horrible to me and my wife and we only wanted to adopt a cat . we left with no cat whatsoever and the worst experience i 've received anywhere . they may say they are doing something good in the world but it does n't give the right to treat people like shit .	1787
0	car wash has been sold to a new company . they have been closed for weeks but that has n't stopped the new company quick quack from billing the monthly rate . after calling and trying to resolve the charges , turns out neither company wants to admit to billing me . not a good way to start things off . several other carwashes that are n't far away . i will be checking them out .	2044

1	the food is very good and fresh . the portions are big too . a nice little gem . if you want a great tasting healthy meal give it a try .	779
0	brought my husband 's truck to get washed , first time at this location we have the unlimited pass . as we sat there watching them attend to our truck we see the girls doing the windows and the guys standing and talking . they let our truck dry naturally , windows were half ass cleaned . and when we brought it to their attention they all just stood there looking at the truck and no response , yeah the truck was dry because of the wind not because they actually did anything . this is the worst service we had with cobblestone to the point we are now contemplating cancelling all together with . completely ridiculous when you spend the money you spend ...	988
0	this is terrible service . my mothers appointment was at 2pm she was n't seen for at least 45 minutes and that 's because we had to check in with the front desk of the doctor sharing the office with gupta . the staff is very irresponsible and just look miserable and they are n't very friendly or helpful . usually as a new patient they give you paperwork before entering the actual room . the nurse had my mom filling out paperwork at the same time he was trying to take her blood pressure and everything else . the doctor himself is very kind and helpful but his office staff and nurses do n't do him any justice .	297
1	i could n't have said it better than vivian s. she pretty much covered everything regarding the food court here . greenland supermarket is a little gem for visitors who want to experience something better ( like diversity of asian food , etc . ) than what 's offered on the las vegas strip . i was pleasantly surprised to take a short drive to this location to just browse through the aisles and aisles and aisles of hard to find asian products and foods that are n't so common in the south . the variety is tremendous and i definitely stocked up on my snacks . just go here .	715
0	the owner of the property we are renting engaged this company to replace a defective spa heater . when they finally came out , they started the work , and left the old heater and trash all over the place . it took them several weeks to finish the repairs and clean up the mess they made . we made numerous calls to find out what was going on , and got a different story each time . on the final visit john initially refused to even talk with us . when i approached him he finally let me know what he had did , however it was quite obvious he was not intending to do so . the entire process took almost two months .	827
1	disappointed but previous reviews . found this randomly on groupon and gave it a try while vacationing for a friend 's birthday . vicki was our host . amazing . she did n't anything and everything to accommodate everyone 's needs . she made the entire experience well worth it . definitely will do it again but will request for vicki ! ! !	2122
0	three days in a row i 've went in this place and they never have nothing they run out of bagels run out of stuff to put on the bagels there a joke i live on the east coast and dunkin ' donuts is there never run out of nothing if i had it my way i would give it a one star and the people there are rude	1131
1	i 'm writing this review based on training and shopping experience . i 've never had to groom , board , or use the vet facilities here though all look great . the training here is the best in charlotte . mr willie is wonderful- he turned my rambunctious crazy pup into an off-leash walker in less than 6 months . we started in his beginner class , went through intermediate and advanced , and are now in therapy dog classes , looking forward to taking the therapy dog test soon . willie can help you with any problem , from drooling to chewing to car sickness to aggression . he 's the caesar milan of charlotte . highly recommend ! ! !	514
1	i started getting my pedicures here a few months ago . i will absolutely not allow anyone else do my feet except tom . tom is a true gem . the best pedicures and foot massage ever . i 'm a client of tom 's forever ...	2128
1	very speedy urgent care . i go here exclusively , they are faster than my pcp and any other urgent care . the longest i 've spent total time in and out the door with my prescriptions is two hours and that with a full lobby of sick people . most of the time i 'm in and out of the urgent care in less than an hour . the staff are courteous and professional and seem to be genuinely concerned with my well being . i really appreciate have a place to take my family and know that i 'm not going to be there all day .	2580
0	horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like i was told i could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also	1561
1	came in thursday , and they were able to help me on saturday ! super fast ! the office is small not too fancy , but then again the price paid was less than half quoted everywhere else . i definitely recommend them for any process !	1932
1	as an update ... i was contacted a few months later by an executive of the company who apologized profusely for the poor service . after a conversation with him , i have to say i was very impressed and believe his words in `` that is not the way they do business . '' he was emphatic about it and i believe it now . he hoped that i would try to company again , and actually i really will now . in fact , based upon this follow-up , i have recommended this company to a friend . this is a good example of the fact that '' customer service is not a department ; it 's an attitude '' . good for you .	2833
0	pricey bread , too pricey for the quality.their sourdough baguette is just plain white bread , the brioche , blah . the decor is lovely , clientele , upscale ; more like chi chi hang out than anything else .	2327
1	awesome & delicious donut choices , cool atmosphere , excellent customer service ( shoutout to tj for the cotton candy donut recommendation , it was great ! ! )	2053
1	consistently great food from this gem in the south hills . vibrant atmosphere . we have been here several times over the last two years and the food is always terrific . try the beet salad and the grilled crab appetizer . fantastic .	1171
0	normally a decent mall . i was at southpark on fri , 3/11 during the evening hours and there are packs of juveniles running rampant on both levels . no security in sight . wo n't return here on a friday evening again !	492
1	i absolutely love this place ! they serve northern china style dishes here . i ordered the pork steamed dumpling , the braised fatty pork and some bao 's . i especially liked the thin wrap that they use for the pork steamed dumplings . everything tasted delicious , however , the food can be a bit heavy/greasy . their decor is pretty modern and the glass lets you see right into the kitchen . the seating is fairly roomy making it great for larger parties . will definitely come back !	943
1	this is a very nice target . it is clean , inviting , and the staff is very nice and helpful . i do a lot of shopping here based on the cleanliness and atmosphere . i would recommend this target to anyone looking for a nice place to shop .	2411
0	until they get rid of the company that takes care of the farm animals i will never go back . peta needs to shut this co down , i saw unbelievable crulity to these animals	759
0	i last paid a visit to this mcdonalds about a month ago and ordered breakfast . though it was n't busy , the cashier took us to a kiosk and said she her manager wants patrons to use the machine instead of ordering at the register because they are `` quicker . '' this was the second time this has happened and now we do n't go back . part of the experience of going to this mcdonalds are the nice cashiers and interacting with them ... especially when it 's not so busy in the morning .	1489
1	great food , good service , fun vibe , always busy for weekend brunch . worth the wait .	975
0	i live about 1000 miles from nearest conns store and have never shopped in one . yet they call me daily trying to collect money from me but wo n't tell me what i am supposed to owe for . judging from all the complaints out there , they are an appliance store covering for a pretty shady financial operation . ignore their calls and do n't give them any info .	2673
1	what a gem ! very kind staff and reasonable prices . they even gave me a pedicure kit to take home because they would n't use it ! we 'll be back for sure !	2481
1	this place was really good . it 's really hard to find organic options that are reasonably priced . they had very flavorful food and its prepared as healthy as possible . we 'll be back !	1402
1	you get what you pay for . i am not looking for first class accommodations when i fly usually . i am looking for an inexpensive and safe airline . i will usually research an airline before i fly them and allegiant has won awards for their maintenance . that is important to me . factor in that you can get a cheap ticket if you do n't mind not picking your own seat assignment and only taking a carry-on . i have flown them to pasco , ft. collins and colorado springs . usually on time and nice crews . i will fly them again .	3127
0	the worst customer service ever ! ! i had a coat getting altered and they messed it up and tried to blow me off for several days . the lady just tried to give me my coat back and say go somewhere else and the manager has no managerial skills at all . it took me to tell them i 'm going to call the news and take u to court to get my money back..which the manager tried to give me store credit first.and as i was leaving another customer had same problem with management ducking and dodging to take care of the customer.very very poor if i could give negative stars i would .	3032
1	i have been a patient of dr. schroeder 's for over 5 years . i love this office and my doctor . yes , there is usually a wait , but that 's because they are specialists and spend the time with you explaining everything . i do n't mind waiting as i know i will get the same service .	737
0	i asked for pizza at 5pm ... ... ..it is 805 pm ... ..still no pizza . they said , so sorry , we have it done by 6:45 . they did n't . so unreliable edit : '' no pizza till 9:30	1478
0	never going back to bonterra . this is the second time that we could n't eat at the restaurant due to a private party . very inconvenient . and the food are not that great . glad there are so many other choices now in charlotte .	886
0	i got a fairly expensive groupon and walked out looking with a rachel from friends . i understand the 90s are back , but i feel like i should be a soccer mom somewhere . i told her 3 times that i wanted bangs cut on an angle . she said she understood , but she went ahead and cut them flat . this haircut is terrible and i wish i could get my money back .	3686
1	deven did a great job . he was extremely attentive to my needs and kept me informed with the listing for the building that i was interested in . when we closed , he helped me look at the options for the management of my new property . very responsive .	3870
1	good experience in good value ! especially with yelp discount . very good relaxing experience after an intense hike !	735
1	again , 100 % spot on . thank you so much for the best 2 hours i 've spent in years . i feel like a wet noodle . think it 's time for a nap . i love the staff . i love the hospitality . i love my masseuse . thank you to all of you . you are a great team .	1950
1	i 've been here a few times over the last week or so , and the daily choices for drip coffee have been fantastic . i love the variety , and each kind has been full of flavor . i 've had a few of the pastries as well , which were n't really anything special , but that 's okay ; i personally come just to seek my morning coffee , and am more than pleased .	1140
0	all you need to know is that the chicken was extremely dry . if a shawarma place ca n't get that right , is it really worth trying ?	1206
1	had the brunch . it comes with pastries , a glass of champagne , a starter , entree and dessert . had the pizza and wife had fish . tasty although pizza crust got very hard as it dried out . ambience is very cool and chi-chi . we liked it and will try happy hour if at the mall .	941
0	okay . so , yes , i did have high expectations . i waited more than a month to go to this place because of schedule conflict , not because it 's restaurant week . it was n't worth it . idk . maybe it 's because it 's restaurant week . but that 's not a good excuse . the interior did n't look much like what it looked like on the internet , the calamari was too cooked , my wife 's pasta was almost as hard as twizzlers and the desert was too sweet . i would not recommend this place to anyone .	886
1	i 'm really not sure what 's up with all the negative reviews . i had a very good experience with sixt . no arm twisting or belligerent scare tactics to shin on for additional accident protection . every employee from the shuttle driver to returns were as personal and helpful as can be . a nice selection of well maintained cars i will definitely use sixt again in cities they cover .	1905
0	i dropped my cardinals tickets off sunday morning with the agreement of 70/30 split in my favor . they called me back an hour later and said they made a mistake and it would be 70/30 in their favor . really ? ? ? i 'd rather eat my tickets than do business with someone that does n't keep their word . seller beware .	1995
1	hubby and i tried this just to see what it was not expecting much because we figured it was geared towards children . and although it is , we still had a fun time going in it . it also made for some cool pictures !	3060
0	the golden tee machine 's spin button is not working . how can you expect to make nice shots without controlling your ball ? also it was the masters today and they would n't put on the tv noise so we could n't hear the announcers . instead it was some rap type music . the food and service was fine otherwise though .	1177
0	are here twice and both times the wings were undercooked . the second time i even asked for the wings to be cooked longer and we 're still undercooked . never coming here again . be aware owner will respond to you for bad reviews telling you that you are wrong for feeling negatively about his business .	1397
1	dr. smith is amazing . i love him . he is the reason i keep coming back . very thorough . great job . dr. hererra very helpful . staff drops the ball . a lot . but the doctors ... .they are worth whatever issues you have to go thru to get to see them .	590
0	absolute worst grocery store . bakery has nothing fresh meat department has nothing priced well or fresh . no one will bake or cut anything fresh . they are banking on the convenience for mountains edge customers.also the deli never uses clean and covers after they are cleaning equipment . completely disappointed .	1904
0	the atmosphere was nice , but the service was poor with only one waitress serving the lounge . the food menu was also quite weak as it appeared to be made up of one small plate from each of the surrounding food venues . the alcohol menu suffered from the same problem as the other bars in the aria , no high end whiskey .	456
1	this is the best ac repair service in the valley . they were sent by my hone warranty . no hassel or up sale . my ac went out on the holiday and they came out the next day and had me up and running in 30 min .	2776
1	i love coming to this starbucks at the trails . it 's my 3rd place . my issue is this ... its 107° so i 'm not going to get coffee , hot or iced , and sit outside in this heat in the daytime . it 's now 8:00 pm , starbucks is closing and there are streams of people filing in to make it before they close . i think it 's time to convert to summer hours ! stay open until 10:00 ! keep it open ... they will come ! if you agree show some love ...	44
0	not taking this airlines again . was told here was a delay , but upon arrival was here was a 2.5 hour delay . this was known days ahead , but notification not provided until after check in . it would have been nice to have been advised before then ... as the delay ( construction at sf ) was/has already been going on . so in summary.. not disappointed in the delay ( this happens and i understand that ) , it was just the lack of communication .	1623
1	i have truly never felt more physically or mentally healthier since going to esos lifestyle center . i look fantastic & my depression is gone ! best decision i 've ever made ! sam , the owner is incredibly intelligent and has the best knowledge of the anatomy & physiology of the human body . thank you esos	3206
0	wow , location is horrible ! ! ! scary dungeon at night- so far from mccarran car rental shuttle - out in a dusty desert field.super long wait times - antiquated check in . do n't forget your insurance card ! the one star was for the actual car , which was fine . totally not worth the few dollars you save by not renting from a company actually at the mccarran rental car station- which would be a much cleaner faster and easier experience ! ! ! ! !	3576
1	the service here is excellent . they are very helpful and reasonable . they do n't try to sell you services you do n't need . i 've had 2 vehicles inspected and serviced here , both honda 's and the service here is much better than the dealership across the street . i will continue to take my vehicles here for anything needed .	2260
1	i have a review of one star at a different kfc location ( the one on 10000 block of west charleston ) but this location had the freshest tastiest chicken i have ever had . service was timely and courteous . i would drive out of my way for this location rather than go to the one in my neighborhood ( summerlin ) . kudos to the management )	1517
1	it 's alright . a convenient place to grab sushi before heading down to the lake or the garden which is located nearby .	41
0	not worth the money . dirty , equipment falling apart , just run down . you would think with the amount of money you pay , it would be clean and they would replace old equipment and fix the leaking roof . spend your money at another gym .	1620
1	this place is such a great breakfast option ! i had their french toast which came piled with fruit and a cup of fresh squeezed orange juice . the decor is very modern and features a spiral staircase leading to the upstairs seating . they have a huge menu ranging from just about every breakfast option you can think of . definitely a great place to stop in before a day of sightseeing in montreal .	243
1	i just found this store . if you are in need of costume jewelry , this is the place to check first . great selection . this is not very high end jewelry , so if you are on a budget it 's worth a look . why the manager would n't let me take a photo to post on facebook is a mystery . why pass up free advertising ? ? anyway , take a look .	3839
0	hire new security ! light skinned guy ( who i 'm not even sure was sober enough to be security ) was a little in his feelings and i guess had a bad night , decided to be rude for not reason to our party . mind you , i was with a group of super bowl champions , and this guy left a terrible taste in all of our mouths . he was a complete clown . even the police told me to call and complain . .	2728
0	employees really need to straighten up . one behind the counter is flipping off a coworker who 's smoking right outside the entrance while there 's a line of customers . i believe the one who was smoking said they 're cousins but nonetheless should n't be unprofessional .	1738
1	i 've been going to this location for a few years now . it 's recently been placed under new ownership and it could n't have come at a better time . the lady that now does my nails is so much better than anyone that was here previously . all the staff is brand new and they are definitely an upgrade !	3040
0	very good location : close to downtown and near the lake . the rooms need to be renovated : furniture was chipped and stained , draws could not stay closed . no complimentary internet - not even for elite spg members . usually spg properties allow you to use computers in the lobby or in the business center , but not here .	1859
1	this car wash just raised its rates 67 % to $ 5 . but they left the big 3 on their sign to deceive customers into thinking it was still $ 3 . the big 3 now stands for 3 minutes . we will be going elsewhere from now on .	3785
1	i think ive found my new favorite nail salon ! ! everybidu here is super sweet.. very patient and they actually listen ! ! ! ! i live in goodyear but work closer to mesa . i wanted to just relax a little before hitting the traffic back home and omg was i blown away ! ! prices are so reasonable and the work here is amazing ! ! ! i will honestly be coming back here from now on ! ! ! kevin is the best ! ! !	1783
1	another social sunday stop . popped in and got a couple pizzas to go . there was a line that moved quickly . we both opted for making our own pizza . i got pesto , pepperoni , mushrooms and olives . hubbs got marinara , pepperoni and sausage . both pizzas were good and not soggy , even after the long ride home . mine was salty but it was my own fault . i was n't thinking . the mushrooms were marinated , that plus the kalamata olives really put it over the top salty . it was still good just a little much . 800 degrees is a good deal even without the discount .	282
1	i 'm usually not very 'adventurous ' in my meals . but i 'll eat anything they make . the chicken tiki masala is the best i 've ever had .	640
0	if you like to spend 20 minutes between your order and when you get your drinks , and you really mean lukewarm when you mean hot , and you do n't really care about how they taste , then this place is perfect for you ! i would give it one star if they did n't have the tiramisu crepe cake , but if you find yourself here by mistake this is the one saving grace . great atmosphere though , perfect for the 20 minutes you will waste waiting with popcorn to watch your own sanity slip away .	344
1	great food and great service . my boyfriend and i had the pleasure of having austin as our server . he was so funny and personable . he is definitely an huge benefit to this restaurant . thank you , austin .	705
1	i needed a car on a saturday and did n't realize they close at 1 pm on saturdays , so i got there a few minutes before closing . the agent stayed late to help me out , which i really appreciated . no problem with the rental and return .	2371
0	quoted $ 153 and change to get my gear shift changed and mind you the part cost $ 12.99 , so $ 140 included labor . they open at 8a and i got here at 8:16a . it 's now 12:08p and the technician bret ca n't remember how to put it back together . wtf ! ! no one bothered to say anything or give me an update on the progress , until i asked at 11:05a . so on top of the $ 153 , i am having to use several hours of pto ! it 's now 12:10p and no car . maybe i 'll go play them the same 30 min youtube video i watched .	1957
1	been a member at this location for over 2years . today was specially extraordinary . her name is jenny ... and she 's awesome . think i grew a couple of inches . she was fantastic . the pain in my lower , sciatic nerve is gone . she used some special natural oils and i feel great . thank you jenny ! ! ! and as always , the rest of the staff is very professional . bought the new scented candle `` mistletoe kisses '' and it 's so christmasssy ! ! ! !	1950
1	this place is great ! was hesitant ordering from here and not a lowes or home depot but decided since the prices were better and staff was friendly . jay and brett have excellent customer service ! jay was really patient with me and all my questions and helped me figure out the exact things i needed for our project . i would say some items took a bit longer then they were supposed to but everything came in finally and correctly . anytime we need anything like this i will make sure to give this place my business !	1548
1	the best walgreens on rainbow blvd . the staff are knowledgable friendly & down to earth hospitable management is caring & will handle all customer service needs that come there way . ca n't say enough great things . to mention a few names . dara , camie , tanya , jackie , seth , melissa , karen . so many more that i have left out & i 'm sorry . kudos guys for being the best part of my day every-time i come in ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	3937
0	came on a saturday night for a friend 's birthday , definitely not what i expected . there was no cover fee , the place is really small - no dance floor . the music does not include top 40 , had to ask the dj to play some hip-hop . mainly light rock or metal . expected a lot better . 2/5	2237
1	this store was pretty good envoy helped me out . i had a check engine when i came by just for a code pull . we had his tech take a look . it was `` off '' when we looked at it i had envoy help me recheck it and i found out what the problem was i had a p0320 so i figured it out . his service was great he 's a very focused gentleman . i 'm on vacation for the weekend from la so i 'm glad he could help . thanks good on you bro	1778
0	i really wanted to give this one star , but dr. gorman was fantastic . everything else from service to follow up was terrible after . go there for the script , do n't bother ordering anything from them , you 're better off going to costco .	403
1	good mall for walking . there is a costco , movie theater and decent food court	2815
0	having eaten at the nyc bareburger i expected similar goodness . uh uh . i ordered some type of game meat that had no distinction whatsoever from ordinary beef . this was an expenisve very boring and tasteless meal with very ordinary fries . expensive and dull , perfect for toronto .	1417
0	upon entering this store , i found this place to be very cluttered and disorganized . the staff here is lacks knowledge but overall is friendly . however ? i could not give this place two stars due to the fact that they refused to sell me an item that i know is completely legal . i could basically buy anything in that store but one item . i find that this place could really could do better if the prices were a lot more competitive unlike the ad that is placed outside of sahara that everything states that everything is 30 percent off and that the employees should be current with nevada law .	2927
1	the only reason they got 4 stars is because of their 3d . the theater is very nice , and the seats are nice ( more comfortable than harkins in fact ) . in all fairness i am comparing their 3d to imax 's 3d . i saw the hobbit in imax real 3d and it blew us away . seeing oz in real 3d was not the same , and the 3d was not as good . for non 3d movies i would probably choose amc now over harkins due to the comfortable seating . as with any movie theater the prices were insane . $ 4.75 for a bottle of dasani ? ? ?	2406
1	i order taxi 's for various out of town consultants . typically they arrive within 15min and its cost effective . it works for our company .	3142
1	this was my first time trying poke and i decided to order the ninja and was not disappointed . the salmon was fresh and delicious and i was pleasantly surprised by the variety of toppings they offered . i was also happy to find out that they had a liquour licence and served asahi beer . nothing like poke and an ice cold asahi on a hot summer day . the staff were friendly and professional which is n't always the case in korea town ... i will definitely be back for more !	309
0	fun , tasty cakes and awful customer service ! stay in school kids ! we would n't go back if they were giving the cakes away for free !	18
1	i love this store because it has plenty of deals and things you will be happy to find , but it 's clean . i spent a lot of time in here and found some amazing items at fantastic prices . the only reason i did n't give them a 5 is because they do n't have any carts . it 's to their own detriment because people would buy more if they had carts . there 's more than sufficient parking and they always seem to have plenty of sales off their already amazing prices . the staff is also very kind .	3276
1	this place is okay . it 's pretty straightforward they close one day a week . i can walk in other days without any issues . there is going to be some wait on the weekends . saima is the girl who does eyebrows and is quite an expert at it . she is very quiet and an introvert . i do n't think that is being discourteous . they started with $ 7 eyebrow then went on to $ 9 and now back to $ 8 , cos of competition across the street . but at least it 's getting my work done and unlike other places where i have to make multiple calls to finalize an appointment .	1383
0	the women running the business is a very scary-looking and rude woman . she does n't even have nice teeth herself . the office was n't very professional looking at all and my teeth did n't even look much whiter after the procedure ( maybe 4 shades ? ) . groupon holders beware there are way better ways of getting whiter teeth for $ 100	2909
1	my spouse and i come here for our scions maintenance - very happy with such great service and the toyota warranty . i wish i came here and gotten my car from toyota instead of jeep . out of all dealerships - this dealership never made feel pressured with a kind `` here is my car , call me when you made your decision . '' i love my jeep but the customer service sucks at jeep miller . only if i could of forsee the future -- i would of purchased the rav 4 . keep up the good work guys !	307
1	pretty impressive they came through with 2 dozen pink and white cupcakes on late notice . everyone at the party loved our treats and im glad we had such a good experience . now i would recommend some sort of bulk discount because 2 dozen cupcakes to the time of $ 85 bucks is a little stretch , talk about the spoiled kids i have..	2024
0	a reply to their comment . he did not refuse to do surgery , in fact im a perfect candidate for this surgery . try actually reading my whole review before spewing stuff that does n't matter . such as addressing how rude he is . or how he wanted to do a procedure that was dangerous to my health . obviously he used to be good but that no longer seems to be the case .	557
0	i love museums . very disappointed in this one . expensive for the value of the exhibits . the bulk of the exhibits are photographs and digital displays . coat check is unsupervised - which i 'm accustomed to in some museums - and of all the lockers there are only two that work .	3847
0	horrible experience as a long-term spg traveler . one of the guest experience associates , refuse service for me 15 minutes before the end of the night . complete laziness and lack of personal attention.the front desk , while apologetic , did not do anything to help me . very unfortunate .	1690
0	sold me a car with damage to the a/c condenser . it was filled and sold . thanks again asshole .	2244
1	the service is good . very officiate and fast whether heading to the airport ( wait time 1 min or less ... or being picked up from the airport ( wait time within 5-7 mins . i gave 5 stars solely on the value with using groupon .	2531
1	quick and easy for the laser hair treatment . the office was big.. quiet.. had tvs and magazine to keep the ones waiting.. happily waiting . we did have a 630p appointment .	2631
0	i went at 230 on a monday . it was dimsum i hated every second i was there , the carts were going around but the ladies kept ignoring us and i do n't understand why . we got gar how & a spinach dumpling . after that not a single cart were go by and we sat for so long till i finally i gave up we went to pay and it was 14 $ which is soooo high for what we got ... ... i 'll never ever go back .. .. food was good though	0
1	great facility . the staff is very helpful and everything is clean . i also had a great experience with danny as a trainer . definitely recommend .	1802
1	biggest of thanks to matt at one stop wireless ! ! i called a ton of places before i came here so i could have my shattered iphone 6 screen fixed . everywhere offered me $ 150 or more & i would have to leave my phone with them for more than one week . not happening ! but at one stop wireless matt fixed my phone in one hour for half the price of those other places ! ! so grateful ! life saver	2930
1	this is a shout-out to matt & ashley at this location . they are awesome ! ! on a super cold day when it was already dark & snowing , matt completed my rental agreement , put on his coat , went outside to get my car & then drove it around so that i just had to hop in . ashley is also super nice & helpful , and was able to assist me with a larger car when i needed one . i hope corporate is reading these reviews , because the madison location of enterprise is doing it correctly ! thanks matt & ashley !	2345
0	great place really helpful techs ! ! however the younger girl who answered the phone was completely rude ! ! im a customer service manager my self and i get it answering the phone isnt fun , but dont make the person on the other end feel stupid for calling especially since i was calling to ask about adding another $ 200 in upgrades . i think i will just do them my self now .	3058
0	by far the worst customer service i have ever had to deal with . i have been a member of gold 's , la , and pure fitness . all were easy to deal with and simple to cancel . i have been trying to cancel my personal training for 2 and a half months with no luck and more charges . do your self a favor and save the headache , do n't sign up for personal training here ... i 'm not sure how canceling your regular membership is but i suspect it 's the same.. the gym itself is just a gym , smaller than most but it gets your workout done .	3298
0	i 'm very disappointed ! their yogurt does n't taste as good . not as creamy and flavorful as it used to be . i do n't know what changed but hopefully they fix it !	885
1	friendly staff , and rare movies make this theater a rare gem in the valley !	2450
0	i ordered through ubereats and was extremely disappointed . the perogies did n't even have potatoes in them , it was like a glue-like substance inside that had a slight potato flavouring . they pride themselves on the quality but nothing i ordered was good . everything was tasteless and it seems like they cut corners when it comes to quality . this place is extremely over-priced for the horrible food it produces . i was excited to have another gluten-free and vegan option near me but i was mistaken . do not order from here !	278
0	this is by far the worst pp health care center i 've been to . had an appt and still had to wait almost 1h to be seen . then i found out , almost a week later , that my prescription was never faxed to the pharmacy . when discussing the issue with the clinic 's supervisor , who refused to issue me a refund for the amount i paid for the appt in order to get the prescription , she stated that was only a `` minor mistake '' .	2334
1	we came here after other provider turned us down . the service was super quick , staffs went above and beyond to serve us , even got our windshield fixed . thank you guys , well earned 5 stars .	2544
1	our ac stopped working , so we gave polar air a call . they were able to schedule us for an appointment that same day and even called us back to send someone earlier than scheduled . memo is an incredible service technician ! he quickly diagnosed the problem , explained everything , answered my questions , and was very honest and straightforward . memo was friendly and professional and our experience with him was exceptional . we highly recommend polar air !	1564
0	3 stars for the hotel -1 because it does n't live up to a sheraton standard ... this is an old run down sheraton . still a nice place to stay , but it needs an update . nice pool btw ...	3166
0	these guys were great about a year or so back but now they seem to have had some front desk changes . i came in for a rotation and was told they cant rotate my tires as they were legally bald . i took it to not one but two other discount tire stores who said the tread was about 5 and that not only could they be rotated but they were good for another 7-10k miles . i 've lost trust in this place and will go back to discount for tires from now on .	3405
0	the service is great but the food is horrible ! ! ! our fish fry came out burnt . the cheeseburger we ordered medium . first it came out burnt . the second time it came out bloody . do n't recommend this cook	1253
0	i 've only been to a few advance screenings here , but i do n't really like the theater . i usually go to regal on rea rd . phillips place is an old theater that regal bought and upgraded . although they installed stadium seating , there still is n't enough room between the seats for me ( 6 ' 4 '' ) and the chairs are not comfortable . the parking can be bad too . it 's not worth $ 10 to see a movie here .	3680
1	saw this show twice now but 6 years apart from each time . the acts have been up'ed their game and the performance is much more entertaining now . they keep their material `` fresh '' ! not a bad seat in the house given how they set up the tables ! ! ! this place does scream of bachelorettes- there must have been 30 of them there when we went so if you are trying to get on stage , know that you need to set yourself apart somehow- dress your best and if u are going with a bachelorette and want her to get on stage , shout , point and put a veil or something on her to stand out in the crowd .	2149
0	worst place ever ! i was worried sick about my dog and i heard so many good things but when i walked in the place was empty and they could n't help us at all . stay away from this place . i recommend desert view animal hospital is a much better fit	2009
0	went here looking for business attire for an interview my daughter had . there does n't seem a rhyme or reason to the way this particular store is laid out . the worst was they gave my daughter two right shoes . perhaps she should have looked but did n't . when we got home she realized she had two right shoes . the cashier had checked the shoes at the register but missed it as well . the only reason i 'm giving two stars is because they stayed until we got back to exchange the shoes .	1608
0	we recently bought a house in peoria and hired gary/plumbnow to remove a walk-in tub and replace with a normal bathtub . the replacement tub he installed has cracked in a number of areas and we attempted to contact gary to make repairs . he quickly blocked our phone numbers and we now need to find a new plumber to make things right . overall an incredibly unprofessional , awful experience . i would give zero stars if possible .	1721
1	great el camino burger . split that and an order of garlic wings with my girlfriend and still had leftovers to take home . we also had onion rings that came out nice and hot with some good sauce for dipping . add a couple raspberry ices teas and our bill came out to $ 43 . no bad .	1487
0	i booked appointment through yelp and decided to buy a series of blow outs . made appointment at salon for 2 weeks later . i show up and front ca n't figure out what happened to my appointment . had charity event that same evening . what is the use of a blow out place if they ca n't get their act together for appointments . asked for refund for the credit i have . front workers said they could n't and i have to email owner . the email address was wrong and i called twice and got 2 different email address which was all incorrect . bad business on tatum and shea .	2190
0	do n't go by what they have online . express is no lotion and the scrub is more like a quick touch on your heel . the technicians were not friendly . when i pointed out the discrepancy on their website they argued and were rude . it 's not my website . i 've always had good service but only when i 've paid more . if you get the express do n't come here .	2372
1	i got the mocha chocolate chip frape mmmm sooooo good made my day un till i got stuck in the play house lol just kidding	1220
1	started going here in college with my roommates when they had $ 5 burger tuesdays . yeah its a chain but they seem to do it right . menu has the standard fare , with noticeable twists . they recently changed the recipes for some of their apps , not for the better in my opinion , but the green beean fries are my favorite . waiters are generally really good , and their stripes card gets you free chips and salsa , as well as points for free food and desserts . vanilla bean cheesecake is a wonderful way to end your tgif dining !	1187
1	my nieces attend gaa and they could n't be happier ! the curriculum and structure seem to be well balanced and challenging , and the teachers are engaging and pleasant . i especially love the innovation gaa uses to send home messages and homework . all schools will have challenges , and it seems gaa is great at tackling issues head on and resolving any conflict . the teachers are supported greatly by the administrators and all faculty are excellent communicators with the gaa community .	2640
1	the core institute is the only orthopedic facility with which i have had any experience . i can not rave enough about my experiences there . from the office staff to dr. myerthall and his assistants , everyone is efficient , courteous and knowledgeable . wait times have never been excessive . i have been consistently treated as a person , never a number . i honestly could not ask for any better treatment ; i ca n't think of any area in which they are lacking . i will consistently recommend the core institute and dr. steven myerthall to anyone needing orthopedic surgery .	2896
0	if safety is the first thing you 're looking for . i would n't try bishop glass . mike one of the driver/owners ? likes to cut people off in traffic . i figure if they 're driving is that unsafe and messy their work is probably the same . drive safer .	1516
0	this company used to be called golba and managed my property for nearly 3 years . during this time they did things like do repairs i did not approve , bring under qualified tenants who damaged my property . they were supposed to do quarterly inspections and provide a report on the property . that happened once a year . they changed ownership so often that i did not know who to hold responsible . bottom line take a look at the reviews under golba . they are poor excuse for property management .	3512
1	i recently bought a vespa from these folk , they are so nice ! i was feeling a bit sheepish cause i was n't ready for a heavy bike yet , i kind thought i 'd feel silly all the way through.. but not at all though . the sales guy was super knowledgeable and super cool and helpful , the owner came out and said hello , there was a dog there lol . they delivered my bike for me cause i still need to get my license and that guy was super nice and helpful too , walked me through my entire bike ! thanks guys !	94
1	i second cynthia c. i live in san francisco , and i love me some pho . # 1 's pho with beef and brisket is at least as good as that of my favorite pho place in sf ; however , # 1 looks like a real restaurant ; my pho place in sf looks like a lunch counter . a great spot for cold-weather lunches .	784
1	love nordie 's , best place to buy shoes , only place i really like to buy shoes ... i am probably the most picky person when it comes to shoes because my feet are weird , one is bigger than the other and my size is in between 6 1/2 and 7 ? ? ? so what to do and where to go to buy shoes ? nordstrom 's of course . they have the best return policy , if a pair of shoes do not work out , it is highly returnable , no questions asked ! now that is what i call customer service in its finest ! ! !	1907
0	my first review of this business was 12/6/17 . now that i found a new place to go , i wanted to share the day/night experience . after many calls i settled on nail design . remember that name . i had a 10:15 appt . i was 10 mins early . the door was open and the owner was standing there welcoming me . he greeted me with good morning said my name and asked if i would like coffee , tea , soda or water ? this was my first visit . i will say no more . tnt has not been introduced to customer service . good-bye tnt ! !	2892
0	oh my . i thought this service was suppose to be an improvement over taxi cabs . i tried uber and i got a filthy 10+ year old car and a driver that barely spoke english . i felt very unsafe in this vehicle . i would never allow a family member to use this uber thing . caveat emptor	2878
0	i went here yesterday and it was nothing like the dos gringos on priest . you can tell the manager at this location is lazy and does n't really care about the location at all . there were 4 dogs on the patio barking . there were children running around with cell phones as their parents were drinking , and the service was crap . bad location . go to the one on priest .	704
0	sat for fifteen minutes in a half empty diner while two waitresses walked purposefully past us avoiding eye contact and served other tables that had arrived after us , apologizing for their ( shorter ) wait . we finally took our business elsewhere since it is apparently not needed here .	406
0	first time joining sam 's club and i had a terrible experience ! we got a good deal on the membership but the place was so disorganized ! there was product on the floor , not much variety . and the lines were so long ! barely any employees around to help . i am just sticking with costco from now on .	2469
1	great atmosphere and delicious food . service is a little slow , but the staff were a sight for sore eyes ! i would go back ! !	634
1	been my doc for over 4 yrs . staff is always very friendly and helpful . he seems pretty straightforward when it comes to telling you what 's wrong and how to fix it . other doctors sugar coat things but not him . would recommend him to others .	965
0	literally zero stars . stopped by today about 1pm to grab a coffee and the service in the drive through was extremely disgusting . the `` boy '' actually said to me `` yeah ? '' when i ordered ! i get to the window and was looked at , provided my coffee and zero salutations ! i felt i was intruding on `` their '' time ! always the same low low standards !	1008
1	we have nothing but wonderful things to say about gymboree ! ! my daughter went for over a year and i 'm getting ready to put my son in a class there too ! just trying to figure out a sitter for my daughter . the teachers a amazing !	3460
1	what a great spot for a delicious , healthy lunch and/or smoothie . unique combinations that do n't taste like every other `` healthy '' spot out there . the staff are kind and friendly . love this joint . more of a takeout place as there 's no seating ( only a stand-up area where you can eat if you 'd like ) .	9
0	i was surprised they could n't dance , mostly they ran around . the choreographing needed serous updating . their bodes were great ! ( thus , the 2 stars ) though , i found myself bored . all the girls ( 12 ) in the wedding party felt the same , the entertainment factor was poor at best , sorry .	2149
1	the good place for shawarma . it comes wraped in warm toasted pita with all the veggies and served with a delicious tahini sauce . the hummos is ridiculously great . i use to always went there for shawarma sandwich for lunch .	275
0	noise from expressway is so loud you can not sleep . like trying to sleep at a racetrack : - ( would not recommend nor stay here again .	1190
0	awful . fatty meat , hard fries , no bread service and expensive . we got a cheeseburger that had hard parts in it and the hanger steak which was so fatty we could n't even chew most of it . disappointing .	1226
0	horrible service , unhygienic environment , and oily food . they have roaches that climb out of nowhere and when you scream , they try to act like they do n't understand the word `` roach '' ! ! like , really ? when a person is freaking out , that is not the time to pretend you do n't understand english . such a nasty place . they actually had to rebuild the a portion of the restaurant because an employee set the roach bomb ( s ) off incorrectly and a fire started .	895
0	i am very disappointed with these people . do not order from them and especially not from amazon online . i ordered several lanterns and then changed my mind but they tell me they were already processed , this was less than 20 minutes later . i sent them an email saying that i changed my mind and i wanted them in a couple days after they arrived seven more arrived . i sent them an email and they said i had to pay to send them back , it would cost me as much to send them back as i paying for them . very unfair and very uncooperative .	3854
0	the new management at the gramercy from newport beach has decided residents should walk around in the 100+ degree temperatures to get to the office . instead of using door from air condition hallways.clearly your head is still in newport beach and not in las vegas where the temperatures kill people .	2151
1	i found lucas lawn care on google when i was looking at getting my front yard turned from dirt to gravel . lucas lawn care quoted us at a reasonable price for what was being done , and did it with no hassles ! they did such a good job with it , we wound up having them cut down some trees for us , which they did for very cheap and did a great job at ! they did such a great job with those jobs , i hired them to do the maintenance for the yard too ! would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good landscaping company !	2091
1	best place to be for sports events . service and the location is amazing . great staff and the choice of food are huge . delicious foods and great drinks . back and front terrace with tv screens everywhere . the decor is beautiful . good for groups and co-workers .	574
1	i would have written a review back in early 2007 if i have discovered yelp sooner but hey better late than never ! : ) i was fully entertained . the casts can really sing . i give it a four stars since the 3 women next to me was damn loud clapping and singing along to the song . agh ! anyway , i truly enjoyed the whole musical . i just ca n't understand why the 1 and 2 stars given by some . too bad its closed now , i would love to go see it again ,	2752
0	do not go here they just butcherd my cuticles the guy did n't speak any english and the owners wife was yelling at me because i was upset with my service.. then she locked me in the place so i called the police on her and her husband.. they tryed to chase me and then locked me inside.. and i even payed her in full and she did n't even finish her job because she was yelling so loud in the place.. do not waste your time and money..lesson learned never to go to places like this ever again..	3682
0	this restaurant was just ok nothing special . appetizer for 3 pieces of shrimp tempura and veggies was $ 15 . a bit overpriced for what you get . tempura was also falling off the shrimp as if it was half breaded . also ordered orange chicken , but had to send it back because was chewy and not crunchy with on overbearing orange taste . would 've given 3 stars , but before we could even get up and leave the waitress proceeded to clear out our table reaching over us to gather dishes . i can see if the restaurant was packed , but it was not . not so friendly service .	1196
0	website says they can repair an apple nano screen . apparently they do n't and have been `` trying to get that removed from the site . '' i submitted a request this morning and provided my phone number that i would be in today . they could have called to let me know prior that they would be unable to accommodate .	3817
0	been here a few times . the service is always amazing but the food leaves a lot to be desired . i would go back just because of the location .	437
1	my family needed a new washer dryer . i did a ton of research before deciding on best buy . best buy offers free delivery , free set up of the new unit+ take away of the old ( if you mention that you were just at lowes- i do n't know why , just tell them ) . i was saving $ 100+ on that alone compared to sears and home depot . the washer and dryer was on sale ( they even have the older models , we opted for the newer ) and they price match . the staff were friendly and attentive . they knew their stuff , were patient with my family and got us in and out quick .	494
1	nothing like those fresh cookies upon arrival . we stopped over for one night on our way to dc . hotel was clean and staff friendly . pool was half indoor , half outdoor , which kids loved . bathroom in room was a little small/tight but overall we were very happy with our stay .	1741
1	i live close by to the location . i 've have gotten close with the staff fast . it 's always nice to come in and get greeted by your first name .	2843
1	great chicken ! great pizza ! this place is just great at quick and easy service . wish i knew abiut it when i moved to north hill . worth every inexpensive cent , for a meal worth more	1416
0	wtf this must be a target that the target headquarters forgot about . when you walk in it look like you 're in a kmart in the early 90 's , that 's bad btw . it has a strange smell and the employees must not realize they work in customer service bc asking anyone for help was awkward . i could i was annoying them . i will drive out of the way to avoid this target .	2859
0	party of 12 , orders wrong 5 times . sent back and uncooked . staff was apologetic but lost our business very quickly as we decided to move our group to a new venue . cool atmosphere for a beer , food is overpriced and tastes microwaved .	2732
1	everything fresh . best pizza in town come and give it a try you wo n't regret it . we visited this place twice while vacation in vegas . tasty , clean , great stuff . recommended for people who loves pizza .	282
0	this review is for my wife . what the hell happened to billy ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	2057
0	was just completely ignored for fifteen minutes at the men 's sunglasses case . not impressed . i 'll go someplace else with my impulse shopping .	1907
0	terrible service ! ! do n't use zippy shell ! ! no communication , no follow up , no resolution ! ! they really do n't care about the customer at all ! ! they pack what they want , even when you tell them not to pack something and leave things behind that go with what they 've already packed ! ! one big joke ! ! i 've been dealing this whole situation for 2 months now and i still do n't have my pods ! ! please whatever you do , do n't use this company ! !	1613
1	me and my girls had a great time on the tour ! /the clubs were ok ... hyde was the best of the three but we had much more fun on the bus . there was an open bar and lots of entertainment from guido torpedo . awesome host ! ! highly recommended tour .	2122
0	nakia was so sweet and nice during my first appointments , then she changed . nakia has the basic foundation for doing hair and may become better under mozell 's mentoring . the one thing you ca n't teach is professionalism , honesty and integrity . this is where nakia is sorely lacking . she handles her client concerns with a great lack of professionalism , maturity and respect . you would think as a new stylist to arizona and a professed number of years in this business and her professed beliefs , that her client communication and consideration would reflect much better . most unfortunate but ... i can not recommend her services .	82
1	the joint chiro in paradise valley is my regular spot . taylor the chiropractor gave me one of the best adjustments i have ever had and will go to him regularly .	3186
0	fuck this store . rude ass people . always some issues with this store . customer service sucks . people do n't know their own store policies and then the fucking self checkout machines charge you for shit you did n't even purchase . fuck this store .	583
1	came here with a friend on a wednesday , i have been here many times for lunch but i have to say the wednesday spaghetti was a great choice . excellent value super flavorful and absolutely worth the stop in . very friendly staff and inviting atmosphere , the patio was n't open which was a bummer but i absolutley advise stopping in with family friends or for lunch .	102
0	mediocre cake too much icing cracked uneven ... nice over the phone not so welcoming at pick up ... . it was not worth the price paid	782
0	jankiest full set of my life . all i wanted were short , natural looking acrylics ( i 'm a nail biter ) . my acrylics are about 1/4 inch thick and completely misshapen . i had to go home and file them myself because one hand the nails were longer than the other and the shape was horrid . one side was rounded while the other was square . i kept pointing it out and the girl would `` fix '' them but the shape was still awful . i will never ever return . i ca n't wait until i need a fill so i can go somewhere else and have them fixed . awful !	527
0	i called and had a great conversation about cool sculpting . i had decided to use a coupon that was extended to me so i called back and was really discouraged in getting cool sculpting . i was pretty bummed to say the least . two completely different points of view and conversations about the same subject . sad	1349
0	great furniture but absolutely horrid customer service . bought a living room set there . chatty sales person made several errors since she was talking and typing at the same time while she put in the the order . first wrong delivery address then attempted delivery way outside the delivery window . every time i call i 'm on hold forever with their contact center . sometimes those calls end in a hang up and sometimes they flip to the store in glendale which is no help . called the scottsdale store directly to speak to the manager who apparently does n't return phone calls . dont go here .	3738
0	randomly closed 45 minutes before posted hours indicate . sole employee watched me pull in , puzzled , and circle around the lot and decided to duck back inside the dark office . first - and last - attempt to patronize this business .	3819
0	crooks , angela had me go in on my day off in hope of getting rid of my car but that was a lie all these guys lie , told me i would get a free tank of gas for me going in but its all a lie dont believe anything these guys tell you there just shameless sales guys trying to make some money off you . hate this place for life for lying to me i hate liars	2754
0	this is without a doubt the worst car repair location in akron . i took my car in to get the tires balanced and rotated . they called me 2 hours later and told me i needed $ 1,500.00 of repairs none of which had anything to do with the tires . this was on a car with only 48,000 total miles and has been well cared for . took the car to another shop and they said none of the items they recommend where bad . they were so mad i did not have the repairs done they refused to balance the tires . stay clear of this place .	1055
1	we get take out from this place quite often and let me tell you , it 's so delicious ! great peanut chicken and peanut tofu , it 's cest bon ! ! the dumplings are some of the best i 've ever had . delicious delicious highly recommend .	649
0	i have been here twice , both at night time around 6-7 pm . the workers yelled and joked around with each other loudly in chinese . that 's fine . what 's not ok is i hear a lot of chinese profanity . i know that perhaps many could not understand those words , but chinese customers do ! i felt very uncomfortable and i suspect this is just their work culture . those shouting workers were front line at the food section and bakery , not in the back .	2069
1	makers & finders newest location is the perfect spot to grab a warm beverage whether you 're in line for santa photos or enjoying downtown summerlin 's nightly christmas parade . i love the mexican spice latte , but i 'll try to switch it up with the coconut turmeric soon . coffee may be the star , but the latin-influenced food menu is creative and unique . i 'm not usually a fan of caesar salad , but i crave m & f 's version made with kale .	1332
1	i love going to this place because i get to interact with animals ! it was pretty busy but the staff helped us out and were very nice !	1894
1	my family and i have been coming here since i was a kid . we get our rice , produce , and seasonings here . the staff is friendly and treat you like family .	2652
0	: (	74
1	great drinks , good service , baristas are kind and fair . wish they had more vegan offerings , but that is the only piece of critical feedback i can offer . beautiful cafe space .	2163
0	the plain tart is never working and tonight i got blackberries that were turned sour . better find another location .	885
1	one of my all time favorite hakka chinese restaurants . almost everything here taste amazing . some of my favourites are the seafood soup , chilli chicken , chilli shrimp , any of the manchurian dishes and fried rice , pakoras , wings , fried banana dessert and singapore noodles . * i would recommend dining in store rather than takeout only because the food is more fresh and you get large portions .	522
0	below average in most ways service quick food not fresh or quality - below average throughout wonton soup bad large room dimsum lunch may be slightly better than normal dinner items but i doubt its much better	0
1	i 've been a customer for over a decade and i love all the products , the cuts are always original and help me maintain my long look .	2156
1	this place was really good i got the waffles with strawberry and whip cream , scrambled eggs , sausage and kiwi drink . everything was so good no complaints . my husband got the waffles with chicken really good the strips were fresh and crispy taste really good . he got the strawberry lemonade drink bomb.com . overall really great food service was really good going back .	580
1	excellent pie . i had the sausage & peppers ; top notch . high quality toppings , chewy crust , super fast . my only disappointment was being charged $ 4.00 for a soda . pizza is reasonably priced . i 'd come back .	282
1	great hotel ! ! everyone was very helpful and friendly . i recommend this hotel in tempe az to anyone who wants a clean and safe hotel .	2283
1	wonderful place ! i ca n't wait to go back ! ! room was great , room service was awesome , view from the room was stunning .	2866
1	i like yogurt ! yoforia is cool . it 's in the epicenter . the best thing about it is the location . you can grab yogurt and sit inside or outside and people watch . it seems to be in the center of everything . the yogurt is also good . i had chocolate with more chocolate . you can never go wrong with that ! typical yogurt procedure . place yogurt on the scale and get charged more than you expected . the staff was nice . good seating . the place was clean , which was impressive for the amount of traffic they receive . i 'll be back .	1184
0	where do i begin , the woman who did my nails was less than delightful , terrible service , was made wait a half hour after the time i was scheduled , extremely rushed once i sat down and as a result my nails are all different shapes . to top it off , i was told my nails were completely dry and ready to go and they were n't , not even close . i 've been getting my nails done for at least 10 years now and i 've never had an experience so bad . the service was so terrible that i will be going to a different place first thing in the morning . i do not recommend this place to anyone !	655
0	two stars today , only because the do n't allow half-stars . i tried the new blt+a sandwich as part of a 'choose 2 ' combination . the salad portion of my combination was better than my expectations for this location , but the sandwich was , to put it mildly , a hot mess . imagine several strips of bacon stacked haphazardly on half of a thin slice of bread . add avocado , tomato , and lettuce . cover with a second half slice of bread and then squash the result . a nice idea for a sandwich but d- for the execution . never again	484
1	randomly landed here twice through yelp while on travel and enjoyed a quick nice meal ... a whole in the wall place that 's clean and offers good service . the afghan tikka on a snowy in calgary night was too good and so was the wednesday special haleem . i am coming back here for sure . give them a try !	1303
1	highly highly recommend ! first class everything . great , charming chic city hotel conveniently located to everywhere you want to be in the heart of the city . the event staff is superb , the spaces they 've created around the hotel for meetings , relaxing , dining are superb . i always look forward to coming back and bringing my friends from out of town , even just for drinks . just what our city needs ! : )	3859
1	i lived year for a few years a while back . i lived in the caseiana model with a garage . i absolutely loved the open floor plan . anytime we had a maintenance issue ( not often ) they were there right away . after our lease is up at veer towers we are actually thinking of moving back here . the pool is beautiful too . overall a great experience here !	2832
1	justin , the pharmacy manager , is far out . very dude , man . he gets it . there 's a lof of ins , a lot of outs , a lot of what-have-yous in the pharmacy business , but he abides . he helps out the little guy , those in need of a coupon or savings for their special medications . a worthy face of the walgreen empire .	1641
0	not sure about this place , the autotrader website listed them as a place to sell cars the used car dealer was a jerk , pulled a carfax and said there was a odometer issue when i asked to see it he just walked away , got home reviewed the report and it said right next to the entry clerical error , it was corrected ... . lots of cars on the lot no customers ... if you do n't have the money to buy the car just say so	855
0	awful . dr. brown was very cold and impersonal . she had a complete stranger ( another doctor i had never even seen ) that i was going to miscarry . the worst experience in my entire life .	2643
1	i am a new patient that just finished my wellness exam with dr wolfson . dr wolfson is a soft spoken caring doctor that you would keep as your doctor for years to come , and i would recommend him to everyone.his office staff is very courteous and professional .	3321
1	the large selection of overweight adults and chubby children as customers tells you how good the gelato is . excellent selection of flavors . service is super slow though .	164
0	its probably best to find another gym . some staff members are using drugs while handling the kids and the owners kids are just free do do whatever . there is a blind eye to the truth masked with more ideas and projects to the gym . consumer beware ! there is a lot of stuff going on and its best to find a gym that is up to par and not cutting corners.. many people like the gym but you guys are just all over the place . its not safe there and unprofessional . this gym could be great , just the wrong people are running it unfortunately . if your a laid back parent then go for it but keep a close eye .	2750
0	went to dine in with my wife on 8/30/17 . we told the cashier we will take a seat so that we can look at the menu and decide the items to order . my husband went to the counter to place the order . they told us they will come to our table to take the order . when they came to take the order they said sorry this table is reserved for someone . they wasted our time and money . we took a uber to go to their restaurant . really disappointed with their service . if a seat is reserved put a reserved sign on the table , do n't waste people 's time and money ! !	1303
0	they canceled my son 's appointment 3 times and they made no attempt to give us any options to reschedule . the office seems to not care about its patients well being .	3598
0	i have been there twice . the first time i went at 5:30 and i thought it was great . the second time i went at 9 and it was the worst of pittsburgh . the hours of operation say it is open until 10 . they had stopped reloading food by 8:30 and the sushi was actually dry and turning colors by 9 . they had broken down most of the food by 9:30 and the help was eating half of the food in order to get them out early before the buffet was closed . most items were out by 9:30 . i wanted my money back and it was disgusting . i have never seen such horrible planning .	165
1	this is one of those hidden gems that delivers amazingly delicious food , attentive service and a great wine selection . every dish from appetizers to main course to dessert was beautifully prepared . we had the best time in this relaxed bistro environment .	1160
1	this is my favorite museum . i remember going on field trips in grade 5 and loving this place and now , at 25 , i still get joy out of my visits there . there is so much to do there you could spend an entire day just looking at the exhibits . i would strongly recommend the science centre to any parents looking to educate their children in a fun way who have a bit of money to spend . the science centre can be pricey after admission prices , souvenirs and food .	2868
1	hands down the best pizza i 've had in vegas . they use fresh natural ingredients . sls is also a great location . prices are really good on the pies but they catch up on the beverages .	282
1	a truly custom experience . they installed a lift kit on my 06 4runner and did an outstanding job . had a couple hick ups with my vehicle being a little older , but they figured it out no problem . will go back for future upgrades and mod 's .	203
1	this is a relatively good ross location . they have an organized system with the line that they seem to have perfected , unlike many other ross locations . the store is typically well stocked and the employees are friendly .	10
0	if you are into people watching this is n't a bad place . well if by people i mean old ugly degenerates , it 's like a welfare convention meets a senior convention . no food , yes you can bring in food but screw it . the clientele is trash and you are too if you go here more than twice . the people really are what make this place a huge waste of space . otherwise it 'd be an okay bar . i just really ca n't stand how trashy and welfare the people are . i 'm sure there 's been more than one heroin overdose in the bathroom here .	2894
1	they seems to have store coupons every other week or something . go to their web site and print coupon $ 5 off when you spend $ 25.00 . also their eggs are cheap most the time . which are great because i 'm always baking/making things & need to buy 12 dozens or more . hehee they also have yoohoo 3pk for $ 1.00 which is pricey but it 's so hard to find it on the west coast so it 's ok i guess .	2154
1	just one visit turned me from a browser to a buyer . i could have stayed there a good while playing around with their wonderful selection of colors . got to try one of their blushes , which i ended up getting along with a lip paint and eyelashes . very impressed with oscar 's service with helping my friend find a red lipstick . so glad that they have a location here in the bay area .	3316
0	had a microdermabrasion and the student was 20 minutes late into the procedure , therefore i did not get the full treatment i paid for . arrived on time and this is the second scheduling appointment that they blamed on their computer error .	1701
0	i hired for some office furniture projects , they came , took cash , said they could help with future projects and never responded . no receipt , nothing , then i find out they broke the cubicle they were supposed to partially dissemble ... . broke it to the point the entire cubicle system no longer has electricity which costs thousands of dollars ! ! ! worst mistake ever was hiring this 'company ' for a simple job	917
0	worst care ever ! 1 . front office / scheduling is severely understaffed . insanely long hold times , available appointments are too far in the future ( no such thing as immediate care ) . 2 . follow up is ridiculous . doctors work in slow motion and results take far too long . i would never , ever recommend this place to anyone . complain to your insurance to find abetted alternative .	2176
0	air hoses to dry vehicles have had the pressure significantly reduced in the past week or so . so much that it takes 3 times as long to spray the water off . please put the air hose pressure back to where it was before . is it really saving money reducing that pressure ? towels have been running out often in the afternoons . is someone not manning the washing of the towels , or is there a sudden shortage of them ? please be sure to have the top roller brush resume after setting it to not go on during a particular vehicle . it is nice to get what one pays for . thanks .	2939
0	i ordered the omg salad with gyro meat and a drink my bill was $ 15 plus change . after i was done they asked me if i liked it i said no and i could only find two olives in my salad he told me they put two olives on the large salad and one olive on the small salad . the gyro meat was dry and too much dressing on salad i did not eat most of it . i would have expected more for that price . this is not a sit down restaurant you go to counter to order . the man told me i should have gotten the ceaser salad it is good .	875
1	the food here was really tasty - i had the shrimp and crab tortellini . however , the service was super slow .	423
0	i think this place has closed . no cars there for the last few days and their phone number does n't seem to work anymore .	1330
0	i have to workout about an hour before closing to avoid the night club social scene . this gym is slowly turning into a place to socialize and pick-up , using the weight machines as chairs to chat and text . they seriously need to build a lounge for these people and let the people that take their training seriously do their thing . front desk employees do n't greet anymore . i 'm only giving 2 stars for the personal training area that is the only place in the gym that is n't over crowded or has people sitting around . looking forward to the new mountain side fitness in queen creek to come .	3912
1	no doubt the best thai food i have had in charlotte . the staff is super friendly and the service is great .	50
0	this place has gone right down hill . you wait up to 15 mins to be served by disinterested bar staff who rarely bother to return to your table . i would not recommend sharkes now	3397
0	what can i say ? worst service ever . waited over an hr and a half for service , the guy in the front was very rude when we asked for an update , and then food took another hour , food tasted good but the overall evening left a sour taste in my mouth . never coming back .	440
0	hey jill , that 's awesome that your sales person notated that they called me but they did not in fact call . so is your point here to convince myself or someone else reading this review that we should be your customers by calling me a liar ?	2210
0	they deceive you & lie to you to make the `` sale . '' mike stated that one of my certificates expired and in order for me to make it active again i needed to put a deposit of $ 200 . what he did n't tell me was that he was really trying to make a sale . i 've been conned twice from them . last year and just recently . do n't do it or you 'll make the biggest mistake of your life . my mistakes is your gain and i hope you take my advice . i 'm fighting the battle to get my money back .	1777
1	i love his theater ! so comfy . they have reclining electric seats and they serve alcohol ! it 's not a full bar but good enough .	564
1	about once a week me and some friends order to go from here ! they always have the pj 's famous hamburger & fries and i usually have a grill cheese & creamy tomato soup ! such a fabulous idea , for them to deliver in forum shops and caesars palace ! if you 're in town , stop by , if you 're a local , this is the place to be for your treats ! also their happy hour with $ 1 oysters is the best in town ! enjoy !	1538
0	stopped by after work to buy my brother a bottle of rum for his birthday . should have been a fairly uneventful transaction except when i pulled out my credit card to pay was asked if i had cash or could pay debit . i did n't have enough cash on me and do n't own a debit card . now instead of being able to checked out i had to listen to a lecture about how minotti 's was losing money if they accepted my credit card and blah , blah , blah . then put a sign in the window that says no credit card purchases but do n't waste my time because you are clueless how to run a business .	256
0	not coming back again for sure ! it felt like we redeemed a free massage coupon with the service we received tonight unlike before ... my masseur basically rub my body , using his phone and coughing , and talking to the other masseur laughing and the other guy keeps on burping ! ! what a shame for your regular client . i used to love this place . maybe they are under a new management ? ? ? ?	735
1	great place w/great people you get exactly what you expect fabulous service . no complaints over here	2198
0	shame the service and experience has declined . i would not recommend . long wait plus unfriendly staff .	2405
0	really nice sushi . the take out was confusing ... for me and for the people there ... .	1049
0	update to respond to comment - i visited cleveland with family . the booking was not under my name . i stand by my previous review .	1165
1	i love this store . the employees are friendly and very helpful on finding me clothes that fit and make me look good . i went in wanting to buy just pjs and walked out spending over $ 100 . that 's good salesmanship if you ask me : ) i wish it was closer to my house be definitely worth the drive .	47
0	i really like road runner ; but not this location . no one would even talk to me . i went in with the intention to buy a new set of custom insoles and two pair of sneakers . but i waited around , tried to get some assistance , and nothing . the only person to acknowledge my presence was another customer . i do n't plan to ever visit this particular store again .	2557
1	as a country girl , i often find myself missing the small town feel within the concrete city we live in . so it 's always refreshing when i come across a store such as the drake general store . with a little taste of the way back machine , a splash of simplicity and dash of country ra ra , this store oozes the christmas season . i am so happy this is a part of my new neighbourhood as i am sure there will be many a gifts bought at this gem .	1378
1	love the variety on tap here & food is good bar grub . if at the bar there are enough tvs to catch most sports going on any given night or weekend	211
1	nice to go to a freightliner that has integrity as well as a need to get your problem solved asap and a sense of urgency that i have n't seen anywhere else ! ! # thanks for getting us back on the road quickly . .brad barbee and candice sawyers	3914
0	great broth on pho , shrimp rolls are good but sauce was bland . i also ordered the egg rolls but when i took a bite i found a white string inside and lost my appetite . this place used to be my favorite , the owners are wonderful and nice . i remember when they first opened i come often and service was outstanding .	673
1	just drove from norfolk , va and needed a oil change and tire rotation badly . george was able to get it finished quickly and was very professional . definitely recommend in coming here .	3488
1	yesterday , while having a girls day with my homie , i treated her to a starbucks ! the service was with a smile and all the staff was very personable ! my sweet black tea was one of the best i 've ever had and my homie said her drink was delicious ! way to go starbucks !	266
1	this place has been really good so far . they do n't charge an arm and a leg like some places . they do not take credit cards but for the price i 'll deal with that . so far no complaints with their cleaning . the clothes are nice and pressed and so far no broken buttons . they are not a `` drop off by 9 get by 5 '' so you do have to wait until the next day . not a problem since they are right on the way to work .	3944
0	this fry 's is ghetto , it 's dirty , the produce is sometimes moldy , the meat has made my family sick twice and the milk storage cooler always smells rank . i 've returned cheese a few times due to mold , it 's called rotating stock people ! ! the employees smoke in front of the store which is disgusting and they really need to train their baggers ! ! kroger has definitely gone down hill in arizona ! ! i have switched to sprout 's , much cleaner and always friendly staff and prices are better !	3935
0	it 's a hit or miss with the nail techs here . they were not busy but the tech who did my manicure rushed . also , i did n't see them clean the foot soak well .	786
0	my manager ordered food from here the other day and it smelled amazing she had these giant egg rolls . i decided i had to try this place out . i ordered the two giant pork egg rolls which was about $ 6 after tax was extremely disappointed . there was literally no pork in the whole entire world i think at the very end there was a tiny little piece . it should be called the vegetable a girl because there 's no meat .	474
1	beautiful place . unbelievable quality ! amazing service ! thanks so much ! keep up the good work .	720
1	this place is a clean and friendly locations . they always greet you nicely and if you are a return customer they usually know you by name ! the technicians there do a great job with my brisa-gel nails ( $ 35+tip for refills ) . the service is usually thorough ! i would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a place on the danforth that is a cut above the rest in the area . the only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is because when it gets super busy , they can get into robot-mode and the service goes down a tad . this only happens during super busy times though like long weekends or christmas .	3247
0	have had nothing but delays getting granite countertop from here . keep pushing install date back . when purchased from home depot was told it would be installed in 3-4 weeks . now install date is set at 9 weeks from purchase date . so sorry i dealt with them .	743
0	update , and a warning to you . repeat visit 1 : a nickel in the nachos , not a dime , a fucking nickel ... .last i check this is a major health violation . repeat visit 2 : egg shells in my chorizo burrito . on a positive note : i did n't see any insect diners on my table . but i did n't look underneath it in fear of seeing a swarm . remember that movie candyman..remember the bee 's in the toilet ... yea that gives you a mental picture . this place must have some serious pull to not have been shut down by now .	1346
1	upscale from the usual diner breakfast , this was solidly delicious with great service and great food . after reading the reviews and the tips , i chose the pancakes , which came with bacon and an egg . bonus points for being able to poach it and as well for the bacon being cooked just the way i like it - not burned and crispy but cooked through . and the pancakes ? excellent . thick and fluffy and tasty . coffee was good . served with a carafe so i would n't have to wait for a waitress to notice my empty cup . why do n't more places do it this way ?	364
0	we were the only people in the entire place . service was okay , i 'm pretty sure he was the owner . the food was decent , but the hookah was overpriced . the decor was unusual and everything could have used a good cleaning and a coat of paint . i wo n't be back to kabob house .	19
0	the food was delicious but the service was so bad to the point of i would n't want to go back . to busy talking to the staff at the bars and not helping he was super helpful with the other tables but ignored us 80 % of the time .	1046
1	just had a great massage there . i work with large animals so my back and legs where achy but now they feel great .	1785
0	atmosphere : quite crowded for lunch , a place to grab quick food food : 1 . cheese spaghetti bolognese : 2/5 , nothing special , sauce was n't that flavourful 2 . hai nam chicken : 2/5 , the rice was a bit too moisted , chicken had lots of fat price : 6.00-8.00 for lunch special , included soup and a drink overall : nothing really stood out , prices were cheap , burned myself a few times with the hot spaghetti plate	1037
1	we hoped in for a bottle of wine before dinner across the street , a very knowledgeable gentlemen from behind the counter helped is selected a bottle . it paired well with dinner and we came back for desert and coffee after dinner . the staff is knowledgeable and friendly . we will be back !	1160
0	went there to order a takeout family pack of wings at a cost of $ 60+ . the wings were good but the order did not have the toast , french fries or dips that were supposed to be included . it was irritating not to received everything i paid for , and even though we got along without the missing items i still feel like i was cheated . the order was a lot of money and they had some responsibility to make sure it was complete .	1397
0	honestly i called 4 times this week have n't gotten a call back . they seen me once and no follow up . i 've requested several appts on the stupid portal and still nothing . i 've ran out of my prescription that i was reluctant to try i the first place ! now i am 5 days without a refill . do you guys realize how dangerous it is to stop taking medicine cold turkey . i 'm honestly so disappointed i thought you guys were doctors to help and care . so crazy because i seen all the bad reviews i should 've known . hopefully i can find a new place .	1541
0	rude staff . did n't ask which side i wanted with my wrap and had i not asked i would have gotten nothing . she told me the options were only chips or a cookie and that was all . come to find out that was a lie .	3225
0	microwaved , sub-par , food , impatient bowling lane ( the pin machine thing would drop prematurely if you took slightly too long ) , the lane itself seamed to be uneven , as the bowling balls would pile up in the gutters and turn right unexpectedly , incompetent and impatient waiters , rude service , undercooked food , and overpriced . their one redeeming quality is that one of the waitresses was very polite , kind , and funny . would still not recommend .	3296
0	i felt that this place was way overpriced for the service they gave me ( just curled my hair ) . while it was cheaper than other hotels , it was still expensive . the stylist was nice , but seemed not super experienced and my hair was just ok - something i probably could have done . the guy when i checked out asked me if i even had my hair done yet . ouch .	3300
0	this is a typical hong kong style eatery with so so service . food is ok , price is right . i do n't like the noisy environment because the laminate walls that bounce noise badly . the waitresses are always setting table with clinging utensils that make the place like dai pai dong ! very very noisy !	1173
1	last week i ordered a sectional from a very nice salesperson ( julian ) while visiting ashley . the very next day i was looking online and saw that there was a big round chair that matched the sectional . i called julian and ordered the matching chair but it was too late to get it on the same delivery truck . julian had it delivered to the warehouse and picked it up and brought it to me himself . come to find out it was his day off . talk about going above and beyond ... ... thank you julian and ashley for having such a great team .	1794
1	nothing but delicious grilled steak and chicken here ! their pinto beans have a kick of jalapeño and are n't just plain beans like most places . the owner is always very welcoming and friendly the 2 times we have come . definitely need to be coming here more regularly ! !	1581
1	the pharmacy at this location is the best ! they are always helpful even/especially when my insurance company is being difficult . they are patient and kind . they always remember me . the manager is fabulous and it shows through in the rest of the team . even if i moved to the other side of town i would make a trek to continue using this pharmacy .	1223
1	growing up back east i thought that i had given up on being able to find rita 's once i headed west . lucky for me , rita 's franchise has reached the valley . stop in for an awesome taste of the east coast . they specialize in something called a gelati , a combination of frozen ice and custard , that is the perfect summer treat . they have multiple flavors , and will gladly let you sample any of them . my favorite is just simply their italian ice , but my kids love the gelati .	2162
1	went to have my passport photo taken . the whole process took 5 minutes : photo taken , paid and photo readied for $ 9.99+tx be sure to mention the coupon from their website to save $ 2 .	2753
1	this place is absolutely adorable inside , and the ice cream is so good ! i got a waffle cone with choc chip cookie dough , and it was great . my husband got a peanut butter brownie sundae type of thing and he said it was delicious . i highly recommend for a cute , quick ice cream stop !	703
1	palms theatre is the place to go for a wonderful variety of entertainment . concerts , musicals , comedy and even childrens shows . you 'll find it 's more special than a movie and comes with memories for a lifetime . staff and performers are fantastic .	2898
1	favorite smoke shop in vegas . it stays open till 12 and had the biggest variety when it comes to shisha and hookahs ! the men who work here know everything there is to know about hookah . i would recommend this shop to anyone !	2568
0	i think the portion sizes are tiny for whay you pay . other than that the treats are decent .	1125
1	classic irish pub ! happy they have magners cider ! we had the wings as a snack and they were pretty good . staff was nice and attentive and the patio was perfect !	1679
0	worst las vegas show i 've ever seen . started 1/2 hour late and it was soooo boaring . we all could hardly keep our eyes open . stay home with your twins . they might appreciate your talent .	1771
1	these guys are great ! stopped by after work as they were closing and they still made time to give me an oil change . they all were extremely friendly and helpful . i 'll be back in a few thousand miles !	3092
0	had my laminate floor installed by amateurs ! it took them 8 days . and now that i have moved the furniture , i see gaps between the floor and the baseboard . this will be the second time the field sup will come out and make repairs . the first was shortly after the install . now it 's 4 months later . good thing this install thru home depot is guaranteed for a year . find an installer who has experience .	1379
1	it was the best ice-cream . my daughter loved it as well . we will be back soon . do n't forget to order macha coco together with your ice-cream . it was perfect match .	3051
0	not sure what everyone raves about , service was terrible , and the crowd was thin . i did n't eat , so i ca n't tell you about the food , i was going to eat , but based on how long it took to get a drink i went to mac 's to eat and you should too .	1179
0	lazy , ignorant staff . tried paying with visa gift card and was told we could n't because the owner & corp wo n't let them take it . no where is it noted they do n't take valid forms of payment . now the girls can get their tip from their idiot boss or from the corporate office they work for . ignorance breeds ignorance . at least get a decent 'talk off ' if this `` happens all the time '' .	704
0	the worst pie and customer service ever . 1 star cause i ca n't go any lower . this place closes at 10pm . arrived at 9:41pm for a take out . the hispanic looking cook not only gave me a nasty look for coming in late but made the worst pizza ever , not worth the $ 27 charged . called the restaurant the following day and explained to the manager about my experience , but he also could n't care less about it , being sarcastic and rude , just asking me what i 'd want from him . overpriced with mediocre food and giant ego joint . never ... ever .	1116
1	i use mac a lot because i just love their products . this store is a little small as the other reviews state but they had everything i needed . the girl who helped me was great and looked up all my products from another store and i was out in less then 10 minutes on a busy saturday night . great experience , i will definitely go back for to that location for my products .	2409
0	i would not risk my 121 career coming here . very unfriendly and instead of making sure a pilot keeps flying , i got the impression she was trying to ground me . i was berated for having a cup of coffee in the morning , 2 hours before my physical . it was an overall uncomfortable experience . you caught me . i like to review ame 's ive never been to for fun on my days off . i stand corrected as well . from your braggadocios response , i now know you are the greatest .	3888
1	always hot fresh bagels , iced chai tea was the bomb ! friendly , fast , always feel welcome by the smiley staff .	477
1	hidden gem , upscale nail boutique with friendly professionals . corie did an awesome job on my mani/pedi !	1370
0	went to get hot dogs for dinner . service was fast . got 3 dogs and large frys . thing i can say is the `` hot dog '' itself could of been alot hotter , especially due to the fact they are in a `` warmer '' type compartment.. maybe we will try them another time . there 's not many hot dog places here in vegas ! business idea	1566
0	beautiful place , however the food very disappointing . the salad was not crisp . felt like it was expired . the beauty of the restaurant does not hold the same standards for the food . unfortunately	1204
1	i found my new favorite nail salon . everything you can ask for for a great experience is here . modern equipment , great ambience , and great detailed work . the massage chairs are heavenly . very satisfied customer ! will be returning .	1834
1	i live in the area and find only a hadnful of restarants in the area have both great food and resonable priced . the service was excellent as well ! i very much enjoyed torched marakel , buffalo tofu and a fresh slaw . the place was packed on a saturday and had a quick turn over at the bar . cocktails were excellent ( $ 14 ) so switched to soju afterwards . great for dinner but also perfect for a quick snack and drink before heading out for the evening . i 'll be back often .	688
1	you could make a whole day out of this which is awesome . beautiful gardens and i almost died when i got to the chinese garden . when i walked through the wall i thought i had instantly had been transported to china . keep note they have different things going on in the teahouse so maybe plan your visit around an event as i missed one i would 've enjoyed . we sat down in the teahouse and was shown how to do tea and had cookies with it for $ 10 and well worth it . japanese garden had a house full of kimono and impressive bonsai as well as many friendly koi in the pond . loved every second here	183
0	this starbucks is the most convent to go to on my way to work but wo n't be back . staff does n't know how to make drinks . 3 separate mornings i have gotten a carmel macchiato and paid for an extra shot and not gotten it . this morning my drink came with whip cream . when i mentioned it was strange the girl said that 's how they make them there . so many better locations do n't go here !	2358
1	really nice . accommodations are great . spa is nice but very small and limited ( think offices converted into treatment rooms ) . pool is nice . we pretty much really liked everything . my only complaint , and they know it , is they could be less aggressive when knocking on the door . one doorbell ring is more than enough !	2883
1	wow ! my order was ready before i got the money out of my wallet ! super fast ! ! ! the sandwich was pretty good , i like the shredded lettuce , somehow in my mind it makes the sandwich taste better , but that 's just my way of thinking whether it 's true or not . the place was clean and the restroom was clean too . good prices . i would return again if i needed a super fast food , quicker than mcd 's .	1475
1	a group of 6 of us treated to this hidden gem by one of my chinese associates who lives in this area . what a treat ! had the crispy duck ( christmas story , `` he 's looking at me '' ... lobster and lettuce wraps . truly authentic chinese cuisine ! i will be back ! ps : it is much larger and nicer than appears from outside .	338
1	amazing ! i do n't know what those haters were watching..but this show was sooo impressive .	2968
1	doctor cool was sent by our home warranty company , american home shield . they came out promptly the same day and identified our ac problem . the 2 techs , whose names i do n't recall , were professional and knowledgable . they even assisted with cutting off the ac locks and cages that the previous owner left on both ac units . i could n't ask for more from an ac company . i highly recommend them for their professionalism and customer service .	2776
0	worst experience . this guy left water marks all over the grill and paint . when i told him if he could take care of it he went to get the windex and sprayed it on the roof and on the paint . smh	3878
1	it 's kinda like a sushi version of chipotle but with better `` burrito '' wrapping skills . the fish is fresh and does n't taste fishy . would definitely eat here again .	470
0	i really wanted to love this place . there are so many great healthy options . unfortunately , there is no seasoning on any of the food . the burger my friend got was rare and the both of our fries were burnt , dry , and lacking salt . i hope they make some improvements .	1269
1	needed a tire replaced late on sunday ( today ) . was impressed with the team 's customer service enough to post this review . what stood out to me is that the team looked like they really enjoyed their work and working together . i always appreciate good customer service when i come across it .	2263
1	cafe rio has been a favorite spot of mine for a long while now . it 's a step above chipotle in my book and they have daily specials ( not sure about the weekends ) that are all pretty good and not as expensive as other items on the menu . the only downfall with this place is that if you 're not careful when you 're ordering you can end up dropping around 13 dollars for lunch . so yeah , do n't go overboard ordering sides and whatnot , the portions are all pretty damn big .	1365
0	ordered a salad for carry out and got the scraps from the salad bowl . nothing but stems and huge chunks of lettuce not as good as if i would of ordered it for dine in .	1519
0	everything about it is really `` small town '' - divey , dirty , interesting wait staff , cheap beer , and a very mixed crowd ... make sure you drink enough and bring your own party , and sing !	3164
0	the absolute nicest people , but short handed and disorganized . my last appointment , it was almost an hour before i got in . when i finally did , i had one person do the fill and another paint the nails . i heard them talking about how they opened and no techs showed up . the people that were there were so nice and apologized profusely , but i just do n't have two hours to sit in a nail salon .	1316
1	these guys constantly never disappoint the other two vapers and i go here all the time the gentlemen there always remember us when we go and are great about treating us like people and not like money walking in the door . though they dont do house juice tease guys are good about flavor choice and help with mod builds i have bought a lot of stuff from them i just bought two new tanks from them and they were the best suggestions based off pure description i this is my favorite place just based on the guys there	2568
1	definitely a hidden gem in the kammz area . i tried this place out when it first opened and was n't a huge fan , however i did give it a second chance and boy am i glad i did ! the decor is very modern and i really like the pictures of west park all over the walls- it feels like home . their sunday brunch and bloody mary bar was very refreshing . steak and eggs delicious as were the potato pancakes ! i ca n't wait to come back	1253
1	warner family practice is the best doctors office i have been to in over eight years . i was with another practice in ahwatukee which was terrible , long waits , bad management of diabetes and other chronic diseases . the doctors , nurses and front individuals are professional and awesome ! !	3349
0	the last two times i 've been to this cupcake shop my ooey gooey cupcakes have been a disappointment . both times , today and two weeks ago they were super dried out . i asked the guy behind the counter if they were fresh and he said yes . there is no way the one i had today was fresh ! it was at least a day old . at least . i used to come here all the time but now i 'm going to try another place . i really loved their cupcakes , too bad .	1125
0	i placed an order online . pick up in 10 to 20 minutes . 12 minutes later i arrive . 18 minutes later the owner comes walking up with two bags of ice . she asked if i placed an order online . i said yes . she just got the order . the place is still locked up . do i want to pick it up ? it has not been started . that was 18 minutes into a 10-20 minute order . no thanks .	1133
0	my stylist was chris.. i ask for longer at the front and shorter at the back.. what i got was same length hair front and back.. i also ask for bangs which also turn out terrible.. this guy did such a horrible job ! ! the back of my head , my hair is sticking out when i tie it up.. i will never come back again ! ! please everyone beware of this chris guy	3610
1	this is my favourite dive in the greater toronto area . hands down . great location . big patio . super cheap beer . cheap food . great service . what you see is what you get . i see reviews here criticizing the quality of the patio furniture . i see reviews complaining about the quality of the vietnamese beef noodle soup . seriously ? what did you expect ? java house is a place where you can get piss-drunk on a nice summer day without making a dent in your wallet . a horror movie is n't supposed to have good lighting .	2718
1	stayed here for several nights . picked la quinta because they truly are pet friendly . no extra charges . no hassles . and lots of poop bag dispensers .	1244
0	we went to the house of blues for dinner on june 12 . the the cobb salads we ordered were small , unflavorful , and expensive . management suggested we split their largest burger , a juicy lucy , to satisfy our appetite . we left the restaurant having paid nearly $ 50 for two side-sized , drab salads , and a near slider-sized double burger . we wo n't be eating at house of blues again .	1129
1	i loved my experience today ! thank you especially to kaylin for taking the time to answer my questions and give me honest feedback . she 's friendly , knowledgeable and enjoys fashion . you can even enlist her help if you want a makeover ( ahem , i do ! ) . she enjoys what she does , so if you do n't like to shop or if you need help ask for her . i certainly will return .	1446
1	josh helped me so much when i was rear-ended unexpectedly . he gave me frequent updates , corresponded with the rental company and the insurance company . he made this a much less stressful situation for me and i greatly appreciate it ! this is a great , reliable place . my car looks like nothing happened to it !	1926
0	unclean facility , poor management and awful customer service . many cardio machines are broken , several for years ! ! ! there are many other gyms in the madison area that actually care about their members . stay away ! ! !	3262
1	first time and and last time . i 'm a punk ! ! ! 22 and a 9 mag . my kind of date . the noise was a lot but my big ears got used to it ! ! ! thank god	3936
1	air conditioneer was a little loud . otherwise you ca n't beat this place . free happy hour . free buffet breakfast . free shuttle to the strip . a hidden gem .	3253
0	i have been experimenting with different yogurt shops around the valley , and came across this location . excited by the photographs and graphics of the website we decided to give it a try . unfortunately , the experience was n't as we had hoped . the exterior was filthy , half eaten yogurt containers on the ground , stains on the sidewalks , overflowing trashcans and dirty patio tables . the yogurt was unimpressive ... flavors were bland , ingredients scarce and some of the fruit mushy . crew member seemed uninterested in our business and bored . better luck next time !	885
0	this place is scary ! there 's a guy here doing his laundry and who 's been going crazy at everyone ( screaming , provoking fights , cussing , etc . ) and not one staff member has stepped up to kick him out . my first -- - and definitely last time coming here .	2722
0	thay . needy . to change the oil everything tasting bad i wish i could give a . 1/4 star . i do not think i will go back	144
1	its clean its fast its good food that wont break the bank : )	549
1	i 've only been here a couple of times with some friends . it 's pretty convenient along with the three other theaters within less of a mile . but i like it because it 's next to the tgif . it does feel kinda deserted . i feel like i hardly see the people that work here . other than that the movies are good and the seats are coo too .	2000
0	their website states the following , `` we offer both a child psychiatrist and adult psychiatrist , specializing in all aspects of the spectrum of psychiatry , including treating bipolar disorder and depression . '' however , they have no psychiatrist on staff . they have a psychiatric nurse practitioner that `` sees children as well '' according the lady that answered the phone . the worst part is that they did n't even tell me before asking me to make the appointment . i had to dig in order to find out who i was seeing .	2629
1	the kids love this place . mmini golf , a climbing slide play area , mechanical animal rides , video games and laser tag ... ..ick , we found a scorpion in the laser tag area ... .all else was great . i reccomend more for little kids , 3-8ish . my 10 year old got a little bored .	3791
1	i came here with family and we ordered many dishes . my favorite were the cheung fun rolls , peking duck wraps with foie gras , string beans , bang bang chicken wraps and mango almond pudding for dessert . i also tried three of their cocktails- manhattan , mojito and yuzu martini . my cousin had their sangria and looked pretty good with different types of fruits inside . great atmosphere and the kitchen bar seating looked like a cool spot if you come by yourself or with another person . the ambiance was upscale and cute . i believe susur lee 's wife designed the layout of the restaurant and definitely fitting with his twist on traditional chinese food .	1441
1	i can not say enough about dr deka and the staff at paradise valley ob . i switched over to their care a few years ago after a recommendation from a friend . this was the best decision i have made . they are so caring and make sure to go out of their way for your comfort . dr deka is so sweet and you feel like you are speaking with a close friend . thank you for providing my family with the best care .	1589
0	manager kelley pulled me out of a line that just opened because she said someone had been waiting longer . i was shocked . as i walked away to go to another cashier , she continued to talk to the other customer about getting in the line first . i questioned her about her odd choice of customer service and she played the `` i have no idea what you are talking about game . '' she was amused . i was not . kelly should get more customer service training . thankfully , the new cashier i went to was very kind and helpful . hopefully , the rest of the store does n't reflect the poor service displayed by kelly .	583
0	this used to be the best mexican food in town . the homemade chips were addicting . the staff in my office ordered delivery 3-4 days per week , every week for at least 6 months . we wo n't order again . they no longer include the homemade chips . now they serve stale cheap flavorless chips but charge the same price . we attempted to call the owner several times to ask about the change but nobody will answer the call .	1421
1	good chinese food fast & clean . =0 )	1342
1	definitely my new nail spot ! my friend angel recommended them to me , and now that i live in avondale i wanted to give them a try : ) i was very satisfied with the quality of their work , their nail polish selection , and the friendly service !	1829
1	really great place ! i love that they have many options for vegetarians . service is always really good too .	947
0	chili is cold dog food . vegetables are raw . waitress kept hiking her way too tight jeans up the whole time . overall garbage .	1491
0	i was excited to use an eyebrow voucher that was in my black friday $ 45 coupon book which i purchased . the spa and environment was wonderful unfortunately my waxer ended up burning my skin under my left eye . i attempted to contact the salon manager , allison and wasfinally able to speak to her about the incident . i felt she was defensive and tried to deflect blame of `` retin '' which i do n't use . she said she would talk to the waxer and get back to me ... hmmmm	2001
1	i 'm a montrealer and i always recommend this bar to visitors . it 's sure to please because of the location , terrace in the summer , and the two rooms ( house , and hip hop ) .	1282
0	the workers are rude never say thank you and slam the menus on the table . they also demand tips and will stare at you until you give it the food is still good for instance the egg i like it however they are in small portions so you will still be hungry sometimes there is hair in the food too which is not yummy ! ! the restaurant is clean and you can expect to spend around $ 10 here	1198
1	great coffee ( duh ) , and a very quick line . drag that you have to park and go in , but they are quick !	108
0	good food but the worst service ! i will never come back again . do not come ! we asked for napkins 3 times . they messed up our order everytime . the staff could care less .	408
0	we got pad thai as take out and it was like no pad that we have ever had ... and not in a good way . it was a mix tomato sauce and noddles and just very strange . i feel the menu should have at least explained how this was prepared since it is so different from any other pad thai . i called to see if we could return for a refund since we could n't tolerate more than one bite but we were not allowed . the menu should have photos or descriptions so you know what you are ordering .	594
1	a true church that preaches the bible as god 's word . i highly recommend .	3393
0	this review is not based on the show itself but on the fact that the box office manager would not permit us to purchase discounted student tickets despite having documented proof ( i.e . enrollment verification plus photo id ) . very disappointing and frustrating . spite kept us from purchasing tickets .	3022
0	if you want to repeat yourself five times and still get your ordered wrong , yes please by all means choose this location . i understand this job has to be really rough , but to get an attitude with your customers is probably not your best move .	844
0	as a loyal customer . i have to say that i will no longer be coming to this store . hannah ( blonde headed girl ) has a nasty nasty attitude . she rude and loud . if you purchase any animals here do you 're research and ask for marshall to help you ! he 's is by far the best and most knowledgeable ! stay away from the hannah 's !	1894
1	got a great cut and for 9 bucks , ca n't beat it !	33
0	awful . waited 40 minutes for a turkey club . expensive for the mediocre quality . everyone was polite , but there was no logic or system to their operation . orders would sit on the counter for several minutes while servers took more orders . if you have less than an hour for lunch , you 're going to be late . everyone around me waited about 20-30 minutes as well	820
0	i went to a yelp event here . maybe i am wrong , but i feel like for a yelp event a restaurant will bring its a game . apparently , savoy does n't feel the same . the bartenders were quick and friendly , but in the words of sarah s. `` well , it 's alcohol . '' drinks ... meh , nothing i would ever order again . food was actually pretty bad . : ( service took an hour to bring salads ... we actually got our food out of order . : ( luckily , yelp people are super fun and cool so it was n't a complete wash ...	714
1	i 've been donating for ten years , and this place is the best . friendly staff and clean environment .	1753
1	wow went the az state fair to hear weezer , and covered the whole perimeter of the fair before i found a shop that sold something that was n't deep fried -- i 'm pretty sure even the racing lemurs were wrapped in bacon . i found piggly 's and ordered the $ 12 bbq beef sandwich , which was awesome . about 3/4 lbs . of bbq beef with carmelized onions and cole slaw . so when you eat it a 2nd meal of beefy goodness escapes the toasted hogey bun onto the paper plate , and then you have to get a fork to finish it . i 'm definitely going to drive to the restaurant to check out their prime rib , etc .	144
0	this place was awful . i had a salmon roll and a tuna roll , which are pretty hard to mess up-and yet they did . the texture of the fish was horrible . you can tell that this restaurant 's chef has not been taught to cut fish properly . i also got a single piece of red snapper . i had to chew on this stringy piece of fish for several minutes . i ca n't believe people eat this . i also found a bone in my salmon . they truly do n't care about their work at all .	24
0	the wait and lines are terrible ! ! ! ! e v e r y s i n g l e time i come either the employees baggers or helpers stand around and pay zero attention to service ! ! !	2105
1	16 flavours and countless toppings . i 'm just happy this place is n't close to where i live or i would be 300 pounds . definitely worth the visit .	3729
0	i would have given 0 stars , if possible . this company is absolutely terrible . the service is extremely slow ( waited on line for 20 minutes ) and despite having a quote for $ 185 , the actual bill ended up being $ 450 ! there is 40 % tax apparently and they charged an extra day since we were 3 hours late on return , despite us telling them we 'd returning the car in the late afternoon . apparently 12 pm is the same as late afternoon . they basically screw you since you have no time to argue when you 're trying to catch a plane . will never use this company again . stay away ! !	3595
0	shitty ffin people i came to give my friend her i.d and they wo n't even let us in again	1966
1	i 've been to fs twice . martina was awesome . she gave me the haircut i showed her in a picture and gave me several hair tips . the staff was very courteous and attentive with all questions that i had .	3210
1	stopped by here for lunch on our way to a baseball tourney . the staff was very friendly and the location was super clean . sandwiches were made to order and were done promptly-even before we could sit down . portions were large ! i would highly recommend this place !	1475
1	i have eaten here for years and never had a bad roll . i love the screamin o its my favorite .	408
1	surprised at anger directed at the airline . my experience was smooth . nice staff , attentive to your needs and no grief at the gate . it is a bit annoying to have to pay for everything including water but i knew that before booking . will book with them again .	3127
0	after 2 months the pool deck drains are popping up and the deck surface itself scratches , mars and scuffs down to the white texture material very easily from normal use . i was able to get some touch up paint to do touch up and it 's slightly lighter then the original color so it does n't match . when i asked the work supervisor he said it would take 45 days to cure , it '' s now 2 months and no change . it is nothing like my old decking surface which was basically scratch and scuff resistant . if i were to do this over i would not use or recommend cdc pools .	659
0	very poor service , even though the restaurant was not busy . waited long stretched for our server , who did n't clear the plates on our table or come back for checks . it was the world cup , in a mexican restaurant with mexico playing and they kept turning the sound off the tv 's . mariachi was fun . food was meh and took a very long time . split our checks incorrectly and took a half hour to do so . mostly frustrated with the service .	190
1	best everything bagel ! ! just stopped in and ... wow they were great . good service and great bagels .	995
0	capital one is the absolute worst bank in the country . i called hundreds of times trying to get help with a dispute . agents do n't answer calls or ever return voicemail messages . they will transfer you all over the world . unbelievably they say they are mailing info-then faxing nothing ! stay away from this horrible company ! it 's impossible to get help and they never call when they say they will . it 's sickening . avoid this company !	3236
0	hm not quite sure if i went on a bad day..but my chicken was soooooo salty and therefore the poutine i ordered was salty as well because they put the same chicken on top . i couldnt finish it . the only thing i would give 5 stars to is their egg custard pies..they were delicious ! i went back later that day just for another .	1109
0	an extra large pizza was so small it barely fed my wife and i . also the pizza was bad .	425
0	had my son in classes here and they changed instructors with 0 notice i bought a bow from them that they recommended spent a few hundred bucks on it for my sons birthday they sold me a defective bow and when my son told me due to the fact that i know nothing about bows i tried to return it they wo n't help me out at all very bad company to work with the instructor is nice i must add	471
1	just purchased my puppy today . i had a great experience . will update my post later after my vet check up .	1894
0	i have been to this facility twice and i have n't had a good experience either time ... i scheduled a pedicure and they ran 30 minutes late so i decided to leave . it is not a very relaxing environment either . i tried them out again for an eyebrow wax and i told the lady not to trim or do the top of the eyebrow and she did both of these after clearly stating i did not want them done twice ... i will not be going back	2710
1	soooo delicious ! with all the burger joints in town , this one is in my top three favorites now ! we ate spicy burger and dog , the burger was juicy and flavorful , the dog spicy and different . it is worth the 30 minute trip for us to get there . a cute little place with games , great service and is clean .	964
1	a trendy happening spot with an art-deco décor . i frequented this new restaurant for happy hour and was very impressed with the service and menu ... caters to a more upscale 35+crowd , which i was cool with . i will be back to patronize this new business ! definitely worth a visit .	1331
0	antoine , antoine , antoine ... im happy that this place has gotten the face lift it needed in some theater rooms but this `` boy '' is a fool . worst `` manager '' i have ever dealt with and he is lucky his staff is nice because otherwise his theater would suffer . i mean that this business would suffer if they would replicate employees like skinny little antoine and had them work here . isnt it supposed to be the opposite and the manager should be an example of what u want from the team ? i am open to a more detailed discussion with upper management if u message me i will provide details and #	611
1	one friend had the gnochi in rose sauce . perfectly cooked , the gnocchi was soft to the bite that resisted once you got toward the middle , like biting the fat little toes of your favourite toddler . this dish is simple and delicious ; pillowy soft nuggets bathed in a rich tomato sauce of cream , butter and parmesan , the generous portion dares you to finish it in one go .	620
1	this place is awesome and clean . staff is real friendly . you can watch nfl while bowling . games are inexpensive . they got a sunday night special $ 14 a night .	3296
0	i ordered online through eat24 and never received my food . i called them and asked where it was and she said she would call the driver . i hear nothing for 30 minuets and then she calls me back and tells me the drivers phone died and could n't finish my delivery . she asked if i wanted them to re make my food and have it delivered like i have all the time in the world . very frustrating ! i did n't end up having time to eat before work .	459
1	best latte this seattle-ite has had in madison !	1807
0	great products & produce , outrageous prices . my local grocer sells honey crisp apples for 2.99/lb . this place - 5.99 . i 'd bet they were both from the ontario food terminal , same quality . this is just one small example of what i can only describe as highway robbery	2819
0	went here two weeks ago with the family , as we wanted to experience the lard burgers first hand . really , the burgers here are just okay and the fries are not good . coke in a bottle is nice , so they got that going for them . if you need to test belly room with triple or quadruple size burgers , go for it . believe i 'll head elsewhere for a good single .	75
1	my favorite store to go all the time good prices , good inventory . special savings with their coupons .	1615
1	vivi is awesome ! i love my nails every time i come here . they 're priced just right and are super friendly . i love that they do n't try to upsell you and are so courteous . nick is awesome on my pedicures and bob always hooks my moms nails up ! this is definitely my go to place !	744
1	cool place , nice staff , cold beer . not seedy at all ... kinda place you find regulars and out of towners riding 51 . give it a try .	319
0	this review is for the restaurant in the basement of the hotel . it is called bucci 's steak house . for a steakhouse , the menu is limited to one page , and well , there are only a few steaks . my business partner and i had dinner , both ordered the filet , medium rare , $ 40 a steak . both steaks were overcooked . they cooked us both new ones , mine was charred . at least they took it off the bill . selection was limited , service was mediocre at best . i wish i could give it less then one star . this is not near the quality of a real steak house . go elsewhere .	1786
0	this is a beautiful restaurant with an overpriced menu laden with garlic . if you do n't want garlic and if you do n't want to leave hungry after paying for a $ 40 lunch , go elsewhere . this was very disappointing .	951
0	i have been put on hold by a snappy lady and left on hold for 1 hour and 20 minutes . then i asked for the owner and she hung up . i called back to speak with th eowner robert who was very rude and hung up on me too . very unprofessional .	33
1	walked to this joint this afternoon and was delighted by a delicious coffee and coffee cake . this is just the kind of establishment the northside needs and i am glad to have stumbled upon it . the staff is courteous and the space is cozy and inviting . stop by here for coffee or breakfast next chance you get !	2504
0	after 10 hours in the desert waiting for towing partly aaa then to have a under the influence driver , almost crashing twice . he did n't know where he was going and my son had to tell him how to get to repair shop . he couldn't process his credit card and made him get cash . ripped him off to a towing charge of $ 405 . if i were you i would think again . to top it off bad mouth him to repair shop . so now i can not dispute the charge and out a lot of money . these people are awful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	2931
1	a great used car dealership if you have poor credit ! excellent service , will work with you to find the right vehicle in your budget . would recommend to anyone else who felt like they would never get approved for a loan ! thanks guys !	3851
1	the most amazing and helpful employees i have ever experienced at any store ever ! i even got a little hand massage when trying their awesome lotion ! i had a spa experience ! they were soooooo nice and helpful at this store ! i did n't want to leave ! if i could leave more than 5 stars i would !	1765
1	typical denny 's . nice and attentive waitstaff . prime location outside of touristy area .	1504
1	after waiting too long for assistance , general manager brett found us and showed us exactly what we wanted for a new tablet . awesome service was worth waiting for .	3192
1	i have had the chance to work with head chef craig barbour on two occasions and i look forward to working with him in the future . his food truck served 300 people at a backyard party and served delicious and reasonably priced food efficiently to all the guests . i only heard compliments from those in attendance . i have also used craig for a private dinner for 4 people on new years eve . he took great care in providing a menu that met our desires , served food that was not only excellent , but prepared beautifully and was a pleasure to work with .	872
0	it 's a little below average . machines sometimes broke for over a week , and you deal with stuck up baller on budget people from southern highlands .	2919
1	you can ge mf fruit loops on ur mf hot dog ! think about that folks , just let that sink in	1407
1	this is my favorite coffee shop in madison . the coffee is stellar and the baristas are friendly . the shop itself is cozy and inviting with mismatched chairs and tables , and i love the art they hang on the walls . they sell some local artisan products , such as hand sewn aprons and things , which is yet another reason to love jph . great quality of food and drinks , you really ca n't go wrong with anything they 've got . i also love their story slams ! so much fun ! jph , you 're the best !	1175
0	worst service . nurses do not have basic skills of being able to communicate effectively .	1684
0	after my complaints they did take the drop fee off . they really should n't leave her so short handed that she had to go to get cars herself from the airport .	3887
0	i would give this place 0 stars if i could but one is the least you can do . once you pay for your storage the service sucks . they are really rude and treat people badly . my unit had a leak and some of my stuff was damaged and they never even fixed the leak . they refused to even refund any of the rent when my stuff was damaged because they did n't maintain the roof . awful .	3141
1	good food , authentic and plentiful . fair prices and excellent selection . a neighborhood favorite !	189
1	first time hear on a visit to toronto . restaurant was nice . our waitress was very good and the food was pretty good too . will definitely come back again .	163
0	an old bldg with torn up furniture ! came to tour for my father . i was disgusted with how badly they openly treat their staff which made me wonder how they would treat my father ! most of the pple there didnt seem very happy or friendly ! ! ! not a place i would even want to be at much less send my pops to ! the other facilities are a few miles out of the way but they seemed so much nicer and caring ! ! ! and they are inside a hospital unlike this dump ( promise ) .	2413
1	i 've never been happier with my nails ! if you are looking for acrylics ask for alex , you will not be disappointed .	3732
0	study area ? great ! quite busy so you need to grab your spot fast ! to get wifi you need to purchase something . quality of their drinks , i 've had their milk tea and it was good ! but , i drank the chocomint tea and it honestly tasted like medicine . green tea mango : i asked for cold and they gave me hot , so no biggie . but i tried it and it was n't as great either ... i sat in the hippie volkswagen tent , and the environment was nice , it 's just the quality of their drinks was n't what i expected .	2219
0	honestly , i have no clue how the store is . they 're closed even though their website says their hours today are open from 9am - 8pm . the door says they open at 10 and close at 6 pm . i 'm doubting their overall attention to detail . we called verizon and were told this location is not a 'real ' verizon store . the tech support guy in the phone from verizon stated that he would n't even consider going to one of these third party stores if he had an issue .	2166
0	they are always screwing up my order and sometimes the food is sloppy . but , the people are usually nice . i guess that 's a plus .	1162
1	got ta respect the dedication this man does . he was tired as hell just about to go home literally and still took care of me . he does a great job here . i recomend this business to everyone .	247

1	i have been to this museum three times and i still do n't know what it 's about ... fashion ? history ? or fashion history ? anyway , each time i enjoyed this museum a lot . it 's small but features both permanent and special exhibits . the current special exhibit , italian fashion is full of fun .	3847
1	i heard from a friend that a new taco place recently opened at the corner of adelaide and portland , so decided to go try it out for dinner . no alcohol license or tacos al pastor yet . we tried most of their tacos , all of which were exquisitely spiced and simply delicious . the ceviche ( sea bass ) was fresh and served with lots of chips and generous helpings of avocado . i also recommend trying the agua de jamaica ( hibiscus tea ) , very refreshing ! prices were very reasonable and the service was impeccable . the seating is cozy and the large pastel coloured wall murals added to the comfortable ambiance , could a nice place for a date .	1469
0	seriously . i have been on hold trying to schedule an appt . for over 33 minutes now . i 've simultaneously been trying to book online and their system is so un user friendly that i ca n't get a confirmed appointment . i 've now tried 3 different location phone # 's only to be sent to voicemail on hold each time for over 30 minutes . i finally called a billing number to confirm that my insurance will pay for my procedure and guess where they transferred me to . . . you guessed it - scheduling . i 'm right back where i started . come on . this is ridiculous .	188
0	i placed an online order for 3 pairs of shoes which i could not find any place else . in fact , i was pleasantly surprised that they had these shoes available although there were limited colors and sizes . everything went smoothly placing the order but after 3 weeks i had n't received any shoes or notification from the company . i then went on-line and saw that my order was marked as 'cancelled . ' no notification , no nothing . at least my credit card was n't charged ... . and the shoes are still listed as available on the website .	2910
1	we visited during the super bowl . it was busy but we were seated immediately . food was good and came out in a timely manner . the tomato soup was really good . very creamy and rustic . bathroom is less to be desired . the waitress was very attentive . we had wings , calamari , the fried cheese is freakin awesome and it was all half off . super cheap during happy hour . will definitely be going again .	717
1	best vietnamese ever . outstanding service . owners even remember their regular customers names .	205
1	i have been going here for years , everyone is talented and does a great job . paula is awesome snd able to replicate any design i show her . my latest got so many compliments ! thank you paula !	2057
0	small , just small . no space on the floor to do non equipment workouts , closes early on weekends , not humid enough , i felt that painful cold air in my throat as i ran . not enough space in the free weights section ... maybe its because i 'm used to 24 hour fitness , but my workout did n't feel complete since i did n't get to relax my muscles in the sauna afterward .	2919
0	went in to view , told would be 5 minutes ... .. 20 minutes later we left ... was quite prepared to buy ( had cash ) ... . when got to car the female agent ran out and said she was ready for us now ... . left after i told her `` you lied ... said 5 minutes and now 20 ... you lie we do n't buy '' ... ..	3264
0	glad to get a response from alamo but there was no qc person to go over my car with me . there were only 4 cars being worked on at any time i was there so that is n't a good excuse as to why it took so long . i have been to car washes all over the country that employ less workers than your business that charge the same prices as you do and they are way superior in efficiency . so if you think you need to hire more apparently incompetent workers and want to threaten to raise your prices so be it . it does n't affect me because i wo n't be back .	2359
1	stopped in because we walk by every week and had never tried . do n't be fooled by the appearance . we ordered the dinner for two and everything was delicious ! when you say spicy they listen ! the peanut sauce for the fresh spring rolls is spot on . the shrimp stir fry and chicken curry did not disappoint . everything came out fast and fresh , we will definitely be back !	1439
1	a quick update on parallax ... .. first , it has easily lived up to it 's 5-star review after several repeat visits . this place remains on my short-list for favorite places to eat in cleveland . secondly , the walleye . we 've had walleye twice now , with 2 completely different seasonal preparations ( once a spring-time composition with leeks and rhubarb , and once a summer-latin composition with a creamed corn and spicy-pepper sauce ) a both times it 's been absolutely beautiful . if you want to taste the king of lake erie sportfish cooked to perfection , go to parallax .	487
1	not as good as steamwhistle pilsner . we had the flint of beers . enjoyed the white and amber the most . the munich ( specialty beer ) was interesting , but david did not like it . pumpkin was awful . what is it with all restaurants doing pumpkin flavors in the fall ? ? i 'm so over it ! !	670
1	went here with my indonesian spouse and we complexly enjoyed the meal.. all of the dishes were ordered were cooked to the standards we expect and were used to . we had the chicken satay appetizer with beef rendang along with chicken mango which was served with a slice of orange . if you are craving malaysian or indonesian food i highly recommend .	1425
0	lady waving me in spoke no english . guy asking why i was there , umfriendly . i felt like i wasnt important . told him i didnt have my glasses and he still handed me the comouter pad . sorry , didnt know the process . if he doesnt like his job then go elsewhere . edwaedo very nice and helpful .	3250
0	if i could give zero i would ! come to vegas harley n get a rude staff member locking the door in our face as our hands are on the door handle refusing to answer a simple question would only rudely aggressively point at the sign saying closing early for inventory ... .its 12:55pm seriously can you just imagine all the business you just shut out ... groups of people outside disappointed and probably wont ever return ... we had a simple question about renting a bike but nope got a door shut in our face instead what great customer service will never return nor recommend this location to anyone . thankfully eagle rider not to far away was more than accommodating !	3078
0	nice staff , but slow on the service . we were out to celebrate our first anniversary . we had our very first date in boulder city so my guy brought me here . i wanted a glass of sparkling wine , they were out . i ordered the chicken marsala , it was very bland no flavor . the wait staff never came back to refill my water . not sure if i 'd eat there again .	109
1	the foundation room at the house of blues is always polite bartenders ian and julie are superstars and julius the vip host is always cooperative polite and outstanding i highly recommend this place .	1129
1	totally relaxing . very thorough when they are not busy . schedule an appt in advance of course if you want to not wait . could be a little faster though .	2128
1	what a great apartment complex . have been here a few months and was invited to a wine & cheese social for apartment residents to get together . not only was the presentation , beverages and appetizers first class , everyone who came had a great time - met some other very nice residents and have met other friendly people who have pets on walks who live here . the staff was awesome , as always . if you have any questions or issues the staff is always right on top of it . nice environment to live at . thank you .	2992
1	great burgers ! super tasty very thin onion rings were my favorite side dish . the mac and cheese was creamy and delicious . the baked beans were also very good .	1046
1	amazing service . everyone is always so friendly here . they bring the good to you . they say goodbye and hello every time . the food is excellent everytime as well .	1494
0	this is to inform enterprise rental that i wont be renting there anymore . i was involved in a hit and run that was not my fault and usaa took care of it . but somehow the incompetent people at corporate in kansas city mo keep sending me letters for the bill . i 'm pissed off because some jerk hit me and took off in the first place and now because of people not doing homework and taking care of it instead of sending me letters for a bill i just have more trash to throw in the garbage . i doubt i will get a response if anyone even reads this	3024
1	needed a specialty cake for an engagement party ! it was pricey but it was fabulous ! ! ! ! ! ! everyone commented on the amazing flavor and design ! we did use their new location on lincoln dr in scottsdale . the cake , the filling and the icing were each outstanding in their own way & the cake was not that sicky sweet stuff you get from costco or grocer . it was very good !	1806
1	this place is great ! my mom was diagnosed with lymphoma six years ago , she needed a new clinic ... her doctor sent us here and we could n't be happier ! they called us and scheduled an appointment for her to see a lymphoma specialist ! dr. u is great ! super nice and very knowledgable ! the facility is beautiful and their boutique of hope is wonderful too !	2768
1	i really love their food ! there are n't very many great mediterranean restaurants in the southwest and everytime i eat there , which tends to be often since it 's across the street from work , the foods is always great ! big portions ! awesome taziki ! yum ! ! plus their staff is always very friendly .	860
1	amazing , clean and friendly services ! love the clean odorless smell and their selection of polishes ! i bring my niece in here all the time and we use the little kid pedicure chairs and get our feet done together , and get matching toe colors , definitely my to go place !	854
1	i actually prefer target over walmart . i can normally find what i am looking for . the reason for the 4 stars is b/c of there decision to support transgender bathrooms and there continual inability to carry the size of pants i need . overall a good store and i 'll continue to go to the store for items i do n't get at costco .	3355
0	this places employs people that prescribe medication for children that do not need it . and they do not get consent from both parents when both parents are required by a judge to give authorization for any treatment on my children . this place should be out of business .	1692
1	needing some food after a long day of drinking . just happen to pop into this place that was close to where we were staying . we ordered two pizzas and they were great . loved the feel of this ny pizzeria . prices were right and friendly staff . i am sure if in the area and wanting pizza i will be back .	328
1	i 've used wells fargo for my last two cars . the interest rates were great and i would do business with them again .	3272
1	my favorite mexican restaurant in town . they make the salsa fresh every day and it is absolutely amazing . they 're not stingy with it either . the food is absolutely top notch and so is the service ! the price is unbeatable especially considering the quality .	7
0	food did not taste fresh- my food did not have a great taste . we got the basil rolls needles and curry and it left a stale taste in our mouths .	50
1	i can honestly say daphne 's cupcakes are the best i 've ever had ! i 've also had some of their day old goods and they taste incredibly fresh as well .	2507
0	owch to the prices ! ! ! ! i hope this place closes and a normal bowling alley opens here because it is a great location . i added a star because the music and the music videos are fun at least . ps ... . replace your shoes every once in a while , bowlmor ! !	3296
0	took my sister to this location on june 6 , 2017 . they did n't have her glasses ready and broke her original frames that she turned in . it 's now september , i called the office and they claimed they had her glasses . ok , when we 're someone going to call her to pick it up ? ? the staff are confuse and no one claims to know anything . took her to pick up her glasses , finally ... the glasses did n't fit . waiting for over 30min and no one has yet to approach us to fix the issues . terrible customer service . will never recommend this location to anyone .	962
1	quite a charming place to dine ! think of paradise bakery ... but way better ! excellent house coffee . i look forward to visiting again : )	1387
0	i had very bad experience with great clips located at 19th ave and union hills in phoenix.. the barber is a old lady..knows nothing about haircuts and keeps talking and always does mistakes.. one time i had rash and burn in the neck after she cut my hair.. i was even getting alcohol smell and am sure she was drunk.. last week the same old lady removed some portion of my hair and then just said sorry.. every friend of mine noticed this..i think this old lady should be immediately removed from this job..	3565
1	had an amazing saturday in las vegas ! the party bus was soo much fun . `` guido the torpedo '' our party host was great ! he was on top of everthing he made sure we kept on schedule . guido had the best energy and pumped everyone up in our group . i highly recommend doing this party bus ! best way to party and let loose and experience vegas safely !	2122
1	just ordered a high cut bikini bottom from them online i am so excited for it to come . i am giving it 5 stars because their employer chris g. was amazing at helping me pick which size would best fit me as i live in california and have to estimate . he provided great service and answered all my questions quickly . i will be updating pics of purchase when it arrives . overall good online service and easy check out . not to mention i got 15 % off as a first time buyer and recieved another coupon just for purchasing !	2661
1	scrubs came to my house for a pre-holiday clean and they were like a cleaning tornado . 4 friendly women went straight o work and scrubbed until it all shined ! i am incredibly hard to please , but they did . i will be using them regularly now . they did n't mind working around my dogs and even were considerate of the dogs fear of the vacuum . ca n't recommend enough .	3257
1	rented a luxury car for 5 days for less than $ 300 . they did n't have a luxury so they upgraded me to luxury elite at no extra cost . picking up the car took 5 minutes and when i dropped it off it took 2 minutes . staff was very friendly , highly recommended !	3024
1	gave jade another shot tonight , this time for take out only , and let me tell you , the food stands on its own . really good . if they can address the clumsy service this place has a chance . well played , jade !	489
0	i wo n't be coming back here again . there were people talking and on there phones to the point where me saying something to one or two people would be pointless , it was at least 10 phones out , and people literally talking at room level volume , i am mad i paid 16 $ for such a bad experience and i will be sure to let my friends know what type of service to expect here .	3063
1	i love this store . i can just spend hours walking around getting ideas of things to either update or change around my house . all of the sales associates are very helpful and knowledgeable . sometimes it 's hard to find someone to help you because they are busy helping other customers . they even cut keys that actually work .	124
0	we went there on our last full day in vegas and were n't too impressed . if you 'd like to be rekindled with soda that came in bottles back in the day , then this store would be for you . i was hoping to come across some novelty candies from the 70 's or so , but their selection of candies was sparse to say the least . needless to say , we left empty handed ... ... ... ... ...	1986
1	as much as i hate going to the dentist , i had a great experience coming here . the employees were all very friendly and accommodating , and the entire process was fast and easy . i had a few questions in regards to financing my treatment , and the office manager chris was friendly and able to thoroughly address all of my concerns . i will definitely be telling my friends and family i have found a new and trustworthy dental office ! thank you guys for taking great care of me : )	3292
1	i love ulta ! they send you coupons , it 's very reasonably priced , they have all kkinds of good stuff . if you do n't watch the time , you could be there for hours . they also have hair products , and perfumes as well .	2479
0	toronto 's ny times square copycat but not as good . i never really feel safe at yonge-dundas square and try to walk/run through it as quickly as possible . there 's usually about 3-4 individual people carrying signs and ranting about politics/religion on a loudspeaker on each side of the walk-anywhere crossing . just keep your head down , do n't make eye contact and stride on through ...	1012
1	this place is legit ! their food is so good and authentic . the location kind of stinks ( only because we 've seen the restaurant change hands often throughout the years ) , but i hope they last . good , good food !	1330
1	the service desk was friendly and the room was really clean . wi-fi was great and fast , breakfast was good !	1195
1	this is my third trip in two weeks because the first trip i had the meatloaf entrée and now i 'm addicted . i might need a 12 step program to break my habit ! this place has a dive bar motif with really good food . i 'm hoping to go through the menu but i need a few weeks ( or months ) to get sick of ordering the same thing over and over . i ordered a beer with my food and it comes in a nice cold glass , excellent !	717
1	this is a great mix of asian flavors from malaysian , chinese , and japanese . everything if fresh and flavorful . the staff is very accommodating and friendly . our group never had to wait for anything . the dishes that came out of the kitchen looked amazing from the mango chicken , the curry chicken , the seaweed salad , the appetizers i ca n't pronounce , and the curry chicken . one of the people at our table had the salmon and shrimp from the habachi grill which looked the best and tasted fantastic from what i heard . i think if you come out of here disappointed , you must be too picky !	961
0	do n't get them to do a roofing job done for you . it took three months to do mine . time , expense , trouble heartache was what we hot . they hired people that had to be required to do certain areas correctly .	124
1	after my last review and email to them , i got a call from the managing partner and a letter . that was a first and i was impressed . i 'm happy to report that we finally went back to this location just this past tuesday ( nov 3 ) and what a difference ! we went as soon as they opened at 4 . we ordered the same thing and everything was perfect ! we had an excellent waitress . joselynn ( hope i spelled that right ) now only was extremely friendly , but very attentive . place was clean and everyone was working as expected . will gladly go back .	1491
0	celebrated by besties bachelorette party here . i had requested a limo but was picked up in a party bus instead : / no music , no fun . when we got to the venue our seating arrangement was n't the most comfortable one either . but once i bickered with the manager we got a few comfortable seats and were able to enjoy ourselves . girls ... you have to try this place . it was fun !	5
0	absolutely the longest wait for service i 've ever had to wait for , over an hour for a drink of wast d time . please get some more or faster workers - paid a lot of money for the concert and ca n't get a drink	2187
0	better pad thai at food court . too sweet , no veggies other than bean sprouts . wo n't be back .	801
1	great tint job on my 2010 toyota avalon & my 1999 mit galant	1121
1	been going here for 3 years and have never received a bad haircut ! you can completely change your style and they will still get it just the way you like ! 100 % my favorite haircut place ! !	457
1	one of the best pizza delivery restaurants in the saint-laurent area .	400
0	they have untrained people painting nails in this place . i have been happy one out of the three times i went . they also guilt you into tipping . i am done going to this salon .	1783
1	seriously , this place is so good . the food ? so good . the bar ? so good . the service ? so good . the vibe ? so , so good . the music ? the community involvement ? the special events ( trivia night ! science night ! ) ? so , so , so good . happy dog is that perfect mix of neighborhood standby , dive bar , trendy hot spot and casual hang out .	1407
0	the worst experience in customer service ! call and wait for 24 minutes to be transferred to the scottsdale location . the csr there advised my order was at the mailing facility and i needed to be transferred again ! ! ! ! i ask her to warm transfer me and she tells me she cant . working for 5 years in customer service myself i know better . so i ask to speak to her supervisor and she places me on hold and 2 seconds later hangs up on me ! ! ! ! ! ! so here i am waiting another 30 minutes to go through the same bs ! worst pharmacy in business !	3283
0	very rude employee ! would never consider coming to this establishment for a tattoo or piercing . terrible just flat out terrible : (	2895
0	i agree with everyone else that has said their customer service is basically nonexistent . it 's a miracle if you can a clerk anywhere in the store besides at the cutting table or the lone clerk at the register and when you do ask a question they look at you like you are speaking and a foreign-language . i 've been told , `` no we do n't have that , '' and then have come upon exactly what i asked about ... ... .. who 's monitoring these stores ? ? ? ? ? ?	3876
1	very nice people and they really care for the animal and really helpful . they keep me update on how my dog is . you can talk to the doc and call then and they really follow up .	3030
0	i was there recently getting highlights . i did n't get a trim-just highlights , a wash , blow dry . soooo pricey . oh-and i drank the coffee they offered me . they clearly charge you for every little thing . i was shocked and i 'm coming from nyc . too much for what i received honestly . the reception area is a mess and the person waiting on me at the cash was very rude . not impressed at all . wo n't go back .	3901
0	ok definitely the worst restaurant i have been to in scottsdale ! ! ! the service is slow ! ! ! ! they messed up every single item we ordered . the restaurant had a terrible draft and the food was mediocre . i would never ever go here again ! many better options for mediterranean food in scottsdale . a definite add to the must miss list . blech .	185
0	on vacation , excited to get a rental and get going , over an hour and a half wait for a car . 4 attendants moving 1 customer every 15-20 minutes each . unreal ! ! ! go to another company , everyone has a reservation and it 's still pathetically slow .	3129
0	i attended this church for years under the old pastor , and stayed for a year under the new pastor pastor greg . it is a very welcoming church and i love the community outreach they do . i will say one of the biggest reasons we left was the pastor preaching hate against gay people . saying how `` disgusting '' they were etc . ca n't support anyplace using their position to preach and spread hate	3167
1	we took our kitten here to get declawed and the experience was amazing . helen evans was our vet , she took the time to discuss everything with us , and genuinely cared about taking care of sparta ( our kitten ) . we chose to have her boarded after the procedure over the weekend ( we have three other cats so easier option ) and they took amazing care of her . the whole staff knew her , and told us what a joy it was to have her . if you are looking for a vet , we would highly recommend this clinic ! ! ! ! ! it was also one of the few clinics that offered laser declaw .	1584
0	thank you for the response on yelp at this point it has been one year since i have referred a client to you he did not want to pay for more laser resurfacing due to his office visit the day of the procedure i have contacted your office i as well will not return to this businesses due to the botched job i received from the doctor .	557
0	$ 7.59 for an unsatisfying , not thick chocolate milkshake ... i do n't think so . it tastes like they put half a scoop of ice cream and 2 cups of milk . high price + low-quality equals horrible . drinks come in only one size to force you to buy the expensive one . the ben & jerry 's name no longer carries value in the retail space . mcdonald 's has a better tasting chocolate shake than b & j . if you want to waste your money come here .	2385
0	you know that scene in steel magnolias , when shelby gets her hair cut , and then bursts into tears when she sees it ? that 's how i felt after i got my hair cut here .	2169
0	we went this club to watch the fix ( band from dc ) ..it was cool that the club had the whole 80 's 90 's theme..i agree with all the other reviews tho , the bathroom smelled horrible ! like a truckstop bathroom . other than that , the sound was awesome and we enjoyed the show .	677
0	pre-paid for a car , flight arrived on-time ( maybe a little early ) , waited 50 minutes for the shuttle to show up , they finally came , the lady got out , said they had no cars , laughed , and drove off . yes , laughed ! ! so i 'm standing there at 11:10 pm , a hour drive ahead of me , and no car . i did not find that funny ! i suggest paying a few more bucks and go to a real rental car agency .	1905
0	do not waste your coin on this place ! the food is very bland , ordered garlic baby bok choy ... ..no garlic , shrimp lo mein no flavor , mancho beef was ok all you taste is the heat . egg roll was good , spring roll ok. do not waste your money head down to . rol san spadina and college	649
0	this shop sold me batteries with a over priced mod . those batteries blew up inside the mod leaking acid into the mod . i go to the shop and they tell me the mod is fried and useless ! they even said that they would never use those batteries themselves ! like wtf why are you distributing them ? they wo n't use them themselves and they wo n't refund or exchange anything !	2568
1	excellent food . try the sicilian pizza . it is terrific ! we were in from out of town and looking for good pizza and found it . grace was super nice .	1307
0	went out of my way to get paint at this store because my carpenter told me to buy here and get a specific type of paint . after buying 300 dollars worth of paint and having it sprayed on , i found the paint was the wrong color . they made no attempt to help in the suituation . i basically spent triple the amount of money on this paint only to have them point fingers at the carpenter . i 'll go elsewhere next time and so should my carpenter .	23
1	i had the brownie and something with elderflower in it and i could n't have anticipated the explosion of flavor in my mouth . the waitress was nice on a next level and did all she could to make sure me and my friend were taken care of . my new favorite spot .	2410
1	i love this place ! i come in at least 5 days a week ! i do their hot yoga , i am down 12 pounds in 8 weeks ! the staff is awesome , and very professional ! i recommend planet beach to all my friends ! come check it out ! you wo n't be disappointed !	1585
0	my daughter and i went for pedicures and were told to come back in 30 minutes so they could get more technicians . i got the spa package with the suger scrub and it was basically put on and then rinsed off . the massage was also super rushed . the female owner is not very friendly . we really liked this place better when it was china nail .	2886
1	i randomly spent my 30th birthday there on accident because my friend left his credit card there the night before . and we had such a blast ! it was so much fun ! i loved that they all switched off , and they all had great voices ! krystal was amazing ! every time i go to vegas , i now always want to stop there ! ! ! !	3326
1	this gym is so challenging and i 'm the best way . the coaches and staff are all very friendly and encouraging . you will love the group fitness setting especially if you are competitive . at first i was nervous that since everyone 's name is displayed , i would feel insecure , however , everyone is so focused on getting their own best workout , you soon realize the competition you are feeling is with yourself and past performances . the gym never gives you a chance to get in a rut and is alway challenging different muscle groups and fitness skills ( endurance , strength , and power ) . definitely give orangetheory a try !	1773
1	absolutely fantastic experience ! the sights , smells , and sounds were so realistic . would definitely do it again . shout out to bailey ! !	1391
0	limited beer options and a fast food quality menu . i left disappointed and do n't plan to return .	428
0	this location is filthy woman locker room and stalls . to let paper on the ground , feminine items not in the trash . this was n't the reason of canceling my membership tho.. no reason asking me why , just pulled up my account rob okay it quickly after coming back from a break . no real fight why i wanted the cancellation , no offers to lower membership , how can be better service to you . as a representative for a company in sales , i i would have asked reasons , what could we do better , was n't interested at all . printed my sheet off computer , on my way .	1802
0	i hate this place , do n't know why i ever came back in here . the service is always horrible , the dj sucks and the people are rude .	2860
1	candy marrufo was exceptional . candy went above and beyond when working on my case and worked with my crazy busy schedule . she was extremely honest with her process of things and genuinely fought for what was in my best interest . my career or the chances of me persuing an additional degree would have been in jeopardy if it was n't for candy . everything turned out to be a total success because of her perseverance . i am a satisfied client and i am so thankful to have her as my attorney .	2391
0	this is a nail salon in scottsdale and i 've heard awesome things . i have had my nails for two days and they are cracked and ruined . not pleased . i do n't believe i will be going back .	2434
1	though i do n't have many places which i liked during my stay in cleveland but this was an exception . visited this restaurant during extreme cold and to get better food as downtown does not have good options . located in an industrial area this is probably the only restaurant in the area . the place itself is very spacious and had ample seating available for patrons . after my initial visit i came here a couple of times . my favorites here are the pho and chicken cabbage salad . the pho broth is so good i can eat it all day along , definitely a must visit place when craving some good authentic pho .	784
0	i came here all throughout college because they have so many electrical outlets ! ! awesome ! i stopped coming because its slow , expensive and the baristas suck . i 'll never go there again hahahha . but thanks for serving my electrical needs !	2163
0	jason , i did that and they blew me off.they stated that they were not responsible.verve also blew me off.so your post is worthless .	3576
1	a little bit of this , a little of that . they have a good selection of a range of fabrics , their painting , woodworking and floral departments seemed on par for most , but their premade ( boxes , paintings ) were small and framing department i did n't see at all . the jewelry section also seemed small , two short rows . but it seemed well organized if not a little cramped , and the cutting counter was on the ball on a sunday afternoon of a sale weekend .	835
0	horrible service . really horrible service . i was told to come in twice . they are 35 minutes away from me and both times they had n't worked out my insurance . i called 4 times to follow up and each time they had no record of speaking with me . a week later i am having my prescriptions transferred to another avella location . we 'll see this is an overall avella issue or just the scottsdale location . i do n't appreciate my time being wasted , and it would have been nice to have received an apology over the phone . i will not be doing business with the avella in scottsdale in the future .	3283
1	thomas and megan were awesome ! they took care of us , explained everything thoroughly and it was one of the best buying experience we 've ever had . thomas was very knowledgeable about the products and their benefits and features to guide us through the buying process . the information he provided us helped us make the best decisions for our purchases . we would highly recommend him to friends and family . thank you so much ! megan was great to work with as well we felt very welcome and taken care of in her store . thank you again ! ! if you go to this store definitely ask for thomas	1442
1	although there were n't many choices , the sliders and sandwiches tasted really good . but the dishes were served very slow . we had a very good time playing bowling there .	742
1	good boba drinks . very friendly staff . the only sugar free drink is the black or green tea . wish there were choices for low sugar boba drinks . love boba tea .	490
1	love everything about harkins no matter the location . the great customer service is always consistent .	2524
0	well , it sure is off putting when you walk in and the girl behind the register is munching loudly on a bag of chips ... .so obnoxious . a friend of mine and i stopped in here yesterday because she was looking for a swimsuit . i looked around and did n't see anything too interesting . i was surprised at how busy this store gets ! while i was waiting for my friend ( in the dressing room ) it seemed like a swarm of people decided to come in and buy sporting goods . i ca n't say that i would come back here if i needed something .	1050
0	found this place from groupon but tried contacting them but no luck ! i 'm assuming that either they are no longer in business or they are just a very unreliable company ! i will be very careful with these guys ! shady ! i 'll just give the business to someone else !	2888
0	the manager is a witch ! she is out right rude to every customer that comes in . she obviously does n't want to be there and makes you feel like an inconvenience for coming in . i had another stylist this time ( shea ) and she was super sweet and did a great job but overall the whole time i was there i felt unwelcome and uncomfortable . the manager is the older , rough looking , mexican lady with the bull ring nose piercing . i 'd go to another salon or location in the future .	3625
1	i ordered a garage door remote from them online . i received it in a few days , i programmed it and it works fine . the price was very good . much lower than amazon and others . i would order from them again . i was also pleased that it included a sheet with 2 suggestions on how to get a better range with the remote - thought that was cool . i see many negative reviews - i ca n't respond to these , but i acknowledge that garage door openers are poorly documented and getting the correct remote is difficult . i had one failed attempt prior to ordering from north shore but i do n't blame the supplier .	3470
0	not really worth $ 12/person . there 's basically a play kitchen and a water room . will not come back .	2969
1	ignite is an open area bar at the end of the casino and a great place to sit and rest while playing . while i did n't see any servers approaching the small sitting area , the bartenders did a good job at keeping the crowds pleased . while i do n't see this bar as being a spot were people would really stay longer than it would take to have a drink or two , it is a nice landing spot when on the casino floor .	2634
1	what a great place . clean . polite . good value . they are getting busier so do n't expect to have walk-in appts available .	3338
0	though the service was great , the food hot , and the coffee bottomless , i still considered mickeys to be a disappointing breakfast because i felt their food just lacked flavor . i went for the salmon hash and think there was 1-1.5 ounces of salmon to go along with all the unseasoned potatoes . just not very much balance or texture differences to standout enough . again , the place has a cool retro feel , folks are nice , prices are n't bad -- but i wo n't be back because the food just does n't do much for me .	975
1	dr. deb is a great dermatologist ! this place is very nice and the staff is very professional . had a great experience for it being my first time . this place is nicer than all the other derm offices i had been to in the past .	3598
0	cafeteria quality food and subpar service . manager was quite rude when the server made a mistake on our order ... .. their coffee drinks are delicious but it did n't make up for the rest .	364
0	i loved some of the clothes upstairs , but this store offers the rudest customer service i have ever experienced anywhere . it inspired me do more research about canada goose as a company so now , when i look at someone who is wearing one , all i can see is a bloody gutted coyote that was left to suffer and die slowly and painfully in a cruel leg trap wrapped around their face and geese having their feathers ripped out of their skin . horrible !	3317
1	good prices , great place to pick up my vitamins which i take faithfully every day . the sam 's brand , is quality stuff , just as good compared to gnc and prices are better here . i like looking around especially with the change in seasons , they put out new stuff and it 's fun to see what 's new . prices are good , but you might not need 3 boxes of brownie mix , so be ware , you can over spend , and over buy . if you have the shelf space , then no problem , right ?	2469
0	we love the 2 items we purchased , a sectional and a love seat . delivery was on time too . however , i 've been trying since july to get an issue fixed and ca n't get anyone to follow through . we purchased at the mesa store , which is now closed . i get the run-around from the phoenix store by phone and no response by email . i would n't recommend the store simply because their follow-up customer service is terrible .	1710
1	dr. brooker is by the far the most knowledgeable eye doctor is las vegas . his caring nature and attention detail are just a few things that make him top notch . the staff is very friendly . would give more than 5 stars if possible .	2811
1	always have great service from driving up , to going to the register , to driving off in a clean truck . everyone is always pleasant . they have a nice `` all you can wash '' package that pays for itself in two washes . i would recommend cobblestone for sure . oh ya you get free popcorn when you get your vehicle washed .	127
1	i do n't care that they moved . it 's such a better place though . this is a real step up & it is amazing ! khianna is the only person to wax me . i wo n't do anywhere else . i keep to my word ... .still going to her and going strong .	196
0	went here to inquire about printing one sheet of a document and was told 2.75 cents . i was told it cost 2.75 to access the system . what system ? the internet lol ripoff	1878
0	i 've sold to half price books a few times now and each time they never give you a fair deal for what you sell them they are no better then selling to a pawn shop .	836
1	this place totally saved me . i broke a unique fitting that plumbed my hot water dispenser . i searched lowe 's , home depot , ferguson , and could not find anything close . i was referred to lvqw and made the drive late on friday . they were outstanding ! polite , knowledgeable , and genuine employees went out of their way to fashion a fitting that would replace the one i broke ! these folks have everything you need for anything water softener , purifier , or under counter filtration related !	2558
1	did a scuba refresher course tonight . good classroom talk and then a nice long time in the pool practicing skills . had a fun time and had good equipment and facilities .	2109
0	starbuck 's is usually very inviting ! ! today , audrey , made our visit quite frustrating when she would n't cooperate in describing our drinks . afterall , there were 5 of us . please teach some of ur employees about proper etiquette & hospitality ! afterall , is n't that it 's all about ? being a successful business and all . # unsatisfiedcustomer	2206
0	had dinner with my wife there last week . excellent ambience at new restaurant , very good service , but the food was mediocre at best , no flavor , definitely missing something . had three different chicken selections ( 2 tapas ) as well as as chicken fried rice . chicken was sliced and appeared to be boiled before being made into dinner , not good . sorry , but not coming back . really wanted to love it .	602
1	great happy hour , nice clean establishment and very friendly staff . will come again ! ! !	2021
0	vacuum hoses are too short . when the bays are full , you ca n't vacuum out your whole car with the right side vacuum . unless your neighbor is willing to share ( which mine was not ) , it 's impossible to vacuum the passenger side of your car .	2821
1	my husband and i recently stayed here for three nights in february . room was very clean , a bit dated/worn carpet etc , but clean . bed was very comfortable . we appreciated all of the extra amenities , especially the little walking trail , the pool , and the poolside grill . staff was very friendly and helpful . we also had 2 massages at the spa which were great as well . it 's a low key place , needs some updating , but for the price it has good value and the location is great . if you are looking to save some money and want a spacious room in scottsdale , this is a great option !	2883
1	i was looking for a relaxing place to celebrate my birthday over the weekend , a place where my kids could swim while the adults had some drinks by the pool , and this was totally it . it was perfect . we got a 2 bedroom villa for a pretty good rate , and then just hung out by the pool all day and ubered to a bar at night . all the staff members we talked to were nice , and i liked that the pool was n't packed with little kids or college kids so we could just relax without feeling like sardines in the pool . we could n't have picked a better spot , and we 'll be back for sure !	2883
1	food is excellent , the cebuchon is delicious plus to add the the good food are the friendly staff and the owner very accommodating	658
1	my stylist has switched salons ... . for as much as i love ladies and gents , i will be following jessie to edge in willowby .	3524
0	i feel like when you go to the dmv , the one thing that will determine if you 're leaving with a license , is the attendant that serves you . unfortunately for me , i had the pleasure of dealing with the most unpleasant , rude , miserable attendant . penndot makes it so difficult to get a license with all this documentation and that verification , the least they can do is hire people who want to be there and know the value of customer service . i always feel defeated when i leave the dmv .	2408
0	the food has no flavour . just basic salt and pepper . i would not eat here again . have been to the restaurant 5 times .	89
0	i just started getting my nails done at this salon . the first visit went really well nails did n't last as long as others but i decided to give them a second chance . second visit a nail chipped after 3 days went to get it fixed btw they guarantee they will last 2'weeks . as he finishes up fixing the nail he tells me that this time no charge next time we charge ! i wo n't be returning !	3842
0	looks like all of the good reviews have gone to their head at this place ! jason and ryan came out last fall and did a wonderful job pruning , etc . called them to come back this spring and no response after first call . after second call , i was told they could only come on a monday . i work mondays , and left a message what days would work for me . never heard back from them ! after 3 calls , nothing . very unreliable and unaccommodating..	2139
1	these wonderful people saved my hair . if you want to go to a regis salon , i highly recommend this one over any other . everyone is so friendly and inviting . they really know what they 're doing and they take time to find out what you want . i had a great experience and am very happy with the result .	2963
0	if you want your car jacked up . come to this holiday inn we 're is the security guard . sleeping on the job . feels like compton or watts . thank you holiday inn .	3832
1	fun souvenir from vegas ! i got the kim kardashian sucker stem and the green apple sucker . i am going to be staying at the paris next week so i will try another flavor . fun but pricey little suckers !	2021
0	this place is tasty but you will wait an excessive amount of time for your order . the restaurant is managed by high schoolers / early college age staff . they are experts at quoting inaccurate times as well as being generally rude to customers . you would expect fine customer service at the biltmore but unfortunately whoever owns this establishment takes no pride in customer service or their staff .	1011
0	after reading the review from the zarina i want to give them a try . my experience from them is try to rip us off from $ 20 to $ 35 , cold water , the owner is on the phone all the time while giving us the service . i wo n't recommend anyone to come here .	735
0	god damn their burgers are dry . their hot dogs and fries were just bland . there are way better burgers and fries elsewhere in montreal . hell.. walk to five guys on the same street . the only positive thing about this place is that it 's open late and right next to a strip club . it belongs on crescent street with the rest of the tourist trap places .	1280
0	make that minus one star . even worse than the food is the lame manager . whoever owns this particular village inn , or if it 's company owned , needs to get their butts in there and make some drastic changes . hopefully this will be called to their attention , sooner rather than later .	672
0	ok.. so let 's start with walking in . there was trash on the floor and i almost turned around . but urged by my husband..we walked in . out of the bread i wanted , no pepper jack cheese , no olives . and here it is the middle of the day . seriously.. your just out like out ? do n't you make bread all day ? ca n't you thaw cheese ? and to top it off the cashier threw the receipt at my husband . not cool . i 'll never go back . and i 'd love to speak to the manager !	216
0	the grooming service here has been terrible twice . our first groom was great but after that , the groomer completely disregarded what we asked for and chose their own haircut . our puppy came home looking like an ant eater with a full body of hair and a completely shaved snout , head , and ears . the groomers here are untrained and unprofessional . we should have never paid for the cut and i would never take any pet here for grooming ever again .	1864
1	this place definitely deserve more than 3 stars . we started with the shrimp and pork rolls . they were large and very good . the peanut dipping sauce was very good , too . my wife got the chicken pho and i got the rare breed and tripe . both were very good . the broth was tasty and full of umami . the vietnamese coffee was great , too . the service was fast and friendly .	784
1	7/12/14 @ 12:15 had lunch here ! everyone & everything was on point . i 've had so many bad experiences at mc donalds but for these guys i decided to make a yelp account just for this ! chicken nuggets and fries were perfectly crispy and the whole drive through crew was amazingly nice and they got our order right which is a gigantic plus in my book . thanks for making our stay in vegas even better ! going again today ! hehehe	904
1	lyle removed 6 very large maple trees from our property . all six were in close proximity to our home and required great expertise to take down . lyle took them down with care , ground the stumps and left the lawn without any damage . i recommend lyle to anyone who is looking for professional tree removal . he is excellent .	2766
1	i walked in on a saturday and was almost overwhelmed with the number of people waiting to get their nails done . it was my graduation and i was n't going to let that stop me from getting pretty nails . i was surprised that i only waited 20 minutes . i loved how comfortable the chairs were with the massage settings and the aromas used in the water . the staff was very friendly . the basic spa pedicure is only $ 20 and she added a few rhinestones and flowers on my big toes for only $ 5 more . they looked so amazing . i definitely recommend this place .	2297
0	i bought 20 times classes and only be able to use up 5 times because it 's very hard to book a class online , it 's always fully booked . and the schedule for beginner class is very limited . i think only the people who 're not working during day will be able to sign up the class there . not recommend at all .	3440
1	this is good food . flavored naans are well flavored . the chicken makhani and lamb tikaa were excellent , and distinitctly flavored . some places seem to use the same spices in everything . not this place . they have an extensive wine list . the service was wonderful .	1497
0	such a horrible experience . first they deplane us because they have a flat tire then again because their engine does n't work . get your shit together and make some planes that can actually run . no wonder it 's so cheap..their planes do n't work	3127
0	this place is not good . one of the worst pizza places - worse than frozen , worse than peter piper . generic crust with no flavor . actually everything is pretty generic and bland . one of the worst i have ever had . also there is no indoor seating . it is just a delivery/ take out place which wasnt clear on the site . for good pizza try setabello ( restaurant ) or alexanders on tropicana ( just delivery/take out but tasty )	1399
0	this place is a total ripoff . my manifold gasket needed to be replaced . they quoted me 1600.00 . when i told the service technician i would shop around , he popped an attitude . i shopped around and got it done for 1000.00 ! along with other minor work . when i went in for an oil change , it was supposed to be 49.00. turned out to be over 150.00 . they lost my business .	2711
1	the lunch specials are a really good deal . $ 6.95 for a nice selection of pad thais , curries and other meats and vegetable dishes . plus it includes rice , soup and a spring roll . chicken pad thai is awesome and so is the red curry . mongolian beef was nothing special but the curry and pad thai is more than enough to keep coming back .	826
1	such a beautiful baseball field and comfy seats . lots of parking available and signs clearly posted if you 're in a foul ball zone . i love their score board and how clean everything is .	330
1	this one 's always super busy and hence , the shelves are not always stocked well enough to accommodate the volume of customers . that 's about my only complaint . other than that , i always shop here before walmart because they are closer and pretty much seem to have what i need . i prefer the flamingo/215 store though !	583
1	oh my gosh ! what a great time ! ! ! this show has me smiling and laughing with my friend the entire time . i loved every part of it ! so interactive and fun to watch . the guys are all beautiful looking . and you can pay $ 20 at the end to take a picture with them . totally worth it . phones are only allowed at one point of the show so you have to disconnect and enjoy yourself .	2149
0	took my computer in for a battery replacement and the computer would n't boot up after they looked at it . for $ 150 they would repair the software . wo n't let them go near any of my electronics again .	607
1	it 's a good place . i admire that regardless that they are never very busy they keep offering fresh seafood . that 's what keeps me coming back . if one day they stop serving fresh food i 'll never return . keep trying diy . we know it 's hard !	129
1	excellent service . easy access to the cars . personnel ( david ) were helpful , personal and interested in serving my needs well . i was a bit concerned about going with a car rental agency that i 'd never used . payless did n't dissappoint and i shall seek them out in the future . go payless !	3595
0	absolutely terrible . dr. zak is very unprofessional and hateful . there is a difference between 'not sugar coating things ' and being completely inappropriate . i went to her through my entire pregnancy and aftercare but i have had enough . she is terrible and has zero bedside manner and refuses to answer questions or help . you always wait at least an hour to see her because she 's `` running late '' . if i could give zero stars i would . i will never return to that office again and i hope no other woman has to go through it either . do not go here if you are pregnant .	1925
0	nice staff but horrible dentist . they told me i had to pay 80 $ out of pocket for a cavity since insurance would not cover it . then they bill be for 200 $ for a cavity . then to top it all of they did n't fill it right causing me to drive a half a hour away to get it filled at there other office 2 more times . save your time and money and go somewhere else .	3003
1	great salads , and gimger tea . large dining room , seat yourself , order at the counter , food ready when buzzer vibrates and lights up . great for groups , or small gatherings . casual atmosphere	1259
1	went there for an oil change recently . did n't know if there 's going to be a wait time so i called ahead and make an appointment . in and out of the store in under 30 minutes . great service and friendly staffs .	2552
1	so i was in desperate need of a haircut after growing my hair out for a year . called true aveda and got an appointment that day with liv . we hit it off right away . she is such a nice and fun person and comes from a family of hair designers . she did exactly what i asked and her suggestions were spot on . definitely will be seeing her again ! ! thanks liv ! i 'd give you 10 if i could !	335
1	i love their donuts . they are the best ! i do n't go anywhere else for donuts after having tried these honestly . 10/10 would recommend .	3322
1	the owner is so awesome ! we ordered a coonan 357 mag . it was such a great experience that i do n't believe we will go anywhere else . one of my hobbies is guns , so i will be back to pick up the smith and wesson governor . i have complete trust with them and feel like if there is ever a gun they do n't carry , he will bend over backwards to get what we want . his shop is santa 's workshop and he is the firearm santa .	3855
1	amazing service and very inexpensive . my driver was the kindest gentleman ever . he waited for me to get my luggage as i was about 5 minutes over the set time but did not charge me extra . we got to the airport on time for $ 30 from utopia rd and 32nd street . i even gave him a $ 5 tip .	3142
0	menu was limited . their sauces were watered down . their prices are a bit expensive compared to dt 's . sorry but we ca n't help but compare since they are not too far from each other . the chicken inasal portion is small for that price . kinda like eating jollibee chicken that are small compared to a kfc . their lechon is not that good either . probably was not that fresh when it was served coz it 's not crunchy	658
0	being a first time patient , asking for your drivers license and insurance card and then tell you to have a seat and theyll return it to you asap ! a few minutes later get called back into one of the rooms come out 45 minutes later not realizing that they had never returned it and getting home and go to get your license and realize they still have it ! then advertise your open till 7 o'clock and at 20 after six are closed . so that really was in a very good first impression and actually may be my last considering the fact that i had to drive around without a license and met up with outta town friends with no license !	297
0	this was my first time at his office , i informed the dr that i was having problems focusing . after talking to me for 10 mins , the dr gave me a prescription for bi-polar disorder . that he wanted to see me again next month . i do n't think i will be turning in the prescription . my family has no history of bi-polar disorder , i do n't think you can know something that serious in such a short amount of time . i will not be returning.. i paid $ 150 upfront .	3928
1	very pretty property , well taken care of . i especially love the pool area , it 's so relaxing . at night it is well lit so i feel comfortable parking spots are covered and close to my front door so i 'm not lugging my poorly planned grocery shopping too far the girls in the office are always so friendly and do everything they can to make me feel welcome , comfortable and at home	2684
0	service was absolutely horrible . we came for lunch . made an order using their ipad . at first we received items that we had n't ordered like soup or such . and we told the waiter and he simply said `` just eat it '' we just ignored that and told him we wo n't eat it and do n't want to be charged for leaving it . then as we waited a whole bunch of rolls came in but none of which we ordered ! ! ! they just threw random food on our table and thought we 'd eat just about anything they gave us .	1231
1	awesome customer service ! i have to shout out tuesday and dorothea for being very awesome and understanding . i put on a shirt i recently purchased and it ripped on me . they were able to return it for me an order me a new shirt online because they did not have my size in the store . i want to think tuesday for helping me feel at ease and comfortable after freaking out because my favorite shirt ripped . & i want to thank dorothea for always being so lovely to me when i 'm in the store . will always continue to shop at this location	3650
0	if you come to las vegas club make sure you bring your own drink i put in over 100 in slot and still not cocktails . poor service at best . again tonight no cocktail waitress and no service i 'm back tonight and men 's restroom is bad .	3630
0	i had the chimichanga and it was n't very good . the seasoning was bland and l was looking for some bold authentic flavor . it tasted like a subway version of a chimichanga .	1137
0	never again will l dine there , my order was totally wrong . the manager who was extremely rude and to be honest racist , wanted me to still pay for the food , which i ultimately didn't.i just paid for the drink i had.that was my first time , and definitely the last time i 'll ever eat there .	890
1	this is my favorite go to phô restaurant ! they never fail me everytime ! very good service , very cozy place and very good food ! their grilled beef ribs just melts in your mouth , and their phô are the best ! i would recommend this to all my friends !	673
1	consistently delicious ! we love to get the gotham minus sausage and beef add ham ! a large pizza and domenico salad feeds 4 perfectly ! the complimentary bread to start is delicious and i often wish i could go just for that !	192
0	this place use to be good but not anymore . the young kid claimed to be a manager is totally unprofessional . when i purchased 4 tires from them , i also purchased nitrogen fill up . when i went to the store the fill my tire the manager claimed that the machine is not ready and i have to wait for 30 mins . in addition , he only check the tire that showed low and refused to check the other 3 tires . this happened today 8/6/2018 .	2123
1	i 've been visiting this location for years . always professional , quick and lovely decor . nisha is my go to brow tech and she 's always great with her customers . i 've been to several threaders and by far all of the ladies here are the best !	2630
1	yum ! yum ! i 'm officially addicted to their apricot tarts , so good , better thank anywhere else and cheaper too . their sandwiches remind me of paris , and their almond croissant is the best !	397
1	the veggie pizza is killer ! i 'm addicted to their pizza sauce . the salad bar is always on point , a little pricey but if you go on wed 's it 's a bit less . vegan chocolate chip cookies are the best . awesome local , organic produce ! have you seen their pumpkins ? !	433
1	i went to a movie and spent one dollar . that 's really all that needs to be said . a lot of the same females who complain if there is a dark spot under a rug in their $ 20 airbnb room complain about this theater . if you want a $ 13.50 experience , harkins is just around the corner . if you 're really going to be a cry baby about popcorn prices and how the place is not immaculate , you need to grow up and shut up .	3927
0	i will say if you have stomach issues and or have n't been eating out often , to possibly avoid eating here . i 've had stomach cramps going on day number two , after eating here . my daughter has had a flare up , as well as my husband . the food is tasty but filled with grease and too much sodium content . if you 're use to eating out then this may not affect you . if you suffer from ibs , crohn 's disease and or have other stomach sensitivities this would not be ideal for you .	1264
1	this is a really great little place . it is the first nail place i 've been to since moving to north royalton . their staff is very friendly and the prices are very affordable . $ 27 including tax for a shellac and manicure . despite my badly damaged nails ( from a prolonged ohio winter and my bad biting habit , ) she gave me a nice manicure without making my hangnails bleed . she cleaned up my cuticles and hangnails , and they feel and look much better . i will be back for sure .	3444
0	they charge $ 225 to mail in a british passport application that you can do online or mail in yourself . these guys are scam artists .	2698
1	they have a good selection of things ! the lady is super helpful and she asked us if we were looking for anything in particular.. we happened to be looking for a canopy and a car bike rack . she took us to where she had the canopies and explained them to us . then she spent some time looking for the bike rack that was posted online but no luck finding it.. but every helpful and took lots of time to help even with other people in the store . we will be back for sure ! !	692
0	they just lost a long standing customer over an expired coupon . 50 % off a salad is $ 3.50 . we spent over $ 100 week there . service and quality have gone downhill lately anyway . the iced tea is often not replenished . very poor customer service decision to not honor a coupon . i 'm done with this place . judging from the number of patrons ; i 'm sure this place will be closing soon . they have already cut back on their hours as well .	875
0	after a few years and maybe six visits i wo n't go back . it 's easily noticed the quality has cheapened up and just not same . the chicken fried chicken , no where near as good as years ago . first hardly warm and on this huge oval plate by itself with small amount of already congiled gravy . just not appealing ... we had a party of ten easy orders and two waitresses did n't quite nail it if you know what i mean . i was obviously paying bill and my service was terrible not even a refill ? until i asked ! 119.99 for ten to eat is ok with half ordering water but just not same food quality ... sorry !	1542
1	purchased jump time here by mistake and glad i made that mistake ! we had a great time ! we came late afternoon on a monday so it was n't too busy . the kids loved it and the staff was very friendly and accommodating . my daughter loved the rock climbing wall and there was plenty to do . plus the prices are cheaper than skyzone . definitely coming back !	1095
0	terrible service . regularly cheat customers and then manager will defend practice . by `` regularly , '' i mean three weeks in a row . shameful . plus , food is garbage . never again !	496
1	i 've eaten here several times , every time is good . there 's a counter for fast service , great oyster shooters , & good seafood	1255
1	delicious burgers ... ..and friendly folks ! they will definitely see us again . great neighborhood bar .	1150
0	these ladies need a lesson in sense of urgency . start to finish it took me 20 minutes to order and receive my drink . pick up the pace . people have flights to catch . terrible .	3124
0	unbelievably bad experience with the reservation desk . in my 25 years plus of travel , no reservation transaction has ever been worse . we tried booking for part of a wedding block . after asking to speak with a manager twice and being put on hold twice , i got hung up on . it looks like we 'll be staying elsewhere . the hotel might be great but if they ca n't even book a room correctly , i worry about a place where i 'm going to spend my hard earned $ $ $ . customer service here is horrible .	1691
0	the young man who took my order was indifferent and i had to clarify multiple times . it took awhile to get our food , which was understandable because it was quite busy . i ordered an iced latte becuase i noticed the steamwand on the espresso machine was coated in dried milk residue . that is disgusting , and you would think it would be standard to sanitize the wand and steam residual milk out afterward . in the end i recieved butter instead of the cream cheese i paid for . next time i 'm visiting for the holidays i 'll make sure to go to another location .	3372
0	i guess i have an unpopular opinion here but the sushi was not good . we ordered like 8 special rolls between the two of us and i could n't find anything i liked . the rolls were average . everything was drenched in sauces . i 'm not opposed to that if pulled off right but it was not right in this case . i could n't taste the ingredients . just the sauces . might as well just give me the sauce bottles and i 'll go to town on them , harry and lloyd style . the place is nice and clean and the service is friendly and attentive , but i just did n't enjoy the food .	626
0	this place has awful service . my family and i were extremely disappointed . the food was decent but will not go back as the girl that served us was super rude and impolite . she was impatient and basically threw our dishes across our table . i 'd give them 2 stars for the quality of their food but none for service .	1062
0	i have eaten here numerous times . never had a bad experience , until today . met a friend for lunch . i had the french pantry sandwich . the chicken was so overcooked and tough , i could n't even bite into it . had to resort to a knife and fork . still had trouble cutting it . the flavor was ok , but i was very disappointed in the overall sandwich . i only ate about 1/3 of it ... . not sure i will be returning here . there are so many other wonderful restaurants in our area .	1458
1	the service here was great ! you always hear the horror stories about going to a dealership and having the pesky salesmen follow and harass you . this definitely was n't the case for me . i arrived and was treated great ! they went through the options i could afford and found the best deal for me ... .i ended up purchasing a car that day . it has now been a month and a half and i had to call about a question ... they still remembered me and were very nice and helpful . i definitely recommend this place if you 're looking to purchase your next vehicle . jeff and barry are great !	2816
1	great concept , it 's the most `` fun '' ice cream i 've had . the ice cream itself however is only as good as the mix-ins you choose . my husband pinpointed that it 's a mix between coldstone and dairyqueen in flavor . if i 'm going to be hustled through a line like angelina jolie herself is serving ice cream , that stuff better be amazing ...	3813
1	foods decent and the service is fast . totally worth going if ur looking for something healthy and fresh : )	701
1	the food is great and the prices are reasonable . they give you a nice amount of food for what you pay for .	1459
0	farmers markets here in az seem to be more of a craft fair . very limited in the produce department . but what they do have is good and those working their booths are polite and helpful . like the tamales . tasty variety . parking was the pits , but it seems they 've modified that situation a bit .	1500
1	spent a few hours shopping for furnishings . our strategy was to shop one day and buy the next . we found more than we expected well below our budget and purchased living room and bedroom furniture ... all of it . the staff was helpful and guided as to all we needed and worked to get us the best possible deal . we have many ashley pieces and love the design and quality . but the service we received at this store put our experience over the top . give these guys a try . you wo n't be disappointed !	1442
0	ignored by a guy who walked from the counter to mess around in the coolers and another who was gabbing with the ( only other ) two customers at a table . cook spoke up only to tell one of the employees that the food he was cooking was ready . i just walked out .	1160
1	best place to watch sporting events , attentive and friendly staff , and the truffle pizza is so damn good .	456
0	this place sucked . the people seemed to be mostly older . age 35 and up . the younger ones were mostly ugly and or fat . the had a dance floor and a dj . the music choice sucked . it was rap and country . it was almost to get service since i was n't a regular . i would not bring friends here unless they were old or ugly .	2894
1	my husband and i absolutely love this place ! ! their food is amazing , always tons of flavor ! we have tried other indian spots , but this one is a notch above the rest . we especially love the vindaloo and the chili naan . awesome !	1497
0	we just moved from nyc , so we were in search of a `` go to '' thai restaurant . unfortunately , the search continues as mai thai ii did not meet our expectations . pros : friendly staff , relatively large portions . cons : food was unremarkable .	50
1	stopped in after work for a friday treat ... a much needed pedicure . very reasonable prices $ 20 for a pedicure and it includes about a five minute massage and hot stones . employees were friendly and took their time to ensure the finished product turned out flawless . this place is n't fancy just the basics exactly what you would want from a $ 20 pedicure clean friendly and quick but not too quick . will be back !	1661
1	obscurity galore . from video games , to vinyl to my favorite , vhs . they have the best collection of vhs tapes i have ever seen . helpful staff , they have been around since 2001 . highly recommended if you 're into niche and obscure media .	2734
1	best club ever , best staff , amazing service , dj is awesome , nice crowd . could n't ask for more , if your looking for a place to go on mondays friday 's or saturdays blvd 44 is the place to be . love it	2200
0	dry , salty , ribs ... tasteless fries.. uncooked vegetables and the list goes on.. overpriced and service takes forever . place looks great but the food is a zero . i 'm definitely not going back .	149
1	this place is an old timey place in a face paced world . i highly recommend the gordon square .	3604
1	you cant beat the price ! $ 3 with promo.. free wash cloth and air freshener ! vacuum works good ! nice and clean place ! 5 star for price and service	2093
1	very nice hotel . convenient to the airport and downtown charlotte , nc . you do have to be mindful of your surrounding . some break in of cars in the parking lot have being reported . excellent breakfast everyday with a very helpful staff . all the rooms have been updated giving each room a very clean very upscale feel !	2540
0	if i could give them zero stars i would . i would never recommend this company to anyone . they damaged my brand new bedroom furniture , took a chunk out of my door jamb , put a hole in my wall and did not cover any of the furniture . when i asked them to cover it they said they can not grab the furniture if it 's covered . when i told them that they damaged the furniture they said it was like that . i told them it was absolutely not it is brand new ! my bed that they put together is falling apartment . i should have read the reviews before booking with them .	370
1	i 'm very shocked at the reviews . i got the platinum wash and my car is spotless ! will definitely be coming back !	3899
0	i was ignored , when staff condecend to work with me , i got a extremely high estimate , and it occurred to me my business was not wanted . why be arrogant .	3501
0	def not going back . capers were stale in the beef carpaccio and the clams in the spaghetti were so fishy and not fresh . nice ambiance but the food lacks .	1204
0	i have eatten take out from here 3-4 times and i have not been impressed . i really like chinese and thai food but this just does n't measure up . i swear i got sick from it one time .	474
1	recently visited this salon to get my nails done due to not being satisfied at my prior nail salon . i was greeted here in a very friendly manner and assisted right away ! everyone in the salon was very friendly , and i was in and out with getting my acrylic nails with gel done ! they looked fantastic , and lasted a good two weeks before i needed them re-done ! i highly recommend this place , and be sure to bring cash with you to tip the nail technician !	3441
1	really fun place and the staff are funny and friendly . tried their medium and hard rooms , came out 1 win and 1 loss . they recently gave out $ 800 dollars in cash prizes in their grand opening give away . also for bday parties that booked a room in advance the birthday person got to play the room for free and even got a box of hostess cupcakes ! i would highly receommend this place puzzles are fun and challenging and they made sense and tied into the room nicely great attention to customers experience	3088
1	from friendly , quick , and efficient customer service to delicious food , kofusion brings a lot to the table in the sushi bar industry . on top , most of the staff are college students , creating a very comfortable , student-friendly aura . highly recommend !	912
0	of the 3 scheduled appointments i have made to this banfield , they have been at minimum 30 minutes late each time ( the longest being an hour ) . again , these were not walk-ins but scheduled appointments . once , i can understand , stuff happens . but three times and you 've got a systemic problem that needs addressing . i wish i could say that it 's due to incredible bedside service . but i suspect that it 's due to poor scheduling and staff utilization .	3094
0	the most skinniest burritos i 've ever tried . i would only recommend this place if you want to have a bad impression of texmex food . although stuff is friendly , their friendliness disappears as soon as they serve you those micro portions . i hope one day oakville gets a burrito boys in town . there are not the best , but at least they 're descent with their portions .	1474
0	blech ! ordered 4 pizzas . the `` good karma '' was inedible ... piled high with spinach gone bad . the special of the day `` mexican '' pizza was way too cheddary . the `` buddha bomb '' was ok and the `` presto pesto '' was the best of the bunch . the crust was the worst we 've ever had . pics online show a wood-oven type thin chewy crust but in reality the crust on my 4 pizzas was an unleavened , cracker-type crust with visible fork holes . the worst meal we 've had in the city since moving here 1.5 years ago .	754
0	so this time we take our truck in for a rattle in the door . they tell us , `` if you turn your bass down it wo n't rattle . '' we listen to talk radio and the door rattles . you ca n't make this up . i could go on and on ...	307
0	bodyheat tanning is a joke . the beds are hot , the fans do n't work , they smell funky , and are out of date . and never have a towel available . over priced and under deliver . their spray tans are sticky and gross . the color is orange-ish . and it 's impossible to cancel your membership . they 'll actually tell you to fight it through your credit card company . never ever ever getting my business again .	1314
0	if this is the best burger in na , then the usa is n't in north america . i can name several burger chains that well best this place what a burger , five guys , smash burgers . our waitress was horrible and it was expensive . skip this place for sure . lunch time friday and it was empty , i missed that clue	1280
0	more impressed by the atmosphere inside than with the taste of the treats : ( i had a rootbeer float , and while the ice cream was tasty , the root beer did n't have the fizz or intense flavor that a regular bottle of root beer would have . the 3 other taste testers at the table agreed . although the dairy-free chocolate shake was good , and the other vegan enjoyed her dairy-free ice cream sundae . will still go back to give the other desserts a try .	3604
0	sad experience . they used to care more , it does not feel safe to live there anymore . high crimes and vandalism is the most discouraging factor along with the lack of flexibility on the management part .	2426
0	advertise they test batteries , showed up to have a battery test and he declined to come outside due to short staff . after i got in my car i saw about 12 employees parade out . poor service and false advertisement .	3455
0	i 've been here 6 times . gourmet hot dogs okay at a fair price , but i would prefer steve hot dogs they tasted better but it 's no longer around . service is great some days and below average simedays . the weekend is busy and crowded with groupies from bands with the music set to loud . excellent atmosphere when bands not thier and service is better probably due to staff not having a pounding headache .	1407
0	if i could give them negative i would . i hate pink and roses ! went out for my birthday dinner last night and my husband was trying to be sweet and surprise me with flowers at our table . he picked out white tulips and got an arrangement of white roses with pink roses and pink tulips . it seriously ruined my night because i thought he did it to be an asshole since he has known for 9 years that exactly what was there is something that hits a bad vibe in my heart and had me on a bad mood the rest of the night which should 've been fun and magically . thank you az florist for ruining my birthday !	38
1	we were pleasantly surprised by this place . just a caveat : we did not eat the japanese food or the sushi , we tried their new chinese menu . we had the szechuan chicken and the ma po tofu and we thought both were tasty , mildly spicy and fresh . this is a small shop , so plan to share ; all the dishes do n't come out at the same time , which is a little inconvenient if you 're going to wait for everyone to get an individual dish.space is small , with an open kitchen , and there 's nothing fancy about it , but the price is right and we really enjoyed it . will definitely be back .	1014
0	waited 45 minutes for a personal banker during my lunch break only to be told to come back at 2:30 . then got another call saying it has to be moved to 4 . either hire more personal bankers or make it clearly appointments only . staff was friendly , service extremely poor .	3202
0	two members of our party which dined here at dinner got very sick and threw up the entire night . will not return , and would not recommend this place .	206
1	for under 45 dollars you can not beat this place , the rooms are clean , the staff was nice , the location was off the freeway , there were a few other hotels but decided on staying in this one , it is close to a few restaurants and bars , and i think a shopping mall area , not too sure . rooms were comfortable , showers were spacious and also clean . no complaints here at all . so if your need a good sleep and your near this place , give them a try .	2599
0	noon on saturday and sooo slow inside and at drive up . wound up bailing from drive through because it was taking too long . tried inside but no better . left without ordering	1460
0	ordered chicken tikka masala through uber eats . serving size seemed smaller than average . at first , i thought i was just deceived by the small cup packaging they used . in the end i had to cook some extra chicken to add to even get full . taste was decent to good , but the chicken was inconsistent . some pieces were good while others were as hard as leather . honestly , i 'm just really disappointed by the delivery experience . no rice , utensil , or napkins . for $ 15 i expected a slightly bigger portion and at least some rice to go with it .	1497
1	pretty fun for kids here . they are here every year and my kids love it . you can purchase tickets here and use it next year . they have things like bounce house , tons of pumpkins in different sizes , slides , a petting zoo ( with baby goats , chickens , bunnies and few lambs . .. i personally do n't like these lol ) . the staff are so nice and location is a decent size . i advise everyone wearing tennis shoes and socks ( lots of slides requires socks ) because you ate walking on hay .	1900
1	i highly recommend gino who helped us through the process of getting our teen son started on guitar . gino was friendly , knowledgeable , able to beautifully demo the instruments , and set us up with exactly what we hoped to find . we would definitely go back for future purchases and would recommend this location to others . thanks gino !	3602
1	first time i been here , and i was very welcomed . i got a fresh fade from gregg , this is definitely my new barber shop ! it was a little pricey , $ 20 but it was well worth it .	3469
0	doctors are gteat , but the support staff and scheduling staff lack organization . constantly making a mess of things . it is impossible to call and actually talk to a person . leave a message and 10 percent of the time they will call you back	2845
0	they completely took advantage of my wife ! all we wanted was a basic wash and vacuuming and they charged us $ 120 ! i called the manager and he just said he 'd wax the car and throw in a few free car washes . thanks not what we wanted . we wanted to be charged a fair price for the work done , which was a basic wash and vacuum . i 'll never be back , and i 'll let anyone in the neighborhood know how sleazy they were to us .	3899
1	i have gone to the restaurant twice so far . i 've tried their pad thai , malaysian curry with roti , and tom yum . they are all pretty good . their shakes are good as well . i have n't tried their pho yet . i 've managed to get seated right away the times i 've gone . the service is as expected . it 's passable . the decor is not there . the water tastes kinda funny . overall , i would go back for lunch .	331
0	i ordered from cafe mezcal through foodora , and it has taken them 3 hours to get us our food , they wo n't even pick up the phone , what kind of business are you guys running ? never ordering from you again !	332
0	they will ask for a higher tip if you give them anything less than $ 15 . i gave the lady $ 11 and she said she wanted $ 15 to $ 20 . i will not come back here anymore . the massage quality is standard with all other places . i do n't like the lack of integrity .	2399
0	i have been to this restaurant many times and several have been bad experiences with the server . they need to find someone who cares about the service they provide to the customer ! i wo n't be going back again ... i think i have given them enough chances . also if the menu says you have domestic beer , have it stocked .	927
1	i 'm so sad ... out favorite chinese restaurant in the valley has closed . : ( we drove all the way from goodyear to eat dinner and when we arrived we found tott 's closed with only a sign that said `` closed relocating '' . we almost started crying as we dream about tott 's and look forward to making the trek across town for their terrific food . i sure hope they open back up ( maybe in goodyear ? ? ? ) . : )	474
1	good spreads from what i can tell of the other exchange places nearby . that and i have to say , the tellers were wonderful people . that and they were open early when i needed them and late when i was thinking about it as well . i gave repeat business based on that . thanks much ! : )	1377
1	love this location , it was close to my job and i 'd go in often . sometimes you go in and out quickly other times you wait about 2 hours . i still like this location , the staff is awesome , especially the girl with the cool short haircut ! i wish i remembered her name she was always so funny and easy going and just a great person overall . i 'm sad i wont be able to go to this location anymore because my job changed .	2940
0	hugely disappointing ! ! ! ! ok ... we went here just because it was rated the # 1 restaurant on trip adviser . wait to be seated ... awesome ... service ... unreal . food ... bleh . we ordered 2 different entrees and an appetizer ... honestly..we did n't finish them ... we told the server we were not able to eat them ... he apologized . we actually got dessert ... since we were still hungry ... after not eating ! it was good..some sort of pineapple cake . overall ... i wo n't go back .	1534
0	great building . great views . great atmosphere . great location . the only reason its a 1 star is because of the management in this building . its horrible . very rude and not polite . i have been living here for a year now and cant wait to leave . other high rises you should check out is turnberry towers and panorama . stay away .	1034
1	shamika is amazing ! ! she always does an amazing job with color , cut and brazilian blow out ! she always listens to what i want and exceeds my expectations ! i 'm so glad i finally found an amazing salon that has great services , atmosphere and hair products ( fave 4 my favorite )	2577
1	this is the best bar in the area - not over priced . they have pool tables and a juke box . drinks are made correctly as ordered the first time and they do n't up sell you the crap you do n't want . this is my `` hole in the wall '' bar . i would pick this place before all others in the area . the crowd is always decent too , everyone just having a good time .	1285
1	best customer service ive gotten at an einsteins in the valley ! the employee who took my order was a friendly young man who was polite and actually looked at me when i placed my order . the gentleman at the register called me by name , was extremely pleasant and offered $ 1 off my coffee for using my own commuter cup . i am so glad i did not let my bad experiences at other einstein 's in the valley keep me from trying this one . i 'll go back again , especially since it is so close to my office .	3372
0	my husband and i went furniture shopping today..we were in the oakwood store for approximately 45 minutes without any customer service . as we were leaving the sales reps where huddled at the front of the store . mind you we had cash in hand and needless to say they did not get my business . ..instead i went a few miles down the road to a little place in twinsburg . .great customer service and my furniture will be delivered tomorrow .	3553
1	my go to place for thai basil close to home . never a wait and they have everything i need and then some . great store !	2965
1	cassandra ramos is your stylist ! she is wonderful and very sweet , . she will make sure you leave happy and looking stylish . cassandra is an organic hair color specialist , which i love because it is much more healthier than other color brands . give it a try !	1130
1	yes , this is as good as it gets ! dr. dameron and his team make going to the dentist actually a really good experience ! the whole staff is very professional , kind and accommodating . not to mention happy ! the hygienists are just the best , as are all the staff . dr. dameron 's work is beautifully done and my teeth have never looked or felt better . i highly recommend this whole office to anyone needing work done ! you will not be disappointed .	3245
0	i 've been going to this place for over a year now and it 's always been ok . however , last time i went , they have raised their prices significantly . then the waiter came to take our order and we told him to give us a few minutes to decide . 25 minutes later and he never came back , so i wo n't be back . too much competition in the restaurant industry to put up with this ! also the place could use a serious remodel .	325
0	quaker s & l is busy , loud and has fairly good wings , expensive but good steaks , and trite `` motor head '' repro decor . there are better restaurants for the money .	1487
1	at first sight its kind of grubby , but once you settle in its quite cozy . the floor has great seating , a little cluttered but close enough to the stage . food is decent and price is fair . tickets 15 bucks . comedians are great and witty . after the show you can play pool out front , which they stayed open later . the front could have better seating or be more inviting . i 've been here a couple of times and will go again .	2144
1	the food here is great , my service was amazing . i came here a couple years ago and had the rudest waiter . i do n't remember the name of my most recent waiter , but he was very polite and checked on me frequently without disturbing my meal . although they were under construction , the restaurant possessed a clean atmosphere .	520
0	i used to enjoy coming to this location . i think they must have changed management . i only visit about once every 2-3 months for staff meeting food . the energy is low with the employees . the manager has an apparent sour attitude . i seen her and another employee giving each other a look while serving a customer that may have been a little indecisive . it was very unprofessional . the other employee was not happy to be there herself . there is a few employees that are wonderful and they would be the only reason i would return .	1214
1	friendly baristas , drive-thru service is *mostly* quick , but the store does tend to run out of favorite pastries on occasion . overall , a solid sbux if you 're in the area and do n't like getting out of the car . do n't forget to flash your smartphone starbucks e-card to gather your gold stars !	2778
0	oh , yeah and if you yelp about them , even though their service sucks , they would term you as a bogus reviewer or disgruntled employee . why would anyone want to hire them let alone work for such a company ! ugh ! their `` filtered '' reviews were probably posted by themselves . who knows ! btw my name is not jorge ! look at my other reviews , i like my anonymity , but give honest feedback . get professional , penguin air , clean up your act first . instead of bullying the customers who give not-so-positive feedback , it would be nice if this was taken as constructive feedback and addressed . oh well ...	2203
0	i waited an hour , for ubereats delivery ( which was originally supposed to take less than 40 minutes ) only for the restaurant to cancel my order , 12 minutes before they close at 8:48pm . this also made it more difficult to find something else that was open . they should n't accept an order , then cancel it an hour later . not okay .	640
1	cca is a great little school . the staff truly cares about the kids . it was a nice surprise to find a school like this offering a well rounded christian based curriculum so close to home . our little boy loves getting up and going to school every day .	2701
1	just had an awesome experience here . brought my bike in for a front derailleur tune up . figured i would have to leave it over night , but he got me in right away and even gave me some pointers on adjusting it in the future . great service , good price , will definitely be back .	3726
1	surprised my the bad reviews . this location is walking distance to my house so on nights that cooking is not an option i find myself here . food is always fresh and as good as any of the other locations i 've been to . the thing that makes this location stand out are the people that work here are actually really nice ! mcdonald 's is mcdonald 's . not the healthiest and u always hate yourself for eating it but at least the people here are friendly	1489
1	these were probably a top pick for me today , amazing model and floor plans . i wish there was more availability , but it was below my price range !	2426
1	drinks are usually well made here , although the service is very slow , but you can expect that at almost every bbt store late at night .	766
0	i ordered extra rice and i got a half of scoop for $ 1.50 , the salad spilled the sauce all over the rest of the food and smells like feet . i 've ordered delivery a few times from here but this will be the last .	1203
1	got out late this morning and needed something to eat . stopped here since mcdonald 's breakfast is so good . the only issue i had was that the bathrooms were dirty . plus the coffee that i ordered was supposed to be with a carmel flavor . i ordered a large iced carmel latte drink and there was no carmel . one thing that i did like about this mcdonald 's was the team work between the employees and it was genuine and not fake . the general manager was so happy and helpful . she was taking orders and even do the work stuff not barking orders like you see with a lot of managers . this is so rare .	1023
0	had brakes serviced at this location 20 minutes later parts were falling off . return the same day brakes had to be redone spent over 4 hours getting brakes fixed had to return three more times to have brakes repaired at there other location very poor service at this location .	2123
0	their hours are spotty at best . inconsistently open or closed . drive over here and not open with no sign either . also after trying these donuts they are nothing special . just go to winchells instead of paying for these overpriced donuts	3322
0	the employees were super rude and their wigs were not good at all they smelled like barbie hair . this place needs to be shut down .	2826
0	worst place ever.. that joe sucks.. i try to ask for my cut style and he said no time for more explanation.. was totally disaster cut.. i went to another place to get my cut fix.. do to your self a favor.. avoid this place.. really sucks	3469
1	this place is without a doubt one of the if not the best mandarin restaurant in town . they operate like no other . costumer service is so good , they always compliment you and acknowledge you when and if you need something . i 'm glad i came here , it 's like no other experience . trust me and go eat here .	486
0	it was definitely an experience ... some unusual toppings and interesting flavors , but we got 3 pizzas , and each one was an interesting mix of undercooked and burnt . for about $ 13 for a 10 '' pizza , i 'd rather eat at a pizza hut or similar chain restaurant .	282
1	i 'm new to the area , had n't found a dr. yet , and picked this office because of its reviews-i 'm so glad i did because they 're wonderful ! pa david was kind and listened to my concerns while asking questions . the front staff and nurses were very nice and helpful ! i highly recommend them !	297
0	first the tow truck was two hours late . then the tow truck driver recommended me to a `` reputable and fair priced mechanic '' . the mechanic was obviously a friend to him but since i 'm not native to phx and i was obviously distressesed . his mechanic was not either reputable the store barely looked legal and his prices we not cheap . i ended up calling a different tow truck service and having my car serviced by a mechanic i was able to do through research on . do yourself a favor and never use this service .	1607
0	worst pedicure i have ever had . she basically washed my feet and applied nail polish . she did n't even clean up her mistakes . will never go again .	3948
0	my experience went from bad to worse . this place is filthy and the employees are extremely rude . i pawned an item and when i went back to pick it up the place we closed . i went back first thing in the morning to pick up the item . i was told that the finance charge was double for being a day late .	3067
0	went here for my first time today because i have been doing a detox cleanse so a fresh drink was necessary . i ended up getting the weekend warrior . i personally did n't enjoy the drink . did n't have much to offer . i have found many other smoothie places and this is something i would n't recommend .	468
0	roach on the floor . i will post the pic for you or try . we got or money back for the food we had just ordered and they gave it back no prob other then the cook looked a little upset ... glad we saw it and did n't eat the food ... was looking forward to eating here due to reviews.. to bad .	1581
1	absolutely love this place been coming here for 10 plus years . staff nice and prices very reasonable . give them a try , do n't know what 's up with some of these reviews ...	1009
1	fantastic service ( with a smile ) and plenty of items to choose from . while it may not be as popular as giant eagle or target , it allows the local to shop quick and shop efficiently .	3216
0	bad service.had problem with my air conditioner , they sold me parts to fix the problem , that the tech told me that it would work , and it didnt work , so i told the tech so what know , you have to pay for the other part to fix it , so i told the tech to give me back my money on the other part that i didnt need.he got very angry and told me to call the office.very bad service , and i am woman.the are looking to take your money and not help with the problem that you are having , i would tell everybody to stay away from this company.and if you use them be ready to get riped off .	1718
1	i think that this place might be under new management or something . i have seen a lot of bad reviews but i started going here recently , and i actually liked it , the music always has a good beat and is fun to dance to.i was having trouble leaving the dance floor because the dj kept playing such great music . the bouncers were very nice and chit chatted with me while the checked my id . also , the other people that go there are all very cool and easy to talk to and have fun with . down side , the drinks are a little pricey compared to the other places on mill .	2765
1	if you are looking for a day camp this summer , legacy ymca has one of the best ! my daughter attended last year and will be going again this summer . last year , she exercised , swam , went on field trips , and had a great social experience . director kelli is fantastic and will be back again this year ! ca n't beat the hours or the price either !	2072
1	just sent my camera without notification and filling out the camera send in form to c.r.i.s . - called them and they found my dataset and camera within seconds . great service , had really fear it gets lost on this way !	633
0	just one thing to say about scoops : this place smells like cat pee . no joke , it is unmistakeable and just gross . ice cream is not that bad but not very good either . would not waste time or calories here when mitchell 's is so close .	703
0	this review is for the grooming service . asked the groomer to do a complete shave , short everywhere . my dog 's entire face and neck are still covered in fur . she looks terrible ! basically i paid $ 55 for a half-done job . teresa did n't even trim my dog 's nails . they refused to book an appointment for the mistake to be corrected . the girl said that the groomers were separate from the hospital . weird part is that i originally booked the groomers through the hospital . she said i should just wait for the groomers to call when they had a slot open . my poor dog . poor wallet too .	1864
1	i love my walgreen 's pharmacy ! always open , fast . the computer calls me to remind me for refills and i get the 90 day prescriptions to save trips . i went there today for my son with only partial info on his insurance ( no card ) they took care of everything with no hassles and had it filled quick .	1641
0	every single time i 've been here , whoever is at the register seems to have a huge stick up their ass . prices are n't too great for what you get . actually , the food is n't even that good , period . only time i ever think to come here is if i want asada fries . but then i remember how terrible the staff is , and my craving subsides .	857
0	no , i wo n't be shopping there for a while . they refuse to talk to consumers union about offering meat without antibiotics . me thinks not . i get enough antibiotics from the pharmacy . i thought tj 's was a little better than that . oh well .	1930
1	moved in two weeks ago and i am very pleased with the responsivness of the staff and management . i do n't consider myself demanding but i did have some needs upon move in . most have been addressed at this point . haley in the office has been a delight to work with and is always attentive to my whining . there are a lot of new amazing complexes popping up in south charlotte that will give atkins a run for it but for the money the location ca n't be beat ! i 'm glad i chose atkins circle apartments . : )	3467
1	come from the west side of phoenix to chandler to have some boba . good service and fast !	490
1	amazing mac and cheese , great prices overall , and friendly staff !	279
0	i called and spoke with dion , he came to my home and took measurements , spoke with me about what i wanted done and advised me that he would have an estimate for me `` in a couple of days '' . dions scheduled appointment was on 8/25/2018 . i have texted him many times as well as called and have received no response . i would not recommend his services . he can not even respond to a text message and makes unfulfilled arrangements .	2691
1	delicious ! ! ! i am not a hot dog fan , but the amazing combinations and toppings buldogis has to offer has changed my mind . not only that , their kimchi fries are a great side to share with somebody . i am never disappointed or still hungry after eating here !	1566
0	hey blonde haired girl working the shoe return..i am sorry that you clearly hate your job , but because you do , that does not give you the right to huff and puff like the big bad wolf when i go to exchange a small pair of shoes for the next size up . if you are incapable of basic human contact at your place of work perhaps go work in a factory or a graveyard ...	742
0	went only twice . both times the pancakes were burnt and the eggs were not good either . dont think we should have to wait twice to get a simple breakfast .	1319
0	towed my vehicle to a firestone where they left it in the middle of the parking lot . because they did not put it where it was easily visible overnight , like in a parking spot the vehicle was vandalized . right driver 's window was completely smashed out .	3211
0	my experience was ok . there was a bit of a language barrier , but all i wanted was a gel manicure so it was n't too much of a problem . the woman was nice enough and the salon was clean . my problem was with her work . as a professional manicurist , i expect for her to know ( or care ) not to let the polish flood my cuticles . i normally get 2 weeks from a gel mani , i 'll be lucky to get 3 days from this one . disappointing .	3390
0	would n't sell me a battery even though i 'm 31 years old . kind of seems like an odd thing to id someone for	2042
1	found out about efresh meals while walking down the street and someone handed me a card type ting to try it for 10 % off . if you work a lot or eat a lot of takeout and are looking for something quick , easy , fresh and healthier , this is for you . was pretty impressed overall . i will continue to order meal plans from efresh	803
1	the staff is wonderful , accommodating and super friendly . kylie at the front desk always go over & beyond and is a huge asset to the entire practice . and without jenn relph i would be completely lost . she 's a true caregiver . best doctor i 've had in all my years .	297
1	the theaters here are smaller but if you 're averse to large moviegoing crowds , this is the place to go . they may not always show the big blockbuster movies so when they do , this is usually our first theater of choice . the concession stand rarely has long lines and is semi-self service which is great . the theaters are clean , well maintained , & comfortable . i recommend this theater for convenience and comfort .	2000
1	i have always gone to much higher end salons , but was in a jam and happened to be driving in the area.they did such a good job with gel overlay and polish that i now only go there even if its a bit of a drive for me . polish tends to wear off ( 1 month + i can let it go ) have never had chipping or peeling . super happy i tend to ask for lena she is super fast and now knows how i like it done .	3463
1	the pictures do n't do justice . this place is really nice , well decorated . the lobby is a nice place to have some drinks etc . if you like to walk is not far from a lot of the attractions .	1859
1	i like this agency always find good people to work with . yes i recommended , i like this agency i like this office i like heather u like the families	2482
0	i 'm posting this as i am currently waiting in the drive-through for over 15 minutes to get a coffee . i echo the other reviews here . somehow this location has a really hard time moving at a decent pace . if there 's more than one car in the drive-through i 'll never stop again	2358
1	went for our cake tasting and had a very pleasant and welcoming experience with the owner joe . very descriptive got the exact image of what i 'm looking for in my wedding cake . flavors of choice are amazing . really enjoyed my experience today and i 'm definitely looking forward to see my wedding cake on april 7th . i have no doubt they will meet my expectations .	2196
0	my experience was very bad . the lady did not honor any of my requests . she did not even ask how i wanted my eyebrows to be shaped . when i asked the lady to clear some stragglers , she retorted that it is my oversight . she did not even ask if it needed any further shaping . overall very poor experience .	2630
0	it is unfortunate that two individuals were disrespectful enough to find this update funny . choosing medical attention is important and discrimination of any type is not funny .	1589
1	i am not sure what happened here in the last few months to cause such bad reviews but it was actually nice here in my opinion . my room was clean and more importantly comfortable . the bed had at least 4 down pillows and i fell right to sleep as soon as i laid in the bed . the free breakfast was horrible the eggs were runny and warmed up alongside the sausages in the microwave . even the waffles had a sour taste to them . if i am ever back in cleveland , ohio i would definitely stay here again .	3248
1	very nice , comfortable and unpretentious place . professional and courteous staff and massage-therapists . ca n't go wrong with this convenient and accessible 'spa ' .	1192
0	the staff was skillful , my body felt relax but not my mind . the staff were allowed to talk ( not whisper ) to the customer and i could n't really enjoy it . i was able to hear the customer by the cashier . i would have given it 4 stars for the skills but the talking took out 1 star . also , be careful if you are driving , the parking lot has a bum that almost took out my tire and that took out 1 star too .	735
1	you have to try their chicken melt when here . decent crowds	221
1	this place has what many places do n't ; a vibe to mentally zone out ... . some bars are meant to bring out your social side , others your sports side- i found that i can get three important things i like at this place : 1 . guinness on tap 2 . robust authentic environment ( nice dark wood styling- old photos and a chilled out staff -- - ( i feel like i can talk badly about obama and iphones and not an eyebrow would be raised ! ) 3 . i can chill and zone out after work and just be quiet .	792
0	pretty glasses , but does that mean i 'm willing to put up with lies ? no ! when i choose a store to make a purchase i also look for integrity , honesty , and solution oriented people . they flunked on all three and lost my business forever . do n't do it , it 's not worth it .	3501
0	because of employee christian reed this location does n't even deserve 1 star . he was so rude and condescending , he made sure to hand me his business card which reads `` mgr trainee '' to make sure i spelled his name correct when i told him i would be reporting him . enterprises brand is `` a family owned business that treats you like family '' . he does n't have the skills set for problem solving or treating a customer like family . definitely needs more training on how to treat people	2373
0	nothing against this dealership , everything against hyundai motor finance and their customer care . they are only helpful when i wanted to lease my car . when the lease is up the are horrible , horrible people . no help , no extension on my lease . very unhelpful . i will never , ever buy another hyundai . always be loyal to honda from now on . honda rocks ! please do not buy or lease this car . you will be sorry .	3041
0	i wanted to love it . third time here and likely my last . it took over 20 minutes only to give me the wrong order ( i ordered iced latte and was given hot after attempting to charge me for a large when i ordered a medium . sorry , but you will have to do better . wait times are long and have witnessed food preparers sneezing into their hands and not washing , prep without gloves , running fingers through their hair . i would not recommend this place . i will go back to sbux . note to owner : your indifference is evident in your lack of responses to both negative and positive reviews .	407
0	brought in our car for transmission work . after the transmission work , immediately had to bring it back due to a loud screeching . instead of actually looking into the problem , they just applied grease . after they `` fixed '' the issue , the problem persisted if a bit quieter . ended up taking it to the dealer a week later . they told me that brake caliper had been over tightened to the point of stripping . the bracket holding the brake in place had been bent . all in all will need $ 500 worth of work to get things put right . was told that the car was not in a safe state . very unhappy .	2100
1	i always come to this store when i am in town and like that i find unique high quality clothes and shoes here . this store was clean , tidy and organized which made for a very enjoyable shopping experience . the staff was very friendly and helpful too . the store had a nice selection of goods that met my expectations . i also , liked that there was a mix of high and lower priced items .	926
0	per the employee jimmy john 's ... '' i am not suppose to make the sandwich the way you want it , i have to make the sandwich the way i am instructed to ... '' wtf ? ? ? ! ! ! my response `` you are not in business or have a job because of your personality . you have a job and open for business because of customers . '' will never return , and if they like free smells i am going to give them one of my own ! !	1340
0	went in for a gel manicure and regular pedicure , the pedicure was fine . the guy was a rude and was rushing a lot . i told them what color i wanted and he ended up doing the wrong one on my gel set . when my hands were under the light for the gels , it was burning my fingers which i have never experienced before . i went two days ago and my pink nail polish is starting to turn yellow ! wo n't be going back because of the rude service and the discoloration after only two days	1834
0	i come to this location because it is close to my house.. but the service here is not good . my mom and i came after church for a bagel and she ordered a regular bagel with no cream cheese . as she was checking out she asked for butter and the manager ( bald man ) said it would be $ .60 for butter ... uhm ... for a bit of butter ? ? ? really ? ! the manger did n't care and neither did the employees . i would understand if she wanted additional meats and veggies , but this is butter . so rude ! i do n't plan on coming back . so upsetting .	3372
1	did a hula burger , it was different but pretty good . onion rings are awesome ! coleslaw was not all that good .	953
0	this grocery store is over priced , a lot of the employees are rude , and the quality of the food items seem to be going down hill . i recently purchased chicken curry from the prepared foods section ... it was gross ! the chicken tasted like processed chicken strips . thankfully there are more healthy alternative grocery stores nearby like sprouts where the employees know what `` customer service '' means and the food items are just as healthy , more reasonably priced , and the inventory is more consistent .	433
1	el hotel esta bien , aunque caro , pero bueno es toronto aquí todo es caro jejeje , el hotel limpio y las camas y almohadas muuuy cómodas .	73
1	the food is always fresh and tastes great . i really enjoy coming in for lunch in between work and my appointments . i can order an entree , soup , wonton , and spring roll for less than $ 7 during lunch time . kung pao chicken and the sweet and sour shrimp are great . yes , this is slightly americanized , but it has been in business for quite some time and the staff and owners are always friendly . they do not hesitate to remember your face and say hello . this is by far my favorite place to take a friend for a quick bite to eat if we want chinese .	237
0	one word : no . the food is awful , you can get better and more authentic greek cuisine in a food court . the service was dreadful , besides the hostess who was pleasant . overall , we did not feel welcome and left as soon as possible after literally choking down our entrees . they use those processed `` __ % meat protein '' frozen chicken breasts for their souvlaki ! not acceptable.the salad was probably the best thing about this joint .	177
1	you ca n't fail here . location + price . rooms are just fine .	2976
1	my dog needed a nail trim , cost $ 8 but they got 2 staff involved , one of them even got his face very near to my dog 's mouth , very brave . i like people who take the initiative to get things done . will definitely be back . the dog bathing is a very good experience after the wash the store has a hugh shopping section , very fun and cute place .	3433
0	the lady working this place is very ignorant and rude ! i stopped coming here months ago because she would treat my friend and i like we were stealing . we initially loved our apartment location just because it 's right behind amko but the lady changed our minds ! ! ! she follows us throughout the store and i ca n't think of a single time it even looked like i was stealing ! ! we were customers for years and just stopped because i refuse to be treated and looked at like a thief when i am not .	2383
1	andre is always in the vegetable section and every time i come he is surprisingly always there ! helped me find over 60 things in the 20 times i came ! he is so awesome that i decided to rate smiths 5 stars because why not give someone credit for making your day so much easier ! good job smiths ! you 're employees are awesome	1223
0	well where to start ? dark dingy , etc . typical look to a music hall . not a think to impress me or those with me . the floor could use some work ( paint ) . sound was good . band was awesome . the kicker - you 'll be lucky if you can afford more than 2 drinks .	1693
1	amazing staff and doctors . i have had `` ok '' experiences around the valley then came across this office . if you are looking for a good eye doctor you cant go wrong !	2126
1	the philly cheese steak was the best ive had ina longggggggggggggg time ! the steak tasted like a good quality of beef . the roof top atmosphere was really cool and layed back i liked it .	1091
0	ok so it has beer . on a cool sign . there are others that have done that with out the sign . food- pedestrian at best , frozen diner at worst . the truth as always lies somewhere in between . really expensive for what you get- london , or nyc pricing has nothing on this place for price . what calgary does , what calgary does best is make everywhere else look awesome . especially with the food , the national enforces this natural order of mediocrity well .	630
0	came in around 9pm on a few different nights . good bagels and hot chocolate but cashier was snippy .	2841
0	i went here on 4/11/2015 after reading a bunch of decent reviews on yelp ! there was only one server working this small joint , it was n't very busy , but she could n't seem to be bothered to tend to the few patrons . not only was the service well below average but my girlfriend found a huge piece of plastic in here chimichanga verdes . when i finally got the attention of the waitress to tell her she acted like it was no big deal and was n't even going to comp the food . i would not recommend this place to anyone ! !	7
0	yeah do n't do it.. even when you think they are going to be watched ... i showed a v cut nothing crazy so i thought this would be ok ... nope totally messed my hair.. and bang to my ears are cut to be bangs starting at my eye brows ... there was no checking of the student after ward and no check off . but she tried covering my chop with curls.. so nice attempt . you live and learn guess it will be another 8 month with out a trim to get my length back..	354
1	b-12/mic shots here are great in and out , appoitment times flexible and the staff is great	391
0	not a clean place , and staff are rude and rough . made me bleed and did not even apologize ! the men are rough .	2197
0	i live literally walking distance from this eatery . my husband and i decided to order a large pizza to go . almost $ 30 for a large pizza ? ! ? ! ? are you kidding me ? the pizza was good but nothing out of the ordinary ... . $ 5 hot n readys from now on ... .	192
0	absolutely horrible . waited around all day for a tech to come and setup internet between 8-5 . ridiculous time frame to begin with . nobody shows up and when i call to ask they say they ca n't get in touch with the technician . they then say i can wait another hour in case he shows up and if not call to reschedule . worst customer service ever . i was hoping that i would just get the internet hooked up then not need to contact their terrible customer service ... somebody has to hook it up first . 0/5 stars	3319
0	their soup and ramen are very salty . i do n't recommend them if you are sensitive to salt . i tried them a couple times already hoping it was just the soup that days . i wo n't go back there anymore .	131
0	this place is seriously the biggest joke ever . the only friendly person was edgar the front desk guy , everyone else 's bedside manners were just down right aweful . i took my daughter in because i thought her ankle was broken they ordered an xray . thankfully i work for a radiologist because we found out she did in fact break her ankle . the results were sent stat fax back to them and they called me 2 days later to give me the results . thx guys she was already seen by an orthopedic dr and was casted 2 days ok . unacceptable ! ! ! no one should ever take anyone here .	535
0	thanks for your response sarah , glad you monitor these reviews . was n't expecting much feedback from this business , as i never even received any , but just wanted to share my experience so others are aware !	147
0	julie was our server . very unfriendly . uninterested and grumpy . hardly checked on us . and when she did she did n't ask if we wanted anything else , just left the check and walked off . had a permanent scowl on her face . spoke to multiple friends who said they also had her and will never return . very disappointed . wo n't be coming back . she 's like a black hole sucking the kindness from you . was n't a pleasant experience .	1487
1	went twice during the trip once for lunch and then the next night for just drinks . they are amazing when we walking in as they were closing but it did not matter . we were in las vegas for my friend 's 40th birthday and they were like `` awesome come on in '' ! the drinks were very good . not a fan of my `` old fashion '' they make it very different with seltzer water ... ..i know i know then its not an `` old fashion '' but hey its how they make it . they have a great selection at the bar and even with them cleaning and packing up for the night they were awesome !	1538
1	they have some pretty bomb flavors and toppings . my new go to frozen yogurt place in phoenix . the staff was really kind too which makes a difference .	1454
1	went to express auto spot after looking for a car online . i called them and asked about the car . the lady was nice . we set up a time to see it . when i got there , i walked into the dealer and was asked if i needed anything . i said i had an appointment . the lady i talked to came up front and showed me the car . we took it for a test drive . everything was fine . so i got the car . the appoint with buying the car took about 2 hours all together . i was really happy that this was an easy transaction .	3305
1	this has better selection than goodwill ! store was laid out cleanly and a lot was available , especially in terms of clothes . prices were beyond reasonable . and i 'm used to shopping in oklahoma ! would recommend !	2646
0	not the same as it used to be . watered down margaritas and food was just ok. we used to come once a week . not anymore . seems like new management ?	1346
0	busy hotel in the middle of down town . staff was nice , but the hotel itself was not impressive . the room was outdated , internet was expensive , and really there was nothing that would make me want to come back . much prefer to stay at the marriott .	1690
1	next to harkins theaters . came here on a friday night about 9:30pm very busy slow moving line , there were two young workers who seemed to keep their cool and still tentative to the orders and friendly . ***ordered the large hot stone strawberry blondie w/ whipped cream on top in a waffle cup , price was about $ 7 & change and very yummy .	1523
0	do n't go here . the guy pockets your money if you pay in cash ( wo n't give you a reciept ) and says if you do n't pass your smog test you will have to pay the full fee again for retesting . super unprofessional people .	2208
1	great little pharmacy . it has everything a big box store has but just all pharmacy related . i do have to go as per my insurance , but every time i go in everyone i very helpful and on top of everything .	3283
1	bob randall , bob randall , bob randall ! ! ! ! go ask for him . he gave me the best car buying experience i have ever had . everyone at the dealership treated us great ! bob catered to my every need , was patient with my indecisiveness , and got me everything i was looking for in a vehicle . i came all the way from pittsburgh to check out this dealership and it was worth the trip . mbono is definitely a dealership that puts the customer first ! got a 2014 cla and plan on staying a client for the next one .	2012
0	well , i am apparently the minority but i will not be headed back . i picked up many items and were not thrilled with any of them . i even had to take one item back for a re-do . i had other items to take back but the owner and i did n't agree on what was `` even '' so i did n't waste my time arguing . they were all very friendly and helpful , but the money , i am not impressed . their prices are high and they only accept cash . to most their work is probably fine . but , if you are like me and am super picky with your alterations , i would keep looking .	2702
1	i always passed this place never thought of going in until now ! glad i did their fried flounder , fried okra and coleslaw is to die for . staff was super friendly . i will be making another trip there !	501
1	i went into this place to ask some questions about a room for my upcoming move . i spoke with the manager , shannon who was super nice and answered my questions . he sat with me and helped me determine exactly what size i will need and gave me all the information i will need when i 'm ready to rent . when i 'm ready to rent , i 'm sure the manager will take good care of me .	2065
0	service is abysmal ( no exaggeration ) . wings are great but unfortunately not worth the wait . over 2 hours from start to finish for wings . i could have driven to east coast wings in kannapolis , ate and drove home in the same amount of time with way less frustration . this place could be so good but in the end it is just not . maybe we will try again next year .	1248
0	hear a ton of bad story 's about this guy , him and his wife are crooks . mainly writing this to remind myself not to go here , and stop my friends from going here .	3623
0	the beverages are good but the service is deplorable . i was appalled by the batista 's condescending service . if you want high quality service , then look elsewhere . this is a place where your money wo n't go a long way - the batistas will be rude no matter if you tip them or not .	2163
0	ran by a bunch of kids who do n't know anything about customer service . there were two people ahead of me in line and after their order was taken , the cashier left the register and proceeded to chit chat with with her co workers . not once did she acknowledge that we were waiting to be served or apologize for the wait . there were four girls behind the counter and all knew we were there waiting for our order to be taken . we left and went some where else .	551
1	this location is well kept . the isles are nice and clean which makes it easy to find what you need . wide alcohol selection also which is a plus in my book .	3935
0	i come here every month to pay my rent . and every time i 'm here i sit in the drive up teller for 15 minutes waiting for somebody to come to the window . its very slow and understaffed .	2760
1	i 've always had a great experience . the staff is efficient & friendly . i usually have enough time to run in for my morning coffee at tim 's while the car is being cleaned . i give the location 5 stars based on the quality x time x cost ( approx . $ 30 with turtle wax ) , which is cost-effective to me . after service , keeps my car generally clean for 2-3 weeks depending on the season & my dog 's paws . i return often .	2256
1	the place was clean , service was friendly and timely when i went on a thursday evening but they were pretty busy so i can only imagine how busy they can get on a weekend . the wings and fries were cooked just right but the nachos were stale . overall its a cool place to hang .	1520
0	the employees are rude . i wanted to get some piercings done and i got major attitude from them . i have had piercings done before and i never had to pay for the jewelry separate . for the basic jewerly cost $ 64 and up . so for two simple piercings it would cost me over $ 130 . i did n't even want fancy or decorative jewelry just the basic . i would n't recommend this place to anyone .	2790
1	awwww , chicago style dogs , almost . first visit to the dog and i liked it . big all beef dogs with lots of options for add ons . picked their suggestions for a chicago style dog and it came close to those that we 'd get when we lived in the city . loved the tots with a variety of dipping sauces . the garlic aioli was my favorite .	1407
0	cost is reasonable quality of food is horrible . the served my pork bone soup cold it felt like from fridge n pot in stove for few minute happen twice will not again . order a bento box sashimi one time the fish was still frozen with ice . their tempura batter was still uncook from inside complaint and they did nothing . very unhappy with the woman waitress took her 30minutes to bring my rice with my food i have to remind her . her service was bad	1101
0	went there to buy a car today . walked around the lot for 20 mins and another 15 mins wandering around inside . so in 35 mins at a car dealership and not a single person even said hello ! ? ? ?	2610
1	suddenly grocery shopping is so much more fun . i always beg my husband ... `` please , just let me take a look at the clothes ... '' and then wind up filling my shopping cart with sweaters , jackets , socks ( great socks ! ) and t-shirts ... because , well , they 're all so cheap ! nice work joe ! ! and the ad campaign is also totally brilliant ! just a note ... at this location there is a fantastic stand-alone joe fresh store , with way more selection . but i also like the clothing sections built into the grocery stores !	3517
1	great customer service . very accommodating ! thanks brunswick ! party of 10 in lanes 1 & 2 on valentine 's day ! we 'll be back ! ! !	2235
0	this restaurant is a disgrace to mexican food . the cheese sauce is definitely right out of a jar and the chicken is 100 % frozen chicken that you buy already in strips at the grocery store . whatever you do , run far away from this place if you want any sort of a decent meal .	1558
0	the two front desk girls really made everything a negative experience management would never do anything about the girls being mean to their own coworker and/or the patients . it was even hard to work there , the only people who were nice and actually sincere and cared about the patients was the front desk manager . the doctor would n't even talk to me when i would see him everyday .	3928
1	this place is immaculate . i love this hotel . the staff is so welcoming and the customer service is excellent . i especially enjoyed my interaction with chhaya at the front desk . she was very helpful . she was also very knowledgable . i will definitely recommend this location to all of my friends and family .	1859
0	i was never acknowledged that i was there , vivian just kept ignoring me and then i asked her to trim shorter and she kinda made fun of me . as she was massaging my feet she put all the used equipment in the water then when done she put my feet in the dirty water as well . she messed up my polish and had to ask her to come over and fix it . worst pedicure ever i have ever gotten . will not be going back	2297
1	a great place to grab some light tasting pastries . they have a nice selections to choose from . the owner and staff are very nice and friendly . the shop is very clean and the lounge area is nice and comfortable you can just eat you pastries and have a great time	1108
1	when i travel to toronto , i either stay here or at the park hyatt . the whc is a nice hotel and it really suits most budgets . the restaurant is ok , but i highly recommend walking around toronto and finding a unique place to dine . it 's convenient that they have a starbucks in the hotel , and the pool and athletic facilities are quite nice , too . there is a bar on the top level that i have yet to venture to , but i 've heard good things . there is a thai restaurant on the same street that i highly recommend avoiding .	1859
1	one of the best buffets & cheap prices . the food is made with love . total for two with beverages comes out to approx $ 23 for lunch tip not included . the maduros are a must have and the hibachi .	1302
1	quick tip : the dim sum is pretty good for the price ; however , the combo lunch/dinner hot food was quite bad . it tasted sour and lacked seasoning . definitely was n't that fresh , although it looked pretty under the heat lamps .	2069
1	this is the newly renovated one located on riverbend . it 's eat all you can for 27.99/head . very good taste and quality of food . the service was good though the staff was confuse with our orders- we did n't mind cause we got pauses in between our orders that allowed us to digest . there were too many choices though that gets confusing sometimes though it 's okay once you look at several times !	206
1	this gym has a very cool design ! the equipment is brand new , it 's never crowded , it has every type of machine and free weights . it 's also a very casual environment so it feels like a comfortable place to work out .	3898
1	very nicely renovated . i would highly recommend . i would give it more stars but it took a while for the staff to notice me at check-in .	1741
0	this starbucks is not up to snuff . they have been slow . they are always out of something . i 've found myself dealing with a trainee who had n't had enough training to handle being a cashier ; he could n't even handle ringing up a mocha .	44
1	sisig fries tho ahaha so bomb especially when ur drinking a nice cold beer with it ... i do n't recommend going here on college night tho unless it 's a frat or sorority event . no one really dances and everyone comes past 10 or as we speak filipino time . good for dinning bad for turning up ahaha	817
0	worst service ever . left within minutes of being seated regardless of the waitress telling us ( a party of two ) to sit after she cleaned the table , and then getting bumped out of it when we were first in line for a party of three . i 'd give it a zero-star review if i could .	1123
1	came on a weekday morning with bf to avoid the weekend crowds and we definitely enjoyed our experience here food : 5/5 ordered a bunch our staples : lotus leaf wrapped sausage and sticky rice , preserved egg congee , egg yolk bun . and they were all pretty bomb ! employees were walking around with carts full of dim sums . super cantonese style some items in the cart are off the menu service : 5/5 super friendly and funny staffs.willing to explain everything despite the language barrier . environment : 3/5 bit outdated lobby and washroom are particularly sketchy overall 4/5 , will return ! and we were told on weekends , there are more variety of dim sums	0
0	dismal service . they messed up my order by not putting any espresso in my double espresso order . everyone makes mistakes- that 's not the issue with this starbucks . what got me writing this review is the fact that there was no apologies- as if it was my fault . the girl opened the cup and pointed to the drink and said there is the espresso . then went on to make me a drink that was made correctly . avoid this location if you have the option .	2242
1	so here 's an update to my initial review for gold 's gym . scott , the director for the personal training programs ; assisted me in canceling my personal training program i had signed up for . he was really nice , professional , & very timely/efficient . my refund of my deposit was sent back to me as per what was told to me & there were zero issues . i have to say , i 'm really impressed . i know this gym does n't have a ton of glowing reviews but they really deserve a billion gold stars from my perspective . i will definitely be referring others here . : )	2338
0	i went in for gel nails ... this guy whos nail technicin certificate had expired started doing acrylics ... i said im here for gels . they said this is how we do gels ... so they do a full set of acrlics and the the gel polish on top . how stupid . i kept having to ask for then shorter and it took 45 min for my nails to be done . i hate this place and their employees and will never be back .	3497
0	only had timbits available at 12 am on a friday night . and was very rude about it . me and a freind came here expecting a late night snack and the lady spoke to us as if we were n't even suspose to be there	3675
1	best pet hotel ever . they know my mom 's dog by name and make her feel comfortable leaving her there . she even gets a doggie report card when she picks her up .	3108
0	service is blah . wings are worse no matter the flavor you get this weird sweet unpleasant after taste . definitely not worth the money . if you want good wings go across the street to native .	1395
0	really bad ! trash and toilet paper all over the balconies and pool area , people yelling from balcony to balcony . clogged sink and bath tub . the bed is not made for a good night sleep ! ! i heard the rooms had been renovated and maybe some have , but not the one i got . in general the place is not good . the upside was , i checked out at 8pm and was refunded my money with no hassle ! but i do n't recommend staying there !	2976
0	staff is friendly ; but- only 1 star because of the 3 cars i 've had from this location- 2 smelled of smoke and whomever `` detailed '' the car must have been blind and smell def . absolutely disgusting . if you 're a smoker- you 're disgusting too .	2177
1	shamika is amazing ! i was so nervous to get my hair colored again . over the years i 've been pretty adventurous with color and my hair was so damaged because of it . so i had n't colored my hair for over a year . i was getting bored with it but was so nervous . shamika did such a great job ! she took real good care of my hair and the color is phenomenal ! i 've never had better color before . i 'll keep going back to her .	2577
1	this place rocks . its just small and not that many tables . the food is outstanding ! anything fried here takes amazing . price is great value . i would come here again and again ! thank you koo koo ! come to brampton .	566
1	hired duane to complete some work at our house . both times he visited completed the job without any hassles , was extremely professional , courteous , and his prices were fair . highly recommended .	3754
0	my son and i stopped for a leisurely meal before getting on our flight . looked like a cute diner theme ; too bad everything tasted like old grease . perhaps they should clean their grill more than once a week .	6
0	this dealership does not honor mopar warranties . wife took jeep commander in for warranty battery replacement . they charged $ 51.50 in labor and $ 49 pro-rate to replace a battery that was 12 months old with a 18 month free replacement warranty . this is my last jeep ! !	1910
0	horrible service . they have one teller for a line of 15 people . meanwhile they have another person asking you what you need in the line instead of opening another window . plus they charge 10 dollars for cashier checks and smith 's charges .50 cents .	12
1	i always stay here this place is great deal .they are real nice very clean and neat	2650
1	came to see a movie on the way out of town in imax , located just inside the palms thru a food court area . good sized theater not a bad seat in the house . popcorn and drink deals reasonable . heard that have good deals on certain days off the week , but went on a friday so i would n't know . the only weird thing is the bathroom is located outside the ticket collection area .	491
0	my child fell down their stairs during the kid fitness class and no one told us ! when her dad went to check on her in the babysitting area , she was sitting with an ice pack on her head . no other care was given for a possible spinal injury ! ! ! the teacher never talked to him and no report was filed since no one had him sign any paperwork . my child has a swollen neck and we have heard from no one regarding this . this is not a safe place to take your child !	2750
0	tried to spend my money but all four people behind the counter wo n't even acknowledge my presence . no one is in the shop . i guest i they do n't want my money . excellent service for invisible people . i do n't recommend this place unless your a white women with 36dd .	203
1	absolutely love my apartment ! building is kept spotless and is a great price for the area . the office ladies have been very helpful and kind and i really appreciated the welcome basket in my apartment when i moved in . little things like that mean a lot . highly recommend !	3852
1	the bagels are great and the staff are friendly . definitely recommend getting lox on whichever bagel you choose . the bagels are baked in-store and very fresh if not a bit small . salads come with whatever you order so there 's no issue of being hungry after .	995
0	it 's a very friendly place . nice lady 's but i give it a 1 star only because it seems like they do n't seem to keep up with sanitation . i took my daughter to get her brows waxed and the sheets seem to have never been washed . wax is all over the floor and all over the furniture . everything was dusty . the room in general was not a good setting for wax services . decided to just go next door .	685
0	atrocious service . was there twice and perhaps never again . it 's enough to say , that after 45 min of waiting ( and starving ) we finally asked the server politely , `` hey , where is our food ? `` , to which he nonchalantly replied that he totally forgot about the order . oh , did i mention that it 's overpriced as well ?	1271
0	i used to love this place , they were always friendly and did a good job on my feet . but my mother went in for a visit and granted her toes are n't the prettiest , but she cant help it and is already very insecure about them , one of the girls asked my mom what she did for her work and my mom told her and said that she is basically on her feet 24hrs a day , the tech replied ' i sit for my job do you think my ass looks as bad as your toes '' never again will they be gettin our service or friends sevice . i can not believe she insulted my mother so badly !	838
1	great job ! nice staff and quiet environment , also they have a huge variety of shellac colours !	142
0	very bad customer service , rosa is a rude not helpful attendant . they messed up my order the day before and told me they would replace and today i came and did n't want to help or correct their mistake .	322
0	stop in with my son who lives in lyon fr . ordered escargot . worst i have ever had . terrible ! nothing freanch about it . unsatisfactory	429
1	my son had a blast and came home soaked in sweat . he 's 9 and even loved the little kid area with the yoga balls ! our first time was for a birthday party , we 'll definitely be back !	1664
1	great staff , never a long wait . dr. duhaime is amazing ! did everything she could to make sure i had the best vision with my odd eye issues . i will be a patient for life ! you may be able to save a few bucks at one of those awful mall places on your glasses , but you will never get the proper care or service like you will here . it 's so worth it !	1865
1	so i call ahead and they are saying everything i want hear ! ! ! yes it 's in stock yes we have rentals we close at 7 ! then i get to the store and rebecca greets me with her wonderful caramel eyes and has the most awesome disposition ! ! awesome service and right on time	3359
1	awesome sales and service experiences ! everyone we talked to over the phone and in the store were courteous and professional . i refer all my friends there . i 've even told friends from out of state to call them . i especially love how easy it is to buy a car through the internet department . sands kia rocks !	624
0	this was the worst nail salon experience i 've ever had . me and mom came in for a pedicure and we were the only people in there , this should 've been our first hint . both girls we had for our pedicure were very unfriendly and made us feel like we were unconvincing them by being there . our pedicure was terrible , it was 15 minutes ! ! they gave about a one minute courtesy `` massage '' to each of us , definitely not the pedicure experience . neither of us will ever go back here ! !	2372
1	beautiful store , great deals , nice people ! what else could you ask of in a retailer ?	223
0	my boyfriend treated all 6 of us out after winning luckily on slots . i had the dungeness crab legs which were dry , did n't taste fresh . that 's expected since vegas is out in the desert . $ 30+ for it though ... pretty pricey and the meat was dry . my bf enjoyed his sushi plate . everybody had something different , the sides were good . but i ordered garlic fries as a side and got regular fries . sigh . nothing too great about this restaurant , not great enough that i would come back .	603
1	absolutely love this fry 's . my kids light up to see gladys in the deli and today miss shannon in floral saved a little surprise for each of my kids . what amazing and kind hearted employees . thank you for your genuine friendliness each and every time we visit .	3935
0	came in at 4:30 on a sunday for a simple alignment and tire rotation . service hours posted are until 6:00pm . it took them 10 minutes to say they are n't accepting any more work for the day . as i leave i see 3 employees just standing around talking watching me leave . nice one guys .	959
