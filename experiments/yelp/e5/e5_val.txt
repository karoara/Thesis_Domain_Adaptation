1	hard to find quality jewelry shops here in las vegas nv . so , when you do you keep coming back for service .	2307
1	i only order coffee and they always brew me a fresh pot of decaf i usually do the drive through in the pm . they also honor my extra large coffee when i redeem my pinch card . best coffee on town .	1761
0	horrible . the little blondey that is the so called `` manager '' needs to go back to training . not only is her voice annoying but she is a midget with an attitude . will never come here again .	1822
1	i am such a fan of this place . the hotel is clean , modern and everything you 'd expect from a marriott brand . but for me the staff is outstanding . they are so friendly and helpful . they go out of their way to make you feel welcome and appreciated . i had a slight snag with the shuttle but mention it to a staff person in passing and it was immediately addressed . i could n't be happier with the results . i wish there was a bit more in walking distance but the shuttle offered by the hotel fixes that problem .	230
1	if you need real chicago style food in your life then this is the place . the chefs name is pizza mike for a reason . incredible taste in a bar/casino/casual eatery setting . great food at a great price ! !	1295
1	art , art ... he 's the man , if he ca n't swoop you up , nobody can . i had the pleasure of contacting art during the '09 sema show for a ride to the strip club for a group of 5 . i never met the dude but he hooked us up fat . i wo n't get into tooo much detail , but one word says it all : free , this and that . catch my drift .	2098
1	roberto 's has the best carne asada burritos and the fixin 's at the salsa bar are tasty . red and green sauce and spicy carrots and lime wedges . also enjoy the 3 rolled tacos with guc .i do agree with some of the reviews about the place being a mess . but that is some of the appeal to most taco shops . i mean risking your life for good tacos and burritos is exciting and i also agree this place is perfect after a late night of drinking .	322
1	in town for business and decided to give this place a try . i was n't disappointed one bit ! great selection of taps and , based on the recommendation of damien , i had the kentucky bourbon burger . it was very good ! luke and damien are a couple of cool guys as well .	957
0	so big fan of buffalo wild wings . i 've been to the tempe location many times and as a sports bar they have games on and play the sound from the games . this location , they were blasting club music . even after we asked if they could play the sound from the game or atleast turn the music down they said the first week management wanted music way up . i think i still have headache from being there . at some point they will figure out what they need to be and thats a sports bar with good beer , wings , and sports . i am willing to amend my review if things change .	383
0	as an online student , devry has never failed to constantly remind me that i should regret ever enrolled in their school . worst school experience ever . do n't waste your money here . i have had to file several complaints over the years . good luck if you ever need help .	1081
0	i went with my daughter to sit with her while she had her nails redone because the first time they did them they were horrible . they were very rude too her charge her more money to fix their mistake.. lily was the girl that fixed her nails and while she had her sitting in the pedicure chair fixing the mistake they made she was talking in her language to all the other nail techs which made them stop look away from their customer and stare at my daughter so you know that they were talking smack . i would never spend a dime in this place very very rude and a lot of bad work came out of that place	2297
0	this company is a sham . they fixed a part . warranty for 30 days and two weeks after the 30 days was up , broken again . keep charging for the same part . came out today ( after waiting 3 weeks for them to fix it ) and within an hour the washer is broken again . worst company in las vegas . terrible customer service . they made me give a star to write this or i would take stars if i could ! ! !	3885
0	it was not busy when i came . it took them 24 min to have my food ready . i have been asked to sit on a table . place not so clean . when my beef kofta and rise with chicken served from a teenanger which he only moving his head indicating that he understands not a word of english came out of his mouth even when i asked about my forgotten drink , i realize that meat was burn . for several hours after i digest it with a terrible flavors and feelings from my stomach and mouth . never again ...	808
1	seriously amazing customer service . matt spent a solid 2.5 hours with us and was never pushy . i 'd recommend it to anyone ! !	3553
0	worst experience ever . the girl at the counter , may montoya , was the rudest person i 've ever dealt with . i 've been going there 10yrs , always had outstanding customer service . she was horrible . if i did n't know better , i 'd never return . luckily i know everyone else gives great customer service , so i 'll be back . i will try to avoid her though .	1778
0	i ordered wings for delivery . nothing beats biting in to a wing and finding pink/raw meat . disgusting .	902
1	i found the service to be exceptionally friendly . more importantly , the floral arrangements were modern , unique , and tasteful -- the opposite of the sort of neon-dyed ftd horrorshows i 'd been hoping to avoid . you wo n't find grandmotherly tulips , carnations , and roses here , only lovely nature-inspired designs . my friend was delighted by her get-well bouquet .	2585
1	victor was awesome ! really informative and helped us out to get the best deal . personable , gave us space when we needed it and did n't feel pressured . thank you victor !	3738
1	this urgent care was the most pleasant and quickest one i 've been to . the staff is so nice and friendly . they made me feel very comfortable and took care of all my needs . they even fill your prescriptions here , which is totally convenient . they are even open every day until 9pm ! i will definitely return here and will recommend them to my family and friends .	2435
0	good food , garbage service like any other low end chinese cuisines	146
0	very disappointed i have chosen this place for year now in the las two times my eyebrows got infected and bleed , my nails are not even closed of what i have requested yesterday i went with my dtr requested pedi and an refill and because they are concentrated to talk not provide quality customer service the guy jhon did not do my correct color neither the pedicure x me and my dtr , please do n't go to this place their service is terrible and they are pricy my dtr requested powder glitter and the lady did what she wanted her and charge 58 dollars . i dont mind paying x service but everytime the service is worst and worst .	3333
0	scheduled an 8 am oil change did n't leave until 9:00 . informed me that my car had two broken springs on the drivers side and when i told them that i would take my car to the dealership for an estimate they came back in 5 mins later and told me that they were mistaken and they thought i owned a different car that they were working on . could be an honest mistake , but it seemed fishy . either way , an hour f for an oil change that was scheduled in advance is completely unacceptable . will never go there again .	3277
0	poor customer service was an understatement for this store . the store was a ghost town but yet no representative even acknowledged my existence . i will not return and will certainly alter my purchasing for my company 's needs .	1782
1	my husband has to get treatments and waiting for kidney transplant from mayo clinic . bernadette cesare of ashley homestore helped me furnished and get delivery on time for an apartment we rented . she is very helpful , professional and friendly . i will definitely recommend anyone to shop in ashley home store on mayo blvd..	3738
1	i been coming here since i moved to phoenix 4 years ago and love it here . they 're super friendly and i always walk out with pretty feet and nails ! i especially love love love when natalie does my pedis and annie does my powder polish mani . i initially walki in there with super short , bitten of nails , ugly nails and now they 've grow so nicely ! you must go and get your manis and pedis here . you wo n't regret it !	415
0	i live down the street from this smith 's , but will now start going to the one on green valley . every time i have gone here over the last month their shelves are not stocked with the sale items . they stock the more expensive items so you are forced to buy them . i am constantly hounded by this girl walking around trying to push their credit card . i am here to shop if i want a credit card i 'll apply for one . also workers doing things in the isles wo n't move out of your way . the sweepers will run you over with their broom and not even care . worst experience ever .	1223
0	this place is a joke . worst i 've ever seen . forgot our food , low quality and nobody cares . fault in management and employees . go somewhere else	1214
1	i 've walked by numerous times and never went in as it was busy and i did n't have time to wait . i 'm really happy i did go in this time ! ! super friendly and really clean . the barber i got was very attentive to detail and really listened to my requests . a tiny bit on the pricey side but life has gotten expensive . i 'd totally go there again . thoroughly impressed . thanks for the great cut ! !	552
0	their employee randomly took my number from their appointment book and started messaging me and harassing me . i mean they did a pretty good job dyeing my hair , the cut was a little choppy . not sure if i would come here again .	3610
1	sam is always able to help out with my print jobs . the staff is always great and able to help with my problem .	1782
1	arizona florist 's is top shelf ! received many floral arrangements over the years but the mother 's day lilac 's can only be described in one word : gorgeous !	38
0	i like the variety of products , however , total wine has total unacceptable customer service . the associate helped us , however , we felt like 3rd class citizens . the employees at the cash register were not very friendly . they need a reminder , as any of us employed by any company , we stay employed because of our customers . total disappointment .	3199
1	lobster grilled cheese explains itself & their clam chowder is my fav so far ! ! ! it 's kind of a far drive for us , but well worth it* ; - )	1255
0	i have been going here for years . i use to like this place , not anymore . they just do not do a good job . if i am paying to have my car cleaned i want it cleaned . i should n't have to come home and finish clening the places they missed . i go every 6 weeks to get my car cleaned . i like to keep it neat . their service has gone way down . such a disappointment . they are close to where i live and it is so convenient . now i need to go out of my way or just clean it myself . what every happened to a work ethic ? ? ? ?	3616
1	i got exactly what i was looking for shopping here . i was looking for some floral accents for some glass jars i just got . of course it was sunday , and my first choice is always hobby lobby ... but they are closed . ( why do i always crave them on sunday . ugh ) anyway , i stopped in here and found some great options . i prefer realistic looking floral designs . there were a lot of fake looking options , but i was able to find some pretty ones that i was happy with . bonus is that they were on sale ! never under estimate jo-ann for crafty things : ) they are surprisingly good .	1937
0	the worst massage i 've ever had . my neck is stiff and bruised ! super annoying . the could use a remodel too .	2346
0	you can make an appointment but they wo n't show up ! made a 9am appointment . 9:00 passes , no one showed up , called and their response was `` oh i 'm busy i 'll be there at like 10 now . '' said ill take my business else where . do n't want to show up on time to a schedule appointment i 'm happy to give my money to someone else . i 'd give 0 stars if i could . customer service at your best !	3727
0	i 've been a member for a year now and have had nothing but bad experiences here . the staff and managers are rude and constantly talk down to you when you ask a simple question . they do n't like dealing with things so the always make you call their corporate offices if you have a problem . go to 24 hour fitness or eos but not this place	3268
0	i give it a 2 based on atmosphere . it is like going to the flea market of books and the customers act in kind . i love going to bookstores , my husband is a writer so it is one of our hobbies ... i enjoy looking for rare copies from great quirky writers and then sitting and drinking in the scene and this is not that kind of place . example- the only cormac mccarthy they had was the road , which i viewed while i saw kids shoving on each other and a dog barking at the front door .	3504
1	great to have in the team they very helpful and great prices personal are quick and really reliable and they speak spanish also im glad they are in las vegas thanx apc for been there for are company sincerly orange applince	3242
0	ordered the chocolate rugelach . stale . too sweet . would not recommend . i was told `` fresh but not necessarily baked today '' . it tasted a few days old .	3118
1	yum ! i ordered online . great customer service . awesome subs . this is a great sandwich shop .	517
0	we really wanted to like dr. mike . but after several off color comments , delays in communication from the office , and most recently dr. mike joking about offering a sex change procedure for our five year old son , we are no longer going back to palo verde pediatrics .	3570
1	excellent dentist and hygienists . very friendly staff . i was given an honest quote for work that needed to be done , that was much cheaper than a quote at a different office in vegas . they also give the most generous gift basket i 've ever seen from a dental office . they have all the modern equipment including a stand up xray machine that looks like something from star trek !	2779
0	this place is terrible . the service was terrible ordered appetizer did n't come until after crappy overpriced burgers . never got a refill on water or ice tea.not sure why so many people take their kids to a bar/restaurant . thought i was at chucky cheese .	1323
0	if i could give it zero stars i would . this place sucks , i went to return my items and was told no , that i can only get store credit . mind you i bought these items 24 hours ago and had my receipt . no one said anything and this `` store policy `` is not posted anywhere other than the very bottom of the receipt . she tried to tell me the credit card machine does n't give refunds , we 'll good thing my bank does . i will refuse the charge .	1446
1	rooms are very large . pools are awesome . workers very polite . only negative is the units are a little dated . but hard to complain when the rooms are soo spacious . the deck was ginormous !	1057
1	love love love ck ! ! i absolutely love the way ck clothes fit on me . i am a weird size , im short but athletic so their body fit styles work perfect for me . i love the styles and colors they have and for the most part their customer service is always friendly ! they also give out military discounts : ) always a plus ! ! !	1655
1	great food and service ! we stumbled upon it too due to coupon , and so glad we did ! need to get the word out about this place , it is a best kept secret in the north end right now !	967
1	one of my favorite places to get a brew and relax . great neighborhood feel and always some locals drinking alone at the bar chatting with the bartenders . and i 'll tell you what , i love a place where i feel comfortable enough to have a beer by myself without feeling like a raging alcoholic . very mixed crowd where everyone is welcome . definitely the right mix of dive bar and neighborhood hangout .	717
0	they ripped off my sister and were discussing in their language how they were going to apply extra charges . never again .	1834
1	i love zias . i walk in there with the intention of buying one cd and leave with a handful . the staff is pretty helpful but i rarely ask them for help . the music they play is often too loud to shop but i wo n't give them bad marks for that .	2648
0	pool was dirty . as we left pool we asked for new towels and they said they would put new ones for us . they did not . we got back from a day of being in the hot sun and there was no clean towels . i went to front desk and the 2 guys were being full towel nazis . such a shit place .	3772
1	the staff ( i think the owner was helping us ) provided excellent customer service when we purchased our first hookah setup . we are definitely coming back !	2568
0	this is the worst hotel i have ever been to . they are liars and have inflicted unnecessary charges . they have damaged my car .	1859
1	good food and service . i wish the entrance was protected more because the hot or cold air comes slamming in through the front door . the vegi salad is really good . i usually get the onions on the side since it can be too much . i love their iced tea . the patio on the east side of the building is perfect on warmer days . this is a great go to for us when we do n't want to think about where to go .	1116
1	the best thing about this place is that it never closes . i personally love the pancakes here .	346
0	the food was ok but was charged 10.00 a piece for 2 margaritas on the rocks because they used patron without asking if i even wanted to shelf ! ! ! $ 20.00 for two watered down drinks is a rip off ! !	717
0	update : the repair completed on my phone ended with an expanded battery which is why the back of my phone was never flush . meaning it was damaged during the repair screws where missing and the lcd screen was pulling away from the frame with lines and not responding . called the owner he 's a really peach of a guy , bless his heart . no refund and out a 900 phone . the only reason why they have good reviews is they make individuals write a review for a discount . dont go to them ! wish the yelp stars really reflected the true service and quality of work .	2930
0	please think twice when buying a pet from petland ! the latest ... .. petland insurance requires to purchase 3 items a quarter ( food being one ) but what do you do when they do n't have the food you have been purchasing in the past ? ? ? ? ? ? ? when your dog has sensitive stomach you ca n't just switch to another kind . yes , they ran out of food and they still make you liable if you do n't purchase three items !	1894
1	the food is very good i personally love the orange duck ; that 's pretty much all that i order . but the restaurant overall is very nice ... i like the decor , it 's very modern but simple : )	1366
0	very bad customer service , indifferent and rude ! people were waiting to be checked in not knowing who was next . the majority of the sales associates were lacking any signs of motivation or urgency to take care of customers . we were just waiting to purchase a car charger and the associate who finally checked us in said the next sales associate would be right with us . steer clear of this store location . it 's hard to even think they are paying these imbeciles $ 10.00 an hour or more ...	3037
1	a great hole in the wall restaurant . i 've been coming here with my friends for years since high school . the food is delicious and fairly priced . the owners are very friendly and welcoming . i have no idea what the previous reviewer is talking about because there is no buffet at silver palace .	1524
1	stood around for a while in the computer section waiting for someone to help . i had to walk over to two people talking to say i wanted to buy a computer . the associate in the gaming section came right over when we were browsing over there . clean store .	3192
1	i love this place . this has been the only place i 've found near me that has live blood worms and ghost shrimp for a reasonable price . they have a huge selection of aquarium plants and freshwater fish . they have pet you normally do n't see at a petsmart or petco . all the employees are very helpful and friendly and the owners are very nice . i love how they have rescues there on the weekend . that 's how i found the bark side rescue and kitts kitten rescue . the place is very nice looking and very clean .	2746
0	in town for work and was really excited to try this place . unfortunately , i was disappointed when i sat at the bar and was ignored . after five minutes of several workers looking at me without addressing me i left . i have found many other establishments in town who are friendlier and prompt with thier service which i will give my money to .	1127
1	enjoyed lunch here today on our way to bookman 's with a friend who had never tried thai food . we ate every last bit of the panang the server/cook/hostess brought . this leads to my only gripe : she was so busy in the kitchen that arriving guests were ignored until they trekked into the kitchen to find her . they definitely need a bell on the door ! that said , mango thai is reasonable and delicious - worth the hunt .	1133
1	it took a while waiting for somebody to get to us when we signed in to start a new account and took a while to set up an account , but the customer service by roosevelt waters was really good . he was friendly and explained everything thoroughly . he made us feel like we knew each other and were having a conversation with a friend .	2761
1	owners now bought it like 5 yrs ago and i had problems with the staff . i stopped going for a while but went back out of desperation and now just owners family runs it and it 's like night and day . they r very professional and great customer service now	1758
0	sorry for the low rating i think that someone besides management should know about our experince . first off i ordered on line , which is like going thur the drive though which actor joe pesci said it right they f you when you go thur the drive though https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=v66xdulprbm it was made yes , it was hard , cold , and i was very unhappy about it .	870
0	overpriced puppies , pushy & uninformed employees . some of the dogs were caged in small space . i told all my friends and co workers dont shop at this place .	1894
0	came here yesterday . omg ! ! ! i got a shake and ca n't believe how unpleasant it was , not o lu the taste , but they put cake mix in their shake . not sure if it 's only this location or all of them do it , but i 'll go to another location and see if anything is different . overpriced , bland and cake mix . smh	2548
1	out of town for business and needed a very urgent hair cut ! yelped this barber shop and when i arrived i notice the fresh clean hair cuts walking out ... i requested one of the barbers by the name of charley bonilla because of the amazing hair cut he had just completed and it looked perfect ! ! charley took his time and never did i feel rushed ! ! ! i would deff come back when i return to lv ! ! ! thank you charley !	761
1	i could not have asked for a better plumbing experience ! shawn was thorough and explained everything without being condescending . it was quite a lot less than i had prepared myself for financially too . the job was done right and i would recommend plumbsmart to anyone !	1975
0	i just witnessed the worse treatment ever towards an employee . i 'm assuming it 's the manager who is screaming her lungs off telling an employee to get it together & hurry up . mind you it 's full of customers in here ! ! ! why not help and discipline the employee later matter of fact in private ! ! i felt so bad for the employee getting yelled out like that in front of everyone . i am not going to be coming here until they fix this management situation just horrible ! ! ! horrible ! !	1023
1	large cheese pizza $ 6.00 plus awesome ! pizza is actually very good and ca n't beat the deal . will definitely be going there every time i 'm in pittsburgh .	662
1	i got the chicken bryan . massive portion ! good food at an affordable price . the service was great , our server was very patient with us .	873
1	i interviewed this business to take over my vacation home rentals in scottsdale . kim and her crew jumped right in and have been doing such an amazing job . my condos are spotless and kim is a pleasure to work with . i ca n't tell you how hard it is to find quality , reliable people so i feel super blessed to have found house spouse . a+++++	2029
0	i was very disappointed in the customer service that i received from jiffy lube . i went in with a coupon for a 29.99 oil change and walked out pay $ 80 for services that were not discussed beforehand . when dealing with mechanic 's i 've always been skeptical and this place did not change my mind . i am in need of an honest mechanic that is n't required by their employeer to upcharge the customer . i will never return to this place again .	2086
0	another bs mexican joint with worthless owners and employees , takes 30 minutes to get crap food .	857
1	anthony , matt and the rest of the reps at this location are the best . knowledgeable , friendly . great service. ! ! 10 +	1237
0	closed . went there today for lunch , was told rent went unpaid and staff was told friday that sat . was the last day open .	1529
0	this guy should find a different job where he does not come into contact with people . rude	2005
0	do n't ever buy a seat in the last row of their reserve seating theater . the seats do n't recline and the seats themselves are very uncomfortable . they 're small and the seat is short . you feel like you 're falling out of it .	491
1	i 'm a fan of jasmine buffet . you have to go with reasonable expectations though . there is always a lot of selection and most of the selections are fresh and tasty . they have a lot of seafood choices at night and on the weekends but i 'm not a fan of seafood . the sushi selection is nothing to rave about but it 's there . i 've never had a problem with service or the food .	1302
0	i called the clinic and asked what time they close and what is the latest time i can bring my cat for the appointment . they said that they open until 8pm and latest i can bring her at 7.50pm . however , when i show up that same day at 6.20sh with my stressed cat ( cats hate travels ) they told me that there is no doctor in facility ( doctor left at 6pm ) and that they are open until 7pm . that is unacceptable	3030
1	after we built our bbq island we looked all over the valley for quality outdoor bar stools . we were pleased to find patio star . not only did they have a good selection of quality bar stools we were also able to customize the cushions and lumbar pillows to tie into our existing outdoor furniture . the pricing was great . we actually also purchased an end table and cantilever umbrella also . the store kept us up to date on the progress of our order and it was delivered promptly .	2389
1	got a nice little tattoo from jesse . he did an excellent job and charged a little amount ! everything in the shop is really clean , and they take pride in their work . i am super stoked on my tattoo , and if i lived here i would definitely be going back !	2192
0	we ended up leaving arrowhead after about 3 years . my daughter is extremely afraid of the dentist . despite her history , they would refuse to let me go back with her until she was already freaking out . then they would let me come back . on top of that , i was made to feel like there was a problem with my parenting skills because of her anxiety . we switched to a new dentist who does n't have a problem letting parents stay with their kids-her first visit went extremely well .	1951
0	this company is a joke when i purchased the service they told me that if i move to transfer the service was going to be free . but they never told me that another 3year contract will start so when i moved i was shocked to learn that i had to pay $ 350 to install the service and my monthly was going to go up . i am very dissspointed since i only had one year left in the contract and knowing that they were not respecting the contract to me it was very unprofessional and unfair . i was going to renew the service but with this experience i 'll go somewhere else .	45
1	stopped in for lunch to grab a burger and beer . this place is legit . a great beer selection and the burger was awesome . as someone who used to work at a burger bar as a cook , believe me when i say the kitchen knows what it 's doing .	1046
1	the staff at caswells is very helpful and friendly . it is a little frustrating that there always seems to be an hour wait to get a shooting lane and to reserve a lane over the phone you have to be a member . while it is difficult to find ammo these days , they always seem to have ammo to use for their range . their pricing is fair and they have plenty of accessories to look at while waiting for a lane .	1128
1	i had some designer biker jeans that i needed taken in about 2 inches and she did a phenomenal job especially considering they had no inseam for her to work with . will definitely be coming back	3015
0	rude , lazy staff , and it 's a dangerous store . people get stabbed here . look it up .	1626
1	if u are renting a car & have a problem , stop & read this ! we had an accident & these people are the best in timely taking care of the problem & in price . i can not say enough kind words about this company . if u need a friend in las vegas to fix your car , go & see bumper medic !	2537
1	the best value next to cheap bottled water on the strip and a good place to ground yourself back to reality after paying up the nose for everything else ... but i 'm not so sure that makes sense since chipotle as a whole has always been a tad more expensive than other tex-mex fare . oh well . a burrito bowl here was cheaper than in nyc and it was centrally located .	214
0	got a haircut at manking grooming . not impressed ! the guy was nice but he totally screwed up my neckline . one side is rounded while the other one is a straight line that goes one inch higher then the other side , very weird . the worst neckline i had in years ! ! including tips it cost me $ 60 ! i will never go there again .	584
1	shaved ice was pretty good and fun . the food was also pretty yummy . just wish their dinner combos did n't end so early ( 8pm ) . if you 're planning to go fri/sat prepared to wait .	176
1	i 've visited this store many times and always fine the employees to be incredibly helpful . on my most recent trip i was in a hurry and pretty grumpy from an incident in the parking lot . even though i was n't happy or nice , ( i was n't mean either ) i was treated with respect and helped to get the items i was looking for , this really shows their commitment to great customer service . this store is always a pleasure to visit . thank you for always giving great service .	1884
0	i was craving for something healthy and from outside it looked good . although my boyfriend told me not go because he did n't like it i wanted to try it anyway . but i should have listened to him ... really disappointing , i wonder how you can fail making an acaï bowl without tasting acaï . too expensive for what it is , not worth trying . sorry !	9
1	located at meadows mall . depending on the time of day , this mall can get pretty crowded . plan accordingly for parking . i love jcp ! great place to shop for work clothes . they always have great sales and tons of coupons to use . today i went in right when they opened . the store was in perfect order and i received excellent customer service today . cora assisted with clothes and myliza was most helpful in the jewelry section . both were extremely knowledgeable and friendly . this location also has a sephora inside of it which is my weakness . great experience today . thanks ladies .	1536
0	one out of the five work trucks i had done sounds like wind is coming through . the other issue i had was that safelite forces you to take it to a body shop to fix more than 24 cu/in of rust . i think safelite should have people on the team know how to handle these repairs so as to not cost me thousands of dollars having a truck down for 3 days impeding my service with my business . very upset with this .	1988
1	amazing food ! i had the curry chicken and it was seasoned perfectly ! the ambiance is very chill . they have changed their address to 1334 n scottsdale road however it is in the same plaza as the old location . will def be coming back ! ! !	1325
0	we were passing through the area on our way back from hoover dam . i ordered a combination plate with a chicken enchilada and a chicken taco . the food was indifferent and the service was poor . the only saving grace were the chips and salsa . avoid .	340
1	robert is amazing in the liquor section ! ! he saved me with my christmas dinner wine selection ! plus i got double the bottles for the same price !	2201

1	scottsdale cab was awesome ! i needed a ride from my hotel to the airport so i could get back to portland , or for a client meeting . i was met by a comfortable car ( on time , too , which is pretty uncommon in my experience ! ) , free coffee from starbucks , and wifi ! holy moly ! talk about treating a customer well ! i got a ton of work done on the way to catch my plane ( ( brought my laptop ) so i was prepared for my meeting before i even hit the airport . i slept the whole way home . thanks , guys ! ! i 'll be sure to hit you up again !	52
1	this is a good place if you forgot to pick something up and it 's the middle of the night . they do have a lot of stuff.. including almond milk and greek yogurt . not bad if you 're in a pinch . that being said , not a nice vibe or ambience and some of the cashiers are really unfriendly . i would n't do my main shopping here but it 's nice to have it in the neighbourhood .	682
1	jeff was awesome ! i called him today for help with a roofing question for my client and he was able to get me my answer within the hour . so he gets my 5 stars for amazing customer service today .	3097
0	today was the last time that i will receive poor customer service at this pet store . i have gone there many times and have had sub-par service but the kid today was super rude . i will not go back . if i need special food i will go to the stock shop off thunderbird and 67th ave . they are always friendly and helpful and carry most to the same brands . they are a bit further away for me , but will drive the distance to avoid the bad attitudes of these people .	1775
1	loved the flavors and variety . the display is mouth watering . the owner is friendly and makes all her own recipes .	3611
0	complete assholes , came in to look at some things and run numbers and came across the worst employees ever . play games with numbers waste your time and have a cynical attitude . one prick even had the nerve to lowkey call me stupid . go fuck yourself bro , you 're a grown ass man selling dirt bikes . get a real job you uneducated swine . they slander their competition , and claim they can get better deals , worst most generic sales tactic ever . save yourself the trouble and time and go to ride now . come here if you want to be treated like shit and overpay for everything .	195
1	good food / nicely presented . friendly staff and a good selection of beers . you have to look for it because of the shopping plaza location , but definitely worth finding .	1253
0	do n't take your bike here . i took my r1 to get flush mount lights and a denali air horn put on . $ 169 later and i really mean later . it took them 3 hours ! ! ! it took the mechanic 1 hour to put one flush mount light on ... like seriously dude ? ? ? i put flush mounts on my last bike myself and know it 's fairly easy . i just wanted to find a good mechanic cause they were close to my home . they lost a customer who wanted to come back .	3702
0	i do not know why this business has such high ratings ! love the location , but have to say there are far better burrito restaurants not far away . i say hop back on the street car and head a few blocks either east or west on queen st. e. for a shot at really great burritos .	31
1	really thorough , conscientious job ! ! ! they kept in good communication and did everything i asked for . deep clean .	897
1	this place is excellent ! we were in vegas for a sports tournament . we needed a small and quick early morning breakfast . we did n't want a big buffet breakfast because it would weigh us down for the tournament . this place was perfect for us . the bagels were great . we got the farmhouse and it was plenty big and tasty . the coffee was excellent too . we will definitely come back here the next time we are in town and need a good morning bite to eat before a tournament .	1214
0	not a very clean place , and the espresso is really underwhelming and bitter . the crepes are tasty , but a lot of the menu items are deceiving . the owner told me her muffins and soup were homemade , however , she later admitted that they are both purchased at costco . it 's unfortunate that independent cafe 's are not interested in supporting other independent bakeries/products . overall , the atmosphere and food were not worth a trip back .	3684
0	the food was good ; portions very small . i had a salad that should have been listed as a `` side '' item and way overpriced at $ 9.00 ... nothing special about the salad and not worth more than $ 5 ; my husband had the pork paprikash and liked it but definitely left hungry due to small portion ... the pork came with no sides .	1463
0	the staff was extremely rude ! i had questions and they made me wait 5 minutes to ask and then looked at me as if i was stupid for asking questions . the doctor was pretty rude but he did a nice job on my teeth . can definitely use an attitude adjust here	1021
1	this new location is much nicer than the previous one , the service is great , nice decor , excellent staff and most of all the quality of the food	523
1	came in from out of town and really enjoyed this place last night . the crowd , ambience and service were all great . great hookahs at a reasonable price . check it out . you wo n't be disappointed .	3634
0	this store sucks . management needs to get the sales clerks all on the same page . one employee tells me i can use a coupon for $ 10 off of $ 25 , pretax , another tells me the $ 25 needs to be the post tax amount . my total ... $ 24.90 . what can i buy for 10 motherfuckin cents ? ? ?	223
1	denny 's has great prices and decent service . this location has good parking and is close to where i live . keep in mind there is also a waffle house and cracker barrell basically next door so they need to stay on their game to compete . denny 's is a franchise and nothing is very unique about this location . but they do it right so they get 4 stars from me .	346
1	i read alot of reviews about dr. tyre which made me real iffy about seeing her.. i showed up at 8:30 my apt was at 9 , i got seen around 9:15.. so was n't to bad of a wait she answered all my questions and concerns . did n't feel rushed at all . so far a good dr. !	3059
0	if i could give 0 stars i would waited 40 minutes in photo for none to come out finally i walked out service there is garbage i would n't ever recommend anyone to go waste their time or money there .	2843
0	do n't work with this company . they promise you the world and dont deliver . i should have done my research better about them . i had use my staff to finish their work . i replaced a roof with them , and when they claimed they were done , plumbing was left unconnected , electric contacts were sprayed all over , my tenants had over spray from their product , the stucco work was un even and crooked . i can go on for pages . this company does not care about the client except for filling their own pocket . dont work with them !	2725
1	we came here as part of the nosh las vegas food tour . we had been to the location at monte carlo and enjoyed it , but coming as part of a tour forced us to try things that we would n't normally order . that 's a good thing ! we tried the sausage and peppers pizza ( sausage , peppers and onions with red sauce ) and the tartufo ( truffle cheese , arugula and mushrooms ) . both were really tasty . each pizza would probably be good split between two people with a salad to share as well . you ca n't beat how fast the pizza cooks and that the wait is very short .	282
1	pretty good ! kalbi tang , sul lang tang , dul bok kee were all tasty and decent prices . would go again .	1290
1	i do n't eat thai food a lot so i ca n't tell whether it 's authentic or not , but the food is really good . really miss dry noodles a lot and pad thai is just soo good ! also miss spicy food and ca n't believe 3 is almost too much for me ! okay will still try 3 next time caz the hot feeling in your mouth is sooo wonderful . very thai style environment and nice staff as a whole . the only inconvenience is you need to go to the counter to check out	895
0	monster ich . it 's medication resistant . avoid them at all costs !	1078
1	really like coming here . the tea is fantastic and everyone that works here always has a smile on their face . thank you !	3238
0	the place was nice and decorated super cute.. but . i 'm sure there 's girls here that are really good but the one i had was horrible ! ! i asked for an overlay because my nails grow long by themselves and she kept burning me with the drill and shaped my nails uneven and ugly.. like , they 're all different . the acrylic is bumpy and not smooth.. i paid for the services but did n't tip her.. i wo n't be coming back here .	2326
1	this facility is great . the staff is incredibly caring and insighful . i was seen quickly , treated effectively and felt genuinely cared for the entire time i was there . dr. rhoton is very compassionate and so was all the staff i worked with . hopefully i do n't have to go back anytime soon but the next emergency i have i hope i 'm in the neighborhood .	350
0	nice place to hang , internet , fireplace , glass of wine ect . however , if you are looking for coffee , well the wine was better than the coffee . have a fully automated machines and making more of swiss coffee than real espresso .	2163
1	after living two years in peru , i always like scouting out peruvian restaurants wherever i travel . this place was one of the best and most authentic i have tried . we are going back . we have tried the tallarines verdes , aji de gallina , bistec a lo pobre , and the causa and it was all delicious	927
0	came here for a simple chain clean lube and tighten service . found when bike was finished the chain was super tight no slack whatsoever and walked back in and they told me that oh its because these bikes are complicated like the suzuki .i brought my 2014 s1000rr . i have always done service on all my bikes just no time to do it this time and when i asked for the name of the tech that did it the first time they would n't give it to me . i do n't know if i will trust this place with any major service for my bike a simple chain adjustment was too hard . then idk about this place	195
0	our server was the least attentive person i think i have ever met . i am guessing she was too absorbed by her flirtation with her coworker to do her job . i had a crispy chicken sandwich which lived up to its name . there was some fairly dried chicken and a lot of very seriously deep fried batter . it was n't the worst thing i have ever eaten but it was pretty lacklustre . my fries were warmish and spongy . this meal gave me serious heartburn . the best thing i can say about this place is it affords a great view of the toronto skyline .	2205
0	decent food , horrible service . three of us went . we all got our food at different times . my aunt was done eating before i was served . and i was halfway done before they brought mom 's out . had to ask to get refills on water until we were leaving and once the waiter dropped off the check he disappeared . so unless you are going to the movies or bowling there just do n't eat there . even then , you might try the deli . so different than primarily prime rib .	1255
1	i wanted to commend a few employees at this container store location . i hope i have all of the names correctly . two employees assisted me , one at the register and one in the closet section . laurie s. and allison were both really nice and knowledgeable . two employees that helped me take the products to the car that were also very helpful and friendly were karli and linda . also , an extra thank you to the manager shari for her help as well . thanks again to these employees for all of their assistance .	2716
0	i can honestly say this was the worst meal i have had in a long time . i 'll just give you the highlights . ambiance , looks like a construction zone , waitress/bartender , very nice but totally understaffed food wait , way too long i actually wish i took a picture of the fries . they were black ! lol once they go black , we tried to send em back lol ... she was to busy to even check on us . the four us us agreed we would never go back . this was our 2nd friday dinner choice ... should of gone for the mesa grill . this morning my stomach was cramping pretty hard . warning , avoid this place !	130
1	the service tech was polite on time and very knowledgeable ! i highly recommend all desert ! from customer service to their tech 's highly professional ! ! keep it up ! ! jules	3885
0	the absolute worst establishment iv ever been in , walked in , never got greeted , and a couple game in 5 min later and they got menus and a drink order before we were even acknowledged , they were busy so i get that , but to be greeted after is horrible , i asked for the manager , who was the person that didnt greet us first ! ! and i told her and all she had to say was `` yeah it got busy '' , and then walked away , didnt even get waters or anything , employees were working super hard and i think they should be replacing that manager because she is awful	882
0	i lost my jewelry in their spa and i went back to look for but people do n't care about it and their attitude is really bad . i am a chinese so maybe they think i am not native and they just do n't care about me , i called the police and try to reach their manager , they told me they can not give me manager 's phone number because it is privacy and their manager is on vacation , bullshit privacy they are bunch of racist ! and thieves ! ! ! ! bad bad bad service bad people racist took my jewelry it is worth 10,000dollars	154
0	only reason i 'm giving it this rating is when i came to the park the lights in the kids area were off and it was dark when it was burly 7pm	3471
1	i love the way the store is set up its so fast and convienent not to big to grocery shop especially . i m so grateful for living near the store im going to shop here weekly !	3810
1	i 've lived in the area 42 years now . this was one of my 1st pizza loves , and all these years later , still my favorite . always delicious pizza , hoagies are awesome too . as lots of pizza places have come and gone over the years , casa still is here and i hope they are many years to come . i usually do n't care to write reviews , however i tried another local pizza place recently and regretted it yet again . all that did was make me question why i bothered ? should have ordered here !	425
1	we have been going siena since 2012 . we have always been very , very happy with the caring and compassionate doctors and staff there . dr. keeney and her techs have been with us through the joy and tears of fur baby parenthood . we would not consider going to another office ... our expectations are exceeded at siena !	1700
1	this is my regular lunch stop when i am in stow . the food is fantastic . there is n't an item on the menu i have n't had and have n't enjoyed . come for the food , but stay for the shakes . if that is n't your thing go for the root beer on tap . it 's the best in town . the monthly food specials keep the menu interesting . the absolute best aspect of retro dog is the staff . i have n't met a better crew anywhere else . in short , this place receives two lion fists up from voltron .	953
0	i had high hopes for bush 's chicken . i was hoping it would be a better version of raising cane 's but instead it was a lesser version of kfc . we walked in and were welcomed with a pungent oily greasy smell that was off-putting . we were the only ones in line and were not greeted by anyone for the 5+ minutes we were looking at the menu . the prices were n't bad but the gizzard meals on the menu mixed with the awful smell made us walk out and not eat here . i have no desire to go back .	862
0	we 've visited other ghengis grills before and have always had good experiences . we were in the matthews area and decided to give this one a try . although the place wasnt very busy , we were greeted with slow service , the server never smiled or said `` thank you '' or `` you 're welcome , '' the floors were sticky , the bathroom was a mess , and there were missing ingredients on the buffet line . needless to say , we wo n't be returning to this location .	209
1	used this company many times , factory certified for most brands . never have to wait more than a day for service call , friendly , affordable , and very knowledgeable technicians . and very flexible on appointment times . a must use in the charlotte and surrounding area !	722
0	by far the worst place for breakfast on this side of town ! it took them an hour to get our food out ... our food was cold so it had to be sent back and remade that took another 25 minutes ! ! i 'm pretty sure the manager there was high on something because when she came to apologize for the bad service she could barely hold still..we 've gone there twice and this is our last ! i do not recommend this restaurant	672
1	first review on yelp and first time at wing time and let me tell you it 's soooo good ! we got a 40 piece party pack which was good for 4 of us to share and all the flavored were great ! the taste of asia had a pho essence and my favorite lemon pepper was also so good we also got garlic parmesan , hot and mild as well and they were also tasty . the texas toast was also buttery goodness and the fries were crispy and salted just right . we will definitely be back here soon ! ! !	1397
0	this store carries low end brands and a lot of the shoes were dirty . do yourself a favor and skip it .	1446
0	wings were fine as was the service but prices are stupid . cost $ 18 for 12 wings and one beer . oh , also cost .89 for one ranch dressing to go with the order of wings , not for extra ranch but for one to go with my wings . cheap bastards , ranch comes with the order , not an add-on as also does carrots and celery . native is going to open back up across the street so you might want to pickup your game .	1395
0	i was a little thrown off . i usually expect to see sriracha and hoisin sauce prepared on the tables when i go out for pho . i had a hard time with the waitress trying to get the correct sauces brought to our table because she did n't really speak english . i asked for a vegetarian dish - vegetarian spring rolls on vermicelli , but the dish was served with chopped bacon on top ! my friend ordered a pork chop with rick . pork chop was tasty , rice was dry	511
1	really good gelato ! my favorite was the tiramisu gelato ! it was a perfect balance of flavor and smoothness . the chocolate was good too if you are looking for something basic . the bananas foster was a little bit too banana-y for me . i could only eat a few bites before the flavor was overwhelming . i really disliked the white chocolate macadamia crunch . it had a weird , unpleasant aftertaste . try the tiramisu flavor !	3735
1	i just saw the show at the westgate so i 'm not sure if i 'm leaving the right review up in the right place but i thought the show was great i love birds and that was a great performer	865
1	great customer service , easy process , highly recommend using this storage facility . the place is very clean , they have specials for holiday weekends so be on the look out . but overall a great experience .	1857
0	wow i did not think it could be that bad but it is . i got a margarita and the pizza has not taste despite supposedly having fresh mozzarella , basil , tomatoes sauce on it . i taste bread and salt . the sauce is watered down and runny . the cheese is lunpy and inconsistent additional toppings are a 1.50 . i am glad i got none . well i guess i will keep the pizza for my am hangover . it has two stars for the staff and free gelato .	282
0	this place does not honor what they quote over the telephone . the man who works in the front was very rude to me . i had a decent pedicure but walked out mid session while getting a full set . i do not recommend this place .	415
1	after years of being kind of satisfied with the services provided on my hair , i finally broke down and did some research and ended up at alchemy for an appointment with ally . i loved everything about this experience -- -great music and great conversation . ally was so knowledgeable on color and cut . and i walked out feeling like a million bucks . the staff in general are super nice and down to earth people . i can not wait to go back ! you guys are the absolute best ! ! thanks ' ! ! ! my hair finally does n't suck anymore ! ! !	3631
0	haircut was fine but they are not good with time . expect to wait at least 30-40 mins after your appointment time.. no respect of your customer 's time	3610
0	went there on a friday night , but they were closed . that stinks . who is closed on friday night .	1583
1	we started at dynamics two years ago & we have had such a great experience . love the staff & the environment . love how you can sit & watch your kids & not have to look through a small window . have & will continue to recommend dynamics to people .	1106
0	i took my partner for his birthday there last night for dinner and drinks . it was such a waste of time and money ! ! the server was slow and the food was horrible ! we had the super gooey chimmy and it was almost raw . what a way to ruin a birthday dinner . thanks gringos ! ! ! ! never will i ever go again and will spread the word ! !	704
1	i love love love this place , my husband is not really in to indian food but he always eats everything up from this place . we originally found it on groupon , the first time we went it seemed very slow ( for dinner ) but this last time it seemed steady . they have a great wine selection we ended up ordering two bottles . also the food is amazing . best indian i 've had in vegas . i love the large selection of naan bread ! the servers are great and professional , i can not wait to go back !	600
1	this is our second time ordering from here . excellent pizza as well as the garlic knots ! i would have given 5 stars but i thought the wings were a tad too soggy from our first experience .	1399
0	someone recently commented on most recent review and then deleted it . i never said that i brought beers on to the course . please read my review again . if you think that i stuttered please try reading one word at a time . my experience at this course sucked and if you have a problem with that please message me . this course does n't care about their alleged `` one off problems '' because i have never heard from them . once again it is modern golf course management at its best . cheers and good luck to you . good day .	2236
1	heather is awesome and funny . my wife is the reason why i get pedicures in the first place . i recommend anyone getting a mani or pedi to see heather .	2390
1	this place is pretty legit ! really busy during lunch time . i got the pad thai and during lunch time it comes with soup and an eggroll . the sauce is a little sweeter than what i 'm used to but still great flavor and exactly what i would expect and a pad thai .	895
1	i was attending the action on film megafest and a number of the films were showing here . love the reclining seats , swiveling trays and concession items . also , nice to have some cocktails available in the evening . the staff was very friendly and helpful . my only complaint was with the sound levels in theater 3 which made it difficult to view some films .	491
1	i love this pizza ! very authentically italian ! i will have this pizza every time i come to vegas ! it is the best .	282
1	tommy guns is great place to get your hair cut . i 've been quite a few times and they always go out of their way to make sure my haircut is great . the hairstylists there take their time to make sure your haircut is just the way you want it . they 're always willing to talk and man do they give good head massages when they 're washing your hair .	226
1	cute place ! do think it needs a bigger menu and a wider selection of times . when i hear `` grocery , '' i 'm expecting a wider range of french items of the sort i bought while living in france that you ca n't get here ( cute yogurts , orangina , etc ) . cheese selection could definitely be expanded too . big focus on wine currently . also think their current hours are unrealistically short for the sort of place they are trying to be . it 's a new business and i want to see it succeed so i will continue to patronize and hope they work on growing/expanding the selection !	1160
1	ladies ! ! ! this is the place to be on sunday nights because the ratio of men to women is about 5 to 1. they play the usual mix of hip hop/80s . when `` party like a rockstar '' comes on , the club goes crazy ! it gets crowded but i had a blast here .	3596
0	i came in to get my legs waxed and when i left she left wax all over my legs even though i asked her to remove it . not only this but she still did n't pull out all of my leg hair ... there was plenty of stubble left . would not recommend this place .	1051
1	a nerdy kids dream ! lots of hands on exhibits that are lots of fun	3891
1	i really love this store . great prices and the furniture is very nice . i purchased a gorgeous counter top table with four chairs . easy to put together . i like the fact that they offer same day pick up . the young man at the pick up station made sure our table was secure in our car and was courteous . i will be back for more pieces .	2071
0	i called in and made a reservation for me and my girlfriend and then when we showed up they said they did n't have a reservation for us and we 're full . i double checked that i called the right number and it was correct . they did n't care at all and we 're very rude about it . i was super excited to try the new place but am incredibly disappointed about the experience and the customer service . never going back .	1288
0	she was nice and had the alteration done promptly for a good price when no one else had time . it looked good enough , but i used to sew and did not consider the alteration to be done quite as professionally as i was hoping for , especially given that it was a designer dress for a special occasion .	1818
0	pretty big size restaurant inside . did not appear that way from outside . service was attentive . food portion sizes are big . we had orange chicken , eggplant and vegetable with garlic sauce , scallop with garlic sauce . but the food tasted pretty bad . they were supposed to spicy , but in reality not at all . the quality was poor . chilli paste appeared to be very old and bland . i would not go back for food again . .	237
0	i dont even know where to start , cdc pools is unreliable , the communication is horrible , scheduling was a nightmare , to the point i had to get upset with them , we were told 4 weeks it took 9 weeks , ruined my yard were they stored a self made 'water pit'.our pool still does not run properly , and we have notified them several times and no one has gotten back to us . our firepit that was installed is faulty , still waiting for that to be replaced . i am so diappointed in cdc as a company . look else where , avoid the headache & frustration of dealing with cdc pools !	659
0	their clothes are okay . some of the stuff is tacky , but some is pretty cute . the problem is the quality of the merchandise . i had browsed here a few times , but it was n't until my most recent visit that i tried stuff on . everything felt like burlap , and made me feel like i was having an allergic reaction . although the prices are cheap-ish , they are still too high for the quality of the clothes . i ca n't imagine wearing such uncomfortable stuff !	3121
1	this is my new favorite taco spot in the valley . the food is great , staff is friendly , prices are more than fair , and i love the atmosphere .	562
0	i wanted to actually like this place.. but its highly disappointing as well as insultive when the manager comes to your table ( when you let your wait person know you are dissatisfied with your order ) and he tries to convince you your order was made correctly and there 's no issues.. uhhh really ! ? ? total miss ... i 'll pass on the pizza.. thanks but no thanks.. i 'm not paying for what i wanted i 'm now paying for your mediocre ! !	705
1	went for lunch with my family on a saturday afternoon . the place was very clean , and you order at the front . this was my first time at one of these franchises . we enjoyed our food . my daughter got a quesadilla with tons of cheese ! when i went to fill the horchata , the lever got stuck and it went everywhere . lol ! we will be back for more . do n't know why we waited so long to try this place out . by the way , i did have the vegetarian burrito and it was very good . my only complaint is that their hot sauce is weak .	1194
0	i came here with my mother for coffee slightly before the dinner hour . the espresso machine at chabichou was broken so the boulevard cafe seemed like an okay option . i ca n't speak for the food but it was the single worst cup of coffee i have ever had , and that is saying something . it literally tasted like my americano was made out of yesterdays dishwater , totally flavourless . unless you count yucky-blahness as a flavor . the service was good . it was nice of them to seat us just for coffee so close to the dinner rush , but come on guys . you 'd think a restaurant like this could serve up something better then sludge .	1271
0	meh . if the ingredients were a little fresher and the recipes are a little healthier , it would be worth a review . msg me ! ( no , please do n't )	0
1	always great haircuts ! i just wanted to give a shout out to steph . this homeless women walked in and said she had no money and wanted a haircut . steph stepped up and `` said no problem . i 'll do it for you . '' the lady was so happy and surprised . it made me happy to see that there 's still good people in this world . awesome !	2591
1	i 'll give this place 5 stars because i read the other reviews and i think people are way too picky and get a little too serious about their nails ! it 's supposed to be a relaxing , pampering experience ... just relax a little and let the nail tech do their job without critiquing every little detail ! i am just finishing up my 'luxury ' pedicure with ann , and it lived up to its name . very luxurious and relaxing . i 'd come back !	3948
1	my favorite local bar ! ! very friendly and attentive bartenders , inexpensive drinks , and delicious food .	1080
0	arrogant , ignorant staff . ridiculously inflated prices for range time and ammo . narrow lanes , narrow shelves for your guns and magazines . they think they are doing you a favor by letting you shoot there . typical lake norman snobbery . what more do you need to know . lots of other shooting options now .	3936
0	-10 love dickey 's in texas so we thought we 'd try at home and for the love of god ppl this is crap ! we order 42 $ worth of meat and sides paid for 3 meat plater and got 2 . half of the sides we ordered are wrong . when my wife picked up the order the ppl behind the counter were making fun of customers .	966
0	the service was super slow and the waitress was not attentive or even polite . the food was not good . had steamed broccoli as a side and every piece was brown . the burger was overcooked and had a weird taste . every aspect of our experience here was terrible . we wo n't be going back . it is a shame , because we have been to other red robin locations in the past , and they were always excellent . not sure why this one is so bad .	1323
0	the staff were pretty nice , but this place needs a major makeover . i used to bring my son here 4 yrs ago when it was still clean and decent looking . now the pool area smells like mold , the water is murky , and the bathroom is soo dirty . management needs to step it up to keep this place clean cause i can not be having my kids swim in a facility this dirty . kids swallow water all the time when they 're learning to swim , i fear for them getting sick here . its too bad cause i would bring my son here again but its too dirty for me	2856
1	the manager is a great guy and provides a welcoming atmosphere and very good service . i have rented here many times and have always been treated kindly and fairly .	3024
0	rent here , do n't own . refrigerator has quit working 3 times . management refused to do anything about it even though we called in time . told to wait until sat or sun . meantime food is spoiling . management attempted to refer us to renter 's insurance instead of repairing . management rude and unwilling to provide any level of customer service . when maintenance man came over he attempted to enter without knocking . i work in the multi-housing industry and this is the worse example of customer service i have ever witnessed .	617
1	went there the first time for myself and was not disappointed . they are very honest and upfront , and wait time was minimal . second time was for my granddaughter . called first and probably got the nicest lady ever that helped me with multiple questions . got there and was in-and-out in a flash . extremely helpful . this will be the place we go to from now on . they all deserve xmas presents .	2517
1	had to bring my grandma fabric shopping for her birthday . this place is amazing . the owner is soooo nice and very helpful . the store is very clean and open . i ca n't wait to go back .	3136
1	great happy hour . reasonable prices . pizza is thin but good . and the wings are great	1520
0	the worst sns nails i have ever gotten . i never write reviews but i had to write this one . the guy who did them even knew it was messed up and blamed the polish instead of himself . will not be back .	2197
1	friendly helpful service . plenty of options . we loaded up on the dried cranberries . for those who appreciate fine cheese , this shop packs locatelli . which packs an extremely sharp and salty flavor . the staff just sort of brushed it off as common place but i can assure it it not . this is the first whole foods that i have found outside of central california that carries it . great for pasta dishes . easily located within the district outside of green valley ranch and casino .	433
0	they have a large selection of items . prices are okay . trade counter is absolutely ridiculous . there is no reason for 10 records , and 3 games should take 3 hours to evaluate . plus i understand that they are in the business of making money , but offering 16 dollars for 100.00+ dollars worth of merchandise is not okay .	2115
0	no it was fixed for a day or two . but just like everything here at onnix it 's fixed and then it goes back to how it was . why do n't you fix things for good and stop with the excuses and the whole `` i 'm going to put in a maintainer request '' and maybe actually hire professionals to get the job done correctly the first time ?	3148
0	very horrible i found alley cat with kittens and person on the phone said i should have let them stay outside and die very rude do n't do n't donate this place	1980
0	this place is terrible at booking . they re scheduled me 5 times because the doctor `` was n't in '' how can you re schedule me on a day that the doctor `` is n't in '' multiple times ? ? the stuff they give you for acne works but there 's just terrible staff in there .	3598
0	will tow your car even if it 's registered . loud , dirty , and the most untrained front desk staff i have ever seen . security plays favorites and does n't always quiet down some apartments , not worth the money ever .	748
0	i have to change my rating because it 's been 4 months the and i have not received the film that i was promised .	1852
1	omni was great ! this was my brother and sister-in-law 's first trip to las vegas and i wanted to make it special for them . the driver arrived on time in the baggage area with a tablet with the names of my brother and sister-in-law on it . my sister-in-law loved that ! the car was immaculate . our driver took care of all of the luggage and was very personable and polite . i had to call omni to give them the names of my brother and his wife inasmuch as they had my name and the operator politely made the change to ensure that the signage was correct at the airport . i can not recommend omni highly enough !	2901
1	had the shop recommended by a friend back in early '13 ... johnny did an awesome job and knocked out work on both forearms in one sitting . no problems at all and they both healed up much quicker than previous ( non-johnny vegas ) work i 'd had done on the east cast . easy to deal with and everything else you 'd hope for in your tattoo shop . headed back out to the west coast next week and looking to add two more to the collection . on to vegas for the weekend !	3910
0	steak and prawn burrito was possibly the worst burrito that i have ever eaten . tasteless .	623
0	they are closed sundays ! i know this does n't make sense since they list sunday hours . if they did n't show sunday hours you might save you time and not walk there since they wo n't be open and then you would n't have wasted your time . however , that 's asking a lot . you ca n't spend money here on sundays because no one is here to take it even though they list sunday operating hours .	438
1	all i can say is wow ! ! another great job completed by dynamite this time at west mesa bargain storage ! i have worked with dynamite for at least 7 years on several projects from hoa projects to storage facilities and have had nothing but excellent results from the planning stage to the completed project . karri is very accommodating and richard is very knowledgeable . the teams that have been assigned to my projects have always been polite , and courteous and careful .	1850
0	came in at 8:15 on a saturday evening . the hostess , who was leaning over her stand slurping on a drink informed us that they were closed . the sign outsides reads 9 pm as the closing time . she did n't even have the courtesy to fully stand up to greet us.how rude and sloppy of a presentation . the place must make a killing if they can close 45 minutes early on a saturday . i understand seating the last table at 8:45 but 8:15 ? why not close at 8 then . horrible customer service and at that point i would rather throw my money at a chain fast food place then try to support a small business .	340
1	cheap buffet , but does n't have a big variety of food . the food is very good although it is very americanized . this place has been around for many years and if you 're craving cheap food this is one of the best places in the area ! i do think they need to switch out the food some more , sometimes there tends to be cold food laying around or dishes that are finished and are not replaced quickly enough , specially for lunch . overall , i highly recommend this restaurant ! it wo n't let you down !	167
0	got a weird vibe that the lady did n't want to give me a loan . she is an elder middle eastern lady , she seemed real nice and kind at first but , her attitude just got worse by the second , and then she was being rude . rude	3683
0	i will start by saying that i love these dentists and im sad i wont be returning . they have a $ 100 cancellation policy if you cancel less than 48 hours . when your appt is on a monday and a mandatory meeting comes up friday , there is no way to give 48 hours given the weekends dont count into that time . its too bad they want to lose patients over this : (	2576
0	by far the worst airline i have ever flown with . three hour delay . not updates from the cabin . rude flight attendants . will never fly this airline again .	1623
0	chicken pad thai horrible ! pink dry chicken ? ? ? took one taste and the rest went to my garbage can . wo n't go back ever !	1203
0	you guys remember the youtube video where the verizon representative could not remember the difference between a megabyte and a gigabyte . it was like that but with trampolines .	3173
0	there are no vacuums . the wash is strong but not that strong . there are alternatives as this is just an exterior wash and go . not worthy of 8.00 in my opinion when there are neighboring competitors that offer vacuums for 1/2 of this cost	1102
1	brent took great care of me after the customer service number disconnected me on the wrong date ! one call to him and i was reconnected less than 24 hours later . if you have any centurylink issues or any office/home that you need wifi , cable , etc go here to their arcadia location and see brent . he 's the man .	3748
1	awesome , great , fantastic , rich & creamy ! ! ! loved the cappuccino ice-cream and the coconut was good as well .	3606
1	my service advisor david scott and antoine in the service area are so awesome to deal with ! always make sure they can answer any questions i have . especially love that antoine always is smiling ! makes for a great visit !	2210
0	this place did not help me at all every little bit of help i asked for they looked at me like i was stupid and they 're very rude i hope everyone in the pharmacy gets fired	3937
1	came by waiting on a business near by to open . very surprise for breakfast . great people working here . very friendly just on spot . fresh fruit bacon just right . mimosa were just right wish it was close to my house . 75 miles away	696
0	salad was good but the 25 minute wait was painful . if you do n't order online prepare to sit awhile . i saw people that ordered online , got their orders quick , however they had to wait too , but not as long . i was almost late coming back from my lunch . it 's going to take some time and rethinking before i come back . bottom line : food is good but the wait is horrible .	1494
0	i tried to go watch sinister 2 with brother and sister and the girl at the front didnt wan na let me watch it but i was 18 ? makes no sense	1240
1	on the 2nd floor in palazzo , right by elevators to guest rooms resort fee gets you a free daily paper ( i got la times ) ; show your room key & give your room # & last name they serve lavazza coffee	2397
0	i am updating my review based on my last three experiences at boulevard cafe . while the food remains excellent , the service has gone steadily down hill . at best , the service of late has been extremely slow ( 20 mins to talk drink orders , another 15 to get the drinks , 15 mins after that to take food orders , etc. ) . at worst , servers have been rude , irritable , evasive , and negligent . they have also annoyingly started to charge for bread , a trend in this city that needs to stop .	1271
0	not . cool . i 'm pretty pissed that i paid $ 175 for this . this is a damn joke . never again .	665
0	one thing i really hate is when nail salons give you a time frame and then blow it off when they do n't meet it . they told me 30 minutes , for which i told them i 'd come back , because i like supporting small business . i came back and they said just a few minutes ! but i noticed another client came and they did n't look close to done . so i asked and she said 10-15 minutes . my time was dismissed and i wasted it on trusting their information . wo n't go there again .	3831
1	very good thai faire ! i hate any food bland or dummied down `` americanized '' and this is not that . i really enjoy authentic places like this .	895
0	i bought a lemon unfortunately . the costumer service was great , but in retrospect i overpaid for a car with 2 accidents on car fax and 5 months later the transmission started to slip , the car had less than 90,000 miles . the shitty part is that once you buy that 's it , your on your own . i 'm not bashing the character or integrity of trend auto or it 's employees , they were kind and i 'm sure in due diligence are not in the business of fucking people over , it just sucks that in my case i lost a few thousand .	3261
0	hit or miss . i 've had some good hair cuts in the past here and always felt that the value was great for the service . my last visit i was dissapointed with the cut . i hate to give a bad review since my stylist yuna was very nice and gentle with my hair . i asked for a simple cut straight across . what i got instead was uneven and not like the photo i brought with me . the shape of my hair is now rounder than when i came in with a chunk taken out of it : /	2181
1	fabulous service and awesome food . we had the italian wedding soup , the fried sampler plate , and the carbonera .	423
1	now i will say the tacos are a little on the higher priced size , but they are big and extremely fresh . quality food and friendly service . who does n't love a local eatery !	270
0	first , there is no solution to their shitty parking situation . you will have to walk at least a couple blocks and leave your vehicle in an unattended - or poorly secured - lot . second , couple that with the busy traffic surrounding the fair grounds , and you 'll have a real fun time trying to cross any streets safely . third , the quality of life that these types of events attract are ... at least ten time worse than what you can spot at your local walmart in the middle of the night . the event security is also apparently largely ineffective . do n't think i 'll ever be trying this again .	2076
1	great atmosphere at this new mexican restaurant . very particular about mexican food and would recommend this place just for the table made guacamole , prepared fresh for you . chips and salsa were plentiful and the chimichanga de pollo was flavorful . molly , my waitress was attentive , with fresh refills on chips and drinks ... great customer service with a sincere smile .	398
0	i purchased the small `` alcoholic infused '' cupcakes on one of the local deal sites . luckily , i only paid $ 24 for the deal . unfortunately , i bought the cupcakes for a party i was having . the cupcakes were dry with little or no taste and the frosting was hard . needless to say i was embarrassed that i actually served the cupcakes at my party . i would equate the cupcakes to something i would pick up at a grocery store on the bargain rack . i called the store to let them know my feedback and the response i received was , `` oh ok , thanks '' .	1806
1	i made an appointment for the friday after thanksgiving fo a exam and to get new glasses . i 've been coming here for 6+ years and the dr 's are great and the staff of young lady 's are always smiling and very helpful . the selection of frames and different styles is awesome ! and the prices are very good . thankyou for another great experience .	2277
0	-one star because we received our belongings . -ended up costing us about $ 1000 more than quoted . -was not delivered in time frame given . -best of all , the movers stole a watch i had on the counter . -do not hire this company ! !	3114
0	wish i could give 0 stars two of the most rudest black women ever ! ! ! ! had to walk out due to them disrespectfully talking with me and my bf . i will never return here ever again so sad and we were interested in purchasing a bike as well oh well i 'll take my business elsewhere where someone with actual bike knowledge and people skills can help me attitude free	3156
1	i had no clue what to expect , at first i thought , '' oh chipotle '' but not at all ! wayyy better love the steak tacos , and they melt the cheese to the shell ! ! ! ! ! great customer service too ! only complaint no mist outside and suggestive selling . i put salsa on my tacos an they got soggy ( amateur move )	1365
1	great gym they have just enough equipment for what you need to have a full body workout	3898
1	wow ! what a great find . you 'd never guess this joint tucked in an old shopping center was putting out the tasty quality sandwiches like they are . seems to be family run , everyone was real nice . sandwiches take a bit to make since they are made fresh to order . we 'll be back for sure .	777
0	it 's a shame ... this was my favorite place on earth when i was kid . but boy has it changed . there is so much empty space with so much wasted potential .	2868
1	i was extremely pleased with the craftsmanship and customer service i received with this company . they truly are running a business the way it should be . my wife 's car was damaged and las vegas collision center brought it back to factory condition . thanks for making a bad time a wonderful experience .	3765
0	the hoa association here is beyond a joke . it 's as if they have not heard , nor will they ever be trained on how to utter any words beyond no . robots behind counters without solutions and fake apologies . do not recommend .	3304
0	i have been going to cafe rio for years , mainly in salt lake where it started . love the food and my port burrito enchilada style with hot sauce was pretty good but the service was terrible . the young gal with the ray ban glasses thought it was more important i wipe off trays than it was to grab my food off the melter thing and ring me up . i 'll come back , i just hope next time the employees treat me better and do n't make it so obvious they 're having a terrible day .	1365
1	dr dewan is he best . he 's done the work to motivate my daughter to take ownership of her ailment , better than my wife or i ever could have , and i believe when she looks back she 'll recognize him as one of the most influential people in her life . it makes such a difference when a doctor develops a relationship with his patient and understands them enough to know how to motivate them . he even took the time to recommend a geometry tutor for my daughter and i think one of the happiest moments of her life was when she completed her first proof ! i highly recommend him .	1464
1	great location and never disappoints . the staff are always happy and clean in appearance . this goes a long way in the experience . the food was fresh ! ! kudos to the manager .	701
1	i used delia 's for the first time and had some dress shirts laundered . one needed to be pre-treated after some self-tanner left the collar and cuffs a mess ( and this was a white shirt ) . they did an excellent job and the shirt was spotless ! i will certainly continue to bring all my laundered shirts here since the location is closer than my normal cleaners . unfortunately , i will continue to bring all my dry cleaning to my usual spot since delia 's prices for dry cleaning are much too high ( double what my other cleaner charges ) and i just can not justify the cost . that 's why they got 4 stars instead of 5 .	2412
1	the staff are so friendly . they are helpful . i never have had to wait long for any visit . they even watched my toddler for me briefly for a few minutes to have one small spot on my face lasered . it only took 3 minutes probably , but the principal that they were willing to watch her is fantastic . i 've never seen dr. rostan , only the pa for my skin checks and she was very thorough and helpful . overall fantastic practice !	2430
1	we have purchased several items from ashley and have been impressed with the products as well as the service each time ! today monica did a fabulous job helping us stay within our budget and find the perfect bed set . thank you !	1442
1	since moving to henderson in 2004 , brad fischer painting has done the painting in all 3 of my homes , inside and out . one was a rental and needing painting a few times . brad himself is a master at picking colors and i appreciated his attention to detail . i appreciated his patience and suggestions when i wanted to make changes . he is very easy to work with and yet is willing to stand firm on the best decision . he and his crew always showed up on time and efficiently got the job done . he is permanently in my contact list under great contractors .	795
1	i rented again from them , this time 4 bikes for labor day . the service as last time was great . this time we did not take a tour as they were not available but with the map the provided we were able to go all the way without a trouble . i recommend to book them in advance that way no waste of time . when you arrive they have them ready and adapted to your height . good place ! ! bike pgh is great !	2949
0	terrible quality ... overpriced broken dented and poorly functioning appliances . they are not even licensed to sell with the state . very poor handling of the problem , total ripoff . do your self a favor and do n't buy this stolen merchandise	1236
0	food below average . my husband got the chicken penne alfredo that tasted like a jar of ragu alfredo sauce was warmed up and poured on top . the bread tasted like it had sat in the fridge overnight and was n't even warmed up to be served . sorry .	712
1	my little man and i love this place . its friendly and the food is great . i have never encountered a rude soul here . the little play area is cleaner than the mcds so i take little man there to play . we also love all of the events they have going on . macaroni kids robinson and mops have fundraisers or free kid activity nights at this location often .	1350
1	what 's not to love about louis v ? ? ? always go here to see the seasons newest and best ! i 'm in love with red ! when not in paris ... scottsdale will have to do ! love my lv !	1493
0	the worst service . food is excellent . if you do n't mind to be yelled at , turned away or receive rude attitude then you 're welcome here . at some point i wonder whether the good quality of food is worth receiving awful service .	1438
0	well , i wish i could rate the desserts here . unfortunately when we arrived after dinner , about 7:00 pm they were sold out of almost everything . just a couple of small $ 2.50 cupcakes that looked to be out all day and some macarons left . i was craving a red velvet cupcake or chocolate cake but it was not meant to be . the display case was practically empty so we left . not sure if they just did n't make enough or maybe it was a busy day ? ?	981
1	it was our first time in . warm welcome . we sat at bar and bartender was very pleasant . we ordered the deviled eggs then we had the grilled corn on the cob . yummy ! then we split the cheeseburger which was very juicy and tasty but to my linking , should not be rated as best burger in az . it was all very good . we had the coconut pie for dessert . also very good although not excellent . overall very pleasant time . nice little place . good music although it kept playing the same 6-7 songs over and over again . will come back for sure . thank you !	286
1	this place has amazing pizza we ordered while i was at work and the pizza was so good perfect crust perfect sauce it was just amazing . we shared with a couple of people at work and our clients and they found it to be really good as well . and price was not bad definitely ordering again .	1399
0	this gym does not fix its problems . for starters , the ac has not been on for at least 3 weeks now since the heat began . the workers there say `` we can not touch the thermostat '' and avoid the question when asked `` is the ac broken ? '' the middle urinal in the men 's room has been broken since i signed up ( about august 2017 ) , cold water stopped running in the water fountain for weeks now too . the weights are never re-racked . i finally made a formal complaint to corporate , and if things do n't change , i will have to find another gym .	392
1	i 've gone here for my smog twice and it 's always great . super fast and great customer service !	1553
1	i came here before my med exam yesterday . the service is good . the waiting time is reasonable ( or because i arrived early before 10 am ) . the food is good ( i have the basic scramble eggs , waffle , and bacon ... . , which is how one tastes the real taste of food . ) i especially love the coffee , a pot of coffee ( not a cup of coffee and then waiting forever for someone to fill it ... . ) i will definitely go back and bring my friend ... . : )	1258
1	call ahead of time to make sure they have your part ( s ) . much cheaper than auto zone , o'reilly 's , and etc . the line is always long , however , it is very organized and fast . parking is awkward and small . not always the friendliest cashiers . policeman is on duty when i walk in .	2027
1	we had a problem with our order through the drive-thru and the manager hugo expediently addressed the issue . he exemplifies excellent customer service . he exceeded our expectations and helped make a not-so-good experience in to a five-star-worthy experience . all restaurants should be so lucky to have such a gentleman manager ! thank you again !	1517
0	this was a dismal experience . i had heard great things about this craft cocktail bar ... .the service was not just slow but non-existent . the $ 22 cocktail i ordered was so bad i could n't drink it . when i asked for a glass of rose instead , the waitress ( after 10 minutes ) brought me white wine . so not worth it .	2513
0	i have walked in several times trying to purchase a $ 2500 tv . i can never get any questions answered or any help . all the people are rude and non sociable . today was the third day they missed out on a sale ! ! ! ! ! do n't ship here if you want costumer service ! ! ! ! !	494
1	place is n't bad at all ! ! 48 bucks from head to toe and service is great ! ! they have smaller private rooms and a common area for larger groups .	2399
1	darcy is great at her job and very personable . poor girl is always by herself . i think she is a rockstar for all she does ... all by herself ! ! way to go rockstar ! ! ! i give you big kudos ! !	2587
0	over hyped , over priced , and disappointing . very simplified bland version of bistro fare . desserts look like they were picked up at a roadside rest area diner . i wish it was borgo again , at least they did food right .	1352
1	we love the pharmacy because it 's open all night , but more so we love rochelle always in a positive mood and real cool with my family , just an outstanding person and great attitude ! ! ! !	3799
0	neither exciting well it was boring bartenderess was there was n't very interactive ... boring food was fair yet i 've been coming for years it 's boring if you sit at the bar you expect an interactive bartender not my best visit ! ! ! ! ! !	428
1	i have come back cocos many times over the last 5yrs . even after moving nearly 20 miles out of the area . i always feel relaxed and rejuvenated after leaving . they are professional and friendly . i genuinely look forward to driving over , and get the 90 minute deep tissue massage .	2014
0	place took forever ... come to find out that they did n't have my oil filter and a hour and a half into me waiting the napa parts guy pulls up and 10 mins later it was done ... hmmm.. but they did n't even let me know what was going on ! never going back	2146
1	dustin patrick and kimberly went out of their way to help me find what i needed get my pictures perfect and figured out where to go from there . they gave me suggestions on how to make things easier i definitely recommend coming here and seeing one of these three if you need a passport .	2871
1	best in town . my husband and i go whenever possible and have a relaxing pedicure . highly recommend .	3682
0	if you want to be rushed and make an appointment only to wait an hour past the time then go to jcpennys . i can see why they are on the verge of closing the doors . we get taken in a room finally for our portraits only to be asked to wait because the family before us did n't hear their name called . so we go out to see a mother acting like a child because we were called before her . i am sorry that god gave you a big nose and small ears .	1536
1	this location is usually busy as it is located inside of the mall at fashion square . the have a good selection of merchandise . be sure to check out some of the clearance items . right after christmas last year i got some gourmet vanilla marshmallows marked down to $ 1 and they were totally delish in my hot chocolates . you never know what you might come across so the clearance is worth checking out . besides that , they have a good selection of some nice pans and bakeware . i am a fan of the nordic brand . some of the williams sonoma dessert bread mixes are tasty as well .	191
0	cockroach infested dump , nancy is a lazy , lying individual . do not go here . website says clean place to live . we have pics that will prove otherwise . a dumpster is a better place than new solutions . nancy talks behind individuals back like the coward she and her snitches are . nancy , will no doubt have a reply defending the awfully living conditions at craig shell 's the new solution , but pics i have tell it all .	2255
1	this dentist office is amazing ! ! ! i 'm a mom of five kids and have been to many dentists and this was is at the top of the list . they are caring , professional , knowledgeable , friendly and have a great way with kids . i would recommend them to any parent trying to find a good kid 's dentist office .	2596
0	imperial is a place we should all love . it 's dirty , friendly , cozy , and right downtown ! it 's seems like a great alternative to the overpriced chain restaurants nearby . the problem is that the imperial pub is actually overpriced , too . it 's a dive that charges too much . so , if you want to pay chain resto-bar prices ... just go to a chain resto-bar where they actually clean the bathrooms .	1091
1	2/28/15 takeout wings are sold by lb so i asked for drums , since its a lb ( lots of nagging at edgley location lately ) here , `` sure '' . 10-15 minutes stopped at comic book store got there in 15 min , ready , hurray 10 drums plastic containers ( who cares about pbf 's ) im happy	393
0	i worked here for 1 day told them i did n't have any experience with more than 2 toddlers at once . they stuck me in a room with 8 toddlers by myself for hours without instruction every time i asked for help they came 45 min later . i quit the next day i could n't handle it . i feel sorry for the kids that go here just based on what they put me through .	2085
0	quality of food was not there for the price . we had mushroom burger , fries , chicken tenders , and potato soup . the waitress was very nice , but slow on service .	1400
0	spoke with customer service after my previous review and was promised shipping for saturday between 12-6 as well as a credit for my trouble . saturday delivery time has came and gone and no delivery . have called to customer service three times today and hung up on all 3 times when trying to figure out how and when we can get the bed . avoid this company at all costs..	2071
0	unfortunately , we 've had several bad experiences with the wait staff . and , it does n't matter whether they are busy or slow . it either takes forever for your waitress to take your order or the kitchen to fill it ! the wait staff sits in the back corner of the restaurant to chit chat rather than service customers . if you have time to kill , this is your place ; if not , choose another restaurant .	1189
0	alarmists : these guys did the safety inspection on my car and came back with a laundry list of issues and tried to scare me in to paying for hundreds of dollars of repairs . i took it down the street to firestone and they said it passed inspection and gave me a great deal on an alignment , which was the only item that baum had flagged that was actually an issue . do n't let them scare you into paying for unnecessary repairs ! ! !	3197
0	got there at about 8 on a friday night and barely beat the crowd and got two spots at the bar . we got the fried green tomato stack with pork belly , pimento cheese and sweet corn vinaigrette to start . it was alright . i would n't recommend it . then we got a spider roll which i did n't really like and a spicy salmon roll which i really liked . i also got a drink that was way too sweet and would have been way better with some salt on the rim or something . it was really loud and cramped feeling . i probably wo n't go back .	487
0	first off it seems impossible to find a authentic rolled ice cream place , so we tried this one out and let 's just say they could do a lot better . pulled up to what looked like the owner having a cigarette outside , walked in not to be greeted but to two hispanic girls talking about partying and one even had her little son behind the counter right next to her while making our ice cream . place was dirty and like another reviewer said nothing going on inside no music nothing . ice cream was oook ca n't say i will be returning for over priced crappy service .	1073
0	the pharmacy is sooooooooo slow , the drive thru tales forever , do n't use it , the drive thru should be fast and efficient , been waiting for over 30 hour , crazyyyyy	1733
1	great hotel . it 's new so has lcd screen . which was centered in the room and swiveled from the bed to the mini living room . it 's a residence inn so it has a the small kitchenette full featured . it felt like a small condo . i recommend this hotel and from all the reviews i 've seen online a lot of other people love the hotel to . that 's why we chose to stay here for 2 days after the conference . well worth it . it 's also a couple of blocks from tim hortons . : ) and the entrance to the subway . so it is very convenient too .	409
1	best chums make happy humans and beloved pets . best groomer in town . do n't waste your time with others . this lovely lady is wonderful .	1847
0	the process started out pretty well with an online assistant named `` sally '' pointing me in the supposed right direct with the internet sales manager `` mike '' . from there the situation deteriorated into the typical laborious car salesman charade . needless to say , i am not driving a hyundai from san tan - it 's a shame because the product is solid and i was ready to pull this trigger . i learned a lesson here . go with your gut . the guys at autonation honda were my first contact in this process and turns out the most honest and straight forward . a fair balance of a reasonable deal and excellent customer service .	3041
1	love getting my pedicures here ! i always feel like i get one on one attention here and i do n't feel like they are rushing me . good polish color selection and they do a fabulous job !	1796
0	do not shoot here . they are full of arrogant condescending jerks . i 've been here at least a dozen times and the treatment never changes . i am a marine veteran and know plenty about firearms yet i 'm treated like a 5 year old child here . the way they talk to customers is unacceptable . go to eagle guns in concord or point blank range in mooresville instead . it 's a little further away but definitely worth it over these clowns . this place will go out of business soon the way they treat people ( not to mention their idiotic policies ) ( danielle h 's review is spot on ! )	3936
0	no works here . is all they do is promised . if you want do time then came here ask for their help . especially the guys name dean . he 's promised a lot . no works here	2391
1	food is great . must trys are : the loosey , the bulgogi cheese steak , and the brick chicken . however , in the few times i 've been there service is hit or miss . it can really improve . i 'm not saying to roll out the red carpet for everyone but at least be more approachable to your patrons ? that would be nice .	688
1	this location is always my store of choice . it 's very clean inside and outside of the building and the people are super friendly here !	3884
0	tamara was one of the most unprofessional , rudest people i have ever come into contact with . she made me feel like i was not wanted there and that all my questions were stupid and i should have already known . she also was charging my card without my consent for co pays with no signatures or telling me .	2782
1	this little liquor store is super clean ! sammy ( owner ) and dave ( employee ) are the nicest guys ! better than having to go to your chain liquor stores due to the fact that its open most nights until 12am . great spot to pick up some good booze at a reduced price . one stop shop , including craft beer and really really nice spirits . grab your booze , beer , smokes , and head out for the night . location is wonderful for all those sw dwellers .	3889
0	everything was great up until the polish ( i mostly go get a pedi for the leg and foot rub ) which looked pretty crappy with paint on my hand . i mean really bad ... . my daughter 's was even worse . they said hers was dry and it was basically ruined 10 minutes after we left . we definitely felt rushed at the beginning and end . wo n't go back .	1263
0	so i 've lived here since october . relatively quiet , good amenities . 2 complaints - my bike was stolen while locked in the garage and i was told `` no security cameras , no responsibility , file a police report '' . wtf . thank you , lincoln , for the protection of my $ 800 bicycle . should the residents even feel safe here ? maintenance - not the quickest to respond .	1908
0	the facts : i was told to arrive at 1030am for an 11:10am appointment to see dr toth which i did . at 1230pm i walked out because dr toth had not seen me yet . this is unacceptable and shame on you dr toth .	3946
1	the bartender wanda , ( the greek goddess she is ) , is so personable , she makes it a point to get to know you , she is great at remembering who you are and she treats you like people , not just a customer , the restaurant attached , johnny vegas grill , is great , best bar food , the wait staff is courtious and hard working , i personaly have n't had a bad meal there yet , the bar promos are good and every one treats you like a friend , i recomend mr. g 's to anyone looking for a bit of fun and good food	86
0	if i could give no stars i would ! the rooms are nice , but management is absolutely terrible . the goal is for the customer to be happy and they legitimately failed in every aspect . i would not recommend coming here .	1057
1	they have always been good to be ! had to wait at times , but they always offered snacks , drinks , etc . i was never ignored and never charged for anything more than what they stated . they do have a very busy office so if you arrive right when they open , you will be waiting . the staff have all been very kind and helpful each time i call and come to get a car . i will only use hertz on sahara and will not go anywhere else if i can help it .	2161
1	flowers by renee has some of the best quality flowers in town . they are prompt with orders and they are always beautiful	3622
1	rachel was ( as always ) amazing ! she got the job done , and i am very grateful for her talents and her professionalism . thank you , mr. appliance for hiring a knowledgeable technician who is n't afraid to tear apart and put back together a washing machine . we look forward to using your services again in the future !	3856
1	birdsong is a gem . a true gem ! i was over at noda and wandered back and around to birdsong . the staff were vvery friendly and i found the bar a bit like home . they have a great outdoor area and , most importantly , their beer is quality . i 'm generally not a fan of flavored beers . ipa por vida ! but ! their jalapeno pale ale ! ? hello deliciousness . seriously . give it a try .	993
1	i drive well out of my way to go to this midas . i think that says it all . i was so upset with the lousy service from the associates at the big-o tires on mcdowell and scottsdale that i needed to take my business to someone who treats their customers with respect and appreciation . the associates at midas are very courteous , expedient , and very thorough when reviewing all your car 's information with you . i apologize for not knowing the gentleman 's name at the front counter , but he is a true service professional . they have earned my loyalty , and i hope more people come to this midas to experience how auto mechanic shops should be run .	1895
0	sign says open at 9am , it 's now 9:30 and i am going to gsw because some one had not opened the door	1743
0	do n't even waste your time using his service . he never showed up and then stopped answering calls and texts .	2602
1	our whole family has been using blackwell for over two decades now . if you want your mechanic shop to be knowledgeable , professional , courteous and caring look no further . they have always bent over backwards to meet our needs and stay on quote . simply the best .	2084
0	girly is very rude and she is the manager and the owner is super rude and does n't get much done ... i moved in and everything was broken and i called maintenance every day and the owner got to a point where he was going to fight me and he was nasty and in a very bad location is this apartment complex	3666
0	they hired this new guy at the front register and good god i would drive 10 miles out of my way to not get this guy . he calls the manager over the speaker every 2 minutes , has no knowledge of anything ca n't count change to save his life and he 's a rude douche bag i have no idea why anyone could ever hire this guy . he will hold up a line for a good 20 minutes to get through 3 people so save yourself time and go to another walgreens !	1881
0	my pedicure lasted about 15 minutes - the guy that did it was obviously in such a rush and didnt care to take his time on anything . there was a woman next to me that got there 15 minutes before me - and was only on her massage by the time i was done and at the dryer . i guess it just depends on who you get in regards to if you get a nice pedicure - waste of $ $ ! ill stick to my usual place that i can always count on - this is what i get for trying something new !	2197
0	we ordered take out and our food , it took about 30 mins to get it and it was given to us with no sauce . my boyfriend ordered the chicken alfredo and the chicken smelled and tasted like an chicken , and had no alfredo sauce . the only redeeming aspect of this trip was that the italian wedding soup was delicious .	712
1	saw g force in 3d here tickets were $ 10.50 so average . theater was big , clean and had very good sound . i was happy . theres a food court right before you come in so bring a big bag and buy your food before you come in . did i say that ?	491
1	solutions is a great place to get off addictions and make your mind right . the staff is very caring and help on most of your recovery . they make you feel like you are part of community . i highly recommend this rehab if you are looking to change your life .	2493
1	these are my favorite subs anywhere . the sandwiches are all well made , extremely quick , have the best meats but most of all the bread is amazing . the staff at this location were all very nice and accommodating . great place . it 's a once a weeker for me	141
0	while dr y is terrific , plan on a minimum of a three hour wait . staff friendly but no matter how good , no excuse for waiting . and i 've had about 10 appts over the past three years . none were under three hour wait . this is forcing me to find another specialist i believe i 'm just $ $ $ to this place . certainly do not care about the value of patient time . today i had a 3:10 appt . it is 5:40 and i 'm still in the waiting room .	3527
1	it 's a great place to go paintballing . you can find a better place unless your willing to travel a bit . i would recommend this place . my issue with this place is that the field itself isnt that great . the staff are cool here . definitely check it out	2926
0	i was excited to try out a new bbq place in mentor . i go there on a saturday night and they have no chicken ! how does a bbq place run out of chicken ? very disappointed . wo n't be going back .	1547
0	probably one of the worse craft stores ive been too . people didnt know where anything was and they were impatient . think twice before going here , just go to joans .	1615
0	theoretically , this location closes at 9pm . we came by ay 8:40 last night to get something for breakfast ... place was dark . suggest you call to be sure they 're open . ca n't speak regarding the donuts ... never got any . thankfully frys is always open right across the street .	1774
1	it 's awesome . great customer service and the prices are more than fair . i 'm making this my stop for all my shopping . thanks spartan arms .	2247
0	the owners does n't seem to want to promote anything but nascar . no infield track for road racing . there 's a road course setup outside , but for obvious reasons , ca n't hold major events . they finally brought back open wheeled racing but racing on the oval ( can someone hit the snooze bar , i 'm falling asleep . ) no motorcycle racing , no sports car racing . the spring mountain race track is a much better venue . the facility needs updating also . i guess it 's fine for holding the electric daisy carnival . woo , i 'm excited . ( if you do n't detect the sarcasm , `` obtuse '' must be your middle name .	2955
1	i love bodyheat tanning . they never fail to keep me tan all year long . the staff is amazing , friendly , & personable . wouldnt tan anywhere else ! i would recommend any of their locations for all of your tanning needs , including spray tan and tanning beds .	1314
0	very very slow service . went around 8:30am . only 2 people in front who ordered coffee ( americano and cappuccino ) . took almost 10 minutes to take their orders . finally received double espresso . the coffee was very sour ( some like that flavour profile , i do n't ) and gritty ( beans too finely ground ) . i wo n't be going back .	207
1	dr. zedek is excellent ! he is well trained in his field and a remarkable human being . not only did he help me control my adhd , but he and his staff treated me like a person and not just a number . he is never too busy to ask me about how i am doing , how 's my wife , kids , etc . he encourages questions , comments , and concerns and always gives thorough explanations of everything . i wish more doctors were as kind , caring , considerate , and honest as him . i highly recommend him for anyone with psychiatric needs !	3928
0	all the reviews are correct : it literally drips grease . it did arrive hot and in a timely manner . the garlic knots are pretty damn good though . i would go for those again .	1399
0	i have purchased ashley furniture for more than 15 years . 90 % of my furniture come from there . this is by far the worst ashley store i have ever been . we placed a $ 7000 order with them and told them that our floors were not ready . they told us that we could wait up to 6 months for delivery . on the second delivery reschedule i received a phone call threatening that the furniture might get out of stock if i was not taking them now . when i talked to the store manager rick , he sided with his people . he is the worst store manager i ever talked to .	3738
0	stopped in today to get my son a donut . we got a chocolate long john and a sprinkled raised donut . they both were extremely heavy and greasy . they had absorbed so much grease that they were crunchy . honestly some of the worst donuts i have ever eaten .	1327
0	updating my review , after what happened to both of my dogs i will not be returning and ca n't suggest that anyone put their babies at the risk of this place . the owner did pay for my vet bill but did n't care what happened to my dogs , refused to refund my money for the groomings i paid for , and told me to simply `` put peroxide on it . '' horrible experience !	3389
0	this place is awful poor customer service and the food is over priced and on top of that greasy i went there last night and wasnt given correct change and when i asked the cashier for the price on the food she got defensive and angry so i asked for my money back and said she could n't return my money because food was already cooking i dont recommend this place at all thumbs down .	3858
0	very disappointed . i went there looking for a maternity dress and was told they no longer have a maternity section because they got rid of it . as a result , they no longer have me as a customer .	3896
1	absolutely best service ever . food was great , kitchen/lobby/bathroom very clean , and true customer service in every possible aspect ! thank you i will be recommending this location and looking into catering needs for my company .	1495
1	i wish we had a joann 's here in hawaii . we have only 1 craft store here that is not as good as joann 's . whenever i go to las vegas thats one store i always am sure to go to . they have a wide variety of different craft selections . overall a crafters dream store .	1937
0	this place is nice but they seem to always be out of the flavors they have listed . tonight i went down the list and finally on my third try i found one they had on hand ! kinda disappointing . this happens to us every time we come here . i come here because it is located across the street from my house so the location is great . i just wish they would make more of the flavors they advertise that day so this problem would n't happen so often . i hate that when we want ice cream it 's a debate of convenience with brusters or the selection of petersons in downtown gilbert !	16
0	i still can not understand for the life of me why every one of my friends wants to go here . it is always packed with bros and some hos , the service is terrible , and the drinks are n't even that low priced . i guess i would understand coming here if i was a pool player , but it seems like it is impossible to get a table . i 'm sure this place will be around as long as the dean does n't shut down the greek life .	1966
0	not the worst experience of my life , but definitely not a good one . i went for a quick 15 minute neck and shoulder massage because i had a headache . for some reason he spent the majority of the time on my shoulder blades . granted they did feel better once he finished ( although i felt a little bruised ) , but the neck/shoulder tension and headache were still there . oh and despite what the sign at the register says , tip is mandatory . i could n't leave until he got the tip he wanted . i wo n't be going back there .	2330
0	the owner/broker betty leal is the absolute most unprofessional , rudest , unpleasant person i have ever come across in any kind of business setting . i was astounded to find out that she was the owner ! ! ! i would expect someone to have pride in their own business ! i would highly recommend steering very clear of this century 21 consolidated . she is completely unwilling to help resolve any issues with the property we are renting . nightmare ! ! ! ! worst property management company we have ever encountered !	3315
1	honestly best gamestop i 've been to . only one i would do business with . staff is great everytime i go in they are always helpful .	2687
1	this place offers great , fast service . i had forgotten a nice set of comforters here for months and when i visited the guy went through a bunch of left over orders until he found mine . although he did not have to , he went out of his way to make sure i got my forgotten items . i have been frequenting this cleaner for over a year and the service is predictably good .	3032
1	one of my favorite spots in the phoenix area . this place is fabulously tacky , complete with plaid 70 's style mismatched couches and velvety posters of elvis in engraved wooden frames . enjoy an old cult film on a large screen tv while sampling excellent bar food and cocktails in a fun atmosphere . i recommend the bloody mary and the chicken chile wraps for starters .	180
0	sandwiches are n't anything special and the owner can be a bit rude to people - then afterwards he 'll come up and be nice once you 're sitting down eating . kind of like getting beat up by your boyfriend and the next day he sends you flowers . additionally , the 4 % surcharge for credit card use is inexcusable - go to subway or ray 's around the corner , this place sucks .	675
0	i am very disappointed with the service after the sale . most of the time you will be asked by the answering machine to leave your number so they can call you back . they rarely return your calls . i believe they need better management .	3541
1	the food fight group never disappoints , and monty 's blue plate diner is no exception . we loved the extensive brunch menu here . we did have to wait around 20 minutes , but there 's some nice outdoor dining space and so we did n't mind waiting outside in the warm weather . once we were seating , the waiter was extremely efficient . our orders were taken right away and we probably did n't wait more than 10 minutes for our food . they have a large variety of brunch choices . the bloody marys come with a side car of beer as well . the booths were cozy and overall felt like old fashion diner . would definitely visit again !	975
0	long waits even when slow ! was at er for over three hours and there were two people there . watched a full shift change . was sent there by an urgent care and they called ahead and tried to get me to take an ambulance . thank god i was n't dying because this staff would have just called a coroner instead of admitting me to get treatment . save yourself the trouble and go to cmc waxhaw , it 's a lot better ! !	3131
0	large selection of groceries to choose from . has a decent live fish section . hit and miss in their meat section . not very fresh compared to the 99 ranches in socal .	3269
0	newish cheap no frills 24/7 gym , good equipment , but busy , to cold in winter , machines often broken and rarely fixed , very few free weights . canceled my my membership after 2 months . back to goodlife ; )	1990
0	not from vegas but use yelp to help find the best spots . i find this place and think it will be okay from the reviews , but learned the hard way this time . what a waste of $ 20 , this barber named big nig sucks did not realize until went home and showered . it was a rough cut the whole time and did not cut clean either , could have done a better job with scissors myself . fool was on drugs or something maybe just bipolar talking to himself while f ' n up my hair . save your money for a better place than this .	761
1	just had a bowl of soup , but the omb copper amber ale is delish ! ! quick , friendly service : )	219
1	love this place ! the staff is friendly and efficient , the office clean . sign is simple , i never have to wait long . dr. dan gave a thorough explanation of my treatment plan and the reasoning behind it . i felt immediate relief after my first adjustment and am looking forward to my next visit .	1274
0	stay away . they did not clean my vents they spray sanitizer and call them clean . they quoted us at 129 and when the job was done they asked for 200 dollars . spoke with the manager and he started yelling and screaming on the phone like a 2 year old . when i said i would write a review on yelp he said he did not care because he pays yelp . whatever that means ? ? our vents are still filthy we have to have professionals come out this time to get them done correctly .	182
0	easily the worse course i have played in phoenix . the round was 5+ hours and the fairways look like a fire had just been put out . the starter was awful and did n't even tell me who i was paired up with and when i was teeing off . there is a reason why the website has a digital flyby and the rate is so cheap . save yourself the trouble and pay the extra $ 20 to play a better course .	85
0	i 'm sorry but this sonic is n't even worth reviewing about . all bad : / wrong order . and rude employees .	994
0	well , it seems parallax really needs to figure out that the reservation system should be a bit more aligned with the time in which one expects to be seated ( 8:30 reservation typically does not mean 9:10 seating in cleveland ) . also , i should have just said that i 'd like the dish of fancy salt on my table as my entree , because it would have been complimentary and that 's what i ended up receiving in lieu of the udon noodle order anyhow . also , if you order a bottle of wine and it 's not sitting on your table , then your waiter should be johnny on the spot refilling those glasses . alas . underwhelmed , indeed .	487
0	went in for an implant constellation and 15 minutes later got a surprise $ 200 charge that insurance does n't cover but he reduced it down to $ 100 . nice guy , just wish they were more clear about prices beforehand .	3240
0	excellent groomers ... ..when they show up . i was just stood up for the 3rd time in 10 months , despite confirming the appointments in advance . once they were scheduled at 3:00pm on a sunday and did n't call to cancel , just showed up at 7:30pm in the middle of sunday dinner with a large family gathering . my neighbor has had the same issues with being stood up as well . i 've been really tolerant because they do a good job , but 3 strikes ... you 're out ! there are plenty of other mobile groomers that are good and happy to have my business .	2324
1	amazing customer service . it 's nice to not feel rushed when you are finding the right juice . sidd helped me out and it was just a fantastic time lots of fun trying the flavours he had great recommendations . overall stellar experience !	3845
0	comfy chairs and the food was decent . we wanted to order the 6-8pm dinner special at 5:55 . server refused and said we have to wait til 6 !	176
0	bought a groupon for a deluxe mani-pedi . made the appointment last week and they did n't bother to tell me the address used by groupon is wrong . so i show up today as scheduled and no one is there and i wait 20 mins . there 's no sign at their old location saying they moved even though it looks like an actual business is still there . i called and left a message and no one has called me back now 4 hours later . i went to elan nail & spa which is less than a mike away . great service at elan 's ! i recommend them over flawlace !	916
1	great local bike shop , with something for everyone , and even some food ( sandwiches and baked goods ) !	3726
0	this was by far the worst tuna sub i 've ever had . both my mother and i order the same thing , and both our sandwiches were awful . they were sloppy and very unappealing . thought it would taste better than it looked , but it definitely did not . to top it all off now we both feel nauseous .	1289
1	great customer service ! five stars ! ! ! so happy to have brought my car here . my car looked brand new after my wash . i got the one where they detail the interior as well . i even got a free air freshener for the car ( i do n't know what they were implying , haha ! ) . impeccable service . really good prices for what you get . staff was super friendly and helpful . i 'm definitely going to be a regular . oh , and i love the 72 hour rain warranty thingy .	2359
1	i 've been shopping at otp for years . they have a great variety of things to spice up the decor in your house . recently , we bought some items for our new house and they had a lot to choose from . we bought a huge clock for our wall , a floor mate , and some other items for our mantle . the prices are n't unreasonable either . we 'll be back soon because we need more stuff for this house , like a chair for my daughter 's room . otp is ok in my book .	2184
0	no greeting as soon as we get in . all staff had a sour face w/a very bad attitude to match . we were very hungry but left after talking to each other and agreed how we do n't need to give our money to a place like this . there was a bunch of us family too w/my mother-in-law from ca that had her heart set on korean . what a dissapoinment ! at least we 're now here walking distance trying out a viet cafe , already a big difference w/the staff !	435
1	been here 4x now . the best thing on the menu is the chips and guacamole . best ever - hands down . i 've had fairly good experiences with the carne asada tacos and quesadillas . according to my boyfriend , their chilaquiles is very good as well . also , great live music .	190
1	i 've been coming here for the past few months and am very happy with the prices and services . i bring my friends family and clients here as often as i can	2372
0	was going to attend this location due to its ' high reviews compared to the other massage envy locations . however , i was canceled on me 6 minutes before my scheduled appointment if i were to do the same i would be stuck paying the cancellation fee instead i 'm just screwed and out of luck . very annoying .	2120
1	this is one of the best old-school mexican restaurants . everything about the place is outstanding . great sauce , cheese , beans , rice , salsa , enchiladas , tacos and the huge selection of tequila . this is a legend of a mexican restaurant in phoenix .	1346
0	worst customer service when they need to replace a warranty item . last year it took 3 months of persistent calls and text to get replacement couch piece after owning for 1 year . this year..another 3 months of nagging for another couch piece replacement . still havent received . richard responds once out of every 10 contacts but never delivers . a 1 rating is too high .	3828
1	from the reviews , we had to try the crispy kau chee , cold ginger chicken , and almond pressed duck . all delicious . the spot itself gave a sf hole in the wall feel that we like . do n't order the wine unless you like your wine sweet . do get the salted duck egg and mix with your rice for added salty goodness . worth the trip from the southside !	1103
1	home style meals at a great price . michele 's place is a perfect small town mayberry kind of diner where you can get great food and it wo n't hurt your pockets . the homefries are amazing , and probably the best i 've ever had at a restaurant .	531
1	this was , without hesitation , one of the most spectacular meals of my lifetime . the young head chef and his entire team were beyond amazing . we did the 10 course tasting menu and i have rarely had such exquisite flavors that were perfectly paired . from the mousse bouche to elk , shrimp and sea bass ... it 's all wonderful . this chef will surely be one of the next big names in the culinary world . well done team . best.meal.all.year splurge and eat here ! ! ! ! !	783
0	i signed up for the unlimited washes but after moving from the neighborhood i 've attempted on 4 occasions to cancel my monthly unlimited washes . this has been going on for 3 months now . on the first 2 visits to cancel i was in the office as they clicked away on the computer telling me that they were canceling my membership right there . all attempts to cancel i was i was told my membership would be cancelled and that i would not be charged , but that in fact has not happened and i 've continued to be charged . im now resorting to canceling my card .	2044
1	overall the tavern is a terrific casual bar and consistently good food . the wine variety and price points are on point and we enjoy the live music nights . mark tarbell plays some nights - that 's always fun to see him jamming with the band . thanks for being close and yummy !	286
0	horrendous place to go too ! ! probably not even real doctors . they 'll write you a prescription for whatever you need , but to get it refilled or to actually get the prescription from the pharmacy is nuts ! ! ! the dr 's never call back or do anything to help you aside from your appointment .	3349
1	love bowlmor . we came here for a friends birthday and got a warming dish of soft pretzels . of course the menu said two different dipping sauces than we received . more options would have been nice , especially because bae does n't like mustard . the staff is friendly and the bar is handy . they had free corn-hole so after our two hours were up we were able to get in a few rounds of that before we called it an evening . we are for sure going to coming back here for future bowling adventures .	3296
1	roger showed up at the prearranged time and completed the job efficiently . he was supervised constantly by two dogs and a cat , and this did not distract him from his task . when he left there was no trace that he had been other than the newly installed bathroom faucet .	1473
1	sara is amazing ! ! ! she literally shares me all the infos how to take care of the eyelashes . i bought the refill deals before i left the place . very highly recommend ! ! !	3685
0	found this place on yelp and thought i 'd try it out . should be open at 10 but here i am at 10:15 and they 're closed . thanks for wasting my time	152
0	beware ! ! ! ! this place is a complete rip off ! ! i took my daughter in and after a one hour visit , i was billed $ 1600.00 . that does n't include what my insurance already paid them . you may get in quickly , but it 's not worth it !	350
1	had a great experience here . hosted a baby shower here in the banquet room and the staff was so helpful ! their bartender crystal was extremely kind and courteous . i had a great experience and will be suggesting this place to friends when they are looking for somewhere to have an event .	1520
1	always fresh bagels and a lovely staff . go there and they already know my order .	414
1	this might be the last place in the city where you can get a classic breakfast ( 3 eggs , bacon/sausage/ham , toast , homefries and fruit ) for less than $ 5 . the service was friendly and quick , and the food was good . their homefries were nice and crispy , with seasoning spice on them . the atmosphere is homey ... wood chairs and carpetting . it reminds me of an 80s home-cooking restaurant , in a good way . we 'll definitely be back if we 're ever in the area again .	1310
0	have gone to sports clips a number of times . they do n't take appointments so this is a business model that is acceptable to people who do n't mind spending time watching sports . yesterday , i waited more than an hour and was told if i leave and come back another day , i will return to the end of the line . i left and will never go back .	2352
0	after several months , i am still waiting on word or payment from an armoire i consigned ... .no one can help me on the phone nor will they respond to email inquiries . i can not recommend this business . i guess they are able to stay in business since they apparently just sell other people 's stuff and keep all the money .	2924
1	the technician did such an amazing job on my gel french manicure . she took her time w/ my cuticles and went back in with many layers of paint to make sure the colors were bright enough : - )	258
0	they advertised a `` couples '' special , but did not put anywhere in their website or their paper ad that the gym requires the couple to be co-habitating in order to qualify as a `` couple . '' they should really have made it a roommate special . i 've had several difficult experiences with this gym , and i recommend that you go elsewhere for your fitness needs .	1984
0	stay away from apache glass ... .i would give these guys negative stars if possible . they are receptive when they want to sell you a $ 3,000 shower enclosure ... but not so much if you need it fixed . they have the worst customer service ... .you might want to tape what comes out of their mouth so you can play it back at a later time ... be warned .	3589
0	avoid ! ! we 've been to them a few times and they are always friendly . however they raise the price every trip . now my regular manicure has gone up $ 10 . we usually come in with several people and spend between us all about $ 300- $ 400 , every 2 weeks . they did not care when we expressed concern about the changing prices . too bad because we were looking at other services they offer .	3333
