1	they made 3 large meat mountain meals at 10:50pm and made them hot . the drive thru lady seemed very enthusiastic and nice even for such a ridiculous order at a very late time .	3949
1	recommend ! ! super helpful staff ! ! delicious food and great service ! ! ! got 2 sandwiches , potato chips and a refill for lessons than 9 bucks with bunch of sauces ... good for snacks on the go ! ! ; ) # meat_loverz ! !	3949
1	the ruben is pretty good for being a fast food place . i would give them 5 stars but the sit i 'm sitting on is broken . the decor is outdated	3949
1	came in for some delicious dinner tonight . had such an amazing experience . the drive thru boy zack was really awesome ! . nice . fast and friendly ... good team on the clock tonight was slighty busy but they nailed it ! i will be coming back to this specific location since i received top notch service ... thanks arbys	3949
1	awesome service at this location each time i come in . it 's a treat as this is the closest arby 's and its over an hour away .	3949
0	this location is fucking trash , they messed up my order , as well as 3 other peoples orders all in a better of 10 minutes while i was here eating . but y'all want 15 an hour ? ha . learn how to make a sandwich properly first .	3949
0	very disorganized . my sandwich order took 15 minutes and i had to ask where it was . they also ran out of dollar bills for change and had workers walking around behind the counter looking confused . to top it off , my sandwich was cold . poor management and training .	3949
0	one star for doing renovations and not marking the drive thru that the restaurant is closed during construction ... ( since this business is unclaimed on yelp i 'm sure i 'm speaking into a black hole.. ) .	3949
0	the pecan chicken salad flatbread is advertised verbatim on their website as `` do n't let the name fool you : the pecan chicken salad flatbread is still a sandwich . it 's got bread -- a pillowy pita . '' i was served a cheap tortilla .	3949
0	well i would n't give them even a star . they were friendly but the rueben sandwich i ordered had such a small amount of meat on it i actually had to look . those gourmet sandwiches are not inexpensive for fast food . i was not impressed even in those times you have to grab fast food . we have so many choices especially on bell road i would think twice in regard to stopping out of convenience . i was not impressed .	3949
1	this is our favorite chinese place in the area . in fact , i drive past two other closer chinese places to pick up food there . delicious dinners include fried rice , egg roll and fortune cookie for 7.99 . we always get wonton soup , too .	3950
1	i have been in on a few occasions for carryout . great lunch specials for only $ 5 . i really love their lomein & their general tso 's chicken . the chicken is crispy & hot . sauce is delicious . they have been very friendly & they are willing to give me soup or soda instead of an egg roll . i also ask for lo mein instead of rice for a small upcharge . the only downsides are : 1 ) i do n't care for their wonton soup . 2 ) the inside does n't look nice to eat in so it 's really mainly a carryout place .	3950
1	we decided to try shanghai wok and i 'm glad we did . i got tofu and mixed vegetables and the sauce was really good . my son had chicken fried rice and said it was good too . i 'll definitely go back and if the food is this good next time i 'll make it my `` go-to '' chinese place in nordonia	3950
0	i wo n't go back . food was , at best , mediocre in flavor and texture . if i ate the shrimp blindfolded i would n't have been able to tell you it was shrimp . this place used to have great chinese food but apparently not any more .	3950
0	the only reason that this restaurant is getting one start is because it goes no lower . after a long drive , we decided to order chinese . they did n't take half of our order over the phone . asked for a tip and then were irritated with the tip given . then argued that we did n't order the other half of our meal when we called them back . rude ! ! ! ! ! do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere .	3950
0	man , first dead flies in my beef n ' broccoli now bones in my general tso 's that found their sharp broken ends in the roof of my mouth . tastes great , however , check your food here thoroughly .	3950
1	****get the white sauce for your fries ! ! ! ! the bbq was better than expected - ribs were good and the brisket was very tasty , although lots of fat . loved the sauces ( slap yo mama - fave ! ) and the fries were extra yummy . very nice surprise and friendly team - thank you !	3951
1	whoa ! ca n't believe i 've driven past this place so many times while i should have been stopping in ! we tried it all , brisket , pulled pork , ribs , wings , mac n ' cheese , fries , parsely potatoes , cornbread , and all the sauces . i loved every bite . i consider myself a bbq enthusiast and this place deserves 2 thumbs way up . will go back as soon as possible .	3951
1	not the greatest pulled pork i 've ever had , but its good and probably the best in the area . i 'm a little surprised by the other reviews because my experience was good . this place is brand new , so there might be some issues training new people . give them a chance .	3951
1	delicious food . i was rather apprehensive about trying it because of the other reviews . the fall off the bone meat was tender , moist , and very flavorful ! it was so good that after eating our lunch , we had to get carry out for dinner . we will definitely frequent this restaurant and if it was closer we would eat there regularly !	3951
1	excellent food ! fair prices and good portions . try all the sauces . brisket chili with rock your socks off . see ya again soon jimmys !	3951
1	one of my favorite local bbq spots in the falls . great selection of sauces and the meats are always spot on . my personal favorite : bbq rice bowl with chicken , original sauce , lettuce , cheese , banana peppers , and sour cream . we 've also used jimmys to cater a number of family events and it 's always a hit !	3951
1	pretty much everything we had on our plates was great . the parsley potatoes were kinda blah ... basically new potatoes straight from a can and had some butter and parsley added . but otherwise the rest of the meats and sides were great . there was also a regular customer in there who goes by the name `` larry '' . he was great for entertainment . a bit pricey ... but i have no problem paying a bit more for good food .	3951
1	stop by for the heck of it . and the rubs and sauces are the best the mac @ cheese wow . so if u see there name stop by and have a few runs best for me so far	3951
0	chicken had a terrible and dry taste . the brisket was smoked for 2 minutes , if at all . i asked the person behind the counter if the lemonade was homemade and they said yes , absolutely no way it was . portion sizes are awful and they are not flavorful at all . i threw the chicken away rather than taking it home to my dog . i will never come here again or recommend it to anyone i know .	3951
0	dissapointed , would not recommend this place , small portions , get double the meat at old carolina , the sauces are bland , and the sides are terrible and they expect you to tip for just making the food ? ! ? i will not be back	3951
0	disgusting ! ! went here a few months ago , they heated up the ribs in a microwave and gave me cold sides and a cold and stale corn muffin . not only was the mac and cheese cold , it was also tasteless . my fiancé got pulled pork that a girl pulled out of a pot with her glove covered hand and then placed in a used styrofoam cup to be weighed on a scale before putting on a stale burger bun . do they not have kitchen utensils ? ! ? ! this place should be shut down , will never come back !	3951
0	it was `` ok '' . if you are going to claim to be authentic southern bbq- you need to deliver that . the bbq was dry . side dishes- bland . they have potential . would like to see them kick it up a notch or two .	3951
0	this place is not a true bbq place ... ..if you claim to be a bbq place you better smoke your meats ... .waste of money	3951
0	food was rather bland had to drown it in sauce ... should n't you smell the smoker or something when you are walking in ? or at least inside ! ? i think that should of tipped me off	3951
0	very below average . i got the one meat dinner with the beef brisket . the brisket was awful . lots of fat . the macaroni and cheese had no flavor . the bbq sauces were very runny and none of them were very good . very overpriced . just say no .	3951
0	horrible ! the ribs were burnt to a crisp . they may also have the worst sauce in the state and possibly country . no joke this place is by far the worse bbq i 've ever had . the sides were just as tasteless . i wish my family and i never stopped at this place .	3951
1	as with many chains , this panda express location does n't have a lot to add to . however , the food was tasty ( mmm ... msg ) , the service was solid , and the interior was clean .	3952
1	the restaurant is always clean and the service is fast . i have found the employees there to be very pleasant . clearly they must like working there because they all seem to have the most genuine smiles . for fast food i would say it 's great . whenever we want something quick we come here because it does n't taste like we are eating fast food . the parking situation is good . no matter what time of day there always seems to be a place to park . i would definitely recommend this location and this restaurant to anyone .	3952
1	i love panda express especially this one the girls are always nice and polite . the only complaint i would have is they always run out of teriyaki chicken : / still love this place tho ! the food has always been good and the seating and tables have always been clean . would definitely recommend this location if you are in the area .	3952
0	ordered teriyaki chicken and was told it would be a 10 minute wait ( which is ridiculous for `` fast '' food ) . i would 've declined it , but we came to panda specifically for that dish . so we said we 'd wait . my husbands food sat out , getting cold , while we waited closer to 15 minutes . in the meantime the one person in the kitchen was openly just standing there on their phone . it was infuriating to know we were waiting for food while someone was just standing there playing on their phone . super unprofessional .	3952
0	they open at 10 . i showed up at 10:30 and they still had nothing ready . i literally waited 30 minutes ( because my gf wanted panda ) for string bean chicken and mushroom chicken . it was ridiculous ... a couple showed up after i arrived they ordered , ate and left and i was still waiting . will not be back to this location because of the bad service . by he time i got home the rest of my food was cold and veggie rolls were soggy . i would give this 0 stars if i could	3952
0	we waited almost 10mins before we was asked what we wanted . the employees are rude . where you fill your drinks was completely discusting . they also needed to clean a couple of messy tables . i should have taken pictures .	3952
1	awesome car wash the staff is amazing to deal with not very common now and days good nod to the management on picking staff will definitely be back over and over	3953
1	i went to their free car wash grand open on 9/15/18 the staff provide good customer service . i went to the one on lake mead before . and my car did n't get damage . but when i was drying my car off at this location rancho and craig i notice a few new scratches on my vehicle . i did n't contact the staff about it bcuz it 's my word against theirs . no sold proof . my car was left clean but also damage . if i known it was going to do that i would 've hand wash it myself . so your basically taking a risk getting your car wash here . i heard they not reailable .	3953
0	this carwash is awful , their system damaged 2 of my rims . i called but they told me oh i have never heard of that.the most expensive car was i ever had .	3953
0	hi april . thank you for answering but i hope you understand my frustration in driving home with a car full of water and soap after i had a bad experience . and to top everything off the car wash is 1 out of 2 locations in question for card fraud on my debit card .	3953
1	got stranded here for a night because of a car wreck , but i was pleasantly surprised when my room was wonderful ! my bathroom was also insanely clean ; i even took a bath ! also , quirky cute night staff woman was helpful and kind !	3954
1	stayed here several times when on the road working and training at the kings mountain duke energy training center and its always been a great stay . the staff has always went above and beyond to accommodate our large group . they put on a smiling face and clean up after us like your mother would have and be honest some of you guys are like children and your room is a pig stye lol . i ca n't thank them enough and ca n't wait to come back !	3954
1	clean and attractive accommodations . friendly staff as well . we stay at the holiday inn express a lot because they typically have a great breakfast bar . however , there was no bacon or sausage on the morning of 30 july ; bummer ! they did have sausage gravy , however .	3954
1	nice hotel . the location is a bit odd , kinda difficult to get to . but very clean , good breakfast and friendly staff . the elevator is a bit geeky when it stops , but that 's the only thing bad i have to say .	3954
0	roaches ... overpriced for an old dirty motel ...	3954
0	we are in the hotel now . very clean and staff seems nice . the room is so hot and there was no way to make it colder . we asked for a fan . it makes no difference . it just blows the hot air around . the staff needs to do something to make the rooms cooler before people check in . miserable .	3954
0	this is the first time i have stayed at a hotel where i have n't felt safe . the hotel sits atop a hill over looking a field and the freeway . i went outside a few times in the evening , and there were questionable people just sitting in their cars in the parking lot . the hallways were dimly lit , and it just did n't feel safe . there is nothing special about the hotel , and not sure what else is in the neighborhood .	3954
0	price gouging after holidays ... after driving go 15 hours wanted a nice clean place to rest our head ... the general manager refuse to try a work out s reasonable price . bad business ! ! !	3954
1	i called luis as an emergency , and he showed up within an hour . he offered an extremely fair deal for the work that i was looking for , and his team did an impeccable job in no time . it was a pleasure talking to luis , and i will definitely be relying on his services in the future . do n't go anywhere else !	3955
1	it was a pleasure doing business with luis & company . they did an incredible job on my sod , followed up by phone and visits , cleanup was exceptional . i highly recommend for small or large projects . than you	3955
0	management is disorganized , pricing is extremely high , and when they promise to provide a quote they fail to even respond . my expectations were much higher and ended up being less than average . suggesting everyone who reads this finds another landscaper as this is likely the most abrasive and rude company in the valley .	3955
0	very unprofessional and extremely rude . i 'm not impressed at all by this company and would suggest others refrain from engaging . what a disappointing experience . the owner is a liar .	3955
1	i went in there last april just looking and comparing guns and prices . i went to another gun shop fully convinced of a specific gun . well when i went in here they showed me all of their 9mm pistols and let me compare them all . in a nutshell i found the gun which i currently own ( ruger sr9 ) . like it says . they help you choose a gun not sell you one . extremely friendly and family oriented . you walk in and there is a coloring table for kids ! first gun store based around the safety of the family not person . 100 % satisfaction from this customer !	3956
1	great customer service . spoke with the owner , dave , who was patient , helpful and knowledgeable . he answered all of my questions and even provided additional information that was extremely helpful . i would definitely go back , once i decide on my next purchase .	3956
1	should have bought my ruger 22 here , stopped in for yogurt after buying same gun in henderson gun store same day i would have saved $ 50.00 plus they would have gave me 100 rounds free as i paid for at spurlocks gun shop . trust me the other gun i was looking at is $ 60.00 cheaper to here at on target guns.. just spent $ 60 more , wish i new about on target guns before ... .	3956
1	i wanted a smith & wesson m & p 9mm performance center model 10108 with a ported slide and ported barrel and these guys had it at a super price $ 50.00 off msrp . they have a very good supply of accessories . theses guys were very helpful and knowledgeable . they are super patient and polite and not pushy salesmen . i definitely recommend this nice store on the east side .	3956
1	knowledgeable staff , a little pricey but they have a good selection of guns , ammo and accessories .	3956
1	love this place ! all of the people i met that work here have been awesome , feels like a home away from home . bought a rifle from them and was so excited that they had a spike 's tactical in stock ! do n't miss out on great prices and a chance to support your local gun store so they can continue to be the awesome place that they are !	3956
0	if i could give this place zero stars i would . i was interested in a glock 22 and i asked this guy if i could see it . he replied , where are you from ? i kindly told him california . the then said , `` i ca n't even let you hold it . everything here is illegal in california . '' well dumbass , glock 22 's are not illegal in california . rude , unprofessional and not helpful what so fucking ever .	3956
0	came back a third time to ask about ffl procedures . once again the blonde girl ruins another visit . as i was waiting i could over hear her conversation with another customer she was assisting with . she was telling the customer that the .380 handgun she was picking up was no good and it would for sure jam even after the break in period . not a good way to talk to customers . blonde insisted the customer go with an xds because the .380 would always jam , lol . i could n't take it anymore , i bought a raffle ticket and left .	3956
0	unprofessional and rude . guys treat you like you do n't know anything . went to return ammunition and they said that i could n't even so the receipt clearly states that i could and they were just rude about it and did n't apologize or anything so now i 'm stuck with what i bought .	3956
0	prices per round : brass : 9mm - $ 0.40 .223 - $ 0.50 steel : .223 - $ 0.36 are you kidding me ? no wonder the store was empty . business is business , obviously , but to run a 100 % markup on ammo ? shame .	3956
0	bad service ! came here because it had good reviews , did n't have items in stock , still bought items was told it was arriving on a specific day , went on that day only to find out it did n't arrive . never going back !	3956
0	owner supports infringement and universal backgroubd checks . straight from the horses mouth on their own facebook page . check for proof . in sure he will take off the bmreview section so no one can see it .	3956
1	jessica was the best consultant ! ! ! ! super sweet , super professional , and very good at what she does . even though i could n't find the dress because i had my heart set on a mori lee gown , i would go back just to see her . !	3957
1	i worked with stacie today and she was amazing ! i showed her a few pictures and the dresses she brought back were great . stacie found the perfect dress for me and made the experience one that i 'll never forget . thank you stacie !	3957
1	cherletta was very sweet and patient . she helped get me my dress online so i would n't have to buy a dress of the rack for my wedding . had a great experience !	3957
1	i scheduled an appointment at david 's bridal to have my wedding dress fitted/altered . anna assisted me and was professional , helpful and extremely knowledgeable . parts of the dress did n't feel right , but i could n't seem to find the words to explain how i wanted it just , `` i do n't like it.. i do n't know what i do n't like about it.. i just hate how it fits . '' somehow she could understand what i could n't seem to articulate and after removing several pins and adding some here and there.. the dress fit perfectly . anna you 're the best , thank you for all your help !	3957
1	i visited this david 's bridal , because the one at northlake mall did not have the bridesmaid dress i needed to try on . i was greeted immediately , and was helped immediately by their associates . they were very nice , helpful and extremely attentive , which was greatly appreciated .	3957
1	i want to give a huge thanks and hug to jonathon who was my stylist . i explained to him my sister is getting married in 3 weeks due to her beast cancer . i needed a a dress that she would like , fit and be altered in time . he was extremely patient , and understanding . i never felt rushed as he gave his undivided attention to me . he found the perfect dress and was able to have it customized by suggesting we add a different color satin sash to the waist . it truly made all the difference . he is a god send ! thanks so much ! julia b	3957
1	david 's bridal was great . the had great selection of dress for my fiancé to choose from . samantha was awesome . she was very knowledgable and friendly .	3957
0	many people are not friendly here . they are very pushy . the associates will try to make you leave with a dress even when you are not happy with it . just go elsewhere .	3957
0	went in and store was completely empty although i did make an appt . i had already registered and the lady at the front insisted i do everything again , even though i 'd done it at my local store and my sister was just there to try on and see what size she would need . i find out that because of that the woman in pineville totally messed it up and almost caused my bridesmaids to be in the wrong color . so glad the asst manager at northlake was able to fix this . will not be sending my bridesmaids to this location .	3957
0	very bad customer servie , there is an employee called john , even refuse me to take a look at that . he said i should go to their website to take a look at the dress not in store . he said he did n't want to take the plastic out and i do n't buy it . very rude and unprofessional , do n't go there !	3957
0	i went there with my friends to look for dresses.. and the service was terrible . they barely gave us attention , whenever we asked for help they 'd nod and ignore our request .	3957
0	my daughters and their friends were there to select bridesmaids dresses . the man that helped them was blunt and rude . he would not call them by their name , but by their dress size ! ! ! ! 7 beautiful young ladies , from size 0 to size 14 , all having the entire store full of customers know their sizes ! no class ! of course , in our society , the girls would not call him out on it . they were too polite . as a father , i think i would have twisted that man 's neck shut . never using them for my girls wedding !	3957
0	came in for a single girl dress and it was a last minute thing . the dresses were nice but was denied the purchase because someone needed to get the commission . bad first experience	3957
0	the sales staff was amazing , and my shopping experience was wonderful . my problem is with the alterations department . the dress has a lace overlay , and i was told they would fix any picks in the lace . they did not do this . one side was not taken in properly and after mentioning this , my complaint was dismissed . they also rushed me during my final fitting . with two weeks to my wedding , i had to take it to another seamstress in order to make the dress fit properly . i am thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the work especially for the amount of money i paid on both the dress and alterations .	3957
1	food was pretty good however the prices are high . waitress did a great job until she asked if i needed change .	3958
1	had a great experience there tonight after the bush concert . was very impressed by the way our food came out . the presentation was flawless . cooks looked like they were doing an awesome job being a former restaurant manager . great job	3958
1	good food for a sit down restaurant at the casino . prices were reasonable and the service was good . great stop .	3958
1	my meal was amazing . the server told me that they make all there burgers by hand . the food is so fresh and taste great . the cobb salad is really good . i highly recommend going here .	3958
1	birthday time and after a couple hours of casino time we went into the cafe for an early dinner . our server was first class , and our food was perfect . she went above and beyond to be sure we were well taken care of . we enjoy the food at this quiet oasis on the midst of ringing bells and music coming from the slots .	3958
1	had a great lunch here 1/3/2014 . my friend got the tupelo chicken tenders ( on the appetizer menu ) she loved the light breading and the sauces . i got the filet of fish sandwich . i chose the grilled version- it was a very nice whitefish filet on a brioche bun . we did n't try dessert or anything- maybe next time .	3958
0	they do n't allow kids which is odd . i wanted to take my family out to dinner and was stopped by security in the parking lot ! ! i do n't really understand why my kids ca n't eat here ? we wo n't be back . other hard rocks allow kids . booo	3958
0	worst hard rock i 've ever been to , and i have been to a number of them , from the one in the netherlands to the one in la . we were told 10 minute wait , 25 mins later told it would be 15 additional minutes with no apology from the same hostess who told us 10 . we left in a hurry after that . avoid at all costs	3958
0	we could n't even get in with our teenage sons . it 's in the middle of the casino and there 's no access for people under 21 . absolutely ridiculous that an establishment like hard rock cafe would make their restaurant so inaccessible .	3958
0	the management was terrible . the food was bland and i asked for medium rare and was given a near well done steak . the obese manager took about ten minutes to reach our table and i was disappointed when she did approach us about the low quality menu .	3958
0	on a sunday afternoon , only 5 tables occupied . service was quick but just that , service ! no small talk , just take the order , get the drinks and wait . small portions , a bit overpriced , and not the best food i have had , miss the hard rock downtown ! better atmosphere , better prices , bigger portions , and better food ! !	3958
0	after studying the lunch menu i decided on the pulled pork bbq sandwich . wow ... it was bad . the pork was not firm at all . it was like mush . it had a whitish coloring to it like it was pig fat . i could of ate it without teeth by gumming it . nasty .	3958
1	we stayed here last august ( 2016 ) and thoroughly enjoyed our one week visit . unfortunately , i was sick for almost the entire week of our stay . fortunately , however , there was plenty to do onsite . we enjoyed the pool almost daily , as well as the activities ( miniature golf , bean bag toss , and jenga ) . the room was very spacious and comfy and the property 's location was convenient to shopping and grocery stores . my 1 1/2 yr old daughter definitely enjoyed everything here , including the huge tub in the master room . i can totally see us staying here again and again . thank you , sheraton !	3959
1	this is a phenomenal place to stay at ! the grounds are beautiful and the rooms are wonderful . best of all , the staff are so courteous and friendly . the really care about your stay . 5 stars from me ! !	3959
1	we had a wonderful stay . the one bedroom suite was very spacious and clean . there are n't a ton of amenities and things to do on the property but the pool area was nice and tons of fun for our toddler . mo and the members of the activities team were absolutely amazing , and helpful at making our stay memorable !	3959
1	i 've been traveling to phoenix for several years now for business and , never considered this property as an option . i was pleasantly surprised by the customer service i received . they made me feel at home . the accommodations exceeded my expectations . from now on , i look forward to staying there for future trips !	3959
1	another great holiday at this fantastic resort . friendly staff & really nice , clean facilities . quieter & more bijou than kierland . we 'll be back !	3959
1	first class resort and wonderful amenities . the staff is very helpful and it feels like home . this place is great for a vacation or stay cation !	3959
0	hotel room and property were nice , but felt like we were in a police state every time we came and went . there were motorcycle cops running a speedtrap between 101 and the hotel several times as well as sitting in the parking lot . when we asked the hotel staff about it , they laughed and said `` oh yeah , they 're always here '' . definitely detracted from our stay here and i will probably look elsewhere next time .	3959
0	i would not have even left 1 star if that was an option . the pool is pretty . the rooms are nice . however the hours of the resturant & bar hours ( and options ) and service is just pathetic . yesterday the man at the front desk suggested the food truck that was out front . this no oasis .	3959
0	roaches in our room ! and our bed ! front desk people were not accommodating and the handed me new sheets so i had to change them myself and actually handed me a can of raid . the offered me a free drink for the `` inconvenience '' of a roach climbing on me in bed..	3959
0	i booked into this resort for a 6-night stay and tried to move one of the days due to a death in the family . they were super helpful to charge me a $ 50 fee to change one night ! congrats on charging me for my uncle 's death . keep up the good work !	3959
0	watch out for scorpions ! my husband and i were stung in our bed in the middle of the night . upon further inspection , the seal below the front door was not tightly adjusted , making a perfect entrance for a scorpion , especially since our condo was in the ground floor .	3959
0	amenities are not very good . they did not clean my room properly . no room service after 8pm .	3959
1	by far the best haircuts you can get for a great price , the staff is fun and easy to talk to , i highly recommend these guys !	3960
1	apparently this place gets crazy busy sometimes but i was able to get right in and sit down on a wednesday morning . i did n't need anything fancy but oskar really listened to what i wanted and took the time to give me a great cut . he was n't happy until i was happy and i left feeling like million bucks . i 'll be coming back for sure !	3960
1	best shop around ! all barbers treat you like you 're family . will be the only shop i go to until i move out of state . prices are great , wait times are not bad , and you get the freshest , cleanest cut available .	3960
0	been a here a few times with my son he usually gets a good cut , the last two times not so well sloppy lines and uneven cuts the barber was pressing super hard with the clippers on his neck it looks like he got into a fight and someone scratch up his neck.. referred a friend here to get her sides shaved down the original guy who did the cut was great when she went back in for a clean up idk if the guy was drunk or what but totally messed up he line up completely uneven and missed huge chunks of hair.. unfortunately they lost a loyal customer to inconsistent service smh .	3960
0	very slow . walked out when one of the barbers quit what he was doing so he can talk on cell phone . they both work very slow .	3960
0	when i walked in i was told it would only be a couple minutes , 40 minutes later the two barbers were still working on the same two people when i first got in there . the barbers were two of the slowest i 've ever seen . i was the second person that got up and just walked out .	3960
1	great ambiance , great food , although their policy of no reservations can be a drag . great place for ribs ... they are so tender they fall off the bone . i always order the louisiana chicken ... ..a flattened chicken breast smothered with grilled vegetables and goat cheese . goat cheese is like bacon ... it just makes everything better . also try their artichoke dip as an appetizer ... it is the best out there . on our last visit ( less than a week ago ) , their baked beans were different ... hopefully it was just a hiccup because they are usually incredible . service is always excellent and the prices are reasonable considering portion size .	3961
1	very satisfied with our mother 's day lunch . : ) ny striploin medium rare with baked potatoes and their ribs are highly recommended .	3961
1	i love this location ! if you make a reservation you get seated fairly quickly . their food is delicious and the prices are reasonable for a steak dinner . did i mention their food is delicious ? i have even been there for lunch and the roast beef sandwich with au jus is amazing !	3961
1	baton rouge puts the keg to shame ! the prime rib is amazing . fresh , juicy , and so tasty . the steak is also very , very good . the ribs , however , are an absolute stand out .	3961
1	went in to have steak and lobster as part of prix fix menu . great portions , great taste , and one of the best cheese cakes for dessert that ive had in a long time ! got a coupon for a free spinich dip to try after their renovations are done . waiter was on his `` a game '' not missing a beat with his service . will go back after renovations .	3961
1	went for dinner late last saturday night with the family . took a while to get a table at 9pm but ribs were fantastic as usual and service was good as well .	3961
1	my favorite baton rouge of all the other franchises ! does n't give you that franchise-y feeling but more like you 're at home ? ! staff is great and friendly ! menu is superb and food is awesome try the chicken ! delicious baked potato . drinks are n't diluted just great ! worth the drive to maple !	3961
0	the food was n't really good to write about it . very expensive with no talent for service . my food was late because they have a party for lunch . unbelievable that a waitress need to tel me that . i 'm not recomen this place . again too expensive for the food they serve .	3961
0	cajun fries were good and everything else was disappointing . this is what i expected anyways from a chain restaurant . the seafood , steak and cajun food did n't cut it . when will they bring a bubba gump shrimp to canada .	3961
0	waited long , i asked for a medium rare steak and was served a raw steak full of fat . my partner had to eat alone since i had to send my steak back twice i went hungry left hungry and was offered nothing but an apology . i will never go to this location again as customer service is n't the best	3961
0	what a downer compared to what this place was in the early years ! wow bad service and even worse food ! good luck , wo n't be seeing me again .	3961
0	came in around 4:30 . place was dead , that 's fine . had seafood linguini . at $ 25 , a little overpriced , but acceptable . the problem when it 's not busy is that the waitstaff koffeeklatches . i had to shoot flares to get a drink , or much else for that matter . very average food , less than stellar service . oh , and the wifi was on the fritz . seriously ? place needs a manager .	3961
0	way too much bbq source and look like a soup for the pulled pork protein cheese is not not melted for the price is not worth it at all	3961
0	we went there because one of my friends who is a foodie bragged and bragged about how good the food was . it 's nothing spectacular . over priced and service was slow and not very personable . i work in the restaurant industry and i guess my expectations are higher . if i was to pay the prices i paid , i 'd rather go to milestones or even joeys ... at least the service is always consistent . will not go back	3961
1	this company fixed my garbage disposal earlier today and did a great job ! both the person i made the appointment and repair person were friendly and professional . the repair person was punctual and my disposal replaced within 45 minutes . i 'd definitely use them again .	3962
1	had an emergency sewer line back-up and our home warranty company recommended do it right plumbing . we called and got a speedy response . the technician was courteous and professional . found the problem and cleared the line that had backed up from a feeder line in the alley . problem solved . thanks you !	3962
1	this is a great local company . i have used them many times and they are one of the few who seem to actually care and go out of their way to get out to your home as soon as possible . thumbs up to ruby and her husband .	3962
0	if your home warranty refers you to them , request a different company . would not return calls and quoted availability for three weeks out . methinks not is right ! !	3962
0	horrible company , horrible customer service . as all of the other reviewers have said , if you are forced to use this company through a home warranty , demand that they re-assign your claim to a company that will treat you with a modicum of respect .	3962
0	these are contractors for my home warranty company . the receptionist/girlfriend/wife ? is very rude and ignorant . they told me that my plumbing issue was a non emergency ! there are several other people that live in my home and they were affected also . they are closed on saturdays and sundays so do n't expect to hear from them if you have an `` emergency '' issue . plumber in charge has a very nasty attitude . leave them alone ! if your home warranty company tries to send them your way- request someone else !	3962
1	it 's a small placed tucked away in forest hills , it 's a ma and pa shop , the seating is limited , you can tell by the look that it was once a neighborhood bar . the wife is very sweet and so is the husband , the food is cooked as ordered so everything is fresh , huge portions and the wonton soup is to die for . very hard to find good quality chinese food i for one do n't care for the american version . i want the real deal i will give this place a five star , based off of the quality and that it is authentic .	3963
1	reasonable prices for excellent chinese cuisine . the family is friendly and helpful .	3963
0	other people in our party enjoyed their meals but it just wasnt for me . it seemed very sketchy to me and i only liked their wonton soup .	3963
0	i 'm not sure what people are thinking when they say this place is good and deserves 5 stars , but avoid if at all possible . the fried rice was greasy and had no vegetables or egg in it to start . we ordered sweet & sour chicken . it also came with no vegetables and the sauce was clearly watered down because it was so runny . the egg rolls were not very good and the lo mein was off in terms of flavor and odor . overall , we spent $ 34 and it was n't worth $ 4 . never again .	3963
1	was at a local pub and several people recommended this place . tried it . what a great find ! thank god it 's near my house ! i tried the gyro and it was wonderful . looking forward to trying the philly cheesesteak ! ! ! !	3964
1	this place serves really good food , especially if you are on the go ... i go to asu west and i always pass by when i 'm around the area . although there is limited seating inside , the price and quality of the food makes up for it . make sure to try the philly cheese steak and chicken tenders ... amazing !	3964
0	ordered a gyro salad at 699 smallest salad i 've ever had in my life ! ! ! horrible amount of meat literally only had 2 tablespoons of meat ... not worth the money !	3964
0	i would n't eat here they put chill in my sub an there was a lot of bugs all around the prep area and it seem like it was a place were they just want to take you money an the cook an cashier were not friendly an the guy cooking my food julio is a good friend of mine an he would never do this to my food but went along an i have a severe allergic reaction to chile an they think is a game an the dude garrett mother was there doing drug behind the counter an he only have her 20 buck on mother 's day this place need new management	3964
1	the chocolate here is both beautiful and delicious . the cafe is adorable ; definitely a nice place to sit and enjoy dessert or a drink !	3965
1	the chocolate is delicious and the hot chocolate is the best ever ! i highly recommend the chocolate tasting class as a fun activity to do something different , you get to try alot and also learn some neat facts ! the chocolates are not only great to devour yourself , but they make great gifts for any occasion/person !	3965
0	horrendously expensive chocolate -- paid over $ 5 for two tiny pieces of chocolate , 1 ounce of chocolate total , one 1cm x 1cm chocolate caramel with way too much salt and another truffle that was good but not great ( also 1cm x 1cm ) . each piece of chocolate is a little over half of an ounce meaning you 're effectively paying $ 45/lb for chocolate -- absurd . good , but nothing memorable and definitely would not recommend . there are no deals for buying multiple pieces and you can easily spend $ 20+ buying 10 tiny pieces of chocolate . would not recommend .	3965
0	had to come back 3 times to get my order right . the first time , they gave me the wrong type of cake . the second time , the slice they gave me for $ 6.50 was thin as paper . the third time i came back they gave me a larger piece , the quality was awful . hyvee or festival foods has better cake for half the price . the cake was dry and lacked flavor . this place is a complete ripoff . do n't come here !	3965
1	in charlotte for vacation . decided to stop by to get my boyfriend a haircut and we are both highly satisfied with the results . it 's unfortunate that we do n't live in town or else this place would definitely be my boyfriends go to barbershop .	3966
1	the barbers wear grate and love the way . they left my boys looking nice and fresh ...	3966
0	few friends recommended this place but they cut me like 6 or more times even took a chunk out of my scalp . i do n't think he used a new blade to shave me . not happy for first time customer . disappointed , wo n't be going back .	3966
0	i got my wort hair cut ever in this shop . the barber that work on my just did his own style different that what i told him .	3966
1	if you 're the junk food type of vegan and like things like vegan pizza , cream cheese , ice cream , tofu , etc . you will not be able to find any of those things here ! they lose a star for that.. : ( i was lucky enough to find one vegan amy 's brand burrito though ! on the plus side , you can find kombucha , a decent produce selection , and the store is open until midnight . cashier and other employees stocking were friendly , there were plenty of carts to choose from and the store was clean .	3967
1	my compliments to the manager of this store . this is the first walmart i visited where the employees have such excellent customer service skills . i would recommend this particular store to all my friends and family members . in particular their pharmacy department is outstanding , especially a pharmacy tech named jeanie .	3967
1	been shopping at albertsons for 27 years . just recently moved near the walmart neighborhood market . i really like shopping here . it really does have the feel of a friendly neighborhood market . it 's not as large as albertsons but it has almost everything i need . only thing missing is a good deli counter . the employees are always friendly and helpful . prices are very low on everything . there is a customer service counter to pay your utility bills or purchase money orders . love this store .	3967
1	i live like a minute from this walmart so it is very convenient and they have a lot of the groceries that i want . the workers there are nice as well .	3967
1	you got ta love wal mart . prices are all great , and great selection . the neighborhood ones do n't have everything that the super wal marts do , but very conveinant if you need to pick up a few things , especially food . you know you will be getting a good deal here all the time . wish i had a super closer to me but i do n't , so this will do .	3967
1	i really enjoy shopping here in the morning after a long nights work . blanch is so pleasant that i 'll wait for her register over self checkout any day . i ca n't say of any other cashier at any other walmart who asks about my day , what i 'm doing for dinner or just asks how i 'm doing . thanks much blanch !	3967
1	i like shopping here the employees and management are always helpful , nice and polite . 2 thumbs-up to all employees .	3967
1	one thing i love about this wal-mart , is that it 's open 24-7-365 . i have been here several times as i just live 500 feet down the street , and i am usually satisfied with the customer service . they have really any thing you might need , even tools and stuff like that . their self check out really helps speed things up , some places have self check outs that always page a rep , but that has only happened to me once . it is not usually that crowded , except during rush hour , and after midnight , whenever i go in there , the only people there are the workers .	3967
1	way better than the regular super store sized walmart , -less people , happier staff . my one complaint is that i always see about 10 employees restocking/roaming the isles but there is only ever one single cashier ! super frustrating , other than that it 's good .	3967
0	every time i enter this store and associate is a total jerk . no customer service or respect for shoppers . terrible place to shop . do not go here .	3967
0	despite the good location , i rarely shop here because every time i go , one of the african american employees is cold and/or rude to me . at the deli , they 'll prepare my order and just hand it to me . no smile , no `` thank you , '' no `` have a great day , '' nothing . it 's the same thing at the check-out . they have good prices , but just know that if you 're white , you 'll be shopping in a hostile environment here .	3967
0	it 's such a shame and inconvenience that every single time i go to this walmart they are always out of pretty much everything on my list . stocking issues have been an issue morning , noon , and night . so i am not basing it off of going late at night when they are indeed unloading product . also they never have enough lines open , so it can be a bit of a wait ... waiting on the one or two employees trying to check out a line full of people . hoping they can get more organized and hire more employees ... that would be great !	3967
0	this place sucks . employees are mediocre but that 's what walmart seeks out . it 's from a management down philosophy . the customers are disgusting & the cleanliness is pretty bad . too bad this is really the only market around	3967
0	the size of this store and they do n't have one pot to cook in.. never coming back.. smiths and albertsons would have this..	3967
0	open some dam checkout lines & if your going to force people to use the stupid self checkout at least make sure an employee is standing there to help with problems- - terrible everytime i shop here	3967
0	too many many people , not enough cashiers . hell most of the self-checkout spots are unavailable ! ! !	3967
0	they used to be 24/7 and now close at midnight . no reason to come to this hole at all now .	3967
0	horrible customer service , employees are low class and very rude . if you are unfortunate enough to have to pick up anything from the pharmacy you are more likely to succumb to your illness than get the medicine you need . i try to avoid this location at all costs . god bless you if you ever have to deal with laquisha or lafawnda supposed to be a manager .	3967
1	i have had great luck finding awesome stuff at all american estate sales . i have been able to get a ton of stuff that has been brand new to use for gifts .	3968
1	great estate sale as always ! ! bobbi is always friendly and smiling ! ! ca n't wait till the next one ! !	3968
1	bobby knows how to negotiate with the best of them ! great customer service and great deals every weekend ! glad i signed up for the mailing list for the inside scoop on upcoming sales ! always a pleasure .	3968
1	great estate sale today ! ! ! come see all the really vintage stuff in this old vegas home ! see bobbi for a great deal ! !	3968
1	i have been following bobbi for over six years . her sales are always easy to find and fun to go to . today i found some 1960 birthday candle holders in the original box , nobody makes them anymore . she is the only liquidation company that stays open till five and does three days . she is fair with her prices and has always been very friendly . if i needed a liquidator i would use her because she knows the value of the items . it 's not a yard sale , its an estate sale !	3968
0	went to one of bobbie sales fri in sun city . no signs out til after nine am . she opened the door to about thirteen people in a very large house . nothing was marked except furniture and higher end items . she makes up prices as she goes along , pockets the money and gives you no receipt . terrible personality with a scowl on her face . i heard the sound of glass breaking and left after that . do not ever use her . try natasha at silver linings estate sale . professional honest and fair prices .	3968
0	i went to an estate sale put on by all american , and it was just filthy ! ! everything was all over the floor , nothing was priced , there was no cash register , she was not giving receipts , she was shoving money in her overalls she was wearing , and very unfriendly . to go in to someone 's home and treat their belongings in such a disrepectful way is uncalled for ! i will never go to another one of her sales again !	3968
0	by the far the worse in regards to estate sales . she is nasty , unorganized and definitely does not try to get items sold for her client . i realize there are some cheap low ball offering shoppers but i personally witnessed 4 customers while waiting in line that made decent offers . she also has no help and walks away from her line and will leave you talking . no cash register , no receipt , and very shady . there are many other companies that show far more care and respect for the client and customers .	3968
0	all the bad reviews are true , this lady is a grungy overall-wearing scammer . i know for a fact that all the leftovers from the estate that are `` donated '' are indeed donated ... to a family friend with a thrift store ! so when you go in and she says she wants $ 25 for an ugly pillow from the 70s ( for example ) , her ridiculously high prices make sense when you realize she overprices things so she can keep them and re-sell them . i love estate sales but i will never go to one run by this company again , it is a a waste of time and only empowers the crazy overall bandit .	3968
0	this lady is a mess , she 's not friendly , no price on her items , look at you and giive you a price at of a hat which is always very high . she 's always late to show at her own estate sale , she is not professional as she always screened that she is looking out for here client but she is looking out for herself . very high price argue with customers all the time , its her way of no way	3968
1	so far so good ... 19.99 gets you and a guest in . the staff is nice and friendly . this place is way cleaner then the other gyms in the area . only downside is that this place gets hot . seems to be a crap ac or something.. but overall the experience is pretty okay ... tip place gets super packed from 5~9	3969
1	great gym , it 's never to packed always fresh and equipment is always clean and works properly . great gym for people are busy and only have a an hour or less to workout very cheap monthly payments and you can even come and try it out for a day for only 10 dollars .	3969
1	have had no problems so far , been coming here for 3 months during the evening to late night hours ( which is the best , because no crowds ) . areas are usually clean , maybe some paper towels here and there , but its nothing to go crazy about .	3969
1	walked out of this location feeling like i belonged and relaxed after spending 3 minutes on the massage chair . i walked in for a tour and was greeted by friendly staff eager to show me around . i was impressed with the well kept equipment . plenty to go around . i figured i could start with the 30 minute circuit workout , move myself to the heavy weights , and end in the relaxation/spa area . great tour . ca n't wait to sign up .	3969
1	love planet fitness , this location has the best showers too . i highly recommend getting the $ 20 membership for the extra perks . it 's totally worth it .	3969
1	first of all , i had to get over the fact of pf taking away the bestest , icognito , lil , old skool theater in arcadia . once i got over that , i went in pf for a decent workout with one of my good friends . pf , you have a no-frills , inexpensive , but more-than-adequate set up here . you have plenty of machines and friendly staff to take care of us . the 30 minute workout literally took my breath away ( which is a good thing , since i 'm fairly fit ) ! -only turn off was the gym-socks-smell immediately when i had entered the building .	3969
1	basically i love this place , i go in after midnight , the gym is very clean and the staff is nice and friendly . i have noticed the cell phone police , dropping weight , grunting and gallon jugs rule are not enforced after midnight.. not a big deal to me , but i have seen some people very put off by this .	3969
0	due to a health issue i requested my membership to be canceled . after speaking with an employee i was assured it would be canceled but i am still being charged . i called in and was reassured it would be refunded but the manager then refused to honor that agreement . i had heard that these guys are shady but gave them the benefit of the doubt . i would not recommend this place .	3969
0	very deceptive marketing . it is not $ 9.99/month . you will pay a $ 50+ startup fee for them to enter . your info . unless you speak to a manager , you are required to bring in your bank account information vs a credit card . then ~3 months after you sign up , you will pay another $ 40 for an `` annual maintenance fee '' . that 's right , within the first three months , you have paid $ 120+ . i have learned why there is this `` maintenance fee '' -- machines on every line are broken . disappointment .	3969
0	this club should be avoided . go to the tempe location instead or join another gym . if you want streaming music on thomas st. forget it . the wifi they have at thomas is regularly down and they just do n't want to fix it correctly . the locker rooms are dirty too . the showers especially . dirt on the floors , old soap and paper towels are left on the floors and i have even seen old wet underwear left on the shower floors . even after speaking with management there has been no improvement .	3969
0	the wifi is constantly going down . bathrooms are frequently messy . even after contacting the hq of pf the same issues have persisted for over a year since i joined .	3969
0	i stopped going to planet fitness because all the the traffic here . it 's so congested with bodies you ca n't even think , and not to mention all the dudes grunting all the time , and there 's not even a free machine . plus all the massage chairs and beds are broken all the time . makes working out really discouraging .	3969
0	making it easier for someone to cancel a membership would be great . i have had the worst customer service experiences at pf especially at the arcadia location in phx . every person i 've come to talk to over the phone or in person is rude and not helpful . i have $ 20 withdrawn from my acct every month ( with receipts to prove it ) yet anytime i try to use my membership that i pay for they say my acct shows red flags but they do n't know why ? it 's ridiculous that i have to show proof of payment everyday while trying to get a work out in . planet fitness is not worth the energy or embarrassment .	3969
0	i wanted to join the gym but they would not let me because i chose to wear crocs that 's all i have i was n't going to buy a pair of sneakers just to go to the gym so i went to la fitness instead what a joke	3969
1	this is my favorite korean restaurant in pittsburgh . great tasty food and atmosphere ! the owner has a high standard in keeping the restaurant clean and providing good service . their food tastes like home-cooked meals with natural ingredients without chemical condiments such as msg . i like everything in their menu !	3970
1	food is good , but very pricey . i ordered a suhlungtang and paid $ 13 for it which is way too expensive ... but i understand ... it 's pittsburgh . anyway , i do n't doubt that the food is delicious so 4 stars !	3970
1	slightly more expensive than korea garden , but food is good quality . better than some places in ktown nyc in my opinion . i recommend the bibimbap , spicy hand-made pork & home-made kimchi dumplings in beef stew , and `` soon doo boo '' spicy soft-tofu stew . the bibimbap is huge and comes with so many components to it . my favorite thing about this place is definitely the side dishes , especially the daikon radish kimchi and potatoes . although , now they charge for refills when they did n't when they first opened .	3970
1	very good . a bit pricey but from our order we now have food for the next three meals , so in the long run the price was more than fair . wait staff does take a very long time to serve you/check in on you , and the karaoke tv seems very out of place .	3970
1	i have been to the week-end buffet a couple of times . i am not sure if they 're still doing it but , it was absolutely mind-blowingly good . expensive - $ 20 which is more like nyc prices . but , good home-cooked traditional korean dishes that to me are like asian soul-food . recommended if for just once in awhile due to the high cost . ( the buffet is only on sundays . )	3970
1	this place is so good ! i feel like i am getting authentic korean food . i like their pork bone noodle soup and their meat dishes ... one side note is that the portions are not huge and they are a little on the pricey side ... but at least the quality is good . i like the decor too . the pillows are very puffy .	3970
1	soo doo buu and seafood pancake are really good . the side dishes are fantastic . also 10 % off paying with cash	3970
1	we just got back from seoul two months ago , this food was wonderful and was a great value for lunch . i had the bibim-bop and my husband had the dumpling soup , both were delish ! we had home made persimmon tea after the meal which was fabulous . love the byob policy and soju on the menu !	3970
1	the food was delicious . i had bi bim bap . i liked that the bi bim bap came with many ingredients on the side so you could mix and match as you pleased . in addition , the meal was large . also , the dessert tea they serve at the end is delicious . the only con was the relatively high prices .	3970
1	galbi and soondubu are amazing . also , the breaded fried pork cutlet is awesome and it 's a massive serving . my parents are both korean and love the food . i 've eaten home cooked korean food all my life made by my mother , aunt , other aunt , other other aunt who comes to visit from korea , brother , grandma , other grandma , granny from church , and friend 's mom ( all korean , obviously ) . i 've had experience eating various personal styles of korean food , and i really love the food here . i find it true to authenticity and flavor . definitely recommend it !	3970
1	the food is good here . i love korean food so i go pretty often . it 's a really calm and relaxing place to be in .	3970
1	really enjoyed the atmosphere , the bibimbop , the assortment of pickles they brought out , and the kimchi dumplings . thought the bibimbop was a great deal for two . when they brought out all the small bites i felt like i was at someone 's mom 's house and she just brought me out a ton of stuff to try .	3970
1	green pepper is a decent korean joint . you 'd expect it not to be that authentic but you 'll be pleasantly surprised ! just do n't set your expectations too high . : p they 're reasonably priced for large portions . they serve a variety of korean food from soondoobu ( korean tofu soup ) to bibimbap to grilled mackerl & other assortments of meats .	3970
1	lovely . attentive servers , delicious vegetarian bibimbap , octopus , and kimchi . comfortable interior ( tables with couch seating are available ) . discount on the bill if you pay in cash . will absolutely go again .	3970
1	pittsburgh is a bit underwhelming in the korean department ; this place does n't stand up to the best options around atlanta or some other cities , but taking into account where you are , you can have an enjoyable if slightly overpriced meal .	3970
0	the prices are a bit high for what you get . the bi bim bap and spicy chicken are salty . i really wanted to like this place , but there are better options out there for korean food . the back room that has karaoke looks cool . i just wish the food was better for what you pay for .	3970
0	i made a reservation an evening before , but when i came they claimed they did n't receive the reservation , so i showed them the call history but they still denied . the attitude of the servant was very arrogant , being very irresponsibly saying it 's not his personal fault , and did n't positively seek for a solution for us . the worst experience i 've ever get on squirrel hill . we designed this to be a birthday dinner but it was all ruined .	3970
0	it is usually a great restaurant . however lately its service level dropped significantly . we waited forever to get our meal . the waiter was really shy and hesitated to serve us . i have been a pretty loyal customer but tonight we almost starved to death ... not sure when we will b back , if ever ...	3970
0	overpriced and abysmal service . we arrived during normal dinner hours to an awkwardly empty restaurant . we needed a minute to review the menu , and the waitress came over twice in about two minutes . it then took another fifteen for her to even glance at our table . the banchan does n't come first and in fact comes after the appetizer , with the course . the food was decent but pretty bad for the price , especially in comparison to nyc 's koreatown . flagging down a waitress for a water refill took about twenty minutes , as she had n't checked on our table for about forty . at that point , we were just done with this place .	3970
0	i made a reservation one day before we went there . but when we got there , they say there is no reservation . they confirmed that was their number i called , but they did n't write it down for reason .	3970
0	very bad experience irresponsible waiters we made a reservation but after we got here they said there was no such reservation . we showed them the calling record , they admitted that this was their number but claimed that they do n't know what was communicated on the phone therefore they can not guarantee there is a reservation . if yoh decided to come here to eat , no need to make a reservation because no one cares .	3970
0	i have visited this restaurant several times in the past with overall good experiences . however , my recent visit was quite disappointing . i made a small request , the same request was easily met during previous visits , due to a health issue . unfortunately , my request was disregarded and i was unable to eat my meal . in addition , the service was poor ( inattentive , unknowledgeable ) . i will be looking for replacement korean places soon .	3970
0	i am a vegetarian so i ordered a tofu entree which was pretty flavorless unless doused in soy sauce . the real reason i gave only 1 star is because my boyfriend ( who is only in town for two days ) ordered a beef entree and then spent the rest of the evening throwing it up . i expected more from this restaurant . we spent too much on our meal to spend the rest of the night throwing it up .	3970
0	taste good reason i only give 1 star : open too late . only after ( 5pm ) . closed 10pm , they would not accept any orders after 9pm . closed tuesday . business hours are awkward . seem they do n't need business .	3970
0	i just moved to pittsburgh and was really excited to see that there was a new korean restaurant . i really love korean food and have had it in many cities in the us . i was really disappointed in this place , though . the service was pretty poor , waiters had no knowledge of korean food . i had the bibimbap which was sub-standard . overall i was disappointed , i wish that they could step it up . i really really wish there was a good korean restaurant in pittsburgh but this just is n't it .	3970
0	way overpriced for subpar food ! bi bim bop ( vegetarian ) for $ 16 ? the food was surprisingly not spicy- i had to ask for a second side of red pepper sauce to make the bi bim bop have decent flavor . could hardly flag down staff when we needed anything . i definitely wo n't be back .	3970
0	i came there at 9pm , but the worker told me they did n't serve food anymore , although it shows it 's still open and the close time is 10pm . really bad experience , will never come back .	3970
0	i 've been here once . the service is fine , but i found their dukbokki to be unappealing . the fish taste was way too strong and the dukbokkis themselves were rather thick . i was also underwhelmed by the soondubu here . i recommend trying other korean restaurants in pittsburgh before coming here . i may reconsider coming back to try their bbq .	3970
0	the pork is terribly smelly . the food is awful . i think the meat we have has gone bad .	3970
0	the rating is mostly for service . we had a reservation and still waited an hour . once we got our table we were ignored . we had to call the server over many times during the course of the evening . i personally did n't like anything on the menu however the party i was with liked their meals . it was a bad experience . yes	3970
1	awesome service and awesome prices ! ! ! had a friend who is a cigar aficionado and went here via yelp . he was impressed . my go to cigar . i 'm hooked .	3971
1	internet is terrible . great shop , great prices , nice staff . no tax tobacco got ta love it . it would be 5 stars if not for the slugfest internet ...	3971
1	owl ear is a phenomenal tobacco shop . i frequent the store to buy cigars and smoke in the lounge . they have a great selection of quality cigars at the lowest prices i 've found in the valley . all the staff are extremely friendly as well . the smoking lounge is a great place to kick back , watch a game , and enjoy a stog .	3971
0	wow . the prices here at e joke . discount my ass . they are way over priced compared to fox bar and anthony 's . this might be an emergency only kinda place but damn - i better be dying .	3971
0	seriously they throw us out in the middle of monday night football ! 15 people & 6 pizzas wasted ! the place is a shit show ...	3971
0	encountered a very rude female employee during today 's visit . things did n't end well as i had to put her into her place with a rude farewell comment . this is an indian place , so i need a discount to shop in this store and the cigar holder said two cigars for $ 1.09 , but the package says $ 1.49 . of course this chick never went around to check my claim , just demanded i pay $ 1.49 . that is when things went downhill and since i know i was right , i don ; 't feel any regrets in letting her have a piece of my mind .	3971
1	i will be back ! i expected a tiny sandwich for $ 5 but it was too big to finish . i was able to feed myself and 5 hungry men for under $ 50 , sides included . the staff is super friendly and welcoming . i can really appreciate a place that offers extra cups of bbq sauce at no charge . everyone enjoyed their food but i must say the sliced brisket really hit the spot . go cowboys !	3972
1	the food and service is great ! ! ! i get the 2 meat combo ever time i go in . you get a decent amount of food for the price . i personal like the smoked ribs and brisket . i have no complaints .	3972
0	the place is very small . they were out of ribs : - ( so i got a brisket sandwich . the brisket was perfectly seasoned , tender and moist . the bottom half of the bun never stood a chance and was a soggy sponge in just a few minutes . they need a thicker bun especially for to-go orders . i will definitely try them again i just hope they have ribs .	3972
0	brisket was ok in flavor but was not tender . the beans i believe were canned , mac cheese tasted microwaved , cold salads seemed out of a container . nothing seemed from scratch . the staff was very friendly but not open for opinions . i think they have potential . i would like to see the food made from scratch and it would be nice if they served bread with your meal .	3972
1	my husband needed new tires for his gmc sierra . being new to the area we just drove to the first tire place we noticed and it worked out perfectly . dave was extremely helpful and easy to talk with . even without making an appointment it did n't take more than 3 hours for the installation and alignment . the tires are great , the customer service was awesome . this will definitely be our go to place for any future truck related needs !	3973
1	i 've been taking my vehicles to this location for many years and i 've always gotten great service . today it was an oil change , tire rotation , and state inspection . the pricing is always fair . their computer system is comprehensive so they know who you are and what 's been done . you 're able to make an appointment with a phone call . the techs are knowledgeable and explain things clearly . i 've never had a bad experience .	3973
0	this place did not put my car back together property . they left a part off or lost it then when i called they said they would see if they had one or if we replaced it they would reimburse us . what if we had not noticed and could have lost a large part of the under carriage cover ? would not recommend ! and i was only getting an oil change . could you imagine something major ?	3973
0	rip-off be aware if you take your car for inspection they have very few customer and they find away to overcharge you i was supposed to pay $ 68 for inspection end it up to pay $ 210 i did not mind if it was something major but they charged me because my fog light was not working and they made me to pay them just to remove it , my wife took the car to location in robinson , and they were going to even charge more so i went myself and had a huge argument with very rude manager , one more time do your research before you choose this place	3973
1	wonderful location , inventive menu , and great river views . worth the trip , especially with all of the art and shopping opportunities in cute paoli .	3974
1	very cool modern cafe that you would n't expect to find out in the small village of paoli . the patio overlooking the river really tops it off . solid menu for lunch - the soup was a great autumn-warmer : curry-squash . they have a few different types of sandwiches , which were definitely above average . desserts were top notch , and the bottled beer selection entertained . what a great little place , just a tad more expensive than i would have liked .	3974
0	this place is out of business . those of you with unused 2014 city tin coasters are out of luck . i wish i had called before i biked all the way to paoli with hopes of visiting this place ... .	3974
0	such a rude reception at this place while visiting from our of town . the lady ( i 'm assuming shes the hostess ) who greeted us said `` would 've been nice to get a phone call in advance '' when we asked for a table for 4 adults and 3 kids . but really , it was the dirty look she gave us and the tone of her voice . we did n't stick around -- life is too short to deal with bitter people unnecessarily . do n't give them your business unless you enjoy rude service .	3974
1	will need to figure out how to get my current face cream from them shipped to me since they do n't list it on the website but have it in store .	3975
1	just been there today and it was amazing , the girl who helped us was very patient , she recommend everything that was good . i mean what do i have to say about a makeup shop , but they should expand a little ...	3975
1	ok so lem me tell you about how i 've been spending about $ 30+ a month on one bottle of cakey mac foundation ! a girlfriend of mine ( master cosmetologist ) just recommended kiko instead and i just paid them a visit . full range of makeup in all shades at a super affordable price ! staff was extra helpful and color matched me perfectly on the first try . bonus love ! ! ! my shade in the foundation we picked out was on sale for $ 5.90 ... five dollars and ninety cents usd . needless to say , i bought a whole bucket of them . easy access in fashion show from red parking . right across from under armour .	3975
0	i was not greeted or helped by anyone . when i was walking to the counter to pay for my purchases ilek , ilick ( not sure exactly what her name was ) walked to the back . when she finally came out to ring up my purchases , she said `` is this yours ? '' . i said `` when i can finally pay for them they will be '' . she rolled her eyes . i decided to leave without purchasing anything . i will not ever go in this store again and would have given it 0 stars if i could have .	3975
0	i 've been there 3 times and never have been assisted once . everything is free for all testing so you do n't know who 's touched it before you . they only do exchanges if you 've never used the make up . well , i 'm not about to try something on my face that who knows what touched it before me . every thing i 've purchased there has been awful . colors do n't go on as they look . the make up does n't have good coverage . i guess that 's what u get for cheap make up . never again .	3975
0	i would give this place a 0 if i could . someone recommended this place to me . i went in and there was 4 workers and none of them greeting me . there was another customer in there as well and no one helped her as well . all 4 ladies was talking in a circle . as someone that use to work in retail before- i would highly recommend whatever the conversation was about i would highly recommend leaving the conversation and greet the customer and help them out . i told my boyfriend that was waiting for my outside of the shop that i was being greeted or help , oh you mean the girls in the huddle ? poor service .	3975
1	staff was very fast and friendly . came in for a synthetic oil change when it was close to closing . even though there is a overall low rating i loved my experience and will be returning due to my great experience	3976
1	they were very prompt , knowledgeable , did not try and up sell me on everything , and were very quick in getting me out of there .	3976
0	i sat in the waiting area for 10 minutes , just to be told it would be another 20 minutes before they would finish . that would n't have been a problem but i 'm one of two customers . he has been here 20 minutes . 30 minutes for an oil change . why do you needle nose plires and a flashlight ? it 's just scary to see three people underneath the hood of a car . it 's an oil change ... not rocket surgery !	3976
0	came here hoping for an oil change in a `` jiffy '' . 1 car in the bay and yet i 've been waiting for 45 minutes . maybe it 's time to give up on these guys !	3976
1	first and foremost , this is the nicest and cleanest dental office i have ever been in ! ! i am always very nervous to go to the dentist and dr athari and his staff made me feel very comfortable . i would highly recommend going to this office and only this office . my tooth ache is finally gone , and dr athari gave me my smile back : ) i could not thank affordable dentures mesa enough ! ! ! !	3977
1	i will be having dr. athari do my 7th dental implant . i have had 6 implants done at various locations ... family dentist , oral surgeon , and local dental school over the past 7 years . i was impressed with the clean modern office , friendly professional staff , and the price . dr. athari and his assistant made me feel relaxed and comfortable . they presented and explained to me a couple of treatment plans along with the pros and cons of each ... i chose to have another implant . i am confident that dr. athari and his staff will make my tooth beautiful and functional again .	3977
0	for most cases , this office is well equipped and able to be of great benefit . if you have a difficult case , you may need someone with a greater level of ability . i am unfortunately unable to rate this practice very high , while mine is a delicate and difficult case , i was left to find another professional to help me complete my implant process that was started with this office .	3977
0	very bad service from the two receptionist they have a very bad disposition ! ! ! ! the dentist ( christopher athari , dmd ) was going to extract a tooth with my blood pressure being elevated ! ! ! i do not recommend this location ! ! ! the product is also over priced for the craftsmanship ! ! !	3977
1	this is such a nice little shop . i live down the street and decided to come in when my roommate informed me that he had just stopped in to bring some desserts for a dinner party . he said that the woman who works there will always greet you in french and that everyone is super friendly ! i lived in france for two years and jumped at the chance to enjoy a toronto-french patisserie of sorts . the chocolates were really good , although i felt a bit expensive . nonetheless , it 's a fun place to stop in and treat yourself to some chocolates and sweets .	3978
1	very nice and beautiful café , delicious french products from the best french artisans and a very helpful and professional shopkeeper ! a place to go to enjoy the creamy and hot chocolate angelina and different selections of french biscuits and sweets such as canelés de bordeaux , palets bretons , biscuits roses de reims , calissons d'aix , etc .	3978
1	i recall reading about douce france a while ago , not necessarily for their croissants , but for their chocolates . but within that article i recalled that douce france made croissants too . so while i was running errands in the area , i made the hubby go in and pick up some croissants to try . these croissants were amazing ! light and flakey and full of buttery goodness ! i 'm pretty sure that it partly had to do with them being fresh from the oven as well . i wish that i lived closer so i could eat these croissants whenever i wanted . but i 'm sure my pants love that i live that far away .	3978
0	i 'm so glad to see this place is successful , so i do n't have to feel bad about avoiding it . when they opened up , they were trying so hard . my husband and i had a coffee there and it was an awkward , weird experience . a poor costumed ( french ? ) teenager had to serve us the coffee and bring us a bottle of water . it seemed forced and cringe-inducing . they have excellent products though , and i wish them the best .	3978
0	great friendly service and a wide variety of products but i 've had much better in the city . i was greatly disappointed to learn that the majority of their products are imported and not made in store . i would rather support shops creating from scratch .	3978
0	average quality and high prices . they sale french experience but even that was average . wo n't go back ...	3978
1	great eggs benedict , huge omelettes . service was okay and the owner was very nice . cash only so make sure you have cash handy .	3979
1	good service ... great portions ... .only been here for breakfast ... .bad thing is cash only	3979
0	been a customer years for the fish fry during lent..will not be back , for some reason the breading on the fish changed to cornmeal , blah , not sure how the french frys were made , they were white and tasteless , soup too , salad oh my gosh , prices are low if that 's all you care about . sad to say bye bye , will not be back .	3979
0	said they are open until 3pm , but when we showed up at 2:30 we were turned away . said she shut the kitchen down already . poor business practice . if you want to close at 2:30 , post that on your door . we 've been there a few times before , but when you 're made to feel like you 're not welcome , it does n't make you want to come back .	3979
1	did n't get a picture because we all devoured the wings too fast ! loved all the flavours that i tried . my favourites were the honey sriracha , the sultry ginger , and the garlic parmesan.the service was slow and the bar was dark and dingy , but the wings were definitely worth it !	3980
1	amazing wings . every wing enthusiast should experience this place at least once . no frills beverage menu . they close relatively early for a pub so this is an eat and run type of joint in my opinion . it 's usually noisy , but very friendly . love the dill pickle wings that have actual dill pickle pieces on them and the raspberry chipotle flavour is a close second for me .	3980
1	we have been on the hunt for the best wings in calgary and i think we finally hit the jackpot ! mug shotz is in a small strip mall across from the crossroads farmers market . do n't let the outer facade fool you , great wings are to be had inside this little joint . huge , juicy , crispy , lovely wings in tons of spectacular flavours . louisiana garlic parm , pomegranate chipotle , lemon pepper , dill pickle , pineapple mandarin sweet and sour , greek ... and the list goes on . yuuummmmmy ! . great service and prices are a bonus .	3980
0	good wings very large portion of french fries bar gravy is good . staff not friendly . felt rushed when the waitress came to take our order she was actually tapping her fingers . i do n't think she ever smiled once .	3980
0	went for wing night and it cost more than any other bar on a regular night . i thought that the place was kind of a dive . was n't really that clean .	3980
0	this place is tragic . how can you have such great wings , but literally the worst service in calgary . do n't think that it 's part of the charm , or the servers are just `` being real '' . they are just bad servers with terrible attitudes . not to mention the last time i was there , it appeared as though our server had just finished a wrestling match with her dog prior to coming to work . you could almost see the dog hair flying off of her as she walked around . i hate it when places like this that get a good reputation for something , then appear to get completely complacent .	3980
1	love this place ! very high quality , if not pricey food . the reason for this 5 star review is for their happy hour . the prime burger is one of my favorite burgers in town & during happy hour it 's only $ 7 for this quality bacon burger . you get your choice of cheese ( i get blue ) & a side of fries . if your a burger lover check out one of the best deals in vegas .	3981
1	came here to meet my bff , we had happy hour . everything was great , food , drinks , price , and service ! i love this place and the atmosphere .	3981
1	this is a great steakhouse ! we celebrated my birthday here ! started with the calamari which was really good . did n't expect the twist with the sweet chili sauce . which it is tossed in . ordered the tomahawk ribeye medium plus was perfect ! super moist and tender ! the best lobster mac and cheese ! ! ca n't forget about the blueberry lemon drop ! !	3981
1	i absolutely loved this place . adam was great . so caring about our group.was there with daughter & 3 of her friends for her 25th birthday . the appetizers all down to dessert were good . filet was tasty and everything hot and well prepared . i can hardly wait to return .	3981
1	this experience was amazing . i recently went on a date here and the atmosphere was very lovely . the hostesses were very accommodating as well as our awesome server christian . he helped make the night special and i am glad he got to wait on us ! the food was far more than i expected and i have to say i was indeed impressed . i highly recommend for a great night out !	3981
1	one of my favorite happy hour places in the city . the menu offers a variety of cocktails , wine and appetizers at $ 6 each . the appetizer portions are large enough to share . highly recommend the sweet chile calamari- lightly breaded , lightly drizzled with a sweet chile sauce and red peppers and spicy yellow peppers . the house made burratta is light and creamy - served with crostini and roasted grape tomatoes the roasted mushroom and artichoke flatbread was tender and crispy garnished with some light greens .	3981
1	always great food ! great hh ! ! we have been here in a group and just us two and always had the best service and food ! the hh menu changes which is great too ! love it ! ! !	3981
1	we arrived a little earlier than our reservation time but were immediately seated . our server immediately welcomed us and shared the specials of the day . we had the tomato appetizer which was outstanding . we then had the bone-in rib eye which was great . the flemings potatoes are a must ! they are the best . later , the manager came to our table to ask how everything was going . the best thing ( and there were a lot ! ) about our experience was our server , melissa . she was truly a joy and made our experience ( our wedding anniversary ) memorable . we will return and ask for her .	3981
1	i went here during opening night , and i had the best prime rib you can imagine . i had mine medium rare . it was done perfectly ! i was so delicious i can still taste it in my mouth . i also had a baked potato and a salad , which i enjoyed very much , too . for dessert , i had the creme brulee , which had a nice , thin , crisply layer on top with the gooey middle underneath . heavenly ! the service in this place was also very good . the servers were really enthusiastic since this was the first day , and it really helped make my dining experience a great one ...	3981
1	my first time going to flemings went for happy hour we ordered calamari and two other appetizers i do n't remember the names of them but they were delicious not to mention the nice glass of pinot noir i had . we also ordered a hamburger that they have on special for happy hour was totally awesome made to order ! i want to go back for dinner ; - )	3981
1	all i can say is fabulous ! we had the tomahawk tuesday dinner and it was so good . dave our waiter was awesome ! he recommended a wine which was also wonderful . thank you for a wonderful dinner with great service . a+++	3981
1	my wife and i had happy hour here the other night before going to a movie . really nice decore , service was top notch , food was great . told the better half we have to come for dinner some time .	3981
1	we go to a fine dining steak houses once a week heres how i rate flemings scale 1-10 ( ten being perfect ) food -- -- 9 ambiance-7 service -- 8 selection-8 cleanliness -- 9 great meal steaks were quality i thought the menu selection was ok ... only negative the food server took our bread plate after we had eaten all of it and never offered anymore..i had to ask for but very good experience	3981
1	had an awesome dinner ! reservations were at 8:30 and they seated us early . cristian ionita was a phenomenal waiter ! his recommendations were spot on ! lobster tempura , filet and scallops were cooked perfect . 2 bottles of the coppola cab 2011 and the mac n cheese made for a perfect evening ! thanks cristian . hope to see you soon !	3981
1	we came here for dinner and the food was excellent ! all of our steaks and fish were cooked perfectly ! but the service was very slow ... we waited a little over an hour for our food . since we were celebrating my grandpa 's birthday , they gave him a box of truffles and a $ 25 gift card . food rating= 4.5 service rating=3	3981
1	this is my first time here . the food is decent but a little over priced . service is not too bad . definitely has room for improvement . the best thing was the cheesecake . it is $ 12 for a slice . i might come back and give it another try just for the cheesecake .	3981
1	super yummy food ! ! ! i 've been here a few times for happy hour and jess over in the cocktail lounge was by far the best server we 've had while dining in for happy hour ! !	3981
1	went to celebrate a late valentines dinner and everything was completely up to our expectations ! they had a great prix fixe menu for the special occasion which was a great option for a great price . but even better than that , on sunday 's only , they offer a `` prime rib dinner '' which is amazing ! it 's a salad of your choosing , a 12oz prime rib with three different dipping sauces , a side of your choice , and a dessert of your choice all for under $ 50 ! total steal ! the service was great , our server was extremely knowledgable of the menu items , and the food was delish !	3981
1	flemming hosted a corporate event for us just before christmas . very well done . waitstaff was outstanding ... as good as it gets for sure . tech all worked , plenty of room . service was on time and tidy . super good , will be using flemings again for my events . thanks flemings at town square , outstanding job and making sure my event was a success !	3981
1	a great steak restaurant in town square . there were two of us and we waited about 10 minutes for a table . they called us by our surname once our table was ready . it was a busy night which made it a bit loud . i had the filet mignon rare and it was one of the best i ever ate . all of the food was very good and the service was excellent .	3981
1	enjoyed an outstanding meal here last . server , liz was charming and attentive and her assistant , brian was spot on with serving water , bread and removing dishes timely . our booth in the rear of the restaurant was perfect for our party of four and offered a view of the bustling kitchen . crowded on a monday yet noise level was moderate and enabled conversation . we will be back !	3981
1	food was amazing ! great atmosphere . i 've heard of this restaurant and finally made it and it was as good as i expected .	3981
1	a great place to visit , when you just need to get out of the house . the food is predictably , beyond decent but the real charm is the the sincere wait staff and bartenders . they go out of their way to remember you and what you like , which makes you feel that you 're appreciated as a regular customer they also have an exceptional wine selection and fantastic happy hour definitely worth a stop this is my first review , they 'll get better , but they will always be honest appraisals	3981
1	this is one of our happy hour group 's favorite spots ! we try different places all over the city , but always continue to come back here . the drinks and the food are great . i think i 've tried everything off of the happy hour menu , and it all is delicious ! the carpaccio and mushroom ravioloi are my favs : )	3981
1	first time and pretty impressed ! the best ceaser salad ever great texture and the cold fork is an important detail ! i ordered the chilean seabass which was cooked to perfection , and husband ordered the i forgot what steak , but it was amazing with the cabernet butter ! cream brûlée was exceptional not to sweet not too custards but just right to share with a cappuccino and cinnamon stick	3981
0	this rating is strictly for the waitress name sarah d. i attend a work dinner and decided to have a cocktail before the dinner ... ms sarah came to my table with a very dry attitude and very unwelcoming ... .i 've been here plenty of times and i 've never received service like this before ... coming from a lady whom work in the food and beverage industry this was unexpectable ...	3981
0	great start - got seated quickly- however service was n't the best . paid a high price for king crab that is typically excellent - it was not - very fishy . over $ 300 meal that was not worth it ! ! steaks however were very good	3981
0	used to come here all the time for happy hour and get the manhattan , crab cakes , and filet flatbread . all three have been taken off the menu and replaced by 3 different cheeseburgers . no thanks . wont be back .	3981
0	hilarious ... ... .. these guys are supposed to be `` top-of-the-line steaks ! the prime rib was over cooked and the potato was way under cooked ... .. did n't anyone poke the baked potato with a fork to test for doneness ? the au jus was not that good . i 've had a better prime rib dinner at arizona charlie 's coffee shop on decatur ... .. i wo n't be back to fleming 's . so far the best prime rib i 've had was at tuscany grill in henderson . ... better than lawry's. , actually the best prime rib i have ever had ! ! !	3981
0	food was ok. not worth the $ $ and service was bad not impressed for being a high end restaurant . my glass of water came with floaters when i brought it to the servers attention he laugh and said i 'll be back with a new one ... . did n't even get a sorry .	3981
0	mislead on that night special tomahawk steak . was told special cost $ 44 for two , i confirmed again with my wife and waiter said yes . when check was presented the charge was $ 89 . disappointed not told the truth of actual sale price .	3981
0	the shrimp cocktail sauce has almost no flavor . the salad is excellent as are the house potatoes . the ribeye steak was 1/3 fat and gristle . the creme brulee was large and perfect .	3981
0	had a 6:30 pm reservation . was seated at 7pm . got first beverage order at 7:20 . it 's now 8 ; 15 and meal is finally being brought out . female server is short with me . i do not recommend this high end restaurant on busy days . they should hire more staff	3981
0	while i had n't visited this specific location before , in other cities flemings is where we 've gone to for a special dinner . this was an ok experience , but not special , so i will not be returning . they service was slow , i did n't appreciate being told to use an ipad at the table to select wine , nor did i appreciate seeing the football game in the dining room . food was ok .	3981
0	the food was really good , great apps and good entree selections . however , the service was sub-par . the staff there is not very friendly , seemed a little pretentious . if you are n't dressed in business casual or similar attire they seem to judge you based off your appearance , and the service we received reflected exactly that . we went there to dine after a movie because the restaurant was close to the theater . if we return it will be only for the food , not the service .	3981
0	the staff was absolutely rude and very rushed . i liked the appetizers and wine better than my filet mignon . i ordered medium rare . i got over seared and almost rare in the middle . the creeme bruelee was the saving grace . very disappointed in my first visit here .	3981
0	mislead on that night special tomahawk steak . was told special cost $ 44 for two , i confirmed again with my wife and waiter said yes . when check was presented the charge was $ 89 . disappointed not told the truth of actual sale price .	3981
0	i still do n't understand why people write good reviews for such cheap produce/meats . terrible cheap farm raised salmon and corn fed ( ie chock full of hormones ) beef . low quality all the way .	3981
0	this restaurant has gone way downhill ! the steak was so tough i could n't cut it with a steak knife ! everything was lower quality . we wo n't bother to return . so sad . it used to be so good !	3981
0	watch it people ! . do not eat fish there ! . i got the worst food poisoning in my life at that place . projectile vomiting among other things is really better not to mention . so disappointed that in such quality restaurant they are not more careful handling their food items in a better way , considering the prices .	3981
0	fleming is way too expensive for their dishes . i ordered baked halibut with few pieces of broccoli . the portion was small and it was $ 38 . besides the boiled broccoli , nothing came with it . gf got three small pieces of lamb chop for $ 25 . the ambient and staffs are nice but it is way over price . the food is okay nothing special . i saw many good reviews so i decided to try but disappointed . i would expect a generous portion and a great taste for that price . would not come back or recommend .	3981
0	this place has changed so much & not necessarily for the better . i will never return ! the prices at happy hour , are ridiculously high , for only a burger . if you do n't like beef , do n't go . the staff is not accommodating , nor informative . definitely will go to panevino , ferrarros , bella vita , or anywhere else . management could care less about your experience !	3981
0	un-happy hour historically this has been a great happy hour spot . this seems to have changed . the prices are not special , the offerings are limited and there has been seemingly nothing added to offset these failings . in a city with limitless happy hour options fleming 's finds itself near the bottom of the list . sad .	3981
0	i have eaten here a few times . food is not very good compared to other places in vegas . for a steakhouse , steak has not been very good . wound rec either capital grill , del friscos or marhes baccus .	3981
0	we went last night for my husband 's birthday and i ordered the special which was a steak served oscar style . the meat was too salty to eat , the crab dry and fishy and the asparagus was over cooked . our drinks- mojitos were also very poorly done . we have been to fleming 's in other cities and had wonderful food . this was very disappointing . the service was nice . the music loud and did not match the setting . we will not return .	3981
0	i 've been here three times for happy hour , but sadly the servers have disappointed me each time . even though the food is decent , i always leave with a bad taste in my mouth due to lack of customer service from the servers and host at the front . i just wanted my place setting so i can eat the food , but was totally ignored . not once the server came back to check on me . so wrong !	3981
0	i had the most horrible food poisoning from the salmon at this place just a couple days ago . for paying over $ 40 for salmon this is absolutely unacceptable .	3981
0	tiny portions and they charge u for everything ! i do n't get it , texas de brazil is way better	3981
0	i will never come to this location again . made reservations from 8:15-8:30 and never got set told we had 20 more minutes to eat .. service was very unprofessional . i do n't understand the need for reservations when your still waiting so weird .. i 'm so pissed because we could have made reservations somewhere else .. sucks to really waste time ugh ...	3981
0	another dry petite filet and the crabmeat/oscar style topping on the steak tasted like it had been under the heat lamp for 4 or 5 hours , dry beyond comprehension ! the 2nd star earner was the cheesecake ! ! ! i 'm finding that a to be a pattern at all of these over-hyped , pricey restaurants . smh .	3981
1	i will say this tracks staff and police workforce really has its stuff together ... getting in and out is very fast . the nascars are very loud at this track . small track . what i really liked most about it was before the race you can go down and sign the starting/finish line ... and see the winning car ..i would highly recommend this track	3982
1	yes , it 's hot in phx , but these cars are sizzling at pir . great fun at the indy race .	3982
1	racetrack is good . only disappointment is the trailers for driver souvenirs . the group of trailers for all drivers is gone . now you go look at a few of them and go to another trailer to pay . items are very outrageous in price . need to bring individual trailers back	3982
1	great atmosphere for the race fan . loved watching the indy cars for the firs time in 10 years at this track . be interesting to see what this place would be like if it had stand all the way around this track , with the exception of the hill . that being said , getting out of the parking lot after the event can be a nightmare , however , i 'm not sure any other track is any easier . hopefully the indy car series will be back next year .	3982
1	the raceway atmosphere was fun and lots of good people . it was my first time going , it was great to see the tattoo booth , extreme tattoo and i actually ended up getting my own . you guys would be fools to not bring them back ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	3982
0	big fat 0 stars . 2017 spring race is disappointing at best . no on site store . no propane sales . an ice truck that has no attendants . and best of all no publishing of all the amenities that were taken away to their customers . but let me guess ... you want more money for your tickets ! shame on you ... you do n't deserve 2 races nor the ticket sales .	3982
0	handicap parking the worst ! there is plenty but you have to purchase a special permit to park up close . greedy track to take advantage of people who ca n't walk . no porta-potties in handdicap lot . been moved to souvenior lot quite a walk away . suppose to be hanicap carts but only saw one every now & then but there are plenty of taxi carts for hire-greedy track . elevator-just one for ada-but everybody uses it causing long lines while suites have special elevator barely full . traffic horrible going in unless you get there before 8am . good luck getting out ! been to 15 different tracks & this track alone is the worst accommodating those with special needs .	3982
0	it is too bad this conglomerate took over our beloved pir ! race tickets cost an all time high , unreserved rv camping is gone ! reserved spots cost up to $ 300 ! so much for an inexpensive fun weekend !	3982
0	until they bring back shuttles to the race track i will be staying home . went last year no shuttle , 21/2 hours in gridlock to finally park a mile from the track . dirt parking kept thinking everyone would get valley fever from the dirt that drifted up . walking over a mile with a 5 year-old who needed to use the restroom not fun . will be staying home this year .	3982
0	sitting on the shuttle and it is faster to walk . moved one stop in 15 minutes . do n't take the shuttles . horrible service .	3982
1	this place is great they always seem to have the stuff home de pot does n't . i have had great experiences with the staff , they are very helpful and knowledgable . they have saved me tons on plumbing repairs and yard machinery repairs .	3983
1	this ace hardware store has everything you need with great selections and prices . friendly employees and you are in and out . ace hardware yay ! i 'm a fan .	3983
0	very sad . used to be a fantastic , well stocked store with plenty of knowledgeable help . now , it 's no longer an ace hardware , the shelves are largely empty , no help .	3983
0	horrible customer service wait time is way to long . they need better employees running this place . will take the extra time to go to home depot or lowes .	3983
1	yooo i just ate the other half of my chicken philly from saturday.. omgg it was so bomb ... .. love you guys keep up the great food.. if you havent been to this established walk into the street stop put your foot out and let it get ran over.. cause thats what everyday is going to be like until you have food from there..	3984
1	this place is great . total guilty pleasure food . the sandwiches are amazing and the fries are some of the best i 've had . i love coming here but i got to keep it limited because that has to be the worst possible food to eat regularly , and it 's also pretty pricey , right around $ 13 .	3984
1	good lunch place that is always busy . if you have been to philly , corleone 's is not bad in comparison . i like their italian hoagie , but the cheesesteak is pretty good too . the bread is what makes a great sandwich in philadelphia and they have those amorosa rolls here too . for those philly transplants , they have tastycakes for dessert .	3984
1	the cheese whiz philly cheese is to die for ! seriously , tastiest philly cheese i 've ever had . the only reason for the missing star is that the menu is a bit on the expensive side in my opinion .	3984
1	simply the best for authentic ny style pizza or philly cheesesteak . staff is nice , service is quick , and the food is consistent every time . prices are fair , but they do have coupons and such to lower things a bit . ca n't recommend this place enough . it 's my new favorite joint . surprised there is n't a line out the door for this stuff . if you 're from the north east , you owe it to yourself to stop by .	3984
1	the service is much better now when using the app and calling in orders . most of the time the food is ready or just finishing up . still have a great philly , also try the pizza philly ! ! !	3984
1	even though i thought i had pressed the 'place order ' button on grubhub , they let me re-place my order in the store when i went to go pick it up without charging me . when i got back to my computer , i had put incorrect credit card information in it ! so i placed the order again . thank you guys for understanding that i made a mistake ! even though it was my fault , you took ownership of it , and made it right . talk about customer service ! on the other hand , i have never had a cheesesteak sandwich , and this was the bomb ! i will be back , many , many times !	3984
1	well it 's a little out of the way but it is really good . i 've now eaten here three times and i have to say i love it . i miss the place they had on shea and tatum . i use to go to that location about 2 times a month . but i love cheesesteak so i find myself going at least once a week now . the the service is great the food is so good so you almost ca n't go wrong .	3984
1	moved to the valley from philly . best cheesesteaks . as anyone from philly will tell you , it all comes down to the bread . i am a wiz with ( cheese wiz with fried onions ) . for the full philly experience , get the tastykakes too .	3984
1	tasty philly stake and nice staff . they also have pizza , wings stc . good price good portions . i love the movie rocky on the tv screens . i love corleone 's . they are located in front of savers and next to kodo sushi sake . i think they do delivery . it 's going to be my favorite .	3984
1	every time is just as good if not better than the last . thank god i do n't live closer i would be here every day ! on this visit the bread was extremely fresh and added to the overall awesomeness of corleone 's . keep up the good work ! ! !	3984
1	this place is seriously just freakin amazing . it is as if the cheesesteak gods had looked down upon arizona and has given us this wonderful gift that is corleone 's . prices are not too bad either . the regular size id big enough to share with the fries . if you sign up for the e-mail club you will get constant emails with specials and deals . do yourself a favor and always get the cheese whiz on your sandwich .	3984
1	yummy , yummy in my tummy ! ! got the original cheese steak with american ( i know , how dare i ? ! ) and added lettuce and tomato . oh my gosh - delish ! the steak is cooked perfectly , and the bread - it makes the sandwich . it 's perfect . in fact writing this review , i 'm craving another one . this will be another one of my must haves while in phoenix .	3984
1	best cheesesteak i 've had ! 2 for one on tuesdays after 4:30pm . ca n't bet this place , highly recommended .	3984
1	best cheese pizza for the price , hands down . wings are good too . fast delivery ... what more can you ask for . definitely a go to for inexpensive good food .	3984
1	i 'm from nj and this pizza is top notch ny style . would recommend to anyone . i wish i lived closer to scottsdale ( i 'm in sw valley ) , i would be here all the time !	3984
1	never been here before decided to try it out since i was on the property working . the fries were pretty good move and crunchy . i ordered the original with provolone and mushrooms and peppers ... it was good ... not something i 'd drive out of my way for but if i was in the area i would go back . my order was to go but the restaurant itself was clean and staff was friendly .	3984
1	super busy at lunch but worth the wait . best cheesesteak sandwich you 're gon na find in arizona without a doubt .	3984
1	if you want an authentic philly cheesesteak `` wit wiz '' , this is a great spot to get one . and there are n't very many in the az !	3984
1	they have the best philly chz steak sandwiches & fries ever ! there fries are thebomb.com !	3984
1	i 've had cheesesteak from here twice - once a delivery from door dash and once i stopped in to check it out since my door dash was so yummy . i ca n't even come up with appropriate words for how delicious a cheesesteak can be ! with or without wiz - your call - its delicious ! the fries . . . how can fries stand out above others ? come here , and you 'll find out ! whatever the trick is , keep it up , because its delicious !	3984
0	on a second visit , everything had changed . the steak was the same , but this time the seasoning had been left off and it been cooked too long and was dried out . and the roll was soggy . worst of all , the inside seating was filthy . the tables had not been bussed , the walls were spattered , the windows were cloudy , and the back of our booth was actually sticky . consistency is important in any eatery , particularly one which has such a limited menu . the third time may be the charm , but i 'll never find out - two and you 're through corleones .	3984
0	i tried this place because i had a coupon . it 's tasty but very greasy . i could n't bring myself to eat it with the cheese wiz but it was tasty with mushrooms and peppers . definitely not on the healthier side .	3984
0	i will not order from this corleones again , every time they forget my ranch and did n't even put it on my buffalo chicken sandwich or the other 4 that i ordered but still labeled each sandwich `` ranch '' they charged me for 4 sides of ranch and did n't bring it so when i called to tell them the lady on the phone told me to tell them next time not to charge me , it took an hour and half to get our food and it was soggy and cold when it got to me , disappointed	3984
0	highly disappointed ! i 've ordered from them before and it was pretty good , but their new staff is horrible ! i called to make an order and they put me on hold and hung up . i called two more times to still place my order and they continuously picked up and hung up in me . i know they close at 8 , but my order was called in at 7:15 . i pray that the owner wises up and fires some of his lazy employees . i will never go back/call back because of this experience .	3984
0	i ordered a cheesesteak and cheesesteak fries at 10:44am , and they were delivered at 12:46pm . the cheesesteak was cold and instead of cheesesteak fries , they brought me a side of fries and a dixie cup of cheese . the receipt on the bag says cheese fries when my receipt from grubhub clearly says cheesesteak fries . the one in the biltmore was my first positive cheese steak experience outside of pa , but this location is a total disappointment .	3984
0	i have been a fan of corleone 's in phx for a long time . however , the scottsdale location does not have the same standards . no fries , watered down tea , and dirty tables , i saw 4 staff members and no one was cleaning the dinning area . the bread on my sandwich and the pretzel were both hard . will not be coming back here again .	3984
0	the cheesesteak and the fries are good enough . but something has to be done about the flies . you ca n't put your sandwich down on your plate without a fly landing on it . i gave up trying to finish my food halfway through and just threw it in the trash . completely unacceptable .	3984
0	watched a cockroach walk from the kitchen to the soda fountain . when i notified one of the employees he proceeded to step on it , pick it up with a napkin and go back to preparing food . no washing his hands . no mopping up where the bug was crushed . never going back .	3984
0	fries were pretty good , crispy but the original cheesesteak , i thought was awful . the restaurant is a little dingy , unkept , the doors were grimy as was the carpet etc. , so not a good sign , should have walked away .	3984
0	generally pretty acceptable . really bad experience this time . at least the toppings were cold so i did n't burn my fingers putting them on the pizza .	3984
0	very good steak and cheese sandwiches , especially if toasted . however , the place is always dirty . and it needs a remodeling . a good indication of how good a restaurant is by how clean its bathrooms are . the bathrooms here are as dirty as the kitchen . even the grill for the steak and cheese seems to only been cleaned once a day . where i 'm from , boston , every sub shop i go to cleans the griddle after every steak and cheese is cooked . the one here is caked in grease and remnants of steak . gross .	3984
0	1st time at this location during lunch hour food took 15 to 20 minutes . steak philly was very dry . dirty inside . been to a couple other locations and never been disappointed until now . wo n't be back to this location .	3984
0	the pizza is great but the service sucks my dealership has been ordering from corleone 's for a long time now and the service has just gotten worse and worse usually takes an hour and a half for delivery by the time you get your pizza it 's ice cold whoever 's running this joint should know that their staff is taking down their restaurant	3984
0	the worst sandwich ever . bought a regular cheese steak and was very disappointed with the amount of bread compared to the meat . eat somewhere else if you want a good sandwich .	3984
0	do n't order delivery ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the kids on the phone are rude and disrespectful . i was quoted 25min and no show after an hour ! i cancelled my order , not getting food from them again ... wow , the food showed up about 15 min after my phone call to cancel . when i asked the delivery kid `` when he was sent out '' ? he replied `` about 15 min ago '' ... ... . very disappointing ... lost a loyal customer .	3984
0	honestly ... just not very good . yeah , everything looks good but the food is flavorless . the philly steak is bland and seems almost mass produced . the pizza slices were old and nasty as they had probably been sitting around for hours . actually had a fresh pie the other day at a kids birthday party and the sauce is pasty and the crust us thick and heavy for a supposed ny style . overall , not nearly as good as the reviews say , disappointed and will not return .	3984
0	first time eating here for lunch and i was n't very impressed . i 'll give them the benefit of the doubt and may try them again knowing that i did not have any of their specialties or known for items like a philly sandwich . i had the anti-pasta salad and it was probably the worst i 've ever had . i threw 3/4 of it away . plus the restaurant dining area itself was very dirty there was n't a clean table to be found the ice machine had ice piled up all over dripping everywhere , there were no forks and the floors were gross .	3984
0	we enjoy the food and like that they offer delivery to our area , but they shouldnt ! the restaurant is 10 minutes from our home , but our food takes over 2 hours to show up ... actually i 'm writing this and i have n't even received my order yet . a sub-par cheese steak is not worth all this . at least have the decency to call and apologize or even let us know there would be such a long wait i would have cancelled the order long ago !	3984
0	this place is supposed to sell slice of pizza they have been open for 35 min.no pizza yet i will have go somewhere else my son wo n't eat a chease steak sucks that now i have to go somewhere else the help here is on there phone and act like they do n't care will not be back not to mention my sandwich is all bread and very little steak	3984
0	great food but you probably do n't want to go there for a lunch break they take forever , they messed up my order and took even longer .	3984
0	that 's not a cheese steak . drive a bit further to rinaldi 's for the real thing . -- '' roll '' is partially-cooked machine-made batch of chemicals -- so greasy i had to wipe the table afterward , and i never even took it out of the wrapper ; the grease soaked through the foil wrapper ( how is that possible ) -- mushrooms surely from a can -- onions from i'm-afraid-to-think-about-where-they-might-be-from i 'm certainly one to stick to family tradition ( placing my finger against my nostril as i say it ) , but this one belongs in the gutter . no .	3984
1	nice cocktails ! bartender working at this place is really nice . love that guy . cocktails at this place are n't expensive .	3985
1	fast , friendly service . but , the place was pretty empty ( 40 % full ) on a friday evening . food was good ( i ordered a steak ) and i would return here .	3985
1	nice terrace , good bloody caesars . lobster sandwich was a little disappointing and overpriced but was still light and fresh on hot sunny day . friendly service .	3985
0	too long to be served ! and the say : `` it wo n't take long ... '' . it is also noisy and expensive compared to places with the same type of food . the food is ok . regular	3985
0	i got the rib eye steak and it was pretty good , but fatty . the baked potato was good and the salad was decent . they came out with fresh rolls with the salad , but my brother in law got the hamburger and he was disgusted with the buns . my sister got the top sirloin and it was not too bad either . my wife got the filet and it was just ok . the service was slow at first , but then after we ordered it picked up a bit . not a bad place , but overly overly priced ! ! outback is half the price and double the great taste ! ! i will not come back here .	3985
0	had the tao chicken salad . so disappointing . deep fried and full of sugar , completely uninspiring and overpriced . should have known better , will not return .	3985
1	yummmmm ! ! ! ! big meaty chicken balls , and crispy too : ) ) happy dance ... i would order from them again . and they deliver : )	3986
1	i love the chicen balls here , best in the city , the rest of the menu is pretty good too , but make sure you try the chicken balls	3986
1	my very favourite chinese food in toronto . when you 're looking for your classic canadian/chinese take out - this is where you want to go . fast , fresh , tasty and more than generous portions . excellent noodles of any kind and chicken of any kind . vegetables never overlooked .	3986
1	great chinese food ! we had chicken balls , chicken fried rice and the crispy beef . the chicken balls were huge and very tasty . delivery was very quick up to little italy too..	3986
1	the fried rice alone deserves 5 stars . its certainly not authentic but it is really flavourful . from broccoli beef to ma po tofu everything at bamboo buddha is extremely tasty . and cheap , my god this place is cheap . my favorite part is the service . love the mum & pop who run this place , so cheeky and friendly . a lovely little local that also delivers .	3986
1	the best chicken balls hands down . the amount of food you receive is astonishing . crispy beef , won ton soup and spring rolls are all big hits in our house . we 've never been disappointed .	3986
1	when you move from the suburbs where there 's old school `` chinese and canadian '' places everywhere into just south of chinatown , it 's surprisingly difficult to find just the basic old fashioned chinese you grew up on before you had any idea of culture . bamboo buddha has it all in hand though - it was a great value on good chinese food like i grew up on . it 's our go to now .	3986
1	best chinese food that i 've had in toronto . they deliver fast too ! perfect chicken balls . the fried rice and chop suey is great . portions are large and prices more than reasonable . this will be my new 'go to ' place for chinese . so glad i discovered it .	3986
1	off the charts broccoli in garlic sauce . probably will be featured in some list on the year 2019 's hot new trend : broccoli . i love broccoli . this place delivers , and nails the classic canadian comforts of city chinese delivery .	3986
1	back on top ! bamboo buddha went under new management a few months back and the quality wavered . tonight we tried it again and it was delicious ! it seems they have worked out the kinks and are back to being the best chinese delivery around ! chicken balls and general tao are a+	3986
1	a lot of food , a lot of food at an excellent price . and they deliver , so you do n't even have to go out . my new favorite chinese place !	3986
1	had the chicken balls and the lemon chicken combo as a take-out . they fill up the container with abundance and the food ... yes it is delicious ! ! lots of meats and veggies although i would prefer the fried rice over the chop-suey . not a place you would want to dine in though ! will be back ... .tomorrow	3986
1	the place is neighborhood cornerstone awesome food decently priced and the servers are friendly . if u are in the king west neighborhood and have a hankering for chinese i would strongly suggest trying it .	3986
0	a chinese restaurant that do not have egg rolls . should say alot..they have a steam table where you pay per item..the won ton is good if salty..place really needs a cleaning and a repaint.. not as good as it was .gone downhill since the daughters took it over as they just do n't seem to know what their doing	3986
0	you get what you pay for . good in a pinch . too much msg . the chicken chop suey is great !	3986
0	gotten takeout from this restaurant for a party . we ordered 3 main dishes and they all tasted horrible . the noodles we got smelled funky and rancid when we opened the takeout container . the fried rice was dry like sand . it seemed they have just reheated and packed it up for the customer . the noodles smelled awful . we threw out the entire container . this restaurant has probably the worst chinese food i 've had in my life . definitely will not be coming back again !	3986
0	ordered delivery from here the other night . an hour and a half after placing my order i called the restaurant to see if my food was on the way , they told me the driver just left and will be there in less than 10 minutes . i waited for another 45 minutes . no delivery . i promptly called the restaurant and told them to forget about it . this was on a wednesday evening by the way .	3986
0	great tasting food , but you better put your dinner order in at lunchtime because the delivery at this place takes longer than the second coming of christ . i must be retarded because i keep going back to this place thinking maybe next time they will be quicker , but they continue to keep me waiting .	3986
0	i really hate writing this , particularly after my previous glowing review , but the last two times i 've eaten here has been bad . really bad . gamey chicken , questionable , tough beef , and my poor dear husband becoming sick , sick , sick . i would n't have updated it after one bad fluke experience , but i 'm sensing a trend ...	3986
0	terrible meals . decent wonton soup . we will not be back .	3986
0	we usually love this place for cheap chinese food , but we 're pretty frustrated that they changed their hours and are no longer open on sundays ( seems like this would be a big day for delivery customers ) . worst was that they did n't bother to change hours on their website or yelp , so after spending time looking at the menu we called to get directed to an automated message .	3986
0	the food was mediocre at best . i ordered the crispy beef , general tao chicken and sweet and sour chicken balls . the crispy beef was not crispy at all and very breaded and did not taste much different than the general tao chicken which is also nothing spectacular . the chicken balls were mostly bread with small bits of chicken . definitely will not be returning	3986
0	bad ! bad ! ! bad ! ! ! i read reviews on yelp recommending this but i was beyond disappointed . i ordered the house special spicy . ( beef , pork , chicken and shrimp fried rice ) with breaded shrimp and spring rolls , they all tasted horrible and it was n't cheap . i should have ordered from my regular spot with fast delivery and very good tasty food ( new ho king ) also , they delivered my food late . never ordering from here again . never ever !	3986
0	either they 're cheapening out on the meat or they are vegetarians and are trying to convert you because when you eat fried meat dish , 2/3 of what you 're eating is batter . stick to vegetarian dish if you do n't want to fill up on fried batter . personally , i 'd get a donut instead .	3986
0	at par with food court grade chinese food . do n't expect much and take-out or request delivery . food is savoury , salty or extremely sweet and tangy . it 's a pretty depressing place . i sat there for an hour once and had some pretty depressing thoughts . i blame the setting . i 'm being serious . excellent choice on those days when you 're broke and really do n't want to eat at home .	3986
0	terrible customer service , terrible food . it was not specified that there would be shrimp in the cantonese lo mein and my friend had an allergy . when we asked for a refund or an exchange we were told it was n't possible unless we returned all of our food untouched . we had obviously started eating the rest of our food because the delivery alone took over an hour ( they said 45 minutes ) . the owner was extremely unprofessional , she did not speak english so she had the person who was taking orders translate for us while she screamed in the background . extremely disappointed , will never be ordering from the place again .	3986
1	we broke down on the turnpike . we limped here . they got us right in and fixed the problem ! ! ! very friendly and accommodating . just super service ! ! !	3987
1	rick was an awesome salesman , i felt he was fair , honest , and truely interested in getting me into a vehicle i felt was the best fit for me . i would absolutely refer rick and sunnyside ( on 57 ) to my friends/family . i am incredibly satisfied with my experience as well as my new chevy cruze 1lt !	3987
0	took 4+ hours to purchase a used car i 'd already put a deposit on and did n't even negotiate the price of . the last hour being the hard sell on nonsense dealer mark-up items like wheel/tire coverage and extended vehicle warranties . post sale customer support is poor to very poor and to wrap it all up they 've been leaving me harassing voice-mails about `` documentation the bank needs '' when upon calling the bank myself they have no knowledge of this and even helped me file complaint with their customer service team against the dealership for harassment . stay away from this mess .	3987
0	a complete wast of time . showed me a car . gave me a price . go to make the deal a day later . the car is gone . a total bait & switch	3987
1	i like to keep it simple when i come here . tacos ( chicken or steak ) quesadilla ( chicken or steak ) , and nachos . it has n't failed me so far and the food hits the spot .	3988
1	in a hip neighborhood with restaurants named fire , sasa and zanzibar , senor tequila sounds out of place . but the only thing you 'll hate is the name . the food is great - i 've had the fajitas and several kinds of tacos . i 've been with family ( children 9 & 11 ) and friends and they easily accommodate both . it is well-above-average , savory mexican food . great steak . solid chorizo . accommodating staff . one knock is that some ethnic drinks ( ie . horchata ) are not on the menu every day , which i found odd . but it 's great to have them in the square , despite the chain-restaurant name .	3988
1	from the moment we walked through the door , we were greeted by warm inviting colors and a hostess who complimented my boyfriend and i ... ..maybe a little too friendly , lol . the server was friendly and the salsas were delicious -very yummy/crunchy tortilla chips . the drinks were pretty big and delicious . we were pleasantly surprised and i felt special : )	3988
1	this place was awesome ! you get a lot of food for what you order and it 's better than most mexican restaurants i 've been to .	3988
1	first time here and thanks to carlos who made fresh margaritas and the food all was excellent . this is a must come again spot . food was hot and fresh prices great and drinks tasty . this place is a hit	3988
1	the food was excellent ! ! best mexican in the cleveland area that i have found . we had the pollo crema and chimichangas , they were both excellent !	3988
1	since my last review , i went back twice ! lol ! i just ca n't get enough ! their margaritas are huge ! the mix is pre-made , but i still taste a strong shot of what seemed like josé cuervo . the food was delicious and plentiful as always . i also like the fact that it is family owned , and you are served and catered by hispanics . it makes it way more authentic . once again the churros are violently good . they make you want to slap your mama ( just do n't though : ) ) i love the mexican music , and the comforting and relaxed yet colorful atmosphere . great family oriented place for sure !	3988
1	each time we 've been here it has been a great experience ! the staff have always been friendly and attentive , and the food comes out super quick ! usually we barely have time to make a dent in the chips and salsa that automatically comes out before our food arrives at the table . my usual favorite is the chori pollo , and it 's delicious ! the chicken and some kind of ground sausage come in this delicious creamy-cheesy sauce . woah . the location is also great ! it 's right next door to the shaker square cinemas so whenever we go see a movie we eat here before or after . parking is a bit of a nightmare though .	3988
1	the burrito durango ( chicken , steak and shrimp + grilled peppers , tomato and mushrooms ) hit the spot ! ! i 'll definitely be back !	3988
1	so glad to have this gem in shaker square . the place itself its comfortable , cute , spacious and not a hole in the walk time of place but still comfortingly casual . i had the loca chimichanga topped with queso and stuffed with chicken and shrimp . was delicious as was the side of rice and beans . the chicken was slightly oversalted for my taste but i still really enjoyed me meal . the queso deserves its own shout out . i could that queso with chips every day . i 'm so glad to have this place so close by .	3988
0	menu is misleading . they charge differently for what is listed and then when you ask the manager its your fault . was a regular customer but will never be back . patrons be ware !	3988
0	i ordered chile rellenos . came with grease and brown gravy . also ordered off appetizer menu , came with dry rice and bean sauce masquerading as refried beans . i paid for the mess but could not eat it . i will not be back .	3988
0	really poor quality . the food was some sort of weird ersatz mexican . it was poorly prepared and poorly served . the decor is colorful dreary . not conducive to even having an appetite . the service was sullen . even though it is not expensive , it is not worth the little you pay ! avoid at all costs . given that shaker square is noted for good food , i predict it will not be around for long . it might work better in a less demanding area ?	3988
0	tonight was the first time i have ever walked out of a restaurant because the food was taking so long . after waiting an hour , numerous tables received orders ahead of us who had arrived after we were seated . manager did not show up to talk with us after waiter said he would . we have eaten here many times and enjoyed the food . this might be our last visit . management showed no interest in even talking to us .	3988
0	slowest mexican place i 've ever been . my carnitas enchiladas came and by the time i got to the third one it had 2 tiny pieces of meat maybe the size of a marble . we waited over a hour for pure disappointment	3988
0	dont eat here ! the chicken tacos were bland with no flavor . the margaritas were juice . the service was horrid . we had to ask to pay our bill .	3988
0	i 'm a regular here so i 've been about 20 times . i like the consistency , but the service could really improve . they are very attentive at first , but service quickly drops off . you ca n't get their attention for refills , more chips/salsa , or the check . it 's become very annoying . i 'm considering going somewhere else for mexican ...	3988
0	long wait . i had to seat myself and wave for service . i did n't tip the waitress and she decided to tip herself . i noticed on my bank statement the extra few dollars that was charged . i called several times to speak with management . no answer , phone continued to ring . i decided to post on yelp my experience . be careful with your debit card . the food was okay , i been there several times prior . after this ordeal i will look else where . my visit was on 8/14/18	3988
0	came in on a saturday night and there was no wait at all for a table . that 's as far as the good service went . waited a very long time for both appetizers and meals . our waitress came to our table exactly once . we could n't even order a second round of drinks because no one ever came back to the table to take our order . the food was ok but that 's about the only positive thing i can say . very disappointing .	3988
0	the service was pretty good , and the location is quite convenient . however , i ordered the azteca steak , and i must say that it was the worst mexican food i have ever had . the meat was completely inedible , and was tough and chewy . it certainly was n't a ribeye like it claimed to be , and i shuddered to think of what kind of meat it really was . the refried beans were watery and soupy . the only edible thing on my plate was the onions . my daughter ordered a quesadilla and taco , which were both fine . i never order the azteca beef , and you 'll be fine .	3988
1	best shwarma i have ever had . i have tried to match it since moving out of the area , but ca n't , and have found myself traveling 35 kms out of my way to eat there when a craving hit . tried to convince them to open one in toronto purely for selfish reasons but no dice .	3989
1	winner winner chicken dinner ! this place has a really solid chicken shawarma and what put it over the top was the service given to me ! the owner of the place , matt , greeted me as soon as i entered and was genuinely interested in how i was doing . he made sure he made the shawarma just right to my liking . great food and greater hospitality .	3989
1	love the chicken plate from here . chicken might be warmed in the microwave when he is busy but it still tastes great . love his samosa . ca n't go wrong with most items at this spot .	3989
1	yes the owner was right . best falafel sandwich ive had . little spicy , little cabbage ? ( thats interesting ! ) he also told me after he goes there is no family member to turn over restaurant to . enjoy it now and while you can my toronto friends . i bet its all awesome . had the hummus too . it was decent . ive had better but the falafel sandwich wowed me ! i really liked the service , too !	3989
1	i think this is my new favourite falafel and shawerma restaurant in brampton . great service . delicious food !	3989
0	was a little disappointed ... the food was sitting out on the counter , the cook used microwave to re-warm it up . chicken meal was sent to me cold , not even warm , the beef was hot but all dried out , almost jerky like . think it 's best to keep driving right past it !	3989
0	honestly , i feel bad for writing this review since the owner was soo nice . but this shawarma was not the best i ever had , like the owner promised . it was actually terrible . no garlic , carbage instead of rice ? no flavour etc . i stopped by here since i was hoping to find a good shawarma place in the area , as it seems like toronto and scarborough have the best shawarma . end result ; i 'd rather drive to toronto for shawarma .	3989
0	i tried their chicken shawarma . highly priced , was not freshly cooked and did n't taste like an sharwma at all !	3989
0	this guy started to get to personal about religion . do n't tell me about your religion and question mine fool . completely cold shwarma with brittle and dry pita bread .	3989
0	chicken was dry and kinda cold . food needed more seasoning and salt . $ 12.99 for a plate . not worth it . when we ordered he told me to go pick any drink i like so i thought it was included in the price like a combo . then in the end i was charged for additional it ! ! ! so shady ! wo n't be back	3989
1	great happy hour specials . customer service out-of-this-world . got to try the lobster tomato bisque soup and lobster grilled cheese .	3990
1	shavone is the best server ! cheap drinks and good atmosphere during their happy hour . they have a free pool table as well . great space definitely must visit !	3990
1	if you come to this location , ask for ashley . best server in this place..not to mention the food is amazeballs	3990
1	the food is amazing ! ! try the lobster grilled cheese for $ 5 on happy hour and finish it off with the greek lamb chops . you wo n't be disappointed . i got great suggestions from the girls behind the bar , and was pleasantly surprised to find local beer on tap . three joseph james handles and a tenaya creek , and decent options otherwise ( though my friend would have loved to have a fat tire ) . overall i had a great experience . great service , great food , great atmosphere .	3990
1	i tell ya since this place opened up a few months ago , it 's quickly moving up my list of favorite `` watering holes '' . although , it does get very crowded on a friday/saturday nights , i like my weekend breakfasts or lunches . the staff is super friendly and very cool . nothing beats a cold beer or a shot or two at this place . cheers ! ! ! : - )	3990
1	love the food here ! the salmon with couscous is delicious ! i come here every thursday and belle always serves my friends and me . thank you belle !	3990
1	this place reminds me of cheers ( the t.v . show ) because the bartenders and servers are so friendly and welcoming . i have only been during happy hour which they have one during the day and one late at night . not only is the service great , the food 's amazing as well . i had the sliders and kettle chips . the sliders melt in your mouth . they 're pretty generous with the liquor as well . no watered down drinks here . you definitely get your moneys worth . btw everything on the happy hour menu is $ 5 , and drinks are 1/2 price .	3990
1	the bartender stephanie was amazing , food was good ; we went here for breakfast and will be back just because she was so great . french toast was french toast . egg sandwich was indeed an egg sandwich	3990
1	went here after work a few nights and the graveyard guy was very attentive and nice . i had the burger here and it was delicious . they have great happy hour here on food and drinks . the private rooms with flat screen tv 's are perfect for a football party or even a meeting since they can slide the doors open or completely closed . i hit a royal here , so their machines do pretty well since they are played often .	3990
1	quaint little place on the southwest side of town . after much coercion from my out-of-town friend i ventured my way over , walked through the double doors and found myself greeted by hot friendly bartenders . the decor was muted browns and had a quirky wall piece which consisted of men scaling the walls ( kinda like army men figurines ) . had a good selection of beers on tap and probably a full bar . the food selection was pretty good as well . between the five of us , we shared lobster dip ( a+ ) , meat lovers pizza ( a ) and nachooooos ( a+ ) , which had actual peppers that left my mouth on fire .	3990
1	the food was good . it was my first time hanging out at the bar and i was very impressed . the service was great . julia was awesome . i highly recommend this place	3990
1	came here a few times after my night shift . come in to unwind and relax in the morning . great environment , food and drinks and most importantly have a really good bartender in kris . she 's always awesome ! !	3990
1	this place is great ! friendly staff & great food ! lobster dip is amazing !	3990
1	great location , friendly staff , and really nice inside . highly recommend ! ! they have a pool table , nice lounge seating ... just missing golden tee . : )	3990
1	liz , stephanie and cici make killer drinks ... food from the kitchen is awesome -- great place where `` everybody knows your name '' ! ! happy hour from 4-6pm	3990
1	i feel most bj 's are similar and okay . it 's a chain after all . the service here was good , and they had a good deal for hh . nice ambiance with a pool table for freeee . there 's also a nicer lounge-y area to sit , so i 'm all for it .	3990
1	liz , stephanie and cici make killer drinks ... food from the kitchen is awesome -- great place where `` everybody knows your name '' ! ! happy hour from 4-6pm	3990
1	food is surprisingly good . poke on top of avocado ! ! ! anchor steam , dogfish head , and delirium on tap ? say whhaaa ? ! ? ! ?	3990
1	belle is amazing ! she makes coming here even better than the food itself . a great place to have friends meet up and hang out . the food is great too . give it a try and you surely will be hooked .	3990
1	one of my favorite spots . the service is awesome . always prompt and they lerned my name by the third time i was in and say hi as i enter . great food too .	3990
1	been coming to bjs for years . the staff changes often , but the service is always pretty good , as is the food . as far as bar food goes in vegas , this place is one of the better places . the gyro sliders and potato chips are my fav . i always stop by when i 'm in town .	3990
1	joe is the reason i come here . he 's the graveyard bartender . come by and say hi . and do n't forget to order food . it 's second to none .	3990
1	love to come here for gaming , beer , drinks & food . like seeing familiar server faces . i enjoy their beer selections on tap . chix mac-cheese lusciously delicious . patrons are happily boisterous making for a fun bar environment . restrooms are clean and kept at a cool temp . lots of parking & easy to get to .	3990
1	sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name and they 're always glad you came . amazing service , friendly bartenders , and a great 50 % off happy hour ! liz , tiff , steph , and cece are the best bartenders in town ! ! !	3990
0	crappy place to game , spent $ 300 while watching my chargers win monday night and only got soda comp . then got ripped off from the waitress , put $ 40 in for a $ 32 bill then she took it to the other side of the bar and when we are at the door says we did n't put money in for the check . total crap ! do not waste your money on these rip offs !	3990
0	bar service was great budweiser on tap is way cool the ladies gave taste tries if unsure what you like which you usually do see too much anymore food was n't so great i be weary just saying	3990
0	terrible customer service from the bartender . i would never go back to this 1 after being judged & discriminated against . the cameras clearly showed i was n't with them let alone come there with them . i 'm not discriminating anything except letting everyone know to not go to your bar because of terrible service . i go everywhere in the area & have never had a problem except in this bar . i would never step foot in this place again ! i 've also got many other people that will never go there because of the way i was treated over a simple glass of house red wine & prime rib .	3990
0	nothing about this bar excites me . they had a nice b.j lounge over by the mgm grand but the lame dotty 's brought out the building . i wish the bar would do somethimg unique to get the blood boiling for a change . karoke , trivia night , bingo or something . shit , adding a touch tunes machine would help enormously . what happened to the female bartender 's skimpy outfits ? come on man . excite me ! ! ! ! !	3990
0	very very very very boring , where are the people ? we heard this place was fun , some old guy alone at a table and two people at the bar , seriously !	3990
0	i wo n't be coming back here for a long time . the bartender that served me and my friends was incredibly rude ! he charged us full price for drinks during happy hour and when we asked him about it , he gave a sarcastic answer along with an eye roll . he did n't even bother to apologize or anything ! horrible !	3990
0	i recently visited las vegas bj 's hoping to share a good time with friends . unfortunately , our experience was less than great . our mojitos tasted more like lemonade . the chicken was pink inside . the pasta was undercooked and they had no mashed potatoes as offered in the menu . the broccoli was dry , dehydrated , chewy . our overall experience was very unpleasant . worst of all , the manager did not take the time to speak with us . i would definitely not recommended this restaurant .	3990
0	used to love this local bar . unfortunately the food & service went downhill . i 'm very disappointed & will not be returning .	3990
0	food staff was good . bartenders were more attentive 2 regular slot players , which is the way of the `` biz '' in this town . with that being said , i 've been in this town for 38 yrs and have seen my share of places close down cuz they ca n't balance the gambling vs the neighborhood food/drinks crowd . this is the 3rd time i 've tried out this spot w/ the same feeling so i 'm done . can't/wo n't recommend this location to anyone .	3990
0	i wo n't go here anymore . the food is good but i am so disappointed in the turnover of employees . since i have been going there all of my favorite bartenders have been let go , most recently , as i found out today , stephanie . that was the last straw for me . she was the reason i kept going back . the place is always dead and she made it a pleasant place to visit . i feel like this bar has potentional but whoever is in charge of running the place does n't seem to know what they are doing . so i wo n't be dumping my money in thier machines anymore .	3990
0	horrible service ! ! ! have never been to a bar where the bartenders poured out the remains of my drink without giving me another or asking me if i wanted another . once you actually get a drink , plan for there to be no alcohol in it . their excuse was it was change over time , although as i 'm writing this , the one bartender has been socializing with a patron for more than 10 minutes and the other is wiping down the counters with me still drink less . such a disappointment ...	3990
0	went in before happy hour today . my drinks were n't entered in computer until after happy hour . he made me pay full price when i ordered before happy hour was over and he kept arguing with me that i placed it after when i had clearly placed my order with along with my friends . their drink were the correct price and before happy hour . maybe he 's just homophobic ? who knows . never goin there again .	3990
0	lame service . i got up with an empty ass beer glass , and stood there . all the staff had their back to me save one , that saw me , but she was `` off '' . i sat down again , still nobody comes over . i get up again , they at least took my empty glass i brought to the bar away . do n't waste your time folks . these girls got alot to learn about service . basically i was able to write this review in the time it took me to get a f****** drink	3990
0	beautiful decor , convenient location , but this place is never busy except in the wee hours of the morning when nightshift people get off work . i understand firing employees for stealing or being unreliable . but this place burns through their best bartenders and i always end up not coming back for a while ... they 've had a few good diplomats over the years but then they seem to get fired for mysterious political reasons . food is great too but skip going to bj 's and stop at tommy rockers . no wonder bj 's has closed so many locations .	3990
0	will not be back ! my wife and i were there today played $ 200 had 2 beers and 2 mixed drinks . bartender gave us a tab for 2 of our drinks . i know it 's not her fault but management clearly has no concept of how a bar should be run ! now i know why saturday afternoon there 's 1 customer at the bar !	3990
0	this shithole ! poor staff , the women that own this place should be ashamed of themselves . it 's the worst i 've seen in my years . i used to love this bar . i live right down the street . dump $ 200-300 in the machines no comp for additional jagerbomb , understandable but this is n't the ghetto . this place is on last legs . owners should consider pot industry and stop fucking locals that will and do patronize over . once again this is not about staff . the girls do the best they can with what these shitty owners give them , id hire them all in a heartbeat	3990
0	disaster ! no wonder the place is always empty . we played over $ 100 in 40 minutes and still got charged for our drinks . the bartender said they had some crazy `` coin in '' policy . well , you wo n't see a dollar from me ever again . it takes forever to even get a drink even when there was only one other customer . food was mediocre at best . we will not be back .	3990
0	decided to stop by here ( first and last time ) as its right down the road from my house . i stayed for about 45 min , had 2 drinks , played max bet quarters the entire time and receive my bill at the end lol ? apparently dumping a little under 80 in the machines isnt worthy of at least one drink ... . i mean really ? ? ? i guess my drunken sixth sense has always been correct ( usually is duh ) in steering me away from this dump even though its so close to my house . never again . `` one time is fine with me.. '' -drake	3990
0	i stopped in at approximately 4:30am and put money in a slot machine ( video poker ) . i was fortunate enough to win a little bit so i decided to leave after playing about 30 minutes . as i was leaving , the female bartender told me that i had to pay for my drink . are you kidding me ? first time i ever cashed out in that toilet and they want to charge me $ 6 for a drink . will never go back !	3990
0	do n't go in if u r a gambler . they have some odd rules regarding drinking/gambling . you only get one well bev or beer per $ 40 . if you somehow win then they will give you a bill for what you drank . it is the worst gaming bar i have been to . several of my gaming friends say the same thing . go to any other bar in vegas rather than this place if you expect to be treated well as a gambler	3990
0	food is decent , service is ok . i used to come here every week but this place has gone downhill quick . what made me rate this place from 3 stars to 1 is the fact the sign you up for their loyalty program but you can not use your points for anything . they are very cheap here , i suggest going somewhere else .	3990
0	always disappointing . food is good , service is bad . if you game you only get 1 beer per $ 20 in ... if you win , you have to pay for your additional drinks . last visit i wanted to eat but could n't get them to take my order . girls are cute but useless .	3990
0	never been to a bar that starts a tab when you 're in $ 100 . 3 drinks in vegas . never going back there again , and i live down the steer . never going again	3990
0	i went there to eat breakfast and received old meat that was n't right . i mentioned it to the waitress and she said we had that happen to another customer earlier . like the meat had to be spoiled or rotten meat that was cooked . the waitress had a bad attitude not welcoming at all . they said they will discount me and i 'm like a why was anybody being served food that the customer before me complained about . i 'm not the person to right reviews but this was just complete all around horrible service .	3990
1	this review is based on their location at the union station market . the jerk chicken sandwich was delicious with great flavour . the coleslaw inside complimented the chicken perfectly . only negative was about the service style . there was a long line-up of customers who 'd paid and were waiting for their food . instead of handing out food as it got ready the staff would compile about a dozen sandwiches first and then give them out in random order . chalking this up to being unique to the union station location .	3991
1	best bbq chicken sandwich ! also yummy jerk wings ! ! ! ! ! they also have vegan options which is great .	3991
1	so glad this place exists ! its a cozy spot , but the culture and vibes are amazing . they have this new bartender and he 's such a good time ! ! im rating this a 5 star because of it 's service that i recently received , and the food is also great - it 's hard to find a bar with such cultured fooods especially on ossington !	3991
0	ordered the jerk wings . got 7 wings for $ 14.99 total b.s . seems like they give uber eats orders a larger portion .	3991
0	the chicken is tasty . unbelievable rip-off through foodora . i have been to the fort york location , and expected a much better portion for $ 14.50 . this is the small , sold at the price of a large . we added festivals for 7 dollars , and received three tiny nuggets ! never again !	3991
0	tried to eat here but unfortunately the chicken made me sick for 3 days , vomiting and explosive back door . it 's great if you like food poisoning , otherwise perhaps avoiding it would work better . also , they play awful music that they think is cool .	3991
1	best chinese resto . highly recommended . 5 stars . let us support this business . best in the west valley . trust me you wont gi wrong coming to this place	3992
1	we heard that they were preparing pho ... ..it was delicious ! the crispy vietnamese egg rolls were a nice compliment !	3992
1	love this restaurant ! service is always great , food is always top notch . we often order for take out , and the food is always ready on time and pipping hot .	3992
1	so far the only place that i 've tried that was good . been searching for a year since i moved for a good place . overall happy . i got the garlic chicken and mongolian sizzling chicken . delicious . plus it 's quiet and the staff are great .	3992
1	around 8-10 bucks an entree . good portions , you 'll get fully easily . complimentary chips upon arrival and unlimited rice : )	3992
1	really good food here . cute atmosphere as well . mongolian beef is perfect . the hot and sour soup is also pretty good ! wish there were combos that included soups though .	3992
1	this was absolutely fabulous ! ! everything was delicious ! we ordered shrimp and snow peas , egg foo and sweet and sour chicken . their were three of us and shared the plates and had food to take home . the minute you walk in the door you know you have found somewhere special . we will be back ! !	3992
1	we always come to this restaurant . great food and superb service . if you like having chinese food , you need to try this place . this place is so clean and not over-staffed .	3992
1	i was a little confused by a few of the negative reviews , my family really enjoyed this place . the crab rangoons and the peanut dressing for the salad were fantastic ! the restaurant is tucked in a strip mall , it 's clean and nicely decorated . the service was great too ! we will be back , just wish we lived closer .	3992
0	we have been here before and it was good . today we watched the cook cough and hack all over our food while cooking . it is an open kitchen so you can watch them cook . no attempt to turn away from the food or cover his mouth . it was really bad . we left and cancelled the food . i felt really bad about canceling our order but there was no way we were going to eat it . the waitress and very nice . beware of the cook	3992
0	i used to tell people to come here if they wanted decent chinese on the wear side . last weekend ordered some takeout for my band and i and it was terrible . mongolian beef was a joke , the kung pao chicken was bland and the potstickers were frozen . what happened you used to have good potstickers . these were frozen , its easy to spot when the edges of the dumpling turn super dry and rubbery . never again !	3992
0	not fresh ; typical canned flavor fond in american chinese restaurants . not real chinese foid . on.par with panda express only i did n't spit it out ! good was hot - that 's why it got a star .	3992
0	first time here and we went here for my sons graduation today i ordered the kung pow chicken , totally tasteless and bland i do n't even think they used salt and pepper plus they stuck jalapeños inside , which i never ever had before and thought it was green peppers ! ! surprise ! ! !	3992
0	we ordered to go . shrimp good , salad great , meat in orange beef was disgusting . beef skewers disgusting . i 'm not really sure it was beef . not trying to be gross but i have to be honest , they are not using quality products . never again .	3992
0	we had to stop eating here . we believe they allowed the locals to dumb them down . most of the locals would consider $ 25 a lot to spend on dinner . 'nuff said .	3992
0	bland and not memorable we had some sort is tower thing but i do n't even remember anything else that 's not a good sign	3992
0	although their website says their open at 10am on sunday , in reality they are not . instead they open at 11am . when advised of their website 's error , the staff did n't seem overly concerned , and i was told that they would `` look into it '' . disappointed as this was my last dining experience in phoenix before flying out .	3992
0	it 's taken me several days to post my review because i thought my opinion would change . must be the change in ownership . in the past , the staff was very prompt and courteous whenever i visited this place during lunch . today , i ca n't recognize this place . the open kitchen was now filled with someone barking out orders . the staff was disorganized and completely forgot my order . when my food arrived , it tasted more bland than hospital food . sad to say i need to find a new place to give my business not only for myself but for the meals i provide my business customers .	3992
1	chris helped me today . found all the parts i needed fast with the best deals . go see him !	3993
1	keffer vw was incredibly helpful without being pushy . kristen and calvin did a great job getting my husband and i into our new beetle . they are always eager to answer questions . nice certified pre-owned inventory ! thanks again keffer !	3993
1	after a terrible first time , i have come back for an oil change and i am thoroughly impressed . will be back .	3993
1	a 2015 gti autobahn was our third vw purchase in a year and a half . each transaction was easy and pleasant , but this was by far the best . jerry franklin , mark marre , sean bartol and the entire keffer team are first class .	3993
1	after a terrible first time , i have come back for an oil change and i am thoroughly impressed . will be back .	3993
1	great experience purchasing a 2017 golf sportwagen all track . salesmen was very easy to work with and didnt hound me on the lot until i was ready to speak to someone . was extremely impressed with the selection of cars , and the value for my trade in . highly recommend vw for your next purchase and keffer volkswagen as your preferred dealer ! be sure to ask for rick !	3993
1	just purchased new 2013 gti from keffer 's steve mcgugan . steve was very knowledgable of the car , easy to deal with , no bs , overall very pleasant buying experience . have bought well over 30 new autos in past 40 years and this experience from walking in to sales to finance no surprises and one of the best .	3993
1	brian wiles met me on a cold and rainy day and went above and beyond to help me find the right passat . despite the weather , he showed me many different models until i decided on the one i went with . between himself and sean , the f & i guy , they both made my experience second to none . i was very impressed with the entire vw experience but most of all the professionalism of the staff . at no point did i feel uncomfortable or pressured . i 'd recommend them to anyone .	3993
1	great service , got an awesome deal from darryl on a new jetta . lowered our payments and got us from a 2 door to a four door .	3993
0	beware ! ! ! ! these guys are rip off artists . bait and switch all the way . please please be careful .	3993
0	sales man was so rude ! ! the rudest i 've ever met , told me that i was dumb and stupid . so rude .	3993
0	made an appointment for an oil change and inspection at 7:30 . i was told it would take an hour and 15 mins which is way too long but whatever . after 2.5 hours my car was finally ready and there was no apology offered until i asked why it took so long . they blamed it on other people showing up late for their appointments rather than offering a sincere apology or valid excuse . i then had to search the lot to find my car . it was not where they told me it would be . not a fan of my vw passat and really not a fan of their service department .	3993
0	we went in there looking for a car for our son ! the salesman was personsaliable enough & we test drove the care however he had kept us waiting too damn long ! ! ! therefore he had lost a sale ! ! ! we had gone to another dealership found the at another dealership for lesser price same car ! to say the least keffer stinks ! ! !	3993
0	be careful of dishonest or deceitful diagnostic policy ! i had my vw towed there and was told the diagnostic charge would be credited back if i had repairs made . they did n't find any thing for what i brought it in for but gave me a list of other repairs needed . i wanted some of the repairs made but they would not take off the diagnostic fee . $ 125 and i repairs ! do n't trust them .	3993
0	the one star is because the sales consultant ( marlon ) was really nice/professional/straightforward when we came and drove originally when we came back is when the shenanigans began with the sales manager wasting two entire days of negotiations that turned into them letting me know they would rather sell me a new car . be straightforward and do n't waste people 's time and we might have bought a new car . instead the picture is where i ended up happily . go to subaru of south blvd . no games or bullshit simply selling cars .	3993
0	this dealership has the worst time management . both times we went there they took more than double the time they estimated . even with appointment . they already said 3-4 hours . how can it take all day if you have an appointment . just frustrating .	3993
0	is starting to think the reviews on here are fictional.. i would not have given them any stars as they are unprofessional..disrespectful..not customer oriented and have no loyalty to their loyal customers.. service up charges woman 20 % ..will quote the same repair $ 100-200 more than another volkswagen dealerships for same repairs.. will not honor warranty work and adds astronomical fees such as document fees..what documents are you really storing in the service department . jim keffer is this really the reputation you want following you . oh and if your black and a woman forget about.. a toddler would get better treatment than you	3993
0	this place is horrible shopping for used bmw , drove 1.5 hrs because avertised price was reasonable . shocked when they came back with a price that was $ 2000 more than advertised unbelievable they wanted to charge us $ 1209 more for reconditioning fees and $ 700 for doc fees avoid this place they 're con artists	3993
1	best subway ever ! ! ! ! ! rae is the best employee there is ! ! ! ! ! really impressed by the sandwich too ! ! ! great great subway ! !	3994
1	we came in and tried the new footlong pastrami sandwich . it is awesome and the service was outstanding . give him a try the prices are also very good	3994
0	horribly slow during lunch hour ! they need to train their employee 's to pick up the pace	3994
0	i have bought a cheese beef sandwich this afternoon about 5 pm . hey i cheese was melted on the beef girl wrapped the sandwich up and set it on the counter . another customer came in and before i could get cash out she 's already start making sandwiches for the other person . i finally had to ask her to cash me out and the lady getting the sandwiches apologize and the girl said oh that 's right that 's what i 'm supposed to do . yeah the lady was not having any hot sandwiches but my beef and cheese sandwich set cooling off . terrible service !	3994
1	my friend terri recomended this place for breakfast . the coffee was great ! biscuits and gravy yum . but their country potatoes are the star of that restaurant ! it a new mom and pop place so let 's get out and support them !	3995
1	what a joyful place ! bright , friendly staff , pleasant atmosphere , local art adorn the walls and good home cooking . had breakfast there this morning , ordered pancakes and eggs , we did n't want the meat so they knocked $ 2 off ! will go again and definitely recommend it . it 's so nice to have a cafe in our neighborhood that is n't a chain but the passion of an individual . susan	3995
1	great restaurant . my wife and i tried this place because it was in walking distance . everything we ordered was tasty and you can tell it 's all homecooked and not just from frozen . the restaurant was also very clean and the staff is friendly . overall just a pleasant dinning experience .	3995
1	this place is quant and cozy . the service was fantastic , husband and wife team . super friendly and food was good . biscuits and gravy where delish , and love they made me iced coffee . the price was really great . they have daily specials . i appreciate a mom and pop place , they work hard to build a customer base . this place is well on its way , only opened in nov. 2015 . so give them a try .	3995
0	my husband and i have quite a few tattoos , so we expect to be treated a little differently sometimes . but when we walked into this place , no one wanted to serve us , and when someone finally did , she acted very much like we were not welcome . after a bit , no one came to refill my coffee so my husband asked if i could get some more and the waitress scoffed at him like it would be an inconvenience for her to do so . that was the final straw . i left $ 20 on the table to pay for our order and we left . ridiculous .	3995
0	horrible service ... . not a friendly place at all if you do n't fit their theme ... would not recommend to people who live in the immediate area ... other places with better food and no judgmental attitudes ... .	3995
0	my sister and her friend were in town from denver and i wanted to try this place , after reading good reviews . we went in for lunch . my sister ordered some chicken tenders . i ordered a burger , and tho other woman ordered something that i do n't remember . the chicken tenders were from frozen , i think , and my sister disliked them . her salad was not fresh either . my burger was just okay . i was very disappointed to take my sister here . the server was nice , and he knew we were not very happy , and he discounted the meal . i will not be going there again . it was below average .	3995
0	i will start off with the fact that we were on a time limit , we had just under an hour to eat so we did n't have time to sit around and wait . the waitress was awkward and very uno servant and it took us 45 minutes to get out food . a large party got their food before we did which was frustrating . the portions were small , but was expected for the price . but the food did taste good at least , that 's why i give it 2 stars .	3995
1	whenever i 'm in town , i go to this place pretty much every night ( because it 's across from the pointe hilton ) . i do n't know of anywhere in my area that has the trivia/touch screen games anymore . i sit here and play poker online and bluff my way to beating everybody 's ass most of the time . great fun !	3996
1	if 50 stars was an option whitney the bartender working today would get it . her amazing service and honest care was something that is extremely rare to find nowadays . hands down an amazing woman and lucky business to have her ! ! !	3996
1	love this place for karaoke . went with a group to sing this weekend and had an amazing time ! food & service are top notch .	3996
1	the food is good and the tvs are everywhere , but the best part is the staff . dan and the team took great care of us . my nephew is allergic to dairy and they bent over backwards to make sure he was safe and we all were well fed .	3996
1	great service- friendly staff . we went twice on our trip to az and the first time we had the reuben and the gallaburger which were excellent ! try the waffle fries . second time around the nachos were n't the greatest . other than that i would go back .	3996
1	amy , the hostess rocks - greeted me with a smile the sec i entered , very polite & offered great beer & food suggestions . if you come here on any weekday - ask for the special -today its tuesday thus , shrimp taco - they tasted great & fresh as if they came right out of the sea of cortez !	3996
1	great boneless wings	3996
1	great drink specials , the server was awesome , quality atmosphere . not all that busy but that made it easier to converse with our friends . good place to meet up with friends and have a relaxing evening .	3996
1	nice place . good food , beer , service , sports on tv and prices . not too bad . what else can you ask for ?	3996
1	being new to town , i 've driven by this bar n grill many times . i 've stopped by recently and thought the food , drinks , service , and prices were great . i ca n't give it 5 yet as i was n't blown away but as i stop by more often i 'll consider updating the review . additionally , i have n't dropped by just to `` have a beer '' but will be sure to update with some feedback on that as well . i will say that their beer selection is quite good though . no complaints whatsoever !	3996
1	great place to watch games and grub . staff are professional and provide great service . they do n't tolerate amateurs , drunks who like to bring their own taco bell into the bar and loud mouths . makes it a great environment for the real customers who appreciate a drama free good time .	3996
1	very casual spot to grab a few drinks and some pretty decent bar food . if you like to sit up at the bar and play those touch screen games , this is a good place to do it . just be forewarned that they get a lot harder once you 've had a few cocktails .	3996
1	great sports bar / restaurant . very clean . tv 's for every seat in the house . bartender was great and attentive . food was delicious and plentiful . off track betting , pool tables , dart boards . good patio for smoking , with tv 's as well . clean bathroom , with tv 's as well . perfect for cardinal fans . i would recommend to anyone .	3996
1	ok , you must try their chocolate porter , its a local beer and delish ! their bar food is really good and yes , even the salmon dinner is sooooo good ! the beers are ice cold , right carbonation and ever flowing the service we received was top notch and when im back in phoenix , ill be paying them another visit !	3996
1	oh my gosh ! i have never loved chicken wings as much as i do these at gallagher 's . next time i travel to phoenix this will definitely be a stop for me . the staff seemed really friendly and there were several locals there too . i got ready to leave and a monsoon storm came so i came back inside and decided to eat dinner . yummm ! ! ! i wish i could find somewhere in northern california that made chicken wings as great as these were i just ca n't stop saying enough about how much i enjoyed the boneless chicken wings and you get to pick your own sauce .	3996
1	my favorite part about coming to gallagher 's is my favorite bartender , cristin `` the pirate '' bartender . not only does she greet every customer as they enter , she truly cares about her customer 's experience while in her care . she goes out of her way to ensure that people 's needs are met , their orders are timely and delicious , and she will do whatever she can to ensure that her guests are happy . she is the bomb dot com ! ! !	3996
1	i pass by this place every day on my way back to hotel so decided to check it out early this week . food is alright , but the staffs are friendly and awesome , not to mention most of them are hot ! it 's good to have a few drinks and walk back to the hotel .	3996
1	i live next door and come here often . they have a great happy hour featuring $ 3.75 20 ounce domestic beers and discounted apps . the boneless wings are my go to during happy hour and i love their honey hot sauce . i go for trivia on thursday nights which they extend happy hour prices for domestic beers . the rest of the menu is all good , i 've never been disappointed . i love their french dip and the burgers . i hear they 're under new management and i 've already noticed things improving . i 'm going to keep coming here way too much as long as i live in the neighborhood .	3996
1	all u can eat fish n chips , cold beer , awesome customer service and walking distance from squaw peak resort ... ca n't go wrong	3996
1	love this place . it 's always comfortable and service is great . food was awesome and coldest beers in town .	3996
1	fun place , yummy food and a great place to watch football . very attentive wait staff .	3996
1	good place to hang out and finish up some work . relaxed atmosphere with lots of locals mixed in with travelers . would recommend 100 %	3996
0	we sat down and waited forever , no one even addressed us . it was not busy so there 's no reason for them to have such horrible service . do n't go here !	3996
0	i read all of the reviews and while in phoenix decided to go to this establishment . was really excited by the menu ... ... ... the service was horrible ... ..food took forever ! will not return .	3996
0	what a joke this place is . the staff is arrogant and condescending , if you are not a regular good luck . they should be ashamed of the way they way they treat people . the best advice i can give is for a fun night out go anywhere but here ! the food is horrible , the tap beer is beyond stale and the bartenders are angry at the world ... . avoid this place at all costs !	3996
0	the service was poor , the food was less than decent . had to ask for a drink 3 times and after the third time the waitress was snippy and said the bartender was feisty . the specialty fish i ordered fried was way overcooked and never was it offered to get seconds . was just very disappointed . we arrived on a friday night after a high school football game a group of 6 and there were n't very many other people in there so we thought the service could have been a little more prompt .	3996
0	the food is poorly prepared , over cooked and hard fried . service was shameful . i was by myself and practically ignored . go somewhere else . the prices are n't that great . there are plenty of better establishments for drinks and appetizers .	3996
0	food is horrendous , but the worst part is the service is trash . the manager with the beard is a robot with no knowledge in how to treat customers . lady bartender is always giving beading eyes . the place is run by novices .	3996
0	sad , outdated decor . regulars ( ? ) hanging out using the `` f '' word a lot . was told the kitchen was closed , then they decided it was open . should have kept it closed . i ordered nachos . they were terrible . some stale chips and a miserly amount of cheese , $ 10 . seriously .	3996
0	we were in town for a convention nearby . the bartender was very inattentive and rude . when we were at the bar the bartender and her manager were talking badly about our group . they were trash talking our cause and one reassured the other that `` they are leaving tomorrow , so we only have to put up with them for a little longer '' . will not return .	3996
0	i came here with my wife cellibrating our anniversary on st patrick 's day and was very disappointed . they were not that busy . all drink were served in a plastic cup and fish and chips took 50 minute to come and and it was cold when it got there . the manager ordered us new meals but ... .. what a bummer and kind a spoiling the evening . never again .	3996
0	terrible service . slow food delivery . no doubt , their thinking is slow food and you drink more which is higher margin . place where the local alcoholics drop in to get their fix . expensive for what you get . it 's not dirty and there a lot of people eating and drinking . you will hear a lot of exchanges between staff and patrons that are merely shallow attempts to establish familiarity . they do n't know each other .	3996
0	the only good thing about this place ( other than it is walking distance to a resort that i frequent ) are the waitresses and bartenders , who are cute and friendly . otherwise the place pretty much sux . the food is mediocre at best . the vibe is lame . the worst part is that they do karaoke there alot , and it is loud and obnoxious . this place has pretty much run it 's course . time for it to close and re-open as something else . hopefully under new ownership . and minus the karaoke .	3996
0	good selection of beer but the service sucks plan accordingly and add an additional hour to get you food and anybody to come and take your order and bring your bill . this has happened on more than one occasion . do n't care to ever come back .	3996
0	one of the worst meals i have ever had ! my husband , son and i did n't eat more than one bite of our meals ! the service was awful ! huge waste of money !	3996
0	came here with a party of 12 on a friday night . place was not busy . we were seated quickly but then the waiting began . our waiter worked hard , but should have had more help . the kitchen was out of several items , including fish and baked potatoes . we were told they 'd adjust the bill , but that did n't happen . food was just ok . i 'd skip this place .	3996
0	normally i love this place but today management failed . they were understaffed to a criminal degree which is bad for employees and patrons . its not like the derby came as a surprise . never coming back for a special event here . i did go to the 7th st and union hills location for preakness and had a much better experience . get your act together on 16th st and i could be persuaded to try again .	3996
0	best waste of a saturday night , the fact that the place was empty should have really sent the red flags flying ! meal made it to the table before the appetizer , soup and salad and yet the nonchalant attitude regarding the issue really baffled me ( this is not a new place of business ) anyway , do n't waste your time and money here ! it is too bad that there are no zero stars options .	3996
0	had a really bad experience . went with a group of 5 for dinner , service was poor , the food was n't very good either . we spent most of our time waiting . our appetizer was the last thing brought out , no apology , no discount , no customer service .	3996
0	we made a mistake going there . my wife read lousy reviews but went anyway since close to hotel and a place to watch basketball . the food was not good and wife felt sick next day . very bland boneless wings that were small pieces and no flavor . the pizza was acceptable . the lettuce was terrible . limp is one way to describe it . the baked potato was served on a bed of ? we were not sure what it was . service was fine . beer cold . it was odd that twice they came to our table trying to deliver someone else 's food . we did watch basketball and had many televisions .	3996
0	took 45 minutes to get our food , and my chicken cheese crisp was cold . so were my friends ' sloppy nachos and quesadilla . we ate it anyways , because we did n't want to send it back and wait another 45 minutes . three other people ordered the cobb salad off the daily special .. the sizes and cost of the salads were all different . ? ? ? there are no prices listed on the daily specials ... do n't be fooled they are 5 , if you look closely , that is the time they start not $ 5 . i was hoping for more , as its very close to my home . : (	3996
0	beer selection was good and waiter was nice enough , but the food was terrible . nacho cheese was wiz and buffalo chicken tenders were undercooked . not sure why , as it took forever for meal to arrive . good place for a beer , skip the food .	3996
0	food and service was never 5 stars , but food has really gone downhill . new and much shorter menu . still a decent place to get a burger and a quick beer , but that 's about it .	3996
0	very disappointed in the service on game day ! we were all excited to see our cardinals play and eat breakfast - the server took awhile before he acknowledged us after we sat down and we asked for a breakfast menu and he said he 'd have to `` find '' one . he took orders from the folks next to us and brought us the drinks they ordered- no further explanation of the breakfast menus - just totally ignored us . we left and went to aunt chilada 's down the street !	3996
1	food is awesome ! been eating there since 2000 . pizza is good but i love the sandwiches . chill vibe	3997
1	i 've driven by the place so many times always wanting to try it and i 'm glad i did . i ordered two large pizzas one pepperoni and the other half chicken and half cheese , as well as 6 piece bone in honey bbq wins . the store was very spacious and clean . the employees were all friendly . as for the food it was delicious . it all tasted fresh and real . the wings were definitely award wining wings . this is my pizza place for now on . in all honesty try this place it was amazing .	3997
1	best local pizza place in this area ! yummy food and fast service . their sandwiches are excellent too . we usually get ours to go and it is always cooked right . real cheese and fresh ingredients . their wings are quite yummy to and so are the sandwiches ! yummy ! ! !	3997
1	easy place to find , we had a living social deal and went to use it last night . clean inside , do n't let the depressing-looking strip mall setting deter you , because the food is great . we ordered the sub sandwiches to go , a turkey and a blt and they were delicious and worth the drive . we 'll be back again . well-lit , clean inside , service was prompt and the food was amazing .	3997
1	finally , a well cooked thin pizza ! it 's been my holy grail for years in the east valley . delicious with plenty of toppings , crisp flavourful crust and a tangy sauce ( i loath sweet sauce ) . oh , and delivery was prompt and courteous ! i ca n't wait to dine in and to try the subs . my fiance is a meatball sub fanatic and i 've heard great things . my new favorite go-to pizza place . bye bye venezia pizza with your soggy , nasty crust .	3997
1	great service . highly recommend the olive oil specialty pizza . always good & so are the salads .	3997
1	new owner ( for a few years ) has really made a difference in this place ! the decor is much cleaner and nicer , the food is even better than it was , and now it has wings ! our family favorite ! they are delicious also ! sandwich 's are still fantastic , and the pizza has been upgraded in a big way ! love this place to come with the family and just have a great time !	3997
1	was in the area because i 'm looking into buying a toy hauler and so we stopped to eat dinner here . the pizzas and wings are delicious and customer service is amazing . this is easily one of the best pizza spots we 've ate at . the staff are friendly , place is clean , and there 's plenty of seating . overall great experience & we will return if we 're in the area again : )	3997
1	my favorite pizza place ! thefood is fresh and delicious , the staff is always helpful and friendly . i have n't ordered anything yet that did n't exceed my expectations .	3997
1	best pizza and wings in town ! honey bbq hot wings are the best , perfectly crispy and flavorful . we 've even had their hot sandwiches before , also amazing ! not only do they have great food , but the staff is also very friendly every time we visit .	3997
1	this a perfect neighborhood restaurant with great sub 's and pizza . my favorite is the taco sub , it is a must have . great for family 's and good weekly specials . also fast delivery .	3997
1	it 's been a couple years since i tried this place , i loved it then and i still love it now . i do n't go here for the pizza , ca n't say i 've ever tried it , i go for the subs . the cowboy is fantastic , but my loyalty is to the club sub . the family has branched out and tried other subs off the menu and not one complaint . i will continue to drive out of my way to get a sub .	3997
0	i used to eat here about once a month , but have n't been here for awhile , last time i ate here they had the cowboy cut sub sandwich , but they do n't have that anymore . they used to have the best subs , but they changed the bread and the sub tastes different . i will not go back	3997
0	never had a problem until today . gave 1 star . order food to be picked up at 5pm . my husband was there a few moments of 5pm . they did n't give us our food till 5:30 . this lady came in after my husband . she order her pizza and her food . the food i order online should of be ready at 5pm . plus the pizza was cold . thanks for making dinner not wonderful . do n't forget i order the food at 12:22 this afternoon for 5pm	3997
0	yuck ! i hate spending my money on bad food ! ! ! we used to go to papa 's a lot years ago , and thought we 'd give it a try , as the reviews seemed pretty decent . first , do n't be fooled by the pictures online . the food does n't look anything like them ! the pizza was on a thin crust , not anything like the picture ! the crust was tough and the toppings , sparse ! the wings ... well , the picture shows a buffalo style wing . what i got was a breaded soggy mess ! gross ! no sauce at all . they were so soggy , i just threw them out . terrible .	3997
0	ordered for pickup . was told 30 minutes . showed up in 20 minutes and paid . i sat for 30 minutes waiting . customer who came in after me was called an got her pizza . i asked if mine was done and they were sitting in the back . i was asked if i paid and then told it was marked as pick up . no apology given . pizza was n't hot by the time i got home . the taco pizza and wings were good . customer service could use some work .	3997
0	i am super disappointed in this place . the medium pizza we got was first of all very small , very thin and had no flavor at all . it was like one of those pizzas you make when you are little or like a lunchable pizza . we also got the wings , very soggy as well . if you live in he mesa area stick to bella 's !	3997
0	just called to order a pizza to try something new even after mixed reviews . always go to sourdough pizza down the street which we love but wanted to try something different . i asked the guy on the phone if he had sliced sausage because my boyfriend prefers it , his response was no and as i was checking to see if that was okay with my boyfriend , i heard him say `` yeah we do n't use that sliced crap '' . we were going to order a pizza anyway but after that response we changed our mind , would have liked to give this place a shot ! bummer !	3997
0	do n't waste your time unless you have plenty of time to waste . took 50 minutes to get a chicken parm sub and was n't even busy	3997
0	ordered pizza through the app papa kelsey 's offers . applied a coupon that was available and placed my order . the app removed my pizza from the order and kent who claimed to be the manager was very unprofessional and unhelpful . will ever order from a rip off restaurant that will not correct the technology they put out . the app states if you have any issues call the store . i did n't realize the issue until i got a delivery of only wings no pizza ! shame	3997
0	i should have tried the subs , according to the other reviews those are good . we got 4 pizzas and not one of them was even edible . they were tasteless and the toppings were blah . i would never get the pizza again . had it not been the tuesday night special where the 2nd pizza was 99 cents , i would have felt completely ripped off .	3997
0	ate a medium pizza the first time and first time there and thought pizza was good ! , 2nd time i ordered a large pizza ! , if that is large ! , i hate to see the small one ! ! ! i think the large looks like a medium ! ! in any other pizza restaurant , will never go here again ! ! ! ! ! never saw a large pizza that looks like a medium ! ! its a con ! ! ! !	3997
0	we 've been looking for a good pizza place in mesa ... besides barros ( the best so far ) ... and decided to give this place a try . it was horrible . i could have bought a frozen pizza from the store and been completely satisfied . even our kids were not happy . we ordered 2 large pizzas ... which from other places gives us plenty of left overs ... that we 're more like mediums . it was just enough to feed the kids . we will not be ordering from their again . only good thing i can say about it was that the delivery driver was very nice . huge disappointment .	3997
0	we have lived in this area for 4 years now and always wondered about this place . we stopped in and ordered a regular old sausage and onion pizza . we were n't very impressed . maybe we 'll go back and try a sub at some point but i would n't recommend the pizza .	3997
1	i have been living in esplanade apartment homes for over 3 years . i am so happy here that i never want to leave . esplanade is a beautiful complex , has spacious quiet apartments , and is run by a very sweet and caring staff . nanette , adia , and elvis will bend over backwards to help you ; not only because it is their job , but because they really do care . esplanade really feels like home because the people that run it make it that way .	3998
1	esplanade has gorgeous apartments , a beautiful pool , clean grounds , and a very friendly staff . nanette , adia , and the rest of the team are the best . i would give them 6 stars if i could .	3998
0	i came to view their apartments at 20 minutes to 6pm . as soon as i walked in i was told that the models were closed . she provided me with the info and when i asked if she honestly could n't show me the apartments she said everything is closed up and she was about to leave . i did n't insist and will never rent from this complex . i 've never had an experience like this at other properties . this is really disappointing as it seemed like a nice place . but if managers are to busy to accommodate prospective tenants i ca n't imagine how they attend to their current renters .	3998
0	i was looking to lease an apartment and saw their website and decided to stop by . i got here a few minutes after 5:30 and they had the doors locked . i stood around thinking maybe they went on a tour or something . i even called the office phone hoping i could reach someone . then a lady ended up walking past and i got her attention and she said they were closed . the business hours say they close at 6 pm . she said her assistant went to the bank and she 's off ... . very unprofessional ! it really sucks because it looked very nice online and i was looking to move in immediately .	3998
1	great experience , awesome pricing ! will definitely purchase policies from here in future .	3999
1	one of the best customer service experiences i have ever had . my iphone 6 plus screen cracked this morning when i put it in a uneven surface screen down ( not smart ) . i filed a claim this afternoon and it is now 9pm and it is fixed like brand new from the apple store and rick at esurranty has already paid the apple store directly for me . i could not be happier ! thank you so much rick and everyone at esurranty .	3999
1	so ... i do understand the frustration with esurranty among most of the reviewers . this company does have a lot of room for improvement , mainly on their communications . due to delays in communications , i also had a moment of doubt that they may really be an online scam . after a few communication attempts via email and phone , claims department manager rick reached out to me personally to move things along and offered an explanation that the delays were being caused by a shoddy operational infrastructure with their subcontractor , and after that , things went smoothly . these guys are not as bad as their yelp reviews suggest , and they definitely are n't a scam .	3999
1	i was happy my repair was done by my house and only took 1 hour . yay ! ! ! ! they are very helpful and professional when you make a claim . the process is very easy and you do n't have to pay up front and wait to be reimbursed . y iphone 5 looks like it 's bran new after they replaced the screen and the home button . i 've seen some other reviews that the people say bad things but y experience has been nothing but perfect !	3999
0	terrible custom service ! spoke with angelo on march 9 and again on the 19th . he said my check was in the mail . nothing since & no one returns calls or seems to be in the office . is this company a scam ? ? will go back to square trade insurance . seems like a better choice . very unhappy customer !	3999
0	my experience with this scam of a company was just like everyone elses . my claim was not responded to in the timeframe noted on the website , and it was basically ignored until i placed a charge back with my cc company . then magically i received a call right away . he tried to get me to send my phone to him for repair , but i had already done research and knew he was just trying to get a real phone . long story short , back and forth through email , and phone messages which turned threatening and basically as unprofessional as you can get . this is 100 % an illegitimate insurance company and this guy is a career criminal .	3999
0	claim cl5165015- esurranty policy # 415412177 beware of scams - esurranty it 's been a month since they charged deductible . i 've got the following from sean on dec 5 2017 , on claim processing time frame : '' 3-5 business days depending on how quickly everything submitted can be verified . the longest it takes is 10 business days . '' never heard anything back . all my emails were just ignored . the company can not be trusted .	3999
0	please do not purchase their insurance . i 've had the same experience just like the other buyers here . these guys are professional con artists . ( i 'll update my story here soon ) .	3999
1	the pizza is cheap and they are normally fast here . they have good customer service and the place is clean . it 's also in a good location .	4000
1	little caesars pizza . average pizza for a really cheap price . this location is pretty fast but they run out of a lot of things fast so i 've learned to call in my order . parking is a bit tight but it clears out in a minute so not too bad .	4000
1	it has fast service and low prices . i recommend the deep dish if you like bread or sauce . i recommend the regular if you like cheese . the crazy bread is delicious and so is the sauce .	4000
1	have never been disappointed here at this location . the staff is always really friendly and helpful ! ! they have some great options . if you have n't tried the deep dish now is the time.. brings little caesars to the next level while you are a it try the italian cheese bread ... so so good ! ! ! !	4000
1	you can never beat the prices and the crust is always the best because of the cornmeal ! ! place is clean , busy and fast ! ! the group working there could use a little more personality !	4000
1	hot n ready ! so i placed a phone order and the order was incorrect when i went to pick it up they said it would be a 5 minute wait , no problem . but when she gave me my order she gave me a free 2 liter soda for waiting . i did n't expect anything but was very happy . who new great service could come from fast food ? !	4000
1	i love how made to perfection this place makes pizza and cheese bread ! their cheese amounts are perfect and drizzle ... .	4000
1	the deep dish is way better than the hot and ready . great customer service and great price .	4000
1	strictly on the service ... cause we know what we are getting at lil c 's . amazing ! the guy behind the counter ( did n't catch his name but he was a tall gentleman with glasses ) was a gem . full of life and made nice small talk about the weather , but it was n't annoying the way some people ask about the outside world . he seemed genuinely interested in today 's forecast . anyway , he was a pleasure to be served by and i hope that he continues to put out good into the world .	4000
1	not a fan of fast food pizza and had n't eaten little cesar 's in years . my friend brought me here and was super surprised how good it was . will be coming back !	4000
1	c'mon guys , this is little caesars we 're talking about . the family and i have frequented this location far more than i care to admit . sure , maybe a time or two we 've had to wait a few minutes and who can blame the poor workers for not being too enthused ? does n't take away from the fact this has is a consistent and solid location as far as lc goes . ca n't beat the price and convenience especially if you have kids !	4000
1	solid pizza and quick service . went and got a hot and ready bacon wrapped deep deep dish pizza . being from detroit there 's not much choice for detroit style deep dish pizza out here . little caesars is on every corner back home and it 's nice to see them expanding all over the country . back to the pizza : it 's almost sinful how much crust and bacon is on this pizza . there was a perfect amount of sauce and cheese topped with pepperoni and more bacon pieces sprinkled on . i 'm sure it took a few years off my life for this pizza but it was worth it !	4000
1	great customer service . i was surprised to be honest , but the wait was really long and the young gal managed the busy store like a pro . not the best area , but since the food is takeout , it 's not a big deal .	4000
1	always have had good service at this location . food has never been wrong or of poor quality .	4000
1	this is the best little caesars location i have been to ! we have been here quite a few times on lazy sundays when i do n't feel like cooking and the pizza is always fresh and the establishment is new and clean . definitely an easy $ 5 to drop !	4000
1	not sure why the negative reviews , i was in and out in no time with hot pizza and crazy bread . good prices , service was fine , did n't have a line , no problem with parking , so i 'm not sure why this is n't rated higher . but i 'll def return .	4000
1	great customer service , very fast , and tasty . love this place . man running the counter today , especially , seemed to have a nice , positive attitude . when you 're looking for a cheap pizza that you can just come in and devour , this is definitely the place to go .	4000
1	this location is the best little caesars i 've been to . the pizza is always hot and ready . the cashier is very nice and friendly .	4000
1	what can i say ! you ca n't beat the $ 5 pepperoni pizza hot and ready price especially if your on a budget ... great location and always busy ... . do n't get caught in the rush ... lol pizza night for everyone ! pizzas roll out really fast here ... . no complaints here ! fast and easy for the days you do n't feel like cooking ... .	4000
1	i am not a big pizza eater but my kids , like most kids love it . this location is brand new and is nice and clean and how can u argue with a $ 5 pizza that is pretty fresh and ready when u get there . also they give my kids little caeser 's pizza cookies when we pick up..nice little touch . i know it is n't great high end pizza but they love it and the price is right .	4000
1	my favorite inexpensive pizza now that they have added more butter to their crust . love the $ 5 lunch special `` deep dish-4 pieces and a soda . '' also love the more cheesy called the extra most bestest . great for my taste buds but not my waistline . they are dangerous close to where i live .	4000
1	i can grab a pizza & be in & out in less than 3 minutes . that counts for something ! maybe i 'm going at less busy times but my pizza 's always hot , ready & delicious ! i 've paid a lot more for pizzas that are n't as good . i was tempted to give it 5 stars ... .maybe i should ... .	4000
1	the best ! ! im here all the time for kids , parties and school events . the service is always great and the pizza is hot and ready . the owner is a big supporter of the community and local schools . little caesars supports our community and as a community we should support our local businesses . any negative reviews here are meaningless to me .	4000
0	cold , extra greasy , and burnt . picked up a $ 5.00 pep and tried two pieces . i threw the rest in the trash . the pizza was burnt . the pizza was cold . the amount of grease on the bottom of the box was so soaked through my counter at home had to be washed off . it sat on the counter for 2 mins and looked like i washed the counter with grease . i do understand this is the mcdonalds of pizza , but when its not even edible , whats the points ? if this place went out of business , the world would be better off..	4000
0	when they first started out they were great , but then they got greedy and started charging more ! the $ 5 went to $ 6 , now they 're charging for the deductions . i wanted light sauce and i had paid the same price for light sauce ( which is less ) as if it was an extra topping ! that 's like requesting a meat lovers minus ham but , having to pay extra , that makes no sense ! ! it 's ridiculous ! ! ! ! ! lc , you 're starting to lose your street cred !	4000
0	i looked online to see what time they close and it said 11 , i even called the location and asked if they still had what i asked for . yet to find out , i drove all the way to the little cesar 's and it closes at 10 . was n't very happy about that .	4000
0	hot and ready is not happening got here at 1:30 it 's now 1:58p . and no pizza ready and it 's just one of the hot ready pepperoni	4000
0	this is my usual stop when i need a quick lunch or dinner for the kids . the staff is usually friendly ... ... ... not anymore . these kids look as though they could care less about their job . : -\	4000
0	your hours are horrible ! ! closing at 10 on a weekend night , really . you should be open till at least midnight on weekends and 10/11 on week nights . you 're a pizza joint for gods sake .	4000
0	i do n't know what happened to this place . when they first opened , they were pretty good . the last 6 months or so , it seems like every time i go , their pizza is overcooked and dry . this is the third time i 've gotten hot n ready pizza that are dry and crunchy . the cheese is mostly hard and brown and the crust on the deep dish is rock hard . as i 'm writing this , my husband just said , geez , this crust is hard as a rock ! so , it 's not just me . i think i 'm done giving this place another chance .	4000
0	if u could give no stars i would . no wonder it 's $ 5 a box , there 's no taste to the pizza what so ever . wong be eating little ceasers , i rather stick with pizza hut honestly .	4000
0	horrible service they do n't want to make pizza because they wan na close 30 min early i will never be returning to this location ever again	4000
0	this place cares more about their employees than the customer . simply asked to have my pizza cut into squares instead of triangles and was denied . asked why they would n't do it and was told some lame excuse how they do n't want to make extra work for employees ( was talking to the owner ) . cater to your customers to a reasonable point and my request was reasonable and not too hard at all . thank you i 'll just go to the windmill/pecos location instead .	4000
0	i would give this location zero stars . very disappointed . i called ahead of time and asked for a fresh pepperoni deep dish pizza , what we usually get from little caesars . i was told there 's already some made , i asked again if he could make a fresh one and said what time we would be there to pick up . the pizza i received was dry , burnt , and as if it was sitting under a heat lamp for hours . very little sauce , just tasted like a big hunk of bread with a cheese stick on top . please do n't waste your time or money and go to another location .	4000
0	this place is horrible . why would i come into ur place of business to get a stop n go pizza if every time i come here it takes 10-15 minutes to get a pizza they 're supposed to have ready at all times . totally ridiculous and false advertising . c'mon little caesars you can do better than that .	4000
0	slowest little ceasers ever . have been here many times and there is no such thing as hot and ready here . always a wait and the workers do n't know what 's going on . just order from marcos up the road . way faster , tastes better and they know how to take your order	4000
0	called before i went in to get my deep dish they said no need to order and when i arrived she said there going to be a 10 min thanks for making me miss half of my sons game	4000
0	i thought this place was supposed to have the most pepperoni and cheese well they do n't one of the pieces i got had a 1/2 piece on the side and the others ! ! ! ! well you be the judge this is it and if this is supposed to be the most well i just smh rn ! ! ! this is the pieces	4000
0	online says they close at 10 everyday , when in reality it 's only 10 on fridays and saturday 's .	4000
0	i called at 10:40 on friday night and they were already closed ! ! glad i called before wasting my time driving there.. i 'll just go to horizon ridge & eastern location from now on	4000
0	this location is always closing early advise you to call before you waste your time driving here esp if its 20 mins til close they 'll already be closed .	4000
0	horrible service we used to order over the phone and then come in and pay even tho the pizza was n't ready the cashier her name is shyla k she did n't let me pay cuz she said she needs the manager approval but when my pizza was ready there was no manager she was very rude	4000
0	the girl that rung me up looked and sounded like she seriously hated her job . i walked in and she looked at me like she was surprised to see a customer walk into her store . she took my order and did n't even ask if i wanted anything else . she literally stared at me until i said `` that 's all . '' horrible service ! great price for a pizza and wings though .	4000
0	hot or ready ... ready buy not hot ... .. no wonder whether place does n't get too many business i know it 's new that 's why i do n't have too many customers ... . , that 's why the pizza set for a long time on the window whatever they use ... .	4000
0	i 've been eating at this location for over three years but a couple of months ago they started over cooking their pizzas . now the crusts are hard and unbeatable and the cheese is no longer gooey but like a sheet of cheese that 's actually crunchy in places . not sure if i 'll be going back anymore .	4000
0	call before stopping if your with-in an hour of closing time . i came in and asked for the new stuffed crust deep dish . they did n't have any made so they declined my order and money . i asked for the managers business card and was declined . when i asked why they were declining the order they stated it was because the staff wanted to go home . i confirmed their hours of operation . i confirmed i was here with in their hours of operations . sadly this is not the first time this happened .	4000
1	been going here since the day it opened . great food and their lunch/dinnaer plate is unique and different from the many other shawarma places located all over the gta making it a worthwhile alternative . service is usually on-point . servers can be terse but are quick and very attentive . would highly recommend to others .	4001
1	i 've been to this place many times , first suggested by a coworker at my old job , then tried their offerings at work through their catering . after many visits and chicken shawarmas , mainly , later , i can say it 's one of the best places i 've had shawarmas . not as good as shawarma palace in ottawa with their amazing plate size , one plate feeds two and a delicious garlic sauce , but still pretty good . i always get the large shawarma pita . their service is usually pretty fast as well . the place looks clean , usually . definitely will go visit many times .	4001
1	stopped in for a quick lunch and had some of the best chicken shawarma i 've ever had . everything tasted fresh , the food was served quickly and the prices were reasonable ( ~ $ 10 for my hummus and chicken shawarma plate with pita ) . super spot for lunch .	4001
1	on our way to the drive 5 in oakville . quick stop for dinner led us here . interesting item on the menu , shawarma with pineapple . gon na have to try that some day but this time i stuck with the classic beef shawarma combo sandwich with fries and a drink . my wife had a falafel sandwich . tasty . nice big pita , with healthy toppings . falafel was mild and tasty . store bought frozen fries . all in all worth the stop . very pleasant people . not a big patio . but comfortable .	4001
1	solid , tasty food and friendly service in an otherwise sad little strip mall . that said , a much better alternative to the pizza pizza nearby . the chicken on my shawarma was a little overdone , but all other ingredients were fresh . got the job done nicely .	4001
0	terrible service ! i called 2 hours ahead to pick up an order . when i arrived they claimed i called the wrong location . i pressed redial on my phone in front of them and their phone started ringing . i then said i would wait for my food and proceed to sit down . 20 minutes later they are looking at me and asked why i was there and whether i wanted to place an order ! and they continued to blame me in front of their other customers . messed up dinner plans for my family so not impressed . avoid this place .	4001
0	perfect restaurant for vegetarians.. chicken shawarma plate had more salad rice and potatoes than actual chicken.. i have given this place enough chances and it 's the same thing everytime ... for the price it 's not worth it.. might as well drive down the street to pita nutso or even osmows .	4001
0	tried this today for the first time . i got the fatoush salad with chicken , almost $ 13 . the plates are tiny , so there was very little salad . i could n't believe how little chicken i got on top . about a third or half of what i would get at any other place . flavour was delicious i 'll admit that , although a bit too strong , overloaded the dressing . hot sauce was great . this place would get 5 stars if the portions were correct , i would have to pay $ 26 to get a plate equivalent to my normal shawarma places .	4001
0	checked this place out for the first time . prices are pretty high compared to osmows and lazeezs . only thing i 'll give them is that their chicken is fresh and tasty but even then they cheap out on the quantity . wrap 6-7 small size and platter for 10-13 taxes in . definitely better places out there . worth trying and appreciating other places after . workers there are also slow and sad not sure why .	4001
0	been coming here for a few years . came in today and wow portions suddenly got smaller . no longer a good deal . time to move on !	4001
1	back in line has helped me with health issues i 've had for years , that i believed to be irreversible . they 've helped me over the past few months and have softened my joint stiffness and lower back aches . the staff is friendly and endearing . they greet you at the door , and always ensure that you 're in and out with the upmost efficiency .	4002
1	5 stars for friendly staff , full service wellness and great chiropractic care . i highly recommend for all your aches and pains .	4002
1	i had a deep tissue massage with francine . it was one of the best massages i 've ever had , very relaxing and no pain the next day .	4002
1	dr. kovac and his staff were so friendly and welcoming ! it was my first experience at back in line and i will definitely be returning . i have already noticed significant improvement in my back and a relief in pain .	4002
1	i had some hip problems that affected my walking . went to back in line based on a recommendation from a friend . found them to be very through to get to the root of the problem . did an excellent job of taking care of hip and i am now back to normal . i continue to go there for routine adjustments since i sit for long periods of time at work . i always feel great after my treatments . all of the staff is very friendly and nice . i always enjoy going there .	4002
0	i chose dr. kovac specifically as a certified practitioner of art . when i expressed my irritation with his being 15 minutes late , he suggested i could have seen another provider , one not certified in art . after claiming several times to have read my intake , but insisting on asking me questions that had already been answered , i had decided that i would n't return for a second appointment , but when he started talking about the injuries i might have sustained from the `` airbag , '' i actually walked out . i can not work with a chiropractor who either lies or does n't understand that motorcycles do n't have airbags .	4002
0	i had purchases a relax & renew new client introductory package from this company to see if i like there massages . i had called many times to schedule an apt and was told they did not have any openings for weeks at a time . i called again to make an appointment and was told they would not honor the certificate because it had expired 6 weeks ago . why will they not honor something i already paid for ? not a good way to get new clients who had already paid for your services .	4002
0	do n't buy a groupon from this place ! my group of friends & i got screwed ! when we each called to make an appointment , the earliest available day/time was several weeks later . we were under the impression that there were several employees who could provide service . we were so disappointed & ended up losing money by not being able to redeem our groupon vouchers at back in line .	4002
0	i had a massage here through groupon i do n't feel that the massage person was very skilled and did not understand proper technique or understand the direction that muscles should be worked on place also had an odor to it that was not clean but that of a gym musty chiropractor evaluation was declined by me but he was very nice	4002
0	i was extremely disappointed with the service and professionalism of both `` doctors '' . basically one big con job . i saw them three times `` paid '' and never got an adjustment just a big sales pitch . it was like buying a used car . this is from somebody with a chiropractor in the family .	4002
1	having supper with a friend who i had n't seen in a while at enoteca monza . we started with the butcher 's board and crostini bruschetta which were really fresh and tasty . we then had the rucola pizza and the penne gigi . the prosciutot , mozzarella , and the arrugula were fresh and the pizza dough was n't over cooked so it was both crispy and soft . as for the penne gigi it was perfect . just the right balance of cream an tomato sauce and the pancetta was n't over cooked . over all it was a spectacular meal	4003
1	as good as it gets that 's exactly the thing to say about this restaurant ! ! ! i came in not knowing exactly what to expect and walked out knowing that i will come back again and again . the food was so good . we were a group of six people and there was not one dish on the table that we did n't enjoy . the deserts are pure heaven . the prices are reasonable and not at all as expensive as i thought they would be . they are five stars all the way in my book ! !	4003
1	my favourite italian restaurant on the west island . large portions , great atmosphere and exceptional service . great for takeout too !	4003
1	had not been to monza in a while , last time i was there it was called mozza . so we were there on a friday night a group of about 15 . have to say i ordered a salad because it was late . salad was ok nothing special , but the dessert was amazing . i had the cookie monster , and all i can say is yum yum yum . if you are a dessert lover , i definitely recommend monza , as well the sangria was delicious . overall the service was good , and fast and fun atmosphere .	4003
0	great service , polite servers , restaurant is very nice but the food is tasteless , the food is appealing looks delicious but ingredients is not good quality , it 's a kind of restaurant where you pay for the decoration and ambiance . would i go back here again ? once in a purple moon not even a blue moon .	4003
0	i hate to say this but the service is terrible . they made a mistake with our order they offered to get us a side , we said yes ... . they charged us for the side ... the waiter also was very obnoxious and dismissive . will never go there again	4003
0	the pizza crust was made this morning or yesterday . when you order the pizza they put the toppings on and then re-heat . the pasta dishes are equally unappetizing . the decor is otherwise nice and the wait staff all wear the the spandex crotch length dresses which appear to be the required uniform for female wait staff in many of the montreal chain restaurants .	4003
0	food is great here ( their hazelnut salad and salmon in particular ) however the service has gone downhill . the past three times i have been the service keeps getting worst and worst . the first time we waited 30 minutes for a table despite having a reservation and showing up on time . the second time the server was very inattentive and non present . this last time we went for a late work lunch . the server hardly came by the table , service was very slow and then he made several errors on the bill . when i brought this to the manager 's attention he apologized but did not do anything to correct our bill . he lost my business .	4003
1	this is a great office to go to if your a naturally minded parent . we love dr lokey . shes awesome and my kids think shes the best .	4004
1	we love dr lokey and her nurse rebecca . they are easy to get a hold of and get us in right away . they always treat my children with kindness and never rush .	4004
0	dr. lokey was rude and condescending . she made snide remarks on multiple occasions . our family and our friends have since changed and are much happier .	4004
0	took daughter for 15 month checkup and what thought to be full set of shots for her age but was told that they did n't have the vaccines needed . so just got hep a shot and have to go to county clinic to keep shots current . 3rd or 4th time this has happened . need to look for another pediatrician as this is an inconvenience .	4004
1	i will be honest and say that i have not been impressed by the restaurants in cleveland . there are no shortage of chinese restaurants in the edge water/lakewood area . this place is the best of all the places in cleveland .	4005
1	we 've been getting delivery from here for about 4 years . pad thai and crab ran goons are by far our favorite option . we 've also tried the sweet and sour options as well as some more traditional asian options . friendly service , fast delivery and always willing to go the extra mile . they were closed for over a year recently and we tried them again . the food believe it or not seems better now although i may be biased . complete remodel of their location and it looks amazing . i see yet now offer sushi : )	4005
1	excellent food ! ! i ordered the shrimp tempura & california rolls . my roommate had the sesame chicken with chicken fried rice . i could n't believe how delicious the sushi was , as it was takeout food . the sesame chicken was also delicious & the chicken fried rice was perfect ! will definitely be ordering from here again ! !	4005
1	so happy they re-opened , love the new décor and atmosphere , food is just as good as ever . great food for a reasonable price .	4005
1	best tasting food friendly atmosphere.best sushi on this planet.very good food .	4005
1	i 'm always a bit apprehensive trying a new chinese place , but this place did not disappoint ! the food and appetizers were great , they went above and beyond to make sure the vegetarian in our group got everything right in her meal and the family combo was a great deal at 12.50 ! we all have leftovers for lunch today !	4005
1	the food here i ordered was good , but the crab ragoons need to be filled with more filling . they have great flavor but definitely need more filling . i also ordered some sushi that was the special for the day but it took wayyyyy too long for my very small order . i guess the chef ran out of stuff and he made a run to aldi 's to grab more . hmmmmm ... ... so no one advised me . i was kept waiting until he returned . a little bit on the tacky side if you ask me .	4005
1	great quality chinese food . their food is delicious and portions are huge ! i love their eggrolls . i have yet to dine in , but the restaurant is beautiful inside .	4005
1	always great food whenever i order ! love that i can walk here and everyone is so friendly . beef szechwan is awesome , shrimp lo mein and honey chicken are some recent finds . order the spicy salty shrimp for a real treat ! thanks panda wok !	4005
1	really good food with wonderful owners . the place is very clean and welcoming with some really friendly faces . they make you feel like home and are very flexible when it comes to making food to suit your personal taste . it 's also a fun place to have parties at . the sushi here is really the best in this area . thank you for the great food and service !	4005
1	not your run-of-the-mill frozen chinese joint . it was clear from the first bite that i was n't eating out of a bag of frozen veggies and chopped chicken . everything was very fresh , and there was so much of it ! if anything could be complained about is that the menu is too big , with too much on it . i 'd like to see them pare down the menu to two pages of specialities . i ca n't say one bad thing about the food , and our waitress was awesome . will definitely be back !	4005
0	i recently moved to the area and thought i would try it . however i was greatly disappointed . the service took forever and the food was very bland . the different dishes were hard to extinguish between . i will not be coming back here .	4005
0	i used to love panda wok , but it has been closed for almost a year . i would call and for the first 8 months there was no explanation , just a vague `` we 'll be closed for a few weeks for renovations . '' apparently those few weeks took a lot longer than they thought , because now they are finally coming clean and saying that they 'll open in november . too late for me . really ? you could n't be straight with the people who have kept you in business all these years ? a great way to lose customers is to frustrate them .	4005
0	i 've had good meals there in the past , and they 're really nice people , but ... . ... not so much . i bit into my chicken and it was dark . like *dark* dark . i did n't know chicken could be that dark . when i have to question if what i 'm eating is actually what i thought i was eating , i 'd have to say no thanks . i just hope at some point that meat did n't meow . i 'm giving them two stars , cuz , well , they 're nice .	4005
0	after reading reviews we decided to ordered lunch pick up from here . picture shown was supposed to be shrimp and broccoli . it was shrimp with mixed vegetables in a white creamy sauce . it was not the typical shrimp with broccoli and the rice tasted old . aside from this we ordered crab rangoon appetizer and they were awful . there was literally no filling inside it was just a fried shell . wo n't be ordering from here again .	4005
0	first , we tried calling and no one answered , so we ordered ubereats from here . they gave us half of our order and a random assortment of other dishes . we ended up with much more food ( which was great ) but i have a shellfish allergy and was really cautious about eating it . my friend enjoyed her pad thai and it was cheap , so i have it 2 stars . general tsao 's chicken ( i think ) was just okay and fried rice was dry . i was surprised to find such good reviews on here , so i will try to actually eat at the restaurant and update this review .	4005
0	rangoon 's empty . sweet and sour pork had tiny chunks of meat but were the size of an egg with all the breading . how this is 4 stars is bananas .	4005
0	this is your typical generic chinese food . ordered a small wonton soup , which taste like any other wonton soup i 've had from a a cheap chinese buffet . also ordered , sweet and sour chicken with pork fried rice . fried rice tasted like well nothing , and then chicken is obviously frozen breaded chicken , to a point where you ca n't tell which is the actual chicken or which is the fake breading . if you 're drunk , then you would n't think the food is bad . if you 're sober , then you might stop and think .	4005
0	food smells like its not clean ... i went there a few times to complain why the sesame chicken is so big . they usually come in smaller cuts . if you want real good chinese food than go to a reataurant like the pearl of the orient in rocky river .	4005
0	called for delivery and they never showed even after i called back agreed to possible discount but because they called me back after it was closed i just missed out on dinner i call at 8:36 they close at 10 ample time to deliver called again at 10 said the delivery was out then hung up on me when i called to get names so that my discount could be honored i was hung up on . food is good but i 'd suggest pick up one star because quite frankly i 'm still angry i do n't even want my discount and it will be a while before i return .	4005
0	i was craving pad thai and thai kitchen was closed . i wo n't make that mistake again . the meal was totally flavorless . i will stick with their standard chinese fare , but in lakewood the best remains szechuan garden .	4005
0	3rd and last visit . governor 's chicken soggy , gross beef with overcooked ho fun noodles , orange colored pad thai with teeny weeny shrimp garnished with a dried brown spotted lime wedge . $ 25.85 out the door . yuck !	4005
1	great food , plenty of food and done when you order it , not pre-made . in fact i like it better than pei wei which is just around the corner . now if you want fancy plates and silverware and that is your criteria for eating , then the plastic forks and plates will not tickle your fancy . but if you want good , fresh and enjoyable food then this is the place to go . they have become one of my favorites .	4006
1	i have tried a lot of chinese restaurants in the area , and i can say this is the best so far . they have the best beef with broccoli , chicken friend rice , and for some reason , their plain rice is very good . the serving is very reasonable for the price . great delivery time and they are very efficient . the orders are always correctly delivered . drivers are polite . i am a fan !	4006
1	china jade has easily the best lunch and dinner specials in scottsdale . it still does n't hold a candle to dragon express down in mesa ( best chinese in arizona ) , but ca n't go wrong for the price . all the employees are friendly and they are pretty fast with orders . absolutely check it out if you want some fast food chinese that is above panda express .	4006
1	food was great , and they took us in as they were locking the door and took our order , which was really nice thank you !	4006
1	very fast delivery ! the food is really yummy , and there was alot of it ! so happy with my order ! highly recommended !	4006
1	fantastic food , great service , fast and large servings ! good price , little pricy but totally worth it !	4006
1	i 'm no chinese connoisseur but i really enjoy the food and it 's always chock full of fresh ingredients which is huge for take out . the owners are super sweet and the little girl will always talk to me . very respectful and thankful for service . we were sad to move away from them .	4006
1	i have ordered delivery three times in the past few months , and they delivered before the estimated time . the food was nice and hot . since i am from the east coast this is the best chinese i have found since moving to scottsdale . my favorites are the cheese wontons , chicken with broccoli and sweet & sour chicken . their sweet and sour sauce is really good so i always ask for extra .	4006
1	very good chinese takeout food . friendly staff . i go there a couple of times a month . never had an issue .	4006
1	this is definitely my favorite chinese restaurant in the area . i 've had the orange chicken , sweet and sour chicken , general tso chicken , and the garlic chicken . all were amazing ! the garlic chicken is amazing and has helped me get over the flu twice now . the amount of spice and garlic is perfect . paired with egg drop soup , it helps out so much with any cold or flu . the cheese wontons are also great . fast delivery every time i order too ! i would highly recommend the lunch special as well because it 's a great deal .	4006
1	after reading reviews on yelp , i decided to give them a try . using yelp i placed an order -- which connects you to the eat24 app . i was able to view the whole menu and pay online . loved this feature ! my food arrived within the suggested time . for chinese takeout , it 's pretty good ! i had the hunan chicken and an egg roll .	4006
1	for years my husband and i have complained about the lack of good , inexpensive chinese food in town . not anymore ! the food and ambience may not be as fancy as other places in town , but it 's good , reasonably priced , fast and the staff is lovely . we 've tried a variety of chicken , beef and vegetarian dishes and they 're all great . best of all ? while our friends were preordering their christmas day-chinese food dinner 4 hours in advance we called china jade and 20 minutes later picked up our food . no wait or fuss . and the food was delicious ! they even deliver !	4006
1	decide to try this place as i saw their menu at my work . i ordered the chicken lo mein lunch special and was able to pick it up 10mins or so after i called and placed the order . place was small but open & clean . food was good too . i even added their spring roll to my order and that is almost as good as yogi 's . definitely will go back and order from them again . one of my new favorite asian fast food places to go for lunch .	4006
1	super fast delivery . the small boneless spare ribs were awesome . big portion of them . everything else seemed good . pretty good chinese food for arizona .	4006
1	this was my favorite place to get `` chinese food '' from when i lived in north scottsdale . this is delicious greasy food . if you 're looking for something healthy or authentic ... try something else . this is divey-take outy-local owned joint .	4006
1	ordered through grubhub . painless process ! super fast delivery . food was hot ! quality was as expected for a traveler 's neighborhood restaurant . jumbo shrimp with mixed veggies was good , as was the wonton soup . lots of big wontons . they provided plenty of condiments ! and , they got my order right . did i mention the food was hot ? ! forgot the napkins , but not going to nitpick . i would recommend them for business travelers .	4006
1	always order from here thru grub hub . always great food and delivers on time everytime . would recommend .	4006

1	i come here at least once a week for lunch takeout . the food is always ready in under 15 min for pick-up . for under $ 7 with tax , you get a delicious and filling lunch entree . my personal favorites are the mongolian beef and beef lo mien . the lunch also comes with an egg drop soup !	4006
1	best wonton soup i 've ever had ! i love the location of this place right beside my gym and right off of the high way . anytime i need to go shopping i always have this restaurant close by . the staff is really nice , the store is clean what more can you ask for	4006
1	we used the app last night to order delivery . with an average three star rating we were n't sure what we were going to get . we were not disappointed ! the food arrived fast , within 15 minutes , was hot and delicious . we ordered the chicken with mushrooms and snow peas and hunan spicy beef and chicken . both got rave reviews . ordering and paying through the app was very easy !	4006
1	general tso 's chicken was incredible ! not as overly breaded or heavy as many places . the delivery was also much faster than originally estimated ! will order again ! i ordered using yelps eat24 app and the total price was a few bucks less then other delivery apps , so that was a pleasant surprise . i also liked how eat24 let me customize just how spicy i wanted it !	4006
1	first chinese place i 've eaten at on this side of town . their cheese wontons are to die for . i love their hot and sour soup and egg drop soup . always delicious and they 're always friendly .	4006
1	it 's a reliable standby for quick take out . i stick to the basics and have liked everything i 've ordered so far . i would pick up before i ordered delivery -- they were quoting 55+ minutes for delivery on a saturday night . also , you can ask for chili paste if you go in ( kept behind the counter ) . seems like a solid family run business , and it 's refreshing to find chinese food actually cooked by chinese people .	4006
1	i 've been eating here since they opened the doors ... the food is consistently good . the staff is always receptive regardless of how busy they may be . i usually ask for a couple of specific changes to a dish and they 've gladly accommodated my requests . they 're pricing is appropriate and fair for the portion size . it 's rare today . help to support their business .	4006
1	i have eaten here twice now and really enjoyed it . the mongolian beef and wonton soup seem to be my favorite . the food is made with fresh ingredients , in the poultry and beef always taste really good . i	4006
1	this is one of my favorite chinese restaurants in the valley . they do n't short you on protein by adding way too many veggies . they 've got the ratio just right . when you return the owners always recognize you and treat you like family . if you ask for extra wonton chips or sauces they really hook you up . the fact that you can get them delivered , and fast , is really convenient . never disappointed !	4006
1	first , this is a casual , take out place . that 's obvious when you walk in . with that in mind : yum ! it was a good value and the service was better than you 'd expect in that setting . i had the kung cmpao chicken dinner special . it had a nice amout of spice , the sauce was n't too heavy , it had plenty of veggies that were n't overcooked and the chicken was breast meat . they also have brown rice - i appreciate that . the egg roll was n't special but it was fine . i 'll definitely try them again .	4006
1	order from there tonite , they delivered to our condo and the food was excellent ! sesame chicken was lightly breaded , very tender and excellent flavor . mongolian beef was delish not to spicey and tender beef . the rice with both dishes was excellent . highly recommend !	4006
1	i crave this place . awesome prices . awesome authentic food . we live about 15 miles away but we are willing to drive out of our way . i have gotten sweet-and-sour pork , shrimp and broccoli , egg foo yong , orange chicken and they were all excellent . the fried rice it comes with is very good too . i think you should ignore the low ratings because this place is really good .	4006
0	the food was over 20 minutes late , cold and subpar . they get 2 stars for being cheap . will not order again with so many other places to choose from . plenty of mixed reviews so this place must be hit or miss . it was a miss for me .	4006
0	convenient and staff was friendly but food was affordable yet truly terrible . inedible with little taste . asian cooking should balance salty , sweet , sour and spicy . maybe this was an attempt to cater to american palates . we ended up throwing it out . phoenix seems to be a difficult city to find good chinese food .	4006
0	horrible service . the guy , john , who took my order was a rude prick . never even got the food . do not order from this establishment !	4006
0	do not order delivery hour and a half had to cancel	4006
0	me and my coworkers usually order from here . it 's good if you 're on a budget also . but they seem to have been a little forgetful with some things lately . i 've asked not have certain vegetables in items that i 've ordered and the last two times i 've ordered they seem to make it in my food anyway . and my side item did n't make it on my last order . they did n't charge me for it so i 'm not going to complain this time .	4006
0	found a hair in my food ! ! called them and spoke with the front desk guy -i think his name is ryan . said he would credit my cc . 5 days later stll no credit . called and ask for the mgr 's name . he said `` it 's none of your business what her name is ... '' i had to go there to demand my money back . he not only lost me as a regular customer but my entire work crew . what a disgusting place !	4006
0	i placed a delivery order at 8pm- they advised it would be delivered within 30-40 minutes as i was only a couple of miles away . at 8.50pm i called to follow up and they must have shut because no one was answering the phone . food never came . hungry ! ! ! ! will never attempt to go back or order again . their loss ! !	4006
0	i really wanted to like this place , living in desert ridge does n't leave you with to many chinese take out options . pricing seemed very fair , and the menu has a great selection . delivery took an hour which is understandable , my house was built in 2012 and does n't show up on google maps yet . -general tso 's chicken was disappointing . -they forgot our chow mien ! -kung pao beef was fantastic ! -chicken egg rolls were good . ( but i ordered spring rolls ) sorry for the 2 stars china jade , but you guys still owe me some chow mein ... how dare you !	4006
0	very clean mostly takeout chinese . not super fresh . panda is fresher . my daughter 's beef was cold in the beef and broccoli and we ate in ! fried rice was even sub par . i 'm sticking with nee house on the north side from now own , my excellent traditional go to spot .	4006
0	bland fried rice . overcooked teriyaki chicken . soggy eggrolls . note , their chicken `` chow mein '' does not include noodles , even though the very definition of the dish is `` fried noodle '' . it 's just a slop of chicken and onions .	4006
0	horrible customer service . 2nd time i ordered delivery and they over looked my order and did n't make my food . they did n't compensate or anything . no manager was on duty and the response was very bad and unprofessional . they have forgotten parts of my order another time . i 'm done with this place . very very poor service .	4006
0	check your order before you leave . we ordered sweet & sour with sauce on the side . they forgot the sauce . when i picked up , i asked but did not check . they nodded yes . i think they are just too busy to care . they offered to drop off the sauce at the house . this took two hours . our meal was soggy by then .	4006
0	awful . i ordered from here today for the first and last time . after spending 60 dollars , i got sweet and sour chicken ( which i despise ) instead of sesame chicken , undercooked crab rangoon ( 2 orders of it ) , no 2 liter of coke ( they forgot it ) , horrible spring rolls ( teeny little veggie ones like you buy in the frozen food section ) , and soggy shrimp . i have n't had a delivery experience this bad in 3 years . save yourself the time , energy , and money .	4006
0	good food ( when its right ) for a great price ! ! ! but ( huge but ) horrible service ! all of the food i got was wrong . called to try to get it fix and could not get the owner or an manager on the phone.an irritated employee told me that the owner did not want to talk to me about the order being messed up and he hung up on me , not before saying `` i 'm tired of this place '' smh i guess i cant order from this place when ordering for the exce 's anymore !	4006
0	we had just moved to town last month and we wanted good chinese . we were so displeased by this place ! first of all the portions were ridiculously small for what they charge . our noodles were greasy and our chicken was cold . then we all ended up with horrible food poisioning for 3 days straight ! ! ! stay far away from here ! ! ! ! it was the worst experience ! ! !	4006
0	highly disappointed . i ordered for delivery 2 lunch specials and a 2liter soda . the delivery driver forgot the soda . the lunch specials said they came with rice and soup or a spring roll . we only got the rice . there was hardly any meat . and when you order from a chinese restaurant , fortune cookies are expected . we got none . for $ 20 , this was ridiculous . do n't think i 'll be eating here again .	4006
0	this was a huge let down . i ordered this along with some co-workers that recommended over hong kong asian cuisine where i usually order from . i will never stray from hong kong asian cuisine as this was the worst lo mein i have ever had . the noodles were some flat noodle with no sauce or seasoning and could not even take more than a few bites . the fried rice that came with my orange chicken was just brown rice with peas in it . the orange chicken was the one saving grace so i had something to choke down but i would never eat here again .	4006
0	attempted to order online . i called after 10 ... and they could n't find my order . i attempted again with the yelp order and after another 15 minutes they could find my order because they had n't put it in . after waiting an hour ... i got a confirmation that my food would be delivered in `` 45 minutes '' . thanks . but please cancel my order and refund my 2x processed payment of $ 32.something . really poor service yelp and china jade	4006
0	this place is a joke ! i was visiting from out of town ! ordered food for delivery and gave them my credit card number 6 times ! unreal then they take the wrong number and send one of there goons to collect from us ! get this they take the wrong number again ! then text me they are calling the police ! perect call them its not my fault they ca n't understand english ! also the food is sub par ! who sticks a menu on someones door to get new guests then treats them like shit ! wake up china jade and get your shit together !	4006
0	still waiting after 90 minutes and no delivery . girl who answers phone has no clue where my food is or what driver has it . all she can say i do n't know i am in high school . worst experience ever . do not use this place ever .	4006
0	place only accepts cash for small orders . food is low quality .	4006
0	meh is all i can say ... i ordered online for delivery . why ca n't north scottsdale get a good chinese place with easy delivery ?	4006
0	stay away from this restaurant ! . their food is loaded with grease , fat and soy sauce . the most disgusting chinese food i have ever eaten . the only thing they do well is tape unwanted flyers/menus on resident 's doors , no matter how many times you ask them to stop .	4006
0	ordered for delivery . cold when it got here later that grub hub said . and no eating utensils or napkins . i do n't know if the bland and tasteless food we got was because it was cold when it got here or not . probably never again .	4006
0	awful ... lunch was served on plastic take-out plates with plastic spoons and forks ! food was soooo mediocre . no table service and the machine was out of iced tea and ice ! they brought us ice in a cup from the back . this was their grand opening no less ! i will not be back ! there are so many chinese restaurants nearby with good food and decent table service . this place is a joke !	4006
0	i 'm so bummed after reading such great reviews . delivery took 40 minutes , but was estimated at 45-60 . the food was sub par at best . i had an unidentified meat in my wontons , no breading on my kung pao chicken , and a flavorless fried rice , with no eggs ! there was so much filler in my chicken too , i definitely wo n't return . half my entree was squash ! maybe it 's different on the east coast , but i do n't recommend the food or delivery since you have a minimum of $ 15 and a delivery fee !	4006
0	who ever rated more than 1 start does n't know real chinese food ! i regret spending a penny there . and also the staff and service are terrible how do these people even gave a job .	4006
0	good customer service . the worst orange chicken i 've ever had . i could n't finish it . i went in thinking it was the same place as the delicious china jade in tempe . nope . again , the people are kind , but the food ... i just ca n't ...	4006
0	found a cricket in my fried rice today ... this place should be shut down ! f***ing disgusting !	4006
0	man these people have donkey brains ! ca n't get the most basic things right and they 're rude !	4006
1	wonderful place to live . been here 5 years but this management now is wonderful ! and the apartments are really nice	4007
1	have been living here a couple of weeks and it is great . other residents are friendly . office people are wonderful . have had a wonderful start to my stay here .	4007
0	what kind of business misplacea a tenants keys ? i 'm talking for the apartment and a mailbox . do n't you think it seems suspicious and extremely irresponsible that they 're unable manage their maintenance crew well enough to make sure keys are returned after routine maintenance has been completed ?	4007
0	the only saving grace to this apartment complex is the front office staff and the maintenance crew . maintenance requests and any complaints are handled quickly and professionally . however , the biggest downside to living here is that the walls and ceilings are paper thin . i can hear literally everything that my upstairs neighbor , side neighbor , upstairs side neighbor , and neighbors behind me are doing . the units are old and there are many areas where they are falling apart . i am not renewing my lease for the noise issues alone . i would not recommend this property .	4007
1	this is definitely some of the best pizza in town . try to come a little before or after lunchtime as it gets packed . and that 's with good reason ! this pizza hits all of the essentials - delicious dough ( you wo n't be leaving this crust on the tray ) , tasty sauce , generous toppings . here 's a tip - be sure to get the fresh mozzarella .	4008
1	i got put on to this hole in the wall . my first time entering it was super sketchy because it 's like , underground . but now i ca n't stop coming here . they make exactly what you ask for right in front of your eyes and it 's quick . i think 8 slices for $ 5 . you can not beat that ! ! ! i hope they never shut down . friendly , fairly clean , and fairly priced .	4008
1	super affordable ( cheaper than other on campus ) , great pizza , nice atmosphere . also very generous with toppings ! will definitely be back !	4008
0	the sign outside advertised a `` 48 oz salad '' for $ 5.50 . when you go inside it says it 's $ 7.65 for salad with no discussion of weight . i ordered a salad , which was difficult because they barely had any of the listed toppings on them menu . when i got it home , it was only 26 oz ... .. i mean , that 's still a huge salad , but do n't advertise something you ca n't deliver !	4008
0	the pizza was super good and that is the only reason this place is n't getting one star . the employees were downright rude and groaned when we came into the door to order . they treated us horribly to the point that we almost walked out when we were checking out .	4008
0	quality is severely lacking . i 'm honestly confused as to how they have such a good rating . ordered two pizzas for delivery . got one that was overly greasy , soggy and only had toppings on one lopside - almost as if it fell . the second was just a hoagie sandwich in a pizza box - literally . the toppings were meager and strange - like one fleck of spinach . plus , we ordered three fountain drinks , but received two cans . finally , the order came nearly a 30 minutes late . i called to explain the situation and the lady was n't too concerned . blah ! go anywhere else . anywhere .	4008
1	my experience renting a storage unit from this facility has been nothing but outstanding . from the reasonable rates , clean atmosphere including unit as well as parking lot , to the most wonderful and amazing staff . the staff here was very professional , friendly , and ready to go out of their way to assist you . they made renting a very easy and stress free process . i had a difficult situation come up and they went out of their way to help me with it . i highly recommend this company and location !	4009
1	i stored my classic caddy here for 10 months and sold it . i happened to find another vintage vehicle sooner than expected and was looking for another space 2 - 3 weeks after i had moved out . doug was kind enough to waive the admin fee and honor the same monthly rate as i had when i moved out . this was greatly appreciated as customer service like this is hard to find these days . i highly recommend leasing a space here ! ! ! !	4009
0	this place is a rip off i 'm renting a 10x10 for 128 a month and just found out it 's not a 10x10 it 's smaller so plus they lie about that price wo n't go up but it did not doing business with this company again	4009
0	this place is a ripoff . i had a storage unit for 2 years here . when i deceided to give it up they would not prorate my fees when i was told by the staff and manager that they prorate fees . they had no concern for my situation , the staff is very unfriendly . do not use this company .	4009
1	went here last night with a friend and ordered the veggie korma . one of the best pizzas i 've ever had ! panago is definitely my favourite pizza joint in the city	4010
1	panago has a great idea : come or call in and order your pizza fresh , do n't wait around 2 minutes for a slice to be heated up at pizza pizza et al . when you can come here and order an entire personal pizza fresh and only wait 6 minutes . this place runs like a well-oiled machine too , they are fast and everything is spotless .	4010
1	great pizza . prompt delivery . the only thing i would complain about is that they close too early at nights .	4010
0	i called to order food they would n't allow me to order with out the hotel phone number . i did n't have the information in front of me i asked if i could order my food now and call back with it that information . the lady became extra rude while she told me no and i just hung up . i 'm going to eat somewhere else	4010
0	the pizza was good enough but it tasted pretty much like a box pizza from the supermarket . so it satisfied a pizza craving but did n't deliver anything special or interesting . too bad . however , got ta say it was delivered really quickly !	4010
0	it is good when it is fresh , tastes bad the next day . they can be very skimpy on the ingredients , but it still beats pizza pizza any time . overpriced for the amount of food you get .	4010
1	i had deena as my specialist for a facial . i have sensitive skin so she offered to use the organic line of skin products . she was very calming and i felt very relaxed . the spa facility is small but clean and relaxing . i will be going back again to visit deena . my skin is rejuvenated and feels great .	4011
1	this 5 star review goes to natalie , esthetician at harrahs spa . i just had the best facial in my life and i have many ! she is experienced , professional , and explained every detail as she completed the 80 minute facial . no one likes extractions , but ya got ta do it . she was so thorough and gave me my best treatment ever . i could go on but you get the picture . as a former day spa owner , she 's the best for a great facial and cleansing . the spa is n't very tranquil - they had the tv going loudly right over the hot tub , no waiting area , but the facial was awesome !	4011
0	i got a full set acrylics done here ... pros : -beautiful & clean waiting area -water is available -good staff -if you get rhinestones or a design on your nails , no charge -decent color selection cons : -process was a lil long -i prefer acrylic powder , over here they use regular liquid polish -as you can see in the picture , the sides are messy , do n't look neat -nails are dull ( i literally got them done an hour ago ) i do n't recommend getting nail services here .	4011
0	awful service . i had a hair appointment at 12:30 and asked if i could move it later , they told me no , so i showed up on time . an hour later , at 1:30 , i was still sitting and waiting for my appointment , despite the fact i reminded them of my appointment every 20 minutes . the guy checking in played stupid and would only offer me 15 % off for my wait . my friend had her make up and hair done , she was charged for updo because one bobby pin was placed in her hair . photos of hair and make up were not followed . go elsewhere . luxor gives great service .	4011
1	i 'm new to nevada and i 've been to this petco two times for pet grooming i believe the guys name was chris he groomed my dog twice and did and amazing job both times ! 5 starr for this petco !	4012
1	tony waller was fantastic ! ! he explained everything to me and helped me select the best deal for me . i bought a fish starter kit and ca n't wait to expand it . he also helped me get several things for our cats . thank you tony very much . he works at store # 573 on south rainbow if you can visit that store ask for him . steve and lori miller	4012
1	brittany really did an amazing job grooming my golden doodle ! she is so nice & patient with him , especially since he is scared of the blow dryer . she did an awesome job shaving his paws like i asked even though he is ticklish . he looks as wonderful as the service ! we 're both so happy ! make an appointment with her because they get busy & allow 2-4 hours of work . call before picking up .	4012
1	we have changed our cat food to all grain-free due to allergies . they carry blue buffalo brand , and we really like their dry for her . we were surprised at how many different canned food brands they carry as well . brittany was very friendly and cheerful as we checked out .	4012
0	okay so i usually do n't write reviews unless i 'm irritated with customer service . i just called this location to ask if they would be able to do a grooming for my dog right now . the guy asked me what kind of dog i told him , i have a german shepherd . he immediately stated i have to wait till tomorrow . he did n't say because they were busy or anything he just stated not till tomorrow . i 'm not trying to be rude but this has happened on multiple occasions . i 'm going to take my service elsewhere . all i wanted was my pup groomed .	4012
0	i came here due to needin a new better litter box . right before here i went to petsmart just to compare prices omg this petco is double prices for same exact litter boxes other store offers . i find that insane . other then that ... . it 's a nice store , people are friendly- enough . but definitely will price compare before buying from here ! !	4012
0	do not buy your pet food at a petco location or at petco online . everything is between $ 10 & $ 20 more expensive than anywhere else . just paid $ 40 for a bag of food that i could have purchased online elsewhere for $ 25 shipping included . we are done with petco .	4012
0	how does a store like this with so many heavy items not have shopping carts ? i asked an associate for one when i could n't find any and she said they were all stolen . i asked how am i supposed to buy a 28lb bag of dog food ? ( i am visibly pregnant ) she just shrugged . i said ok i guess i wo n't shop here then and left . wow wow wow . how can people like me or the elderly buy items at a place with no carts or staff willing to help with heavy items ?	4012
1	garlic knots were scrumptious ! i also had pinwheels with broccoli , chicken and cheese yummmm !	4013
1	yum ! best place to eat is at bar bq . my bf and i had the 3 plate meal w/ side . the brisket , chicken and ribs were so tender . you have 3 choices of bbq sauce . we chose the carolina sauce ( slightly spicy ) and its very good . the mac and cheese is a bit dry . they had a bogo special on all beers ... yes ! highly recommend !	4013
1	the food was decent . this place is like a higher end food court . a little pricey for a food court but it 's the vegas strip . the staff was friendly .	4013
1	the pizzas here are amazing ! love the custom made to order salad also ... huge portions . definitely worth it ! yummm !	4013
1	grab a snack , sandwich or coffee and plug in for a charge before hitting a nightlife hotspot or before a show . this is at the nexus or cross-roads for the appian way , the colosseum & the forum shops . there is a coffee shop and many different kinds of upper scale fast food type places .	4013
1	this review is for the lobster chowder company .i had the fries fish sandwich with fries .to borrow some inspiration from james lipton : it was probably the most delightful fish sandwich i have ever had in vegas and possibly the world ! !	4013
1	theres a variety of foods you can choose from . the pizza place is open 24 hours since every night we walk by at 2 am its still open and its poppin with people ordering pizzas . the burger place has really good burgers too and its a little cheaper and quicker if u dont have time to sit and eat . its also right by the forum shops	4013
1	in a tight bind found this place as it 's right across from the colosseum . the pizza was good , quick & large pieces . they options cover everything from ; wraps , chinese , build your own salad , choweder and mexican food . it 's vegas prices ( $ 7/slice , $ 8.99/taco , & so on ) but still on the cheaper end of what it could be . i 'll stick this marketplace in my back pocketbook for another time !	4013
1	for a selection of food and good service , at a fair price try cypress in caesars palace.the seafood station has by far the best corn & lobster chowder in the valley.they have a chinese station -- hamburger station -- sandwich station -- bbq station -- pizza station with a large variaty of pizza 's - garlic knots that are out of this world -- salad station made to your liking . try it you will like it food in the cypress street market-place	4013
1	i was hesitant about eating at a food court in las vegas but this place ending up being very good . i ate at the asian restaurant and the food was tasty and cheap . i also ate some pizza that was crispy , cheesy , and perfectly done . if you need something quick , tasty , and cheap then definitely go eat at cypress street .	4013
1	i like a food court that offers lobster bisque in a bread bowl !	4013
1	the service was terrible but the food at bar bq was very tasty so i am overlooking the very slow service . they had bar bq joined with another sandwich place on a register and only two people working . poorly staffed for a lunch time when there is a big convention in the hotel . however , the brisket sandwich with bourbon bbq sauce was amazing . i also got a side of collard greens which i loved .	4013
1	perfect embarkation point for the forum shops . love that you can refill fountain drinks for free ( i 'll usually stop back after the shops and rest my feet while sipping on a couple more cups of diet pepsi ) . i have n't had all the choices but the pizza place is good and i really like the lobster chowder joint . prices are high but they recently added a $ 1 discount on everything ( except soda ) for total rewards members . i would recommend this to anyone who is looking to do the typical vegas experience .	4013
1	oh yeah ! ny-style pizza and i do n't have to go out on the strip to hunt for it . excellent ! great sauce . i 'll be back ( from the crap tables ) for more ! ! !	4013
1	i love pizza ! ! ! the broccoli garlic and cheese littel pizzas were by far the best i have ever had . it was cooked perfectly as well as the mixture ( topping ) was delicious ) ) you have go tme sold ... can ; t wait to go back to caesars ! ! !	4013
1	when you want to skip the hefty prices of the classy restaurants this is the place to be . a great selection of food and lots of seating only a few steps away from the main casino . been here many times will be back soon .	4013
1	the garlic knots are sooo yummy and soft ! definitely worth trying if you love bread ! : )	4013
1	it 's so refreshing to find a food court that does n't have your typical restaurants ... .like sbarro . the pizza is amazing ! it 's gourmet pizza without the gourmet prices ! they also make custom made salads . i can not begin to explain how fantastic that is ! i tend to be picky with my food and i was able to order a salad exactly the way i liked it ! delicious ! this is by far the best pizza and salad in vegas ... .it 's a must visit !	4013
1	we got drinks and pastries here as a pre-brunch snack . they were good , nothing special , and the prices are casino prices . i think you get 10 % off with the total rewards card , but i forgot . still , it is pretty convenient , and the quality was fine .	4013
0	i had a hot turkey sandwich . it was very good and the roll was nice and fresh . the service was not at all what i was expecting . but the whole caesars complex was a downer .	4013
0	a bit overpriced . food not as good as advertised . our group bought food from 3 of the places here and were not satisfied with the quality .	4013
0	just about every cuisine in this marketplace . i was craving a hotdog which turned out to be a $ 16 dog -- typical vegas strip food price . but what made it worse was that it looked and tasted like a microwavable oscar meyer 's dog . the experience was horrid .	4013
0	i passed through here looking for something to eat for lunch and promptly left . nothing looked appetizing at any of the food stalls . whats up with all the crappy food at this place ? the pizza looked like a complete rip off . i must be turning into a picky ass mofo eater cause i swear unless the food is cooked fresh and the best ingredients are used i do n't want to get near it .	4013
0	i came here thinking i can get some food cheap and quick but it was the exact opposite . i had the 2 scoops gelato it was $ 8 that was good gelato but too expensive . i had the super dry bbq chicken at bar bq not good at all	4013
0	horrible . i ordered a salad and soft drink from the pizza place . they charge $ 4.50 for a soft drink . then when i went to pick up my salad , i saw it under the heat lamp cooking . the smashburger place was also bad , salad was horrible , long wait when not very many people , also charged $ 4.50 soft drink . no salad dressing was put in the takeout order . skip this one , for $ 15 you get food worse than mcdonalds .	4013
0	i wish i could give a real review but the food court is not open right now . closed for remodeling , go elsewhere if you want a quick meal .	4013
0	the chinese food place is not good at all . hard to believe the steamed white rice was even bad . shrimp and lobster sauce was very bad , wonton noodle soup lacked taste . the only some what decent thing on our order was the special fried rice . you could get better food at any whole in the wall chinese place in a strip mall .	4013
0	we had the sushi in the food court and it was inedible . the tuna smelled like they got it from a can and the rice the most disgusting rice i 've ever eaten . my wife got the noodle soup and it was better but not exactly good . i should have demanded my money back but i did n't want to wait in line to do so . if the sushi was any indication of the rest of the food here , avoid it at all costs .	4013
0	this food court is really sad , though i appreciate the fact they have a diverse range of food to pick from . the big thing that got to me was when i got sick from the crab sandwich i had here one night . and since then , i 've avoided this place every time i 've been back . prices here are n't too bad , but you 're better off going somewhere else to pick something up for around the same prices . 2 stars , sorry ! !	4013
0	bbq place inside the little food court in the casino . the total rewards card saves you $ 1 on meals . prices below are with the discount . one meat plate $ 9.49 combo ( side , drink ) $ 6 the brisket was so fatty i could n't even eat it . the mac n cheese tasted like it was old and the corn bread did n't even taste like corn bread lol . i was really hungry and on my lunch break , but i could n't even eat this meal . $ 15 down the drain !	4013
0	slow service but ok if you do n't want to deal with a restaurant . ordered a wrap and it took forever ... not enough help . another day , ordered a bowl of noodles . was much faster but paid almost $ 10 so not a bargain .	4013
0	sometimes you want a quick lunch that does n't cost $ 15+.. sometimes you want some reliable food with the quality level of say mcdonalds or a subway.. this place is none of these things . it 's slow , it 's expensive , and the quality sucks . f you caesar 's for not putting a food court in the mall either.. seriously.. they screw you into eating their over priced crap . pay a few bucks more ( at least at lunch time ) and eat at mesa.. it 's worth the splurge and you wo n't walk away feeling jipped .	4013
0	not worth it . we tried a few of the different places at this food court , and each time the food is really disappointing and expensive . not to mention the drinks ! a soda is $ 3.55 ! also on two occasions - the cashiers overcharged me . stay away - it 's even better just to eat at planet hollywood down in the forum shops .	4013
0	the bbq : we got the three meat combo ( pulled pork , hot link , & brisket ) and they were all pretty dry . we got the mashed potatoes as a side and they were extremely bland and completely void of any salt , pepper , butter , or anything . i 've had he burgers at the grill in the past and it was of much better than the bbq .	4013
0	this place is awful , the service is so slow . coming frmo nyc i expected a deli to be rather fast . instead it took over 10 mins for them to make my sandwich . the tuna did not taste fresh and the sandwiches were expensive . for the same price i probably could have had a nice sit down meal . they really need to improve this food court , especially the delivery time . this was the first and last time i ever ate at a food court in vegas . i rather just have the olives of my martini if i 'm looking for a quick bite ,	4013
0	one of the worst tasting and most expensive non-gourmet pizzas i have ever had . about $ 5 for a decent sized slice and after one i was still hungry but could n't do a second one , it was just too greasy and bad .	4013
0	absolutely the worst , most over priced food court in las vegas , or anywhere i 've ever been for that matter . if i could give this 0 stars i would . it was later after a concert that we were looking for something simple to eat that would n't break the bank . boy do i miss the days in vegas when you could eat for next to nothing . this food court 's service was slow , the prices for the size of the food we 're incredibly high , and the food was terrible . stay away . take my advice , go somewhere else .	4013
0	we needed a quick dinner in order catch a show or something . my memory is a bit fuzzy . but , i do remember paying $ 10 for two slices of pizza and a soda . the slices were small , greasy and had obviously been sitting in the glass heat locker a long while .	4013
1	came here on a busy friday lunch for the ayce with 2 other coworkers . overall we were quite satisfied with our meal , all of our orders were very accurate . the rolls were a nice size , seaweed salad was good , tempura and sauce were excellent and also enjoyed the skewers . what i thought were below average were the sushi pizza and some of the grilled meat . it was okay , but not a fan of the sauce they used . it was a tad too sweet . good experience overall and would recommend anyone looking for an ayce in that area .	4014
1	a great lunch spot for ayce japanese . much bigger selection and variety than other ayce places . even non-sushi lovers will find items on the menu they 'll like . just do n't come too late into the lunch hour as all the tables get taken quickly . have n't been there for dinner but i hear they also serve sashimi at that time .	4014
1	let me just echo one word : deeeeliiciouusss . the sushi was fresh and the kitchen food was so yummy . the interior of this place was really nice and the service was really fast . as for the price , its affordable . i paid for an ayce ; $ 14.99 + tax which was worth it . overall , my first experience was awesome and i 'll definitely come back . tip : come early because when i came around 12 , it was so packed already .	4014
1	geat food , especially braun rice sushi !	4014
1	this place never disappoints everytime i come here for their ayce . it is my number 1 , to-go , ayce sushi restaurant . i would recommend this place . sashimi is usually fresh . quality is always on point . my olde faithful .	4014
1	a lil bit pricey compares to other ayce , but the food is well worth it . fresh fish , crispy tempura with just right amount of breading , fast and friendly service , huge selection of food for dinner . one of my favorite places in the city !	4014
1	came here this past weekend with a large group for the ayce dinner . the service was great and food was delicious . will definitely come back here for my next bout of ayce ! ( also the fact that they have brown rice sushi is an added bonus )	4014
1	great spot for a nice dinner date ! everything was super fresh and tasty , their staff is amazing and really nice . we arrived early ( around 6pm ) and we got a table right away but by the time we left there was a pretty lineup ( they do take reservations ! ! ) we had their ayce and paid around $ 80 ( dinner for two and three beers ) . my bf and i always fill up on sushi really fast so i do n't think we got our money 's worth of food , next time we 'll order from the menu .	4014
1	awesome ayce - my fave in the city . first of all , the service is good - sometimes they forget a roll , but they are generally friendly and helpful and do n't give you attitude about their mistakes . the sushi is delicious , the fish is fresh , they have some fun rolls i have n't seen before , and the price is very , very right . they generally do groups really well , even though it 's a small place . the only thing is that the menu does n't actually have descriptions of all the sushi on the ordering card - but hey , it 's an adventure that way .	4014
1	my wife would give it a solid 5 star , cause she doesnt eat much red meat but for me it is one of the best part of the japanese kitchen . the service there is better than an avarage sushi place . selection of food is just good enough . only one thing is missing for me that is the red meat that they use is not that great but other than that thay are simply one of the best sushi place in toronto .	4014
1	after trying a few different sushi spots near the yonge & eg area , i can say that this is my favourite . the sushi is very fresh and the staff are friendly . my boyfriend and i came here on a thursday evening and the place was very busy . luckily we got a seat right away but others had to wait for a table . the menu had everything you could expect from a sushi restaurant and food came quickly . if you 're looking for a new sushi joint i would recommend giving this spot a try !	4014
1	definitely enjoyed the ayce menu . decent selections , a bit over priced but seems to be around the going rate . only negative thing i had to say was the waiter took my menu and ayce menu away after our first order , had to ask for it back . other then that , would return .	4014
0	i feel this place is a bit over-rated and has good ratings because this area lacks good sushi . the ayce menu offers mainly sushi rolls and maki , because of this we felt like a lof their dishes was packed with rice . we parted just a little bit of the rice out and the manager came over and scolded us . i understand why she may be upset , but really no need to scold your customers . she tells us `` rice is the same price as sashimi '' and she will charge us for that . this was half way into our meals and we lost our appetite , so we just paid and left .	4014
0	i went for ayce lunch for $ 15.99 . food came out promptly . everything was below average . the rice tasted completely unseasoned and plain . fish was not particularly fresh . tempura was soggy . beef and chicken skewers had textures of dried meat . seaweed salad was too salty . epitome of fast food sushi .	4014
0	honestly do n't understand why this place has a 4 star rating . poor service and medicre sushi . sashimi was still frozen , if you have sensitive teeth it will bother you with every bite . pricey for it 's quality . came here on a sunday evening for ayce dinner - 28.99 each .	4014
0	really dont understand the good reviews ? miso soup was way too salty ... which is weird since it tastes like the powdered kind so i do n't get how you mess up following the instructions for making it ? specialty maki rolls were big which is fine , but had too much rice and i think the rice may have been over cooked because chewing a piece of the roll felt like chewing a big ball of gum or mochi ... . only thing going for this place is its low price . $ 10 for lunch set of miso soup , salad and two maki rolls ( dynamite and tuna )	4014
0	i got all you can eat for $ 30 . there was a large variety of food which was good . however , the food ranged from alright to good - nothing exemplary . servers were nice . my only complaint is their menu : in the pan-fried section they have a dumpling option . the dumplings provided by these menu option are in no way pan fried unless they decided to not turn on the heat for the stove . that would be okay but they insisted that we pay for the food . i disagree with this sort of customer service and ca n't give it more than 2 stars .	4014
0	used to go to this place often for all you can eat . we really liked it back then . but we came here last night for dinner with a couple of friends and this place has really gone down hill . the dynamite roll and beef enoki mushroom wraps were both bland . the spider roll was disgusting and it was cold . this was one if the only sushi restaurants we only go to . unfortunately , this last visit left a disgusting taste in our mouths . sadly , we wo n't be going here anymore .	4014
0	terrible , the food is not fresh . they offer lots of side dish and failed in main dish . i ordered spicy chicken and i can barely find actual chicken in it .	4014
0	new to the area . read the reviews and went for an ayce . out of everything we ate . snow roll was tasty . everything else mundane . not to mention all the hot food came barely warm and fried items like tempura and fried banana was soggy and cold . quite dissapointed with the food . especially for the price point service was pretty decent and didnt have to wait much	4014
0	i really do n't understand why people say this is the best ayce sushi in the city . the sushi came out super fast , which is awesome , but the service was subpar and the food was just okay . the rolls i had were bland and made with way too much rice , which i hate to see ayce places do . i think it 's dishonest , in a way , to fill people up with inexpensive rice so they 'll order fewer rolls . i left this restaurant pretty full , but not very satisfied .	4014
0	well my review wo n't make any difference to anybody wanting to stuff themselves with farmed fish sushi for $ 30 but the owner appeared very grumpy , ( it all comes from the top ) the place was full of young folks coming for a deal and the sushi was average . worst sushi pizza ever , sloppily rolled sushi and i felt as though i was in a factory . shrimp tempura was good but teeny tiny . avoid this place unless you 're super cheap with low sushi standards .	4014
0	worst japanese food i 've had in toronto . ordered the chirashi as i do when i try out a new sushi restaurant . you can tell how fresh their fish is as well as the taste , texture , and consistency of their sushi rice when ordering this dish . fail on all accounts . run by non-japanese .	4014
0	oh man . after reading all the yelp and google reviews i was honestly expecting a whole lot more . this place is what i would describe as very , very average . went for a saturday lunch and the service was ho hum . the sushi was average . the ambiance was average . the teriyaki and tempura items were actually very good though . all in all , not worth driving in for . if you live on the subway line , might as well . otherwise save your time and money .	4014
1	wonderful local establishment ! i have enjoyed many a meal here and have never had poor service or food ... and quite often have an extraordinary one . the menu is simple with a variety of daily specials . your first trip you should indulge in their stuffed french toast . go early or on a weekday as the weekend wait can be lengthy . take a few people , have a mimosa , and have a convivial time .	4015
1	this is my favorite famous toastery location . the inside is warm and inviting , the way a breakfast spot should be . the coffee is awesome and the menu is extensive . this is a great spot for lunch too ! lots of wraps that are very filling .	4015
1	toast cafe is my long time favorite . i wish the tables were a bit bigger simply because i am very tall . it 's cozy and every meal reminds me of home ! sad that they no longer serve dinner ! highly recommend the left coast blt	4015
1	do not get the breakfast quesadilla if you do n't like corn . sausage gravy is amazing . great service and you can alter the menu and drink alcohol for brunch . amanda is awesome . i like the country benedict with avocado . yummy ! ! !	4015
1	visiting davidson college and stopped in for lunch . great chicken caesar wrap and juicy hamburger . busy at lunch time , but still fast service and a great lunch . love the atmosphere .	4015
1	the food it great ! the people are really funny , they joke with with you ! the food usually comes out fast ! everything i have eaten there it delicious ! my top three is definitely the french toast , pancakes , and waffles . the only thing is while i was visiting nc we went to this restaurant for breakfast 4 times . i order chocolate milk each time . the first time they gave me a large chocolate milk . the other 3 times they gave me a small one even after i ordered a large . but this place it on if the best breakfast places i have ever been !	4015
1	love the food , the ambiance , the servers , but the pricing is just double what it should be in some cases . the price point is n't justified .	4015
1	we enjoy the urban feel of this little restaurant in quaint downtown davidson , nc . the best breakfast in the area , plus the staff is the friendliest and entertaining . chris , our favorite waiter , is a stand up comedian , keeps us laughing . mat gives a show when he sets up the table . great dining experience .	4015
1	toast gives me the feels . always coming in strong with the herb omelettes . keep up the good work	4015
1	recently had breakfast here while i was in town . sat outside with our 3 dogs . had a lovely , hot breakfast in a timely manner . waiters were friendly and quick to service our table . this was one of the only places where i ordered scrambled eggs that came out light and fluffy like a scrambled egg is supposed to be . no rubbery eggs or bacon here ! the french toast was also deliciously sweet and tasted fresh . if i lived in the area i would go back every weekend !	4015
0	we went with about 6 people and sat outside on the patio underneath the tree . the outside patio was really nice and it is located near downtown davidson . for us ... that was about all of the positives . service was very slow , our waiter confused our drink order . i got the stuffed french toast with strawberries and cream cheese . it was all cream cheese - a big goop of cream cheese with a little bread and a few strawberries is not what i had in mind . others ordered breakfast food like the eggs benedict and and omelet - no one was impressed . overall disappointed in the meal . most likely will not return .	4015
0	waited for twenty minutes and finally left . worst service ever . thanks for ruining my morning . wo n't ever go back- will remind my patients and everyone i talk to that you guys suck will be a problem	4015
0	usually just being there is a good experience but today was an exception . manager ( female ) was very rude , arrogant & controlling towards the 5 in our party . we were there 8 am & well before traffic & sat where we usually did but brought in an extra/new customer . question to manager : was getting 1 extra seat out of your rearranging worth offending 5 people ? have been going in there regularly on sunday mornings for several years now but as there are now other places to go for sunday breakfast , we will not come here so often . love the servers & food but manager could use a personality upgrade ! !	4015
0	from cincinnati ... expecting the french toast like from vitor 's ... only got toasted bread with jam . so disappointing	4015
0	slow kitchen ! we 've been coming here for years and the past two times , it has taken about 40 minutes to get our food after ordering .	4015
0	okay ... so the food is good but not good enough to warrant the excessive wait times and chaotic name taking process . my biggest gripe is the constant confusion going on at the front of the house . it 's just enough of a turn off not to go back . the 'tude you have to work through just to get a table ai n't worth a super yummy sausage biscuit .	4015
0	food was ok ( had breakfast ... none of our dishes were anything to write home about ) . food alone would have garnered 3 stars . issue with our visit was that staff seemed more interested in turning our table than our dining experience . met a friend of my wife 's who she has not seen in 10 years & felt like we were getting the bum 's rush from the minute we sat down .	4015
0	least favorite famous toastery around . the hostess was rude and somehow he managed to be our waiter as well and rushed us when taking our order . will not be going back to this location . poor management !	4015
0	had a three egg omelet , with onions , smoked sausage and cheddar cheese . lots of onions , very little sausage and hardly any cheese . very disappointing ! the grits were like soup , also disappointing . a $ 10.00 breakfast and you only get one slice of toast ? ? ? i do n't believe the omelet was made with fresh eggs . the coffee was good !	4015
0	least favorite famous toastery around . the hostess was rude and somehow he managed to be our waiter as well and rushed us when taking our order . will not be going back to this location . poor management .	4015
1	great find in toronto ! wish there were more places like this everywhere . lots of awesome cider choices . kaleb was very helpful in answering questions , and helping pick out ciders for flights . got to meet kyle , the owner as well . very knowledgeable and friendly . if you find yourself anywhere near cider house , definitely stop in . cheers !	4016
1	this is my favourite place for craft ciders . lots of variety , many of which i had never tried . highly recommend the whisky cider , by far the best one ! i gave it four stars because i found the food to be meh for me . their butter chicken was almost like a pub style , it was a bit greasy for me .	4016
1	after an uneven start ( some of the bad reviews are from that time ) the cider house has settled into an excellent local restaurant , especially if you like cider . the burgers are great , the cod cakes are fantastic and the indian style poutines are delicious winter fare .	4016
1	amazing food ! best butter chicken.. also great service i can with the whole family and we all enjoyed it ! fresh food	4016
0	wife was super excited about this place ; she loves cider . i was keen to try the clam chowder . they did n't have any . was planning on following that up with beef schnitzel ; only chicken available . the chicken was great ! unfortunately i had to share it with my wife as she deemed her butter chicken to be close to inedible . i had a spoon of it , very runny sauce . the ciders were a hit , but virtually very little else was .	4016
0	had the wings with their homemade sauce , tasted like watery salsa . the poutine with peas was bland . took over 30 minutes for meal to arrive . the waitress did work very hard and mentioned that there would be a wait . will not be returning , overpriced food .	4016
0	want to love and support it , but ca n't ( yet ) . we went for valentine 's day . this was a great night to wow the neighbourhood as a new place . not enough servers , very on/off service . no special feeling at all - just another bar night . no offer of a dip for wings . the food was very salty - especially the caesar salad with no croutons and the chopped up addition of radicchio . after two drinks , both my husband and i woke with splitting salt/additive headaches and wo n't be going back . love the concept , but they need to change a few things to succeed .	4016
0	cider house has been open about a month and already it 's mobbed by the destination dining crowd . office birthday parties , etc , which is good for them but they do n't really seem up to it . server was worked off her feet , providing good but minimally friendly service . i had a pommies on tap which was fine but i probably would have enquired about something more exotic if i had n't felt so rushed . ordered a seafood chowder which was fresh but almost completely bland - more milk flavour than seafood . i wo n't be going back anytime soon .	4016
1	nice price for dinner & lots of sushi options . i would like to go back !	4017
1	we found our new buffet ! we used to only go to crazy buffet because hubby wants sashimi , but since this place has it , we 'll come here instead . it 's newer and closer than crazy buffet . the food is pretty much on par with most other buffets , as far as taste goes . i got my buffet for free because it was my birthday , and i think dinner price is around 12 bucks . we 'll be back !	4017
0	my son wanted to try this place . i said , `` the yelp reviews are n't very good . '' i should have listened to what i read ! the place is nice looking and clean ; however , we wanted to eat . the food was very disappointing . when you think of a buffet you think , `` i 'm going to stuff myself ! '' and `` i 'm going to eat more than i paid ! '' not this time . i ate very little as nothing looked very good and it tasted worse . we will not be going back .	4017
0	i liked the previous buffet . this one was nasty . there was a lot of food but i did n't like any of it . and i 'm no snob , i 'm normally an equal-opportunity food lover ! the lo-mein is soggy and the `` orange chicken '' tastes nothing like orange chicken and was sitting in a couple inches of watery substance . i would take panda express over this place any day !	4017
1	i had a peppercorn prime rib sandwich here that i can not get out of my mind . make sure you get it on wheat bread because you know ... healthy . the service : well , no one that works here is in any rush . the parking is a bit of a pain due to the high volume of people going to starbucks next door . the store is very empty but there is never any outdoor seating because all the starbucks customers are sitting in the quizno seats .	4019
1	i ate her for the first time a few weeks ago . i 've been back like 6 times since then ! i am hooked on the prime rib dip : ) fast and clean and they also had a groupon going around .	4019
0	quiznos is not a place i frequent . the prices are high for sandwiches ! but it was wet and cold the other day and i wanted some soup so i stopped in . i ordered a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup and a small italian sandwich . i also added a drink and the total was around $ 10 bux . the sandwich was a decent size for a small and was filling . the soup however , was bland . even salt and pepper did n't help much . it tasted watered down and not good . i would go back here again maybe for a sandwich but not soup .	4019
0	i 've never been a fan of quizno 's and this location in particular is n't great . the service is always subpar . when we approach the counter i always feel like i 'm bothering them . they barely utter a word of greeting and ca n't seem to be bothered to even crack a smile or ask if we 're ready to order . on every occasion i have been here i have to start the interaction which is a little annoying . we came here recently because i 'm a groupon addict and i just ca n't seem to resist . i 'll stick to firehouse subs and subway in the area instead .	4019
1	kiry has been amazing , she knows what i like and always does a great job ! i 've been coming here for about a year now . it 's very convenient to where i live . tina does my toes and is mindful of my sensitive toes . she does a deluxe pedi that is relaxing and leaves your feet very smooth . i got my toes done with white diamond which is gorgeous . i recommend that for a wedding or special occasions or to just dazzle your feet .	4020
1	love this place ! staff is very accommodating , talented , and focused on customer service . they put the customer first and will always make sure you are happy before you leave . plus they do the best damn designs in las vegas !	4020
1	before relocating i attending this salon for 3+ years . it 's an amazing place , extremely caring and nice owners . this salon has gone through some changes in the last year but what business does n't have its ups and downs . i never had issues but i noticed the 1 stars ... if you have issues with a nail tech speak up and let the mgmt or owner know so , they may fix it . do n't give a business 1 star , hurting their business without personally speaking up directly to the person in charge . i know this salon will be back on track soon ... they always have been .	4020
1	i really love this place , laurie is amazing ! i also love the atmosphere , everyone is so nice ! they def make you feel at home .	4020
0	tina and the staff had great friendly customer service . however , wished that kind of quality could have translated onto the the gel manicure and pedicure . after leaving the shop and having a closer look in better lighting , the pedicure polish was dried uneven and already chipped as well had indentation in the polish . never had i had a problem with past salons before . in addition , my gel manicure with just a choice of 1 color , nothing fancy , was settled unevenly and the borders were messy . nice people . customer service is great , but def improvement in the quality service is needed .	4020
0	did n't feel like they did such a great job the last two times i 've gone back . one of my nails chipped two days later and the rhinestones were n't what i was expecting . really disappointed and i paid $ 75 . not coming back again .	4020
0	came here few years ago . older lady did my pedi . cut too short it was bleeding ! felt bad . i did n't say anything . but i got light headed . room was spinning . i start sweating . i showed another lady my bleeding toe . all she did was put some green liquid on it . i still tipped . felt bad for the old lady	4020
0	this is the worst salon . first off they past you around from one technician to another . i paid $ 65.00 plus 20 % tip . to have one nail break in two days a second nail break a week later . they did a horrible job on my pink and whites . i asked for tuxedo style , which only about four of my nails truly came out to be tuxedo style , the rest just look weird . i will never go there again i 'd rather not wear nails again in my life before going here .	4020
1	loved the facility and the staff . after living in az for 10 years i have had trouble finding a dentist i actually liked . today i went in for a teeth cleaning and had a pleasant experience .	4021
1	best dentist office i 've ever been in and that 's saying a lot considering i 've lived in 3 states and have been to a lot of different offices . the staff was extremely nice , the office is very clean , decorated beautifully and they were very accommodating . i really appreciated how thorough they were with me as well .	4021
1	such wonderful staff ! almost made the experience enjoyable ! i hate going to the dentist , but i do n't mind it as much here . they are always encouraging . thanks dr v & yolanda !	4021
1	i absolutely love this dental office . dr. v is incredible , compassionate , and honest . she takes the time to listen to you and makes you feel like she really cares about you and not just the money . i would highly recommend this place to anyone who lives in phoenix . her staff is awesome too . i would never go any where else but here . thanks for caring and understanding when a patient is really confused about their treatment plan . you really made my visit today comforting and making me feel i made the right decision . thanks again for everything .	4021
0	cleaning was great but the wait was ridiculous . got here at 12:40 pm and at 1:57 was just told that the dentist would be 15 more minutes . do n't come on a lunch break people .	4021
0	had some fillings & a crown last may done and one of the fillings is now lose and causing pain . they want me to pay again to fix the same tooth in less than one year because i did not have them clean my teeth in the last 6 months . just another way to get more money .	4021
0	never made it to see dr. mattern due to poor office staff . spoke to one receptionist last week , who took my name and demographics , insurance details , and information associated with the last dental office in order to obtain films and prior records . called surprise office again today to confirm past records had been received and to schedule my appointment . after speaking to two different staff who had no idea what i was talking about and could not locate my records or my insurance information , i did n't feel comfortable going to an office that was n't very organized and did n't follow through .	4021
0	lifetime is not really lifetime here . poor quality work and poor service . my wife and i both had trouble with the work performed here . cost is very high in more than one way .	4021
1	the restaurant doubles with tim 's . pretty decent burgers . i do however find they salt their fries a bit to much good point the use sea salt and not far from home . still better quality burger than mcdonalds at least i think and trio less than a big mac trio . service at this restaurant always been friendly .	4022
1	i love wendy 's ! not to mention the cashier that took my order was such a sweetheart . when i want wendy 's , i sometimes go out of my way to come to this one ... do n't judge me . : )	4022
0	driest , most burned hockey puck of a burger i ever saw was from here . mushy tomatoes and cold all around , plus they 'forgot ' half the order even though she confirmed over the intercom ... finally , we did n't get a receipt - that 's illegal in this country here ! do n't go to this embarrassment to the franchise .	4022
0	wendy 's is my favorite fast food chain but this one i will avoid at all costs . my mistake was heading out as they were closing but it 's no excuse for serving flat come with no ice . the fries did not come with ketchup , i just assumed they would put them in the bag , i barely are them since they had a weird taste . last and least was the double burger which was a soggy mess . the bread could barely contain the meat and i had to eat it piece by piece . get there much earlier than midnight to be able to complain in person if you get subpar food and service .	4022
1	short lines , fairly empty , pricey but everyone knows albertson 's is ! the plus is that they have a drive thru pharmacy that is empty-no lines=good , good !	4023
1	the store was clean and very well organized . we were able to find all of our groceries with no problem all of the employees that we ran into smiled and we had great customer service .	4023
1	there are definitely better places to grocery shopping such as cisco , sam 's club or winco , but i like going here just because it 's close . albertsons has really good produce a meat unlike some of the cheaper stores . what i do n't like about albertsons is the prices are too high .	4023
1	better than most albertsons in nearby henderson . the employees are genuine and the selection is usually good , with a clearance section that usually has quite a few items . the location is great , within a strip mall and across the street from cvs .	4023
1	chase is absolutely amazing ! i went in to buy a patio set and he made it quick an easy . actually all of the male employees were great ! there were about 7 guys that helped me out to my car . i didnt have to do any lifting . i have never had service like that before . i highly recomend this albertsons . they truely care	4023
0	this used to be a great store when it did n't have to accommodate the whole town+tourists driving thru . i miss having a second grocery store and i especially miss vons . albertsons has become constantly crowded and busy and way overpriced . i used to know all the checkers but now they have like 175 employees i do n't recognize anyone . if you only have to run in for a couple things i would recommend going late at night so you do n't have to wait in line forever . if you have a whole weeks a shopping to do , do yourself a favor and go to henderson.. winco , smiths or walmart .	4023
0	overpriced , dirty , and impossible to find the cold drink fridge - it 's actually where the entrance is on the corner . the florist department is trying to charge $ 9.95 for a candy bouquet using 10 `` fun sized '' candy bars . grrrl puhleeze .	4023
0	the customer service sucks , all of the employees are rude and talk instead of do their jobs it 's pretty bad when you have 1 item and it takes you 20 minutes to get through the checkout	4023
0	while the prices are better than haggans . the service is horrible . i went to buy eggs and this trashy employee was bent over showing her butt crack and a huge thong . i 'm sorry but pull up your pants and be professional . the staff here is rude and unprofessional . the only things this store has going for it is decent prices and janet in the pharmacy . she is amazing and professional , i just wish i could say the same thing about the rest of the staff .	4023
0	shopped here for years because they were much better than the other grocery store in town , vons . the vons closed due to another story of corporate corruption of which albertsons was a part . since then , shelves are not properly stocked or faced , expired items everywhere , light burned out , and floors dirty . i usually drive down the hill to smiths now . sad .	4023
1	i ordered three of the dollar 69 tacos and ended up being able to make 6 tacos out of three tacos . they were very good with sour cream and guacamole with lime over them they were so good and filling	4024
1	oscar is hot and a good chef.. 5 stars ! always my fave place for carne asade fries at 3 am drunk ... : love it	4024
1	4 stars for 70 cent tacos all day wednesday ... would give it 5 if that was the price all the time . even tho the promised pastor has n't actually been available the 2x i 've visited ... the carnitas is good enough . buche also an option but i 'm not a huge fan of it . 4.56 after tax for 4 tacos and a pretty good small horchata . keep in mind this good review is for 2 p.m. food . i would guess the 2 a.m. food is a totally different story .	4024
1	amazing tacos , fast and easy , and service was super nice . wednesday 's are the best - $ .80 ca n't be beat !	4024
1	love the lengua tacos and it 's only $ 1.99 each ! one of the best tacos i 've ever had . the place is clean & the service is good .	4024
1	i 've only tried the bean burritos and they are delicious and huge ! half will fill you up ! open 24 hour and polite staff .	4024
1	went here while my sister was getting a tattoo a few blocks down . pretty ghetto area but delicious tacos . we went with the standard asada tacos and they were the perfect little palm-sized munchies overstuffed with steak , white onion and cilantro	4024
1	we came here by accident last night when we could n't find tacos el gordo . i have never heard of this place nor do i live around this area but damn those were good quesadillas ! and the staff was super friendly and chill at 4am ! they do charge a dollar for credit card transaction which i did n't realize until today but oh wells ca n't beat friendly customer service !	4024
0	not sure how they stay in business and do a huge business . food is either salted for a survival journey or flavorless . the sauces are hit and miss and they seem to lean towards better servixe to nonenglish speakers . been there 4 times in 12 years never good . i forget and go back .	4024
0	the food we ordered was very uncooked and was near edible . chicken in my burrito was pink ! ! the fries in my carne asada fries were soggy and the meat was horrible ! unsatisfying experience	4024
0	this location is horrible , i walked in and ordered 4 tacos with meat and cheese only . the tacos came out 5 minutes later and the food was not even cooked . i asked the lady what she just served me and she laughed . i almost lost my cool because it took 30 mins to issue a refund for $ 12 in tacos , i am fed up & disgusted	4024
0	whelp , i finally made a food mistake . i came here . carne asada fries . undercooked hard grease soaked fries . ground paste beef . definitely not carne asada . definitely not stomach friendly . i returned it to the counter after two bites . absolutely unsafe tasting food for a hungry after work bite .	4024
0	make sure to check your receipt . the cashier charged me 9 dollars for a 6 dollar burrito.when i asked her about it she tried to tell me it was because of takes . then because of a soda then finally she said it was just extra that day . and also the food is basic at best.try tacos el gordo or pepe 's instead save your self the hassle and disappointment.if you want great food stay away from here .	4024
0	i ordered a carne asada burrito and it was n't good at all . the beef and rice tasted like they been under the light the whole morning . the food was n't fresh at all . i 'm very disappointed since i 've been craving a burrito for a while and this place did n't meet the expectations .	4024
0	this restaurant is by far the worst ! ! ! ! ! food was extremely greasy ! ! ! oil was left on the table from under the asada nachos plate ! $ 46 went straight to the trash as food was sooo nasty and greasy ! ! !	4024
0	by far the worst establishment i have ever been in to eat tscos . the meat was overcooked . the place dirty and the customer service a joke . would not recommend this place . recommend the one on sahara . unfortunately the on trop has closed . stay away from this location .	4024
1	huge dim sum fan here ! ! i have been craving for a descent dim sum place in mtl for a while . red ruby , kam fung brossard n chinatown ... .all meh and do n't really like them . i used to like crystal before the big fire next door , they used to have very freshly made dim sum , a la carte . now the new resto does n't look as nice and they push carts instead of ordering , but the dim sum were good size n yummy . its a little bit pricier than other places , but worth the money	4025
1	i enjoyed it ! the dim sum was flavorful and huge . the trays they come in are cute ! the interior is also nice and clean .	4025
0	my first time having dim sum and i was hoping to taste some really yummy food . unfortunately it was n't quite what i was expecting . i ca n't name the food i had since it was so hard to understand what the staff was saying . basically , crab and seaweed roll , a vegetable spring roll and some asian brocoli . the food was extremely oily and heavy leaving me with a tummy ache . i am glad i finally tried dimsum and can really say that it 's not for me .	4025
0	je suis retourné à l'impériale pour aller au dim sum . la rapidité du service n ' a malheureusement pas changé . il y n'avait pas beaucoup de serveurs et de chariots de nourriture . bien que les mets étaient bon , la gestion du restaurant demeure toujours un problème .	4025
1	a very nice lounge . not too busy , plenty of decent seats . well managed and nicely furnished .	4026
1	one of the best united clubs i 've been to in the us . while it is smaller than the rest ( newark , houston , san fran , etc . ) , it is fully stocked and very clean . ambiance is welcoming and comforting . all the staff are kind and generous . no rushing people around like at newark . i actually felt like an elite member of a club , as opposed to the clubs at the united hubs , since those are flocked with randoms .	4026
1	i flew into the a gates - it is a long walk to the d gates to avoid going out of security . you just keep going until you find a train to the d gates . then up and to the right . it was nice , clean , and friendly employees . busy , but not crowded . they had cheese and crackers , carrots and ranch , cookies , and snack mix , yogurt raisins , goldfish .	4026
0	very meh . cheese and crackers , with no crackers . no deli meats out like other clubs . soup but no soup bowls . staff is friendly , but not a real attention to detail here . cool view of the airport . it would be nice if they had a section that was dark so i could enjoy the city lights , because it was nothing but glare off the inside of the windows . seating area is crammed with a bunch of tables , like a food court at the mall . overall , not that impressed .	4026
0	a lot like this airline , the united club is a total disaster . it 's an overpriced money grab , and what do you get in return ? low flow faucets . busted latches on restroom stalls dirty furniture and carpeting an animal-like food trough with bird seed and crackers a bar that just rips off its members . a true shame what they did to this place since it opened as a president 's club .	4026
0	mike w is the worst customer service rep i 've ever seen within united . normally , united reps are very nice and realize who the customer is ... not mike ... he 's there from 9-5 and does not acknowledge 1k / significant customers . he does n't realize his job was created because of customers . his favorite word with a smirk is `` no ''	4026
1	the food was good and affordable for the first time being their also great customer service they be seeing me soon too thanks also they play good music it 's poppin ' to if you 're not picky about pho try it out i like it	4027
1	i can eat pho everyday . that being said , i can cook pho . while we are in vegas , it was cold so we went to find pho and i ca n't tell you how often i 'm disappointed with other restaurants pho but not here . their pho broth here has the least msg taste . let me emphasize that it 's extremely rare for me to like other people pho , so i highly recommend their pho here . my 5 stars is purely for the food . service and other things have room for improvement	4027
1	i 'm from oc california . ca n't compare but this place is good enough . the best part is they have red pepper flake chili oil .	4027
1	came here to try the pho and i was not disappointed ! ordered the chicken pho and it had good flavors . the portion size is huge . the service however is very slow .	4027
1	ok , i take it back . the san gabriel valley and orange county are not the only places in the southwestern us with great vietnamese food . the combo banh mi blows away most of the sgv ones . the bread ! wow ! seafood combo pho is a 5-star item too : complex broth , super fresh calamari , and not too much salt . oh , speaking of fresh , i was teasing our server , asking him if he had to go dig up the bean sprouts in the back yard . freshest ones i 've ever had ! so , yes , five stars .	4027
1	the pho was great and the soup had a great flavor . spring rolls are awesome . recommend to everyone	4027
1	wowww the pho here is so good . i 'd say it 's better than east coast pho in general . broth is on point , plenty of meat and good portions . thai iced tea was good as well as the spring rolls . what a find ! well deserving of 5 stars .	4027
1	this place really surprised me . i was expecting good phó due to really good reviews . i must say this place is a must try ! the broth was really delish and hot . the egg rolls were freshly made . the chicken phó is a great alternative if you do n't eat red meat . again 5 our if 5	4027
1	all i can say is wow ! the morning after a night of going hard on the strip i knew i needed pho ... .good pho glad i had been recommended pho 90 this place has some of the best broth i have ever had period , and the service is a++ . i could n't finish the large bowl , which is the size i always order . also the grilled pork spring rolls where excellent	4027
1	our server my is the best , she made sure we had water every 5 minutes and gave us great service . very friendly and the area is clean . came here for a late dinner crave and glad i chose to come here instead of the place next door . the food was delicious and gave us foodgasms lol i would definitely recommend this place and try the grilled bbq pork vermicelli or # 01 the pho is also good . we all ordered smoothies with jello and the green tea is out of this world . i 'm definitely coming back here for more ! the prices are perfect and it 's a nice quiet place to come with friends for lunch or dinner .	4027
1	omg amazing food ! a few minutes drive off the strip but so worth it . i tried b1 ( vermicelli noodles with bbq pork and egg rolls ) . we were told this would take 10 mins to be prepared as the pork is made fresh to order . and it was worth the wait - the bbq pork was delicious . i ordered an extra portion on the side . along with an extra portion of the egg spring rolls . the pork banh mi was gorgeous . fresh ingredients and crunchy baguette . the pho was exceptional too . and to top it all off , the service was fantastic . i 'll be going back soon for more !	4027
1	food was great ! service was excellent ! my sever kevin was very considerate to my sea food and peanut allergy and even changed the music for my liking ! definitely recommend this place ! ! alcohol coming soon for this fantastic place	4027
1	i think this is the absolute best bowl of pho i have ever had . the smell was amazing and the flavor did not disappoint . the noodles were perfect both in consistency & portion size . i got the steak & brisket option ( i 'm not very adventurous with my beef ) and i could not be happier i came here over the other options .	4027
1	first time here and a must try ! it 's a little small but it 's super clean and the staff is super welcoming . i ordered a small chicken pho and let me just say , this place has probably gives you the most meat which i am so happy about : ) my brother ordered a p1 and he was super happy with it too . we also ordered the shrimp fried rice and its probably one , if not the best , fried rice ive had at a viet restaurant . the service was super good too ! will definitely be back : )	4027
1	we went here around 10am on a saturday morning and got sat immediately for a table of 4 ppl . pho , com thit nuong , & banh thit nuong all were very good . the only thing about this place was a little long to get the food . small place and nothing special .	4027
1	great pho and very nice staff ! they have a kid 's size bowl available and it looked like enough for an adult .	4027
1	super good broth , excellent flavor . prices and sizes of pho have changed from yelp pics of the menu , but still totes worth it . trying the sammies next time . 10/10 will return !	4027
1	very decent pho located in chinatown . i 've been to several of pho joints in chinatown and this one actually taste good . it 's sad , but true , pho in vegas , quality ca n't compared to the ones in so cal , but pho 90 somehow come close . been here twice , had their pho special , egg rolls , banh mi and bun . all tasted ok. service can be a little slow because there is only one server on the floor .	4027
1	pho is really good . i like it . i will come back soon from la .	4027
1	went there twice in a roll , very large portion of its signature bowl , can not finish at all . good taste , reasonable price , great services , a good choice for pho lovers .	4027
1	great and authentic pho . very reasonable price , far better than any fast food on stripe .	4027
1	this is actually , the only restaurant out of the hundreds i been , that i love the service , server my was amazing , food was great , we did n't have to wait that long , or called her to get more water , she was very friendly , i highly recommend this place , not only cause the food is great but the service also .	4027
1	the pho is what i consider healing . every time i feel like i 'm getting sick or a cold coming on pho 90 is there for me . i usually order two things : rare steak pho and curry chicken w/ rice plate . the curry chicken is a wonderful dish that is bursting with flavor . the pho never lets me down . excellent choice if you want to experience the healing powers of the pho .	4027
1	pho 90 is definitely a contender for best pho in vegas . they have the big noodle and its fresh and light . the soup is perfectly seasoned , not to salty . the meat is high quality . it cooks just right in the soup , not too chewy . in my 3yrs or trying vegas pho , this will be my new go to spot .	4027
1	nice clean restaurant . big portion . very delicious . courteous hosts . definitely will be back .	4027
1	there 's something different about the broth here that stands out . we ordered the chicken and beef pho soup . the first thing you 'll notice is the extreme clarity of the broth . there is a layer of grease , but that 's really gelatin from the bones and it 's actually very good for you . do n't season the soup with any hoison or siracha sauce . oh yeah , the soup tastes delicious too : - )	4027
0	who the f*** gave this place 5 stars ? i deleted my yelp app after trying this place out . food taste like s*** . yelp sucks donkey d*** lately with fake reviews . the lady took my order without writing it down . got my order wrong 2 times . the seafood pho my wife ordered looked like s*** . the pho tai i ordered was so f***** sweet , they told me it was full of msg . f**** disgusting and i 'm more disappointed at my fellow yelpers for reviewing this place as a 5 star . f***** pho nasty msg is what they should call this place .	4027
0	i agreed to this place because because of the yelp reviews but i regret it so much , they took forever to place our order when there was only two tables here . took about 40 mins to even get our food , i even overheard them say that they forgot about our food . let me again remind y'all that there was only two tables , including mine . the pho was salty . do n't believe the yelp reviews , go somewhere else .	4027
0	lady was very sweet she gave us a coconut drink for the inconvenience of a ugly critter come into our table & this nasty little cockroaches staring at our face . besides all that the food was just ok .	4027
0	bad place ! too greasy . it should be this way ! common sense take the white fatty part out of soup before serving it ! !	4027
0	food was ... . meh alright . they did n't offer any vegetables with pho though the spring rolls were great ( ca n't really screw up on that ) . refill of water never offered and the entrées came out one at a time ~15 minutes apart from each other . imo the banh mi cost too much compared to others that i have had elsewhere . i 'm sticking to viet noodle though it 's always nice to try other places .	4027
0	undeserving of the current 4+ star rating . food is n't horrible but is n't anything special . service was slow and inattentive for a near empty restaurant . be sure to check your pho order because you may be missing some meats ( ex . no tendon )	4027
0	customer services was horrible , she never came to the table asking how 's everything nor re fills on drinks , towards the end there was a bug supposedly a `` fly '' from what the host was saying , but it never flew ? ? never again	4027
0	this place was terrible . service and food came out pretty quickly but did not taste good.everything tasted like they half assedit the pho was bland they use instead powder for soup other dishes came out messy.bland and below average typical shady business . needless to say we will not be coming back the restroom was nasty it has a funky smell	4027
0	looking for a quick place to eat pho . mistake in coming here . the girl who took our order was unpleasant . and after she took our order she left , and so the new girl did n't know anything about our table . highly frustrating ! but marlix , the waitress who took over , was extremely kind , very friendly .	4027
0	this review has nothing to do with the food . i was not given a chance to try it . we ubered out to chinatown in hopes of late night pho , but were turned away at the door over an hour before the posted closing time . do n't advertise hours if you 're not going to stick to them .	4027
0	i found this place from yelp , the rating was great . we got the table , got water and order placed . 40 minutes passed by , i started to get really frustrated . we asked for food multiple times and the server confirmed that food will be ready shortly . another server came and asked us to confirm our orders . excuse me ? ? ! ! ! i could not believe what i just heard ... long story short , we did n't get our full orders , had to asked for vegetables for phos after we got noodles.. food was decent but the service , big question mark ...	4027
0	service was super slow . the server saw us but acted like he did n't acknowledge us . i had to go get the menu by myself after sitting there for 10 mins . took 30 mins for my food to be arrived . it was ok. do n't think i 'll come back .	4027
0	they prep there meat on the floor the kitchen is very dirty all there drink are powder not fresh fruit they lying to the customers the pho was suck	4027
0	one waitress on the floor with several tables . she forgot to bring the drink then asked her again but she did n't serve . so i walked to the counter one more time but she just work ignoring our drink . after we finished our soup , we were so thirsty then asked another guy then we got drink . so horrible service .	4027
0	wasted my lunch break waiting on my meal , i 'm not sure if the food is good because it took so long i was n't able to actually eat it	4027
0	probably the worst service i 've had in a long time . no greet when first walked in . server just gave us our menus and never came back . took another tables order that came in after us . we got up and left . this place needs to hire more servers .	4027
0	not good service . waiting 15 minutes . bun bo hue is horrible . they cook from instant power quoc viet bun bo hue .	4027
0	the positive : the food is good . but the service and wait time was ridiculous . at 10pm our table of 3 was one of two parties in the restaurant . we ordered and proceeded to wait for over 45min for a pho and two vermicelli bowls . they got one item wrong and realized it after we had waited 40min . so we proceeded to wait for one person 's food for well over an hour . ridiculous .	4027
0	i originally was going to give this place a nice review because our dine in experience was fairly good however we ordered a pho to go and when we got home to eat it found a mill worm in the pho ! i have never been so grossed out . immediately dumped out the rest . will not be returning .	4027
0	one person on the floor with full tables , skips taking order and forgets to bring us water . we had to waive her down to get her attention , also it 's been 30min since i 've been sitting here and our food is n't here yet . the waitress is a bit nutty , yea nutty , she forgot the tables and order numbers . i do n't know it 's horrible service and i have yet to taste the food .	4027
0	i placed an order on post mates , and when the food arrived it was awful , it was n't prepared the way i 've asked . i ordered the seafood wonton soup and they barely put any veggies and shrimp in the soup . food was also cold . the food can use a lot of improvement for sure ! !	4027
0	the food was disgusting nasty and big disappointment the pho has a lot of m s g the veg not fresh it old and stale and also i found hair in my food the smoothie drink not real fruit it is powder with a lot of sugar add to it i give this place a thumb down	4027
0	we ordered pho rare steak and beef chow . one would n't have guessed that considering the total amount of beef was less than a quarter ounce in both meals . no sauce provided for any meal . the pho had 1/2 in of oil in it . gross	4027
0	i been here a few times and it has been pretty good . however , it must have been an off day or the newness is wearing off . the pho was a little oilier than before and the veggies looked old . the hoisin and sriracha is either watered down or just old . i hope this was an off day , but who know . i plan on coming back again and hopefully it gets back to how it was when it first opened .	4027
0	worst pho spot ! ! their broth is flavorless and they gave me maybe four pieces of tripe . never going back !	4027
0	i saw this new restaurant with five star review and was excited to give it a try i really like vietnamese food . i ordered the clear noodles with pork and seafood . the soup was sweet , tasted like it was made with lots of sugar and msg . they priced it at $ 11.99 which is expensive for what you get especially when they use imitation crab meat . sorry but i can not recommend this place .	4027
1	i did n't have high hopes for dinner here . i was pleasantly surprised with the prime rib dinner and the service . service was excellent and prime rib was delish . the salad and veggies were a bit sad but overall a decent dinner for a fair price .	4028
1	excellent breakfast ! service is down home & friendly ! craps are super cheap , too . get there early !	4028
0	i came to try something new and this tiny cafe inside jokers wild casino seem to be a new option near my job , however i was disappointed from the moment i walked inn , poor costumer service , crowded ( 11 am ) and somehow rude costumer service , lack of communication and long wait for food.i got to see other costumers which seem to be regulars here and got a whole different type of service ( seniors most of them ) cashier was also host and just told me to go seat , waiter took about 5muns to come by.at the end i got my food and it was ok . i hope they can give a lil more attention to the costumers !	4028
0	the food is good but i did n't even get to eat it this time . i had visitors in town at my home and thought i 'd step out and get everyone omelets ( the chili cheese is good there ) . after waiting a standard amount of time for someone to help me i was told that they do not do to go orders before 11am on the weekends . that seems like a ridiculous policy in a city that 's always on the move . the staff is friendly , the food is above average , but this policy stinks .	4028
1	definitely the best barro 's location i 've been to ! ! it 's always consistent , clean , pleasant employees with great customer service ! they can be crazy busy and still be smiling and attentive . i usually get a veggie pizza , veggie salad or cheesy bread which has all been super bomb ! it 's nice to go here and watch a football game sometimes to take a break from the busy loud sunday football bars . i miss living in tempe and by this location ! no other ones compare .	4029
1	cheese bread app is amazing ! served with pizza sauce and puts me in mind of pizza hut taste but with fresh and fluffy crust ! garlicky and yummy ! ! the pizza was cheese and pep , really great -- not too spicy for the kids and we all loved it ! got one xl for 4 of us and had leftover . priced well too -- wish we had one of these back home !	4029
1	delivery is quick and fast . the drivers are always pleasant and friendly . the wait time is short on the phone . we order the mega meat , salad and breadsticks with cheese ... this loacatuon has the best crust and sauce to cheese ratio . when my sister and cousin come from the west valley they order from this barros coz they say my barros us better than theirs . we have also had wings and subs delivered at other times and it was also great !	4029
1	driving down borderline road , looking for something to eat , went pass this place and was tempted , after going another two miles or so we made a u-turn ( not sure if it was legal or not ) so ended up here and we 're very glade we decided on this place , the whole pizza is very good ! ( even at the crust part-which sometimes i do n't ) and i would come back here the next time we are in the tempe area !	4029
1	barros special pizza is the best . crust is delicious . the wings are big and meaty . i never liked wings before but these wings are fully cooked and not dried . i would highly recommend . the seating is kinda weird like a maze lol	4029
1	decent pizza with speedy service . they pile a lot of toppings on your pie , and if you like a lot of crust , this is your place ! the original crust itself is more on the doughy side and not super crispy . we had the special which was loaded with ham , pepperoni , onion , bell pepper , and mushroom . i 've had their wings as well and they are also decent .	4029
1	great food . we go about twice a month and are starting to notice that they have about a 2 1/2 to 3 inches of crust on the pizza . which means less cheese and pepperoni on the pizza . did not notice that in the beginning .	4029
1	this is the best place for pizza ! i do n't know what it is about barro 's but it 's irresistible . the place has a pretty nice atmosphere , it 's normally pretty quiet without the crazy hustle of a normal restaurant . personally i like it , it 's laid back . the lunch deals are really great ! slices/drink combos are cheap and the deals change by the day of the week . the wings here are really great as well ! great customer service , the girls at the counter are really helpful and patient . this is my go-to pizza place !	4029
1	absolutely delicious . here visiting from california and stumbled on this little gem . this is the best pizza i 've had in a long time . this place is now my # 1 pick for pizza when i come to az . awesome guys keep it up .	4029
1	love . love . love their gluten free pizza . they just have one size ( small ) about $ 12 . bbq wings are very good ( and big ) . fast delivery .	4029
1	if you want good service wonderful excellent pizza and wings and beer this is a place to go	4029
1	great pizza that has not changed since i worked at throne in rolling meadows 39 years ago . great pizza , great football coach , great family . hello to mike , ken and coach .	4029
0	food is amazing ... but this is the second time an employee has swept the floors around us literally flinging dirt in the air towards our food . first time i thought it was someone new and inexperienced but come on ! ! ! food service 101 people ! we 'll just have to take our food to go from now on ...	4029
0	not to be a jerk but when you order food to go you do not expect it to sit on the counter getting cold . seriously there are 3 to go orders sitting on the counter getti g cold . shame on management for allowing this and not following health dept regulations . prepared food is to be kept under warmers . we wont be ordering over the phone again for sure . *update* manager really needs to put a gag on the mouthy broad at the counter . because i brought this to the managers attention she had the audacity to call my son a prick . how ugly and disrespectful this staff is .	4029
0	pizza maybe good , but delivery sucks . and then when you call to check the status they say `` your on his list , just be soon '' . wth does that mean ? i asked for an eta . this happens everytime i get delivery and if this is anything like the other times , it will be cold . very frustrated ... ..and you ca n't order online . what pizza place does n't offer that ?	4029
0	we have had multiple order errors from this barros and tonight was the last . ordered delivery over two hours ago and the food was a no show . there are too many good pizza joints in the area to continue ordering from here	4029
0	really greasy and fattening . not even my stray cat that would eat literally anything wanted any . i actually kind of want to throw it up after eating it rather than gain 5lbs . when is it time for restaurants to have healthy food ? so much to ask ?	4029
0	worst customer service i 've ever experienced . we called in an order for delivery and they told us they did n't deliver to our area yet we live a mile away . when we came in the manager said `` we deliver , the girls just do n't know the area '' i 'll be sticking to other pizza options from now on .	4029
0	after ordering a pizza for delivery and the price was n't what we thought it was going to be ... we canceled our order . although afterwards a pizza showed up at our door which you made me and my roommate fight . she threatened to throw me out and we never put an order in neither did i give her a credit card number who her to run . they showed up with one pizza when we ordered two pizzas and wings how is that even possible ... . thanks love barro 's now i may be homeless just because of you	4029
0	wow . been going to barros for 15 years and never again . wife and i walked in for lunch , each carrying a baby . we asked an employee if we could get 2 high chairs . she then pointed to where those are kept , on the other side of the dining area . umm thx . so with baby in hand , i went and grabbed one.. took it to my wife so that she could put a baby down.. then grabbed the other one , which was missing a strap . i felt it would have been great if the employee had helped me . not very welcoming . i will buy pizza elsewhere from now on .	4029
0	i used to love their pizza . been eating it since i was 10 . and now they switch to pepsi . as mark cuban says , for that reason , i 'm out .	4029
0	do not order the ravioli ! the ravioli was stone cold in the center and was obviously store bought . i never send back food but they were really nice about it & served me wings instead . very nice atmosphere !	4029
0	i just picked up an order for a thin crust 2 item pizza . when i got home i could n't eat it because it was so salty . it tasted like somebody just took a salt shaker and opened up on the pizza . i will never eat here again .	4029
0	i 'm a visitor from out of town . tried to get them to deliver a pizza a total of 5 miles away and was told it was out of their delivery area . sad i got rejected but i 'm sure this review will make a statement . do n't offer to deliver if `` you ca n't deliver '' .	4029
1	kate spade is a fashion genius . she provides simple , elegant , and fun designs for women of all ages . kate spade is mainly famous for her simple and chic handbags and her cute shoes . kate spade has her own designer shop , but she is also sold in many retail shops around arizona . kate brings quality to everything she makes , but it comes with a steep price .	4030
1	maybe the selection is n't the biggest but the girl who either there was so sweet it made the entire experience awesome ! ! ! i 'm s fellow kate spade follower and get most of my bags from the soho location in new york but i love buying items in different states i visit !	4030
0	i had purchased some items out of town ( nyc boutique ) and when they shipped the pieces it was missing a gift box i needed . i came into my local store trying to simply get a gift box for the item . they would n't give me one and said it was $ 6.50 if i want it ... unbelievable ! the store manager was extremely rude as well . if you love kate spade just go buy it at nordstrom 's . avoid shopping here !	4030
0	went there today to buy a handbag and there was a good and bad . the bad , a worker named sam gave us attitude and acted like she was doing us a favor while the other worker ( her manager ) wanted to give us a discount on a bag ( 10 % ) she had something personal with us it seemed . will never go back if this girl still works there . bad business .	4030
1	reliable late night or lunch spot the past few times i 've been here or had food that my friends picked up . did n't run out of rice for the chicken teriyaki bowl , unlike some crappy spot on sunset at arroyo grande . check it out , service was pretty fast even at around 4:30 in the morning .	4031
1	great service there manager was awesome and accommodating . when my son 's friend felt ill and had to take his food to go he wrapped it up for us and was caring and considerate . he went above and beyond with customer service .	4031
1	ricky at the front counter he the most dope food taker the world i 'll highly recommend this jack in the box who ever is faded just saying	4031
1	recently started to make changes here , i 've lived in the area for about 2 years and had been here only like 3 times . they were all okay but overall unsatisfactory . have been back in the last month a couple times and it 's always been clean , everyone has been very nice , and the food has gotten more organized . it still tastes the same , but it 's a lot neater , burgers not falling apart , curly fries are n't cold and soggy . much better than ever before .	4031
1	norma is the best manager . we had a complicated order and she made it extremely easy . thanks norma !	4031
1	i had a coupon so i figured why not . i ordered an ultimate cheeseburger and it tasted really good . just the right amount of condiments . the rootbeer is just always better at jack in the box for some strange reason . at 1 dollar for any size soft drink ... why yes i would like a large , thank you . the order was completed quickly and accurately despite the fact that they were busy . its located in a weird spot , but if your on the move you can gas up and get a burger then hit the road .	4031
0	the only downfall - homeless ppl in and out of the facility begging for food . i would n't mind helping out with food or money , but not while i 'm eating .	4031
0	when you order they ask you if you want medium or large . if you choose medium thinking it 's the meal item that is on the menu , you would be wrong . both options are up-sales . if you want the meal item on the menu you have to say , no i want the regular or the small , which mean the same thing . they do n't warn you that the medium is an up-sale making you think you have one of two choices when you actually have three . very sneaky and very unappreciated .	4031
0	i had a craving for bacon cheddar potato wedges and this location totally messed up my order . i do n't normally check my order because i literally get one or two things when i order from here . not only was my order wrong but what they gave me was hella nasty . i was given the munchie breakfast mashup which was totally disgusting . i 'll never go back to this location .	4031
0	the worst place to go horrible customers service & they never get my order right i will not be at this jack in the box any more ! ! ! i also call their distant manager waiting 2 hear back .	4031
0	came here on sept 1st-2nd at midnight and i swear i 've waiting about 5-7 minutes in the drive thru . got up to the ordering screen and i waiting another maybe 5-6 minutes , the customer service here sucks ! the girl in the drive they cash just sucks . anyways got up to the window only to see these idiots playing , i wonder why the fcking drive thru line was backed up ! so i get to the window and the chick sees me pulling up and turn her back towards me while i wait for her to take my payment . uhhh , dummy ! learn how to do your job and stop playing ! dumb kids .	4031
0	walked in waiting for someone to acknowledge me . after 3 min i look at the fry guy and asked if anyone is working up front . hey spoke no english at all and pulled the lady from the drive thru to help me . after i ordered asked for no tomato but , of course they added tomatoes . no customer service today..	4031
1	this is the best mexican restaurant we have ever been to . we go there at least once a week . service is always excellent , as well as the quality of the meals . this restaurant is highly recommended !	4032
1	we went about 3:15 and missed lunch , but it was absolutely awesome . the best we have found since moving to charlotte 4 months ago . food was somewhat slow coming out but worth the wait . we will be making this our family mexican restaurant to eat when we go out .	4032
1	el valle is the best mexican restaurant in charlotte because the food was good , fast , and most importantly well priced ! most mexican places in the clt are super pricey but not this one . this place was open while hurricane florence was hitting charlotte . we went and the food is fantastic ! the service is very fast and polite as well making sure our order was right . i finished my plate which i rarely do , the margarita was good ( maybe a little less tequila than i like ) and the queso was great too . this is our new favorite mexican spot .	4032
1	this is our local , 2nd family , authentic mexican spot . el valle holds a special place in our hearts , we have no local family and come here often enough they know us , our kids , our friends that visit and give us hugs , jokes and good cheers . grilled chicken nachos is our favorite , but you ca n't go wrong . frozen rita 's are a must . make sure to tell them it 's your birthday !	4032
1	this understated gem is my favorite mexican restaurant ( by far ) in charlotte and one of the area 's top 5 of any kind . the service and the food are consistently phenomenal . the pollo san jose is my personal favorite .	4032
1	el valle is excellent ! always great service . i have been to a handful of mexican restaurant in charlotte but el valle is my far the most athletic , their food is so flavorful and fresh .	4032
1	affordable , classic mexican . nothing fancy , friendly staff . i 've been taking my wife here and having business lunches here for 15 years . never disappointed with the food . try the lunch fajitas . i like the variety of veggies rather than just the regular peppers and onions .	4032
1	we love mexican food and this is our number one go-to mexican restaurant . waiters are attentive and pleasant . food is plentiful and served hot . it is very good . i do n't usually write reviews , but had to leave one when i saw the comments about `` average fare '' . they have great chicken -- pulled breast meat . they have great fajitas and burrito grande . highly recommend .	4032
1	i 've been going here for over 15 years and the high quality and affordability of the food has not wavered .	4032
1	my family and i went here for lunch today and it was delicious . i had a hard time deciding what to order because they had so many dishes that sounded good . i ca n't wait to go back and try something else . great service , great food and great prices ! !	4032
1	huge menu with so many offerings ! well priced margaritas , cute decor and ambiance inside , portions enough to make two meals out of and warm chips with salsa ! we will definitely return to try other menu options and marg flavors ! service was great and super friendly , too .	4032
1	best restaurant in the charlotte area . they have had excellent food and service for 8 years and continue to be a weekly tradition . the outside of the restaurant is daunting but it has a friendly atmosphere and the best mexican food in charlotte	4032
1	always friendly . plenty of good food . the fajitas are delicious and enough to share . just buy drinks so you do n't seem like a cheapskate . one of my favorites for sure .	4032
1	really , really great food ! i ordered the fajita hawaiiana and it was delicious ! the portion was huge so i ended up bringing a nice container home that served as lunch for both me and my husband the next day . the shrimp and chicken were tasty and there was a lot of it ! they serve horchata ! ! ! i love horchata and theirs was yummy ! perfect amount of cinnamon ! our server was awesome and took great care of us too . overall we had a very nice experience dining here and will definitely return .	4032
1	tasty mexican food and friendly service . everything we 've had here has been good -- fajitas , tacos , enchiladas , quesadillas , etc . it 's a family-friendly place . it looks a little sketchy on the outside , but inside it 's clean and the food is good . i 'm upping my rating to 5 stars because we get consistently good food and my family is always happy to come here . the staff is friendly and accommodating . this is my kids ' favorite restaurant . we are here often .	4032
0	not a place i 'll ever crave a meal from . service was a bit slug-like , but the location was convenient . this place serves its purpose , i suppose ; it 's just nothing special .	4032
0	the food is absolutely average . the service is not quite that good . but it is one of those places that distributes buy one/get one style coupons . if you have a coupon ... .what the heck .	4032
0	not a place i 'll ever crave a meal from . service was a bit slug-like , but the location was convenient . this place serves its purpose , i suppose ; it 's just nothing special .	4032
0	i never write reviews , but i had the worst service i have ever experienced at this restaurant yesterday . they messed up all three of our entrees and two of the three drinks . in spite of this , when we mentioned the mixed up entrees ( we let the drinks slide ) , they were extremely rude . i say they because all three people who served our table were rude . one man actually rolled his eyes at me when i pointed out that my `` vegetarian '' burrito had chicken in it ! unbelievable . i definitely wo n't be back .	4032
0	came in for lunch about a week and a half ago and i kept putting my review off because i was n't to sure how i felt about this place ... i had the shrimp fajitas they were a large portion and were served with rice and beans . both the rice and beans were pretty gross nothing like i 've ever experienced at a mexican place : ( the beans left this gross after taste in my mouth and the rice just was blah ! the service was weird they sat us right away and got us drinks right away , but when it came to taking our order they were no where to be found ! all in all it was ok nothing special ...	4032
0	not really popping on a saturday night , very surprising . clean and attentive staff . was just ok for me considering we eat out in charlotte a lot but are trying more local closer to home . disappointed that they did not have regular pinto beans although it was on the menu and did not have plain old regular oil and vinegar for the salad . both platters had so so so much iceberg lettuce on them the rice was hidden under it therefore made the rice cold . the fried tilapia was way over cooked that the bones were edible . some say it 's good but sorry that was n't my experience .	4032
0	the food and service used to be good . waiter forgot the drinks , and then forgot to put in our food order . when we finally got the food , the orders were completely wrong . dirty dishes were never picked up of the table , and we had to go to the bar to get silverware . to top things off , they did n't comp anything on the bill . do n't see us going back any time soon .	4032
0	terrible food . i got the cheese enchilada with refried beans and rice along with a margarita . the refried beans were oddly a reddish brown color and were chunky and tasted horrible.the cheese enchilada tasted like it was made from those gross american cheese slices wrapped in plastic . the margaritas were horrible as well . the chips and salsa were the only reason i would give it a one star review . they were good . my husband and i did n't get sick thankfully , but both of the friends we were with were up all night the day after eating there sick from food poisoning . def would not recommend it to anyone .	4032
0	weak . came her with some friends one night in search of authentic tacos and margaritas . left in disappointment . ordered a half pitcher of margarita and food . chips were cold ( not unusual for mexican places , i know ) we received a full pitcher or martgarita and i brought it to the attention of the waitress . tacos were okay . al pastor was super dry . only drank half the pitcher . was charged the full pitcher price . will not be back . go to azteca it 's worth the 4 minute drive	4032
0	i have been to this restaurant numerous times and have always had a great experience . however tonight i had a terrible experience . it took a very long time for us to receive our food and then when we asked for our checks i received my bill and the total was around $ 12 however when he returned with my card after already running it my bill was changed to $ 21 . we gathered that apparently they had forgotten to charge us for the cheese dip however instead of communicating with us this they just change my bill and ran my card without my permission . in my opinion this is terrible customer service and very unethical . we will not be returning .	4032
0	the service was impeccable , the chips and salsa were perfect and the sides were fantastic . the main star of our two dishes lacked in flavor . i would come back , but only after receiving suggestions on what menu items are their top sellers .	4032
0	the service was awful , we waited for an hour for the waitress to come by our table , and even after we called them over they just turned around and walked away . i told them it was my daughters birthday and they did not do anything , and that would be fine if they did n't do a celebration for the table behind us . the food was sub par and our drinks were never refilled . do n't go ! ! ! !	4032
0	ordered a fajati for two and when we got our dish there was a baby spoon size amount of guacamole on the dish , when i asked the waiter politely if i can have just a little more , he responded by saying that 's all they give otherwise you have to pay for more . really ? ? ? ? really ? ? ? ? are you kidding . you are supposed to please the customer , have been going there for years and it was my birthday and i was so happy to go there , i should have gone somewhere else to be treated that way , sushi might have been a better choice	4032
0	the food is kinda bland ... salsa does n't have much flavor and the guacamole is just mashed up avocado with a tiny bit of salt . the rice does n't have much flavor either . the margaritas were good , though !	4032
0	no . just no . not authentic . bland . preferably for those not into spicy or seasoned food . servers unable to handle multiple tables . beware being seated in the area where they sit very large parties . your service from beginning to end might take up to two hours . i ordered steak tacos and was given fajita tacos . there is a difference in the meat if you know what a carne asada taco should be .	4032
1	well stocked and clean considering christmas is a few days away . fast checkout . painless	4033
1	i like that dollar store but they never have any wagons to use they put there supply in wagons and leave nothing for customers	4033
1	great customer service here . very good with stocking their items and the store is always put together nicely .	4033
1	this is your go-to place for all the little things you need . from school to household stuff , to food and make up . i was surprise to see that this place is clean , and everything is in order for your delight ! will come back here if i need more stuff .	4033
1	this is absolutely the cleanest and largest dollar tree i have visited . huge selection . everything is well organized and the cashiers are friendly and helpful . will definitely visit again .	4033
0	this store is very similar to most dollar stores except for one thing . there is always an extremely long line to check out . i 've been there at 9am and 8pm does n't matter ... line of at least 6-10 people . i 've actually walked out of this store after seeing the line at least 4 times . there are a ton of dollar stores to shop at and the management needs to staff at least 2 cashiers .	4033
0	i go to this store a couple times a week but mostly out of convenience . the store is crowded and its hard to find things and quality of the $ 1 is about 10 cents .	4033
0	when i asked the cashier why there were no carts her response was the ones we have are in use . when i said they should get some more her response was this is a cheap company so i dont see that happening . sad thing is they are losing business . people wont buy more than they can carry .	4033
0	ruby is a freakin idiot and she is rude ! i came to this list store to look for balloons and they tell me that they do n't have the ones that i need . then why % @ $ # are you displaying them like you have them ! take them down or put a damn sign to say `` out of stock '' and do n't be rude to customers ! i absolutely wish businesses would feel the pain when they have employees that are rude to customers ! i do n't have to shop at your establishment .	4033
0	the worst dollar tree to go throughout the area . worst customer service . wo n't accept the q 's and will give you lower value than what 's indicated ! worst store and does n't even rate a one star	4033
1	tucked away in the strip mall is this gem . i have tried many things on the menu & it 's always fantastic . try the sa cha beef ! very affordable . dinners are about 7-8 $ .	4034
1	this place rocks ! i order take-out from here once every month and they never fail me . the food is fresh , hot and tasty and the price is great . i always get either 4 happiness or the orange chicken , either one i am never disappointed .	4034
1	so far my favorite chinese restaurant since moving to charlotte . the staff is super friendly and great every time i visit . i usually just get take out but i 'm sure it would be the same dining in . i go with the sesame chicken , rice , and spring roll . the chicken is always cooked well and no super over cooked like a lot of chinese restaurants offer . it 's always been clean and inviting , and the location is easy to find . prices are great for the quality that you get !	4034
1	i pick up food from here frequently . it is very good for the price point . i 've had better chinese food but not for $ 6 a person . the egg drop soup is great ! !	4034
0	we just had some extremely flavorless chinese food for dinner from here . it was fantastic the last time . not sure why it was subpar tonight .	4034
0	food : so completely , totally meh . pre-cooked meats , steamed vegetable , and poured over the top sauces . meh . decor : moderatly interesting asian art with a few too many happy buddhas . service : confused but trying to be helpful .	4034
0	the food and prices are decent but the service could use some work . i felt like this one waitress was very rude . also , i ordered take out recently , picked it up myself , and payed with a credit card . i found out a couple of days later that they took it upon themselves to add gratuity . it was kind of shady business practice so i wo n't go back .	4034
0	i was a loyal customer for many years , until one day the beef started to taste funny . then i got food poisoning . never again .	4034
1	the ordering online was fast and easy . my order arrived fast and hot exactly the way i wanted it . the delivery person was polite and friendly . this was a rare occasion when my family was gone and i was alone and super hungry . for once i got to order what i wanted with just the toppings i wanted and it was perfect and absolutely delicious . thank you dominoes for making my night awesome !	4035
1	i ca n't in good conscious give any sort of chain 5 stars however this particular domino 's comes damn close ! they take 30 minutes or less to deliver which is outstanding ! i hate domino 's regular crust . yet there thin crust pizza is spectacular ! my girlfriend and i always order a thin crust pizza with white sauce instead of tomato , topped with spinach and tomatoes . this pizza is delicious ! and i highly recommend it !	4035
1	always a fresh hot za ! accurate orders and super fast service ! always craving pizza from dom ! keep it up ! $ 7.99 3 topping large monday through thursday ! ! !	4035
1	just had the best cheese pizza i 've had in a very long time ! ! ! ! you ca n't go wrong with cheesy goodness ! ! ! dominos is my new fav ! ! thanks dom ! ! on a side note , dude working was super rad and friendly !	4035
1	great service . love the online order app	4035
1	i prefer domino 's over pizza hut for sure . sometimes i crave it more than toppers . its good for when you 're feeling lazy and want some yummy pizza . plus the parmesan bites are delicious .	4035
0	dominos is dominos . but when i walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins . i had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after i ordered . this dominos is slow . drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it . edit : our soda was flat . seriously go get ian 's or drive out of your way for dominos do n't go to this one	4035
0	if i could give it less than 1 star i would . domino 's `` online only '' 50 % off all pizzas at menu price 11/25 thru 12/4 `` this store is currently unavailable for online ordering . '' been like this for all wisconsin stores since the promotion started .	4035
0	i ordered and they took 30 minutes to say that they canceled my order due to a new location opening up near me . when i tried to call to resolve the issue , they ignored my call 3 times . i 've ordered multiple locations at least 20 times and this is by far the worst ever . i guess they cater to the college students ( sarcasm ) .	4035
0	they did n't even cut my pizza ... .. awful customer service as soon as i walked in the door .	4035
0	this place is disgusting . not only are the windows completely finger marked up , the floor is molded in corners and the staff looks to match . i would n't order food from this place if it was n't 1am and limited options . the food was over cooked , dry and bland . my chicken bacon ranch sandwich looked like kids play and i actually fed it to my dog . the manager on staff at the time -- chris -- had no idea they food was coming out this way and had no real managing/people skills that i could see from our 5 minute conversation . yuck and yuck .	4035
0	i never even recieved my order . i called to ask what was going on an hour after i ordered and they were closed . they offered me a cheese pizza that they had sitting around . yuck . when i called the next day they told me they had no record of my order . the manager argued with me , it was clear she had zero people skills or management experience . as a general manager myself i know that the customer is always right . comping off a free pizza might take a minute but its worth keeping a customer . however i will never ever order from any dominos again .	4035
1	i came to montrose looking for my very first car . i knew what i wanted but could n't quite afford it . brandon bowen searched for a bank that could work with my credit score . he finally found one and i was able to purchase a hyundai azera ! it was a limited model and it was everything i wanted and more ! i love my car ! i love brandon for staying until after they closed to help me close the deal . montrose is a great dealership and i would recommend this place to anyone looking for a car . thank you brandon !	4036
1	my car salesman , bryan freeman was great . i would definitely recommend him to anyone else looking to purchase a kia vehicle ! thanks bryan !	4036
0	the most annoying thing a car dealership can do is not have their prices posted on the car . i should n't have to waste my time talking to someone before i know if i 'm interested .	4036
0	i will give them a one because only option and guess that they are actually going to change and fix my tire counts for something ... but not after being scolded for the fact they close in 40 minutes ... so sorry i had a tire with a hole in it and ca n't drive it more than 2 miles without it almost flat . customer service is really bad , you do n't need to make someone feel like it is their fault for getting here 40 minutes before you close ! bought 3 cars from them and my family all of theirs and never again ! !	4036
1	my tire was low on my way to work one day so i pulled off the highway and pulled into big o tires . i already called my job to inform them i was going to be late . as soon as i pulled in , ray helped me right away , he was extremely attentive and didnt just check the tire that was low , he made sure all tires were good . i dont know if he sensed my urgency , but he was so quick and helpful that i wasnt even late to work !	4037
1	great spot very quick surprisingly cheap even though they 're located in centennial definite recommend .	4037
1	service so surprising , my jaw fell open ! brought my truck in with an almost flat , because the air station up the road took air out instead of putting it in . jayson looked at it and immediately spotted a nail - which caused the initial low air light . when i went in to pay , the owner said 'no charge ' . i could n't believe it ! not only is it a holiday , and they are the only place opened , but jayson squeezed me in and no cost as the cherry on top ! ! ! i will definitely be back to get our tires replaced from here , because of that kindness and customer service .	4037
1	these guys are great . had me in and out in a timely manner and did a great job on my car . they 're not pushy or shady in any way . if i 'm in the area i 'll never go anywhere else .	4037
1	i ca n't think these guys enough . this is the best big o . they close at 6 and i got there just after 6 . i was expecting them to tell me to come back tomorrow to have my tire fixed but tim and robert said they would do it and they got it done . these two really helped me out tonight	4037
1	the guy name jonathan was pretty helpful luckily he double check my tire size for my car . cause the other guy ordered a wrong size . got there n got the deal buy 2 n get 2 free . in an hour it was done .	4037
1	i am very happy about my service today ! the staff were very nice and welcoming ! i came to the location on a sunday , i needed to get 4 tires and they gave me great prices so i walked out happy ! tim told me to come in and mike was ready to help ! i will definitely be coming back to this location even though i live on the north side . i recommend this location ! great service and great staff !	4037
1	we went to big o tires today as we needed a flat fixed . and met ryan . he was amazing . not only did he helped us with this tire but after fixing it , they changed out the spare for the fixed tire ! the team were all very friendly and knowledgeable . so refreshing after going to another place that immediately wanted us to spend $ 1100 ! ! we will definitely go here for all our auto needs in future . thanks again for you help !	4037
0	this place is the worst ! go elsewhere ! i brought my car in here over a year ago for an issue . left it there overnight . get a call from them the next day telling me they could n't find the problem i brought it in for but said i needed new brakes . wth ? ! other crap went down with this repair place afterwards but i wo n't bore you with the details . just go elsewhere .	4037
0	my girlfriend asked for a balance rotation . they tried to take advantage of her poor knowledge of vehicles by charging her for an alignment and rotation for $ 116 . she had a coupon for a balance so they knew exactly what she wanted . they covered the mistake so we did n't pay . later on i was working on her car and noticed that one tire was badly wash boarded and bald on the edge . that obviously shows they did n't do a rotation or they would have seen that or they just did n't care for her safety . fuck these bitches . i wish i could give them negative stars	4037
0	i agree with the other reviewer . i had work done there and had to take it back 4 times and it 's still not right . my car has n't been the same since . stay clear of this place !	4037
0	under new management and it is terrible . very disappointed . one guy working while the other guys stand around talking even though there are empty bays and multiple customers waiting . very unprofessional appearance and attitude .	4037
0	what a joke . i 've had my oil changed for years at other big o locations and have always brought my own oil . now they are making me buy it from them . do not go here . awful customer service .	4037
0	the worst . mistake after mistake and twice wasted time saying tires were ready and they were n't .	4037
0	i no longer trust this place . i just had my filters checked at nissan today and they were dirty yes , but the air filter was not destroyed . if i knew that they pulled stuff apart , i would have denied the service . prior , i had no issues other than wait time .	4037
0	not sure why i torture myself , but here i am , an hour into my wait to get tires rotated . the shop is completely quiet , yet i have to ask for them to start on my car . apparently the guy was in the restroom ? the first time i came for an oil change and tire rotation they said they had done it all , but when i went to drive away , the tires hadnt been rotated . gave you guys a second chance and you blew it .	4037
1	i went here on a friday night for a girls night with my two sisters and we had a great time ! the beachin tacos with ahi tuna and the chicken fresco melt were amazing ! in addition to the great food , the live music by the erin rossi band made the atmosphere so much fun !	4038
1	this is a great place with good food , good staff , and great beer and drink selection . it does n't look like much from the outside but wether you sit inside or on the cute patio you will love it . they have good specials and seasonal drinks . pizzas a great along with everything else i 've tried .	4038
1	it 's consistent . i like the specials . try the desserts , a pastry chef on site . this is no joke . talk about wine , beer or bourbon selection . take your time and enjoy the evening . live music friday and saturday night . i 'm partial to the mediterranean salad with blackened salmon . that 's my standard dish , but on occasion i can be convinced to eat the delicious smoked wings with their homemade sweet potato fries . you wo n't find a bad dish on the menu .	4038
0	we went to the beach club a lot when it first opened . they 've always had good food and drink but at a price . an example was friday night . during happy hour we had a bowl of soup , wedge salad , the meatball , 2 beers and a glass of iced tea . without happy hour prices the bill with tip would have been $ 50 . years ago there was a problem getting a seat at the bar on a friday night . that 's not the case now .	4038
0	we walked in took a look at the menu saw the ridiculous prices and walked right out . sports bar atmosphere . if ya wan na pay those prices for nothing special food in an atmosphere of loud tv screens go for it ! and it 's not like your in the bahamas folks . your in the freaken concord plaza ! yuck .	4038
0	food is alright , but the service and ownership is horrific . they have zero understanding of customer service and taking care of the customer . after being a regular for nearly 5 years and lackluster service i 've had enough and found a new place to frequent .	4038
1	tried pizza perfectta for the first time today . i had a mini pizza ( ricotta , cheddar , and fontina cheese ) . it was perfect - the size , crust , temperature , and taste . i absolutely loved it .	4039
1	the pizza and hoagies here are absolutely on point . wow ! i ordered a medium pizza with chicken and spinach . my husband a tuscan chicken hoagie . first , the medium pizza is huge . easily the size of a large at most places . the chicken was good and not rubbery . the spinach actually had flavor . i eat a lot of spinach pizza and it usually is flavorless . this was amazing . the tuscan chicken hoagie was next level . super flavorful and delicious . best of all , everything arrived hot ! we 've ordered way too many pizzas that arrive lukewarm ! we will definitely be back !	4039
1	solid pizza with good fries and onion rings . they accommodated my requests for a special pizza nicely and delivery was on time . delivery was a little pricey but otherwise a good place for pizza .	4039
1	tastes pretty cool . wrapped my pizza in foil after , the slices i could n't finish . i have to admit , used a lot of foil	4039
1	do n't be fooled by the humble exterior : their food is delicious ! better than pizza sola . its my favorite pie in shadyside , and their hoagies and gyros are also delicious .	4039
1	this is the first pizza i had when my wife and i moved to pittsburgh from san francisco about 10 years ago . when i had it i thought , this pizza is okay , but the sauce is really good . ever since , we 've always ordered it with extra sauce and it 's been great . i would give their standard pizza 3 stars -- but with extra sauce , as you should order it and they should start serving it -- it 's 5 star pizza as good as any in pittsburgh .	4039
1	friends , if you are going to pittsburgh and do n't stop by pizza perfectta , you are missing out on service and food combined that is must have . i have the privilege of knowing the owner and his family well , and i can thoroughly endorse his professionalism and product satisfaction . an exceptional pizza delivery spot you will be grateful to attend . excellent variety , hearty taste , and pleasurable service . and they have the awards to back it up , winning last years best pizza in pittsburgh award for 2012 from a reputable area magazine . in conclusion , go !	4039
1	my favorite for pt . breeze/pittsburgh east end . flat new york style , not greasy , timely delivery , they know my orders !	4039
1	i live right around the corner , so this is my go-to pizza place . we 've ordered both wings and pizza from this place , and i ca n't complain . pizza is delish , the staff are always friendly , and the pizza is always done on time !	4039
1	deliver fast and are very courteous . pizza is meh but the fried pickles are delicious- perfect hangover food .	4039
0	do not order the hot wings ! ! if you enjoy eating hot sauce flavored gravy paste , then by all means these are the wings for you . if not , stay away . my boyfriend and i each ate one and could n't even finish the rest of our dinner . do n't waste your money !	4039
0	i try to only order from yelp once a week , i had a looong day and i was really looking forward to not cooking in the heat . i ordered 6 fresh wings and tiramisu . not only was the delivery driver almost half an hour late but i was really disappointed with my food . the wings were tiny and the tiramisu came the smallest container and it was frozen ! plus it was $ 4.99 ! ! i expected a healthy portion for that price . i will not be ordering from this location again .	4039
0	i was pretty disappointed with this place . i thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay . i went here around 12am on a friday so maybe their ingredients were n't as fresh . i ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries . the fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless . there are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me . the people working there are really nice though which is a plus . overall , i would n't go back .	4039
0	on the positive side , the delivery was pretty quick , given i ordered during the dinner rush , where i would consider under an hour to be pretty exceptional . after that , the food was pretty meh . the pizza was n't bad , but it was n't great either . given the relative quick delivery , it was on the cold side upon arrival . also , i had ordered a fried pickle appetizer . it was clearly a frozen appetizer , so i knew what to expect , but this also arrived cold and soggy . all and all not a terribly positive experience given the vast wealth of take-out options in the area .	4039
0	extremely poor service from owner . thought he was a nice person but he actually does n't trust black people . nor does he like doing bh business with them .	4039
0	well i havent had pizza from pizza perfectta in quite some time . from what i remembered it was pretty good . but today it was absolutely unforgiving ! it was as if i had ordered a pie with very light cheese and very lite sauce because 2 of the 3 main ingredients of any good pizza were severely lacking , lacking to the point of which it prompted me to write this review and im not a feedback kind of person . maybe its how their recipe calls for the making of their product now ? if so , they have narrowed my choice selection for the future . also the driver forgot to bring my drinks . wow !	4039
0	they have inaccurate hours posted . i tried to order at 11:30 pm when yelp says they close at 2am and they were already closed . when i told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said `` oh that 's ok ... . '' and hung up on me . i will never be ordering from them again , which is a shame since they are so close to me . i immediately called pizza parma which gladly delivered to me . i recommend ordering from pizza parma since they have similar menu items , they post accurate hours , and they do n't hang up on you ! seriously ? why answer the phone ?	4039
0	wo n't deliver to lawrenceville , even though only 2 miles away . do n't order for delivery unless you live next door	4039
0	got the rancho and the greek , not so bad but i probably wo n't go back ... too heavy for me ...	4039
0	stay away ! ! ! ! ! ! could not understand what the foreign cashier was saying , made placing near impossible . could not make a pizza to save their life ...	4039
1	great service . they saved me over $ 1000 dollars on my smog repair . my car is good as new . thanks cj . i am now a loyal customer .	4040
1	awesom service dan and carlos both extremely helpful and got me back on the road in no time i would definetly recommend this place for any repairs quick and honest	4040
0	they broke my engine cover while changing my motor oil . they did n't even have the decency to let me know they broke it . shame on them . terrible customer service . wo n't be going back . if you happen to go there make sure to check everything before you leave .	4040
0	they never did my oil change . the new management sucks ! my light is still on and has been for the past week . not a honest car shop go elsewhere .	4040
1	highly recommend high country comfort ! called this morning for my momma , air blowing hot , jesse came out and fixed the problem ! really appreciate you guys ! thank you again ! kristie	4041
1	dave and his staff are professional and honest which for me is number one when it comes to the a/c business . i was using another company when my a/c would n't kick on and after 3 days and numerous attempts at fixing the unit they were convinced that it was the main board which would be an expensive fix . i did n't feel right , i know i should have cut them loose sooner , i had high country come out and take a look at the unit . it turns out the main power supply wire had shorted and needed two feet of wire replaced . so thanks dave for saving me hundreds of dollars .	4041
0	have been using this company for 18 years and been very happy . had a problem and for 200 $ i was told ac was working . 20 minutes after they left stopped working . they were trying to help go thru a home warranty company but that failed . i made another appt and there was a mixup that was absolutely understandable , then have tried to call for 2 weeks now no callback . wow what happened ?	4041
0	this place indicated they fixed our ac- although we only saw them once . one year later and 3 ac companies later and a lot of lost time , turns out the leak this company found in our ac is still there . this company fabricated a letter for money held back in escrow indicating that our ac had been fixed by them . what 's most insulting about all this is that after many calls to them , they have not once returned our call .	4041
1	best pies ever ! the menu is delicious as well . ever location i 've visited has always had friendly servers who were very helpful .	4042
1	always good good and good prices . they seem to always have great quality food . i never get wrong orders . the sandwiches are my favorite part but they make fantastic crush burgers too . their pie is always delicious too !	4042
1	village inn is my go to restaurant for casual dining . the food is always hot and fresh . our waitress was friendly and efficient . she promptly brought out our drinks . my family and i stopped in for brunch . three of us ordered the v.i.b . for breakfast and my son ordered the pancake breakfast with eggs-medium and bacon . i chose two eggs over easy , two sausages , hash browns and a strawberry crepe . my daughter ordered two eggs over easy , two bacon strips , fruit bowl and low fat yogurt . my husband ordered cheese omelette , bacon , home fries and french toast . this location in glendale is highly recommended .	4042
1	our waitress , gina , was great . she kept refilling my water which is rare at diners . normally your server gives you 2 refills and then they disappear . i ordered a california benedict . the egg should 've been slightly runny ( it was fully cooked ) . the sauce was `` ok '' . the pie was great and our overall experience was great . thanks village inn . : )	4042
1	i have n't been to a village inn in quiet sometime . i walked in and was surprised by the new retro theme decor . love it ! seated immediately , gina was my server , lovely woman . fast service , good food . you ca n't beat the $ 7.99 special .	4042
1	absolutely no complaints . i was seated immediately and the waitress was very helpful . i wanted to order a omelette but i wanted to do some substituting . she advised to take a look at this new selection called `` my incredible v.i.b '' . you get 4 selections of 30 menu items for $ 7.95 . i got a 2 egg cheese omelette , 2 scrambled eggs , 2 bacon and 2 sausage . it was cheap and filling . the soda refills were never asked for just brought . really happy with the service . food was 3 stars but service was a clear 5 . 4 seems a little high but the service was that good .	4042
1	tonight my husband and i decided to stop for a quick bite at village inn . last time we were here last year was terrible . service and food were bad . tonight it was a different story . our waiter aaron was pleasant and funny . had a great sense of humor in fact all the servers were so nice and happy . the manager , john , stopped at all tables and would get anything if you needed . such a turn around . we will be back . great food and service and the pies are wonderful .	4042
1	my first time here my dinner was good ... but the pies ... yummy there was so many to choose from it took me a while but i settled for the lemon surpeme pie ... delicious ! ! !	4042
1	did n't have to wait too long . they had football on which is cool . our waitress was fast and friendly . the country fried steak , eggs , and pancakes were delicious and all entrees were eaten all up ! thank you .	4042
1	we have always love village inn..but the last year we had had several customer services where we felt they were lacking extensively.. we have n't gone back for almost 6 moths ... and decided to go there this morning to give it one last try . to our surprise ... it was a complete turn around in customer service ... warm greeting.. happy faces and the manager john was amazing and restored our faith in vi ... we will be back and will again sing their praises as we had done in the past . great food..great menu and great service ! ! ! !	4042
1	cherry pie was on point ! ! ! ! i had it a la mode with vanilla ice cream . i am still dreaming about it now , i may have to go get another one .	4042
1	i have been to multiple village inns over the years . this one is great and the customer service is always on par . the food is always hot and if you want something different they will try there best to make it the way you want .	4042
1	my favorite place for 6 years now . they never disappoint . food is quality , servers work hard to make sure your needs are met , and the overall restaurant is kept nice . i 've never had such amazing service over and over throughout the years . i mean it when i say village inn is the . best. ! ! ! ! ( p.s . their hamburgers , chicken and salads are the best ever made ! )	4042
1	came for pie and coffee with my lady ! the pie was excellent , the coffee was hot , and the server , isaiah was superb !	4042
1	we always come to this resturant & i liked allso my kids love it & they have good deal a free pie every wednesday	4042
0	went there today had garden veggie skillet , so did drew my buddy , potatoes were rubbery , not flavorful at all , got mine just luke warm . wo n't be back for long time , only thing i give my experience was service was ok	4042
0	we went in for some breakfast after a late night . waited for ten minutes for anyone to talk to us . walked around the corner to find the waitress asleep . take a nap before you come to work !	4042
0	went in to have dinner and got over looked by 3 waitresses and one manger , never got helped for 10 minutes and left . i know restaurants can be busy but at least say hi to us . wo n't go back . went over to the chinese restaurant across the street and had a great dinner . so i guess i can say thank you village inn for being bad .	4042
0	my daughter , granddaughter and i had breakfast there this morning . to our great surprise the check was $ 39.00 ... each entree was $ 8.50 ! the food was just okay but acceptable . shock of shocks : small oj $ 2.59 ; iced tea $ 2.39 ; 2 cups of coffee @ $ 2.29 each . we each received an empty cup with a carafe on the table . i had 2 cups ... my daughter had one . had i been a ! one i would have received the cup and carafe for $ 2.29 . all we got for an additional $ 2.29 was an empty cup . these prices are so inflated . never again !	4042
0	the server was good the food was good the restaurant was so dirty in the plates needed to be thrown away they need to close this location if that 's the best they can do do n't eat here i 'm concerned what 's going to happen to me tonight for meeting here	4042
0	prior experience has been pretty good . but this time was terrible . we got a banana cream pie to go . the banana cream was a cheap vanilla pudding with banana chunks in it . they apparently thought they could mask it with the banana and the pie was expensive . will not do that again ! !	4042
0	if i could give this zero stars , i would . i ordered the breakfast platter that had a little bit of everything . tasted okay , but i woke up that night with an awful pain in my stomach . i ran to the toilet and was met by my dinner from this place . i got food poisoning and could not eat breakfast food since . stay away .	4042
0	i just placed my order after being seatted and waiting 20 minutes for the server to take my order . have n't been here for about six months but this place has changed and not for better , will not be back . used to be a great place to have breakfast , when the food arrived it was good except for the fact that the sour-dough toast was not toasted .	4042
0	will not be eating here again . floor is filthy . restrooms need attention . food was good but cold	4042
0	had a planned breakfast for my mother-in-law today and everything seems regular and ordered the ultimate skillet . and was almost done when i hit a piece of bacon that for lack of a better term tasted like hand sanitizer . or some chemical . wife confirmed spoke to management which said the would remove from the bill . strange	4042
0	my french toast came out cold my sons came out cold reversi did not too far from the kitchen has been the area where they cut ties and watching them in the kitchen standing there eating instead i 've taken care of the customers . i tried to flag down the manager she acknowledged me and then just walked into the kitchen . we have had the server in the past and she rock it tonight was horrible ,	4042
0	this has got to be the worst service ever . we waited outside for almost 1 hour for a table for 10 people & then 20 mins for our drink order .	4042
0	i was not impressed with this restaurant at all . the food was extremely disappointing . my husband did n't finish his meal because he thought it was gross and my daughter had a hair in her grilled cheese sandwich . i have paid less for a much better breakfast .	4042
0	do yourself a favor , and spend your money else where . easy pass on this place . servers were rude . order was wrong . food was marginal at best . they did n't even clean off our table when there was pie all over from the bottom of my food ( it was n't even my pie ? ! ) just left it there . definitely will not be back . saving a few bucks on a free slice is not worth the experience . would give zero stars if possible .	4042
0	worst service ever ! arrived at 6pm for a table of 5 . 20 minutes to take our order and now it 's 6:50 and we still have not received our food we had to leave to attend a concert and now have to find fast food before we go . this is my local location and wo n't be returning .	4042
1	wow , i came in today for some impulse shopping and the customer service was unmatched . i wish i had their names but every associate was so friendly and helpful that it unusually made my day . i was looking for a particular size for a pant but it was unavailable at this location that they located it for me at another store . my experience here was the epitome of good , no , more like exceptional customer service ! i got better treatment here than at louis vuitton . good vibes !	4043
1	i had the best customer service in this store- and it looks like there may be some confusion on which one it is so to be clear i am talking about the aeo in the fashion show mall . excellent customer service by all employees and a super shout out to callie , who took good care of me and my very thin , long legged daughter she picked great choices for both of us , and is super good at her job . thanks to everybody that was working yesterday , they were all great .	4043
1	i go to this location fairly frequently and andrew always happens to be there when i visit and he 's so friendly and helpful . all staff members are pretty friendly here but andrew is just really great . thanks andrew !	4043
0	i just recently started shopping at this company . still trying to evaluate how the clothing will work out at this point . however , the encounters i have had with their employees have not been pleasant . i feel the definitely need improvements in customer service . there seems to be a lot of flawed logic in their company policies . at least the interpretation of them by employees . will likely avoid this store . not sure how online service is though .	4043
0	customer service sucks ! ! i stood at the counter for about 10min . before anyone asked if i needed any help . rude !	4043
0	i think this is for the north premium outlet but anyways . was told at galleria at sunset they didnt have the size i need at this location but they were wrong . help is terrible beyond terrible . there is 3 people in the store folding clothes and one at the register . i asked the girl at the front for a size and i had to wait for 20 minutes . this isnt rocket science . after i tried on a few things i left . i guess this store is for teeny boppers	4043
1	great service and grooming ! we have used several groomers in the west valley and we will definitely be returning here !	4044
1	we love this place . the owner is so personable and you can tell she really loves animals !	4044
1	our louie looks so handsome after he 's done ! we got so many compliments . it was louie 's first time at see spot clean and kara was able to fit him in on the day we called . louie seemed to be calmer going in and coming out from this groomer ( compare to when he was at petsmart ) . and they even gave him a complimentary bandana to complete his handsome look ! we definitely will be back . thanks to the grooming team at see spot clean for taking care of our louie !	4044
1	i love this place ! ! ! the owner and the other employees are so nice and genuine . i feel much more comfortable bringing my dog here than anywhere else in the area . i feel it is important to support local retailers . give them a try , you will not be disappointed .	4044
1	see spot clean - has moved to bullard ave , just south of i-10 . same great people , new location and same wonderful results ! ! we totally recommend going to see spot clean	4044
1	i saw them on yelp and decided to give them a try based on all the wonderful reviews . awesome ! ! they are really sweet and my little girls look beautiful afterwards . they do everything that most other places would charge more for ( hair cut , ears cleaned , nail trimming , etc . ) and like another reviewer said , a cute bandana . for $ 35 ! ! ( my guys are maltese/shih tzu mix , might be slightly higher for bigger dogs or special haircuts ) . definitely try them out . wonderful customer service and very helpful ! emily	4044
1	i tried see spot clean for the first time today and it was absolutely great ! i usually go to petsmart but it was always a hit or miss with them , so i tried see spot clean . not only did they do a much better job , but their pricing was significantly cheaper ! the employees were great and really knew what they were doing . i will definitely come back and recommend this place to all my family and friends !	4044
0	i was referred to see spot clean by a co worker , his neighbor claims to work here & had great things to say about this place . i made my appointment and took my 2 year old pekingese chihuahua mix in . the staff was very friendly and informative . upon going back for my little lady , i grabbed her and left . once we got home we started noticing long hairs left around her doggy personal area , her cut was n't blended so it just look like scissors were used . for $ 50 this was not worth it . we wo n't be returning .	4044
0	couple of years ago we took one of our dogs here for grooming . the people were n't quite as rude as others have mentioned but within a couple of days charlie got very ill. he became somewhat lethargic ( excuse my spelling if incorrect ) , would n't eat or drink so we had to take him to the vet and they said he had a very high fever . charlie never had been sick prior to his visit here so needless to we decided to never return because he probably caught something during his grooming .	4044
0	beware ! this place almost killed my 3 pound puppy ! one lady at the front desk told us that they drug the dogs . another front desk lady told me that they ca n't do that since they are n't a vet ( this is correct ) . so i dropped my tiny puppy off and when we picked her up she was acting very strange , lethargic , and she threw up for the rest of the afternoon . they had drugged her without our consent and lied to us about the fact that the groomers do not sedate . we almost lost our puppy . this is why the dogs are n't scared .	4044
0	this place is dirty and smells bad . i took my dog here and she got a skin infection from tge burns she received . i do not recommend this place .	4044
0	nice people and good work on other dogs but mine wo n't be back . i asked them to cut her body close but leave her body full . i did n't want to overreact but i did n't even recognize her as my dog because her face fur is shaped differently . her tear stains are usually almost gone after grooming but looked almost worse than when i took her . i guess i have to deal with it until her next grooming elsewhere . again the staff was friendly but i would have like what i asked and paid for .	4044
0	very nice people . they were great w/ my dog , but i do n't think the service was worth the price . i 'll just wash her in my tub and save the $ $ next time .	4044
0	i wanted to try this place out because it was open on weekends with great availability . i called to make an appointment ; i was quoted $ 40 oh wait $ 45 `` minimum wage increase `` ok still i understand . this place smells horrible . i understand it 's a dog grooming but i 've never visited a dog groomer that smelled so bad . upon picking my dog up i was told it was 50 because it was a scissor cut ( not my dogs first grooming ) . the haircut is ugly and uneven , and his man parts are swollen , cut and he has a rash .	4044
1	i simply love this place . my daughters and i went there after my youngest spotted it while shopping . let me start with the meat ... it 's fresh ground beef and hand shaped on the grill . the quality is superb let 's move on too the bread is freshly baked . i love the mooyah sauce and sweet potato fries were the best . i go there after time i want a great burger . its better then bang bang ... .	4045
1	finally gave them a shot . some think it 's pricey , but it 's cheaper than 5 guys , less greasy , and cleaner . the concept is the same . just tell them what all you want on the burger and bam . we really enoyed a burger better than fast food , but not super expensive . $ 5 gets you a good sized burger . we will be going back .	4045
1	these may be the best burgers and chili cheese fries in town . i 'd never heard of them before and you can bet i wo n't forget them any time soon . the burgers are savory and cooked to perfection and the buns and toppings are fresh and tasty . better than smash burger and 5 guys any day . i feel lucky we have one so close by , this may be the only one in nc .	4045
1	tried this place tonight and was nicely surprised . the burgers are really tasty with a nice burger to bun ratio and just the right quantity of toppings . fries were hot and fresh and tasted hand cut . standout chocolate shake , not to much chocolate and very smooth and creamy . we will be back !	4045
1	great food and amazing service ! they have a turkey burger and a whole grain bun as well for those looking for lighter options . the sweet potato fries were stellar and a must try . our daughter ordered a shake and immediately declared it the best ever . my husband ordered the double burger with blue cheese raved about the flavor as well as all the options available for toppings . all in all a fabulous add to sycamore commons and we could n't be more thrilled .	4045
1	so nice to have a delicious burger place ! very tasty and many options to try . owner and staff are super nice . fries are so good and love the presentation ! i order a double for my two little ones to share and they are so nice to cut it in half and serve it separately . miss in-n-out but this place rocks ! get the app for points : )	4045
1	great place if you 're trying to eat low carb . they have a lettuce wrap for the burger ! i had half regular fries and half sweet potato fries . i liked the sweet potato better . my burger was very good , the service was very good and i really like the rewards program . try it . you wo n't be sorry .	4045
1	we came across mooyah by accident . we were out shopping and we need to eat . i 'm a fan of this place . i love the burgers . the staff is very friendly . it 's in a nice shopping plaza . it 's kindda like five guys but better . the actual burger tastes awesome . it reminds me a of burgers i had as kid . you should check this place out .	4045
1	what a surprise to fund this place in the middle of a completely yuppie uptown area . wait..you are n't overcharging for burger and fries ? wait ... you bring it to the table and are actually nice about it ? ok , great ! these burgers were freshly ground perfectly cooked awesomeness . juicy , stacked full of flavor and lots of options their fresh fries were pretty rockin as well ! ! if you like good burgers and at a reasonable price ... please find this place ! you will not regret it ! !	4045
1	the best hamburgers ever and the buns were excellent . i had the sweet potato fries and my husband had the regular fries . both were were so good but my husband ate some of my fries and i have never seen him eat sweet potatoes . the shakes were awesome . i also liked the fact that my food was served on a tray , not in a bag . mooyah is now my favorite place to get really good , really fresh food , prepared just the way i like it .	4045
1	great burger , got the wheat bun , the topping choices are great . not too messy , given all of the condiments and toppings i chose . cooked all the way through . the burgers are very wide , but terribly thick , so if you like a pink center , it may be a challenge . my new favorite burger place .	4045
1	big tasty burgers with fresh toppings on high quality buns , fresh cut fries , and tasty shakes ... what more could you ask for ? ! what sets mooyah apart from the other artisinal burger joints is an absolutely delicious seasoning mixed into the burger meat - the burgers themselves are really , really good . so , i 've you 've got a discerning palate you 'll probably like mooyah more than the competition . waitstaff are friendly and attentive , prices are very reasonable , and the atmosphere is comfortable and clean with a chalkboard wall and chalk for the kiddos . keep up the good work mooyah ! !	4045
1	i just ate the best burger i 've had in recent memory . the husband got a 'mooyah ' style burger and i got a cheeseburger . my plate was clean within 5 minutes and i was n't even that hungry ... it was that good . hubby said his burger reminded him of a gourmet in and out burger ... he lived in ca for several years and tells me that 's a very big compliment . we will absolutely be back !	4045
1	this place is amazing ! ! ! the burgers are fresh made-to-order , and you have an ingredient list of at least 15 add one ! fries are perfect , not mushy or over salted . the also provide veggie burger options , and a variety of shakes . the mooyah burger is a must try ! ! !	4045
1	for a restaurant that opened today , one would expect for them to have a few glitches/mishaps on the orders . we ordered 8 different orders today for our office , everything came out perfect and made to order . the staff was friendly and processed everything efficiently . the owner was present and patient with staff members as , again this was their first day , they were still learning . the pricing was a bit high and no daily lunch specials were offered . everyone agreed that the burgers were juicy , good quality , fresh , and very large . the french fries were cooked to order , seasoned perfectly . definitely will return , just not frequently due to pricing .	4045
1	better than five guys , not greasy . great seat on the burger , delicious homemade bun and crisp hand cut french fries . will definitely go back , especially on a monday night where they offer a buy one get one deal after 5:00 pm .	4045
1	every time me and my family come here it 's a great experience the food is really good quality the bread is homemade i always customize my burger the sweet potato fries are always fresh everything here is really really good	4045
1	yummy burgers , delicious grilled hotdog , and amazing sweet potato fries ! ! love the atmosphere and options for burgers . the kids meal was an amazing deal as well ! $ 4.99 for a regular entree , small side , and organic milk or other beverage . so glad we stumbled on this place !	4045
1	i think this place is wonderful ! this is a great concept ! they make burgers to order and i love their sweet potato fries !	4045
1	solid burger place . i went with the classic mooyah in the mooyah style and it was really good . plenty of food for me , no need to double it . the fries were good too ! when i talked to the cashier to order and the guy who i picked up my food from , they were both extremely friendly and nice as well as helpful . i 'll definitely go back when i 'm in that area shopping and craving a burger .	4045
0	too pricey for what you get ... .i got the turkey burger moo yah style with fries ... .and i 've had better . to put it simply , mcdonald 's tastes better .	4045
0	the food here is pretty good plus it 's not expensive if your on a budget . only problem that happens all the time is bad customer service . every time i eat there the same employee at the register seems to be so rude . just watch out ! good grub , bad service..	4045
0	will up the review and stars when the sauerkraut rolls out to the place for the hotdogs .	4045
0	the food is good but it 's the service i 'm disappointed in . i was called to pick my food up from the counter . i sit down and within 60 seconds two employees bring out the food for one family and on single person seated . why is it that i had to pick my food up but you had no problem serving a family and a single individual their meal . that was plain rude i 'll stick with bt burger joint where the employees are super friendly and the food is just as great . make that three people .	4045
0	second visit tonight and we are sad to say not going to return . the prices are high for what you get . they have both times served incorrect items causing one person to sit waiting for food . my children love the shakes so maybe for desert or a treat .	4045
0	service was friendly , but i classify this as a modified fast food restaurant it should not have taken 20 minutes for a burger , fries and drink . then lets talk about the salt burger . i ordered the mooyah burger done the mooyah way which means sauce , tomato , lettuce , pickle , grilled onion and american cheese on a whole wheat bun . my first bite was with everything and it seemed salty so i scrapped off the extras and took off the bread and just tried the burger , turns out it was the burger itself that was overly salty , in fact so salty there was no other taste coming through . definitely not going back .	4045
0	avererage burger , a bit greasy and the fries were cold . in my opinion there are much better places for a burger , but if you are in the area and really want a burger then you could go here .	4045
0	ew , man ! my burger tasted like a hot dog , straight up . nothing like a beef patty . it was really disgusting and i 'm very disappointed . wasted $ 12 . my soda was good though ... the jalapeños are super delicious , but then the fries tasted like they were fried in old ass oil , soo ...	4045
0	how do you put the right star amount on a mixed experience ? we actually enjoyed the food . the burgers were tasty , and the fries were exceptional . my son also got a banana milkshake , that he enjoyed . unfortunately ... he also came away with what we assume to be food poisoning . stomach was upset almost immediately after eating , then spent the day in bed and in the bathroom . i understand food prep is a tricky business , and there are going to be instances like this , even in the most sanitary conditions , but it certainly makes me wary of a second visit .	4045
0	mooyah more like moonah , i was n't impressed at all very disappointed . i got the mooyah burger with cheese , lettuce , mayo and mushrooms for some reason my burger was sweet not sure why but it was n't that good . the fries super limp greasy just yuck . the best thing was the sprite and the milk shake . reminds me of 5 guys burgers . i will not be going back .	4045
0	once was enough for this five guys knockoff . the order was simple : burger and fries . the fries were ok , but not very hot . the burger was very over cooked , hard and dried out . when i complained to the manager she said , `` we cook them well done just like five guys . '' she refused to cook a burger any less done than what i was served . i left after two bites and wo n't return .	4045
0	fries are good . burgers very dry , no taste . got the double burger with cheese and it just was n't good at all . having a stomach ache after eating it . recommend five guys instead of mooyah if you are looking to pay the same price for a better burger .	4045
0	when a restaurant specializes in two things only - burgers & fries , you would think they would excel . in my opinion , this is not the case . the burger had no flavor and the fries were greasy & limp . plus this new restaurant is very , very expensive for what you get . the girl at the cash register added 70 cents to my bill for cheese when i did n't even order cheese . the only thing positive was the customer service . i wo n't be going back .	4045
0	owner has a bad attitude .. he is a very rude person , , never supporting his business again ! ! and i think he under pays his employees ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4045
0	where 's the beef ? ! i ordered a double burger and the wife had a regular mooyah . imagine my surprise when the food came out and the wife 's single patty on her burger was larger than my two patties combined ! the reason people order a double is because they want more than a single ! maybe it was an off day , but the cook should have noticed the comparison as he was preparing our order . a 1 star experience , but gave an extra star since the burger did taste good ...	4045
0	i love the selections that they have . the issues were the young lady taking our order chewed on her fingers constantly . she also suggested due to our size that my husband and i needed a large order to share . on top of the attitude my burger and the fries were over salted . i will definitely not be returning .	4045
0	visited twice and probably will not return . unimpressive . we were 2 of 6 customers in the place and they still got our order wrong . just basic burgers and fries for cheap .	4045
0	if you value a great burger , do not eat here . the burgers are slightly off , the customer service was terrible for the value of the food . if i wanted crappy service and sub par burgers i would have went to mcdonald 's . it 's not rocket science , either you greatly improve your customer service or the food . all in all not a very good experience ! ! !	4045
0	greasiest burger i 've ever had . over done greasy fries ! grease was running down my arms and i had to pat the grease off with napkins but even that barely worked . the manger of store owner was extremely rude ( bald guy ) . do not get how a burger can be this greasy . i tried eating it but i ca n't . i am definitely throwing the rest away .	4045
0	i came here for lunch with a good friend and the experience was unpleasant . our order came out wrong and they lied about it being correct . we also could hear the people behind the grill saying crude things and cursing . we also witnessed one of the workers flipping off his fellow coworkers . that is not something i want to hear or see while trying to enjoy my messed up order . it is inappropriate , rude , and unpleasant .	4045
1	great takeout/delivery . quality of the food is impressive . never had an issue with delivery time . my go to place for chinese on the quick .	4046
1	when i crave chinese food , this place is my quick fix . they are so fast . i order & it 's all ready by the time i get there & i 'm only like 5 minutes away ! the food is tasty & very affordable . i often crave their curry & any of their spicy , fried chicken dishes . vegetables are consistently cooked to perfection . their lunch menu is excellent . portions are large like my cavernous appetite .	4046
1	fabulous food ! i ordered the lunch sesame chicken with lo mein and the crab rangoons , delivered right on time and still hot ! ! will definetly order again !	4046
1	this is my go-to cheap chinese place . great chicken , delicious crab rangoons , and fast service . i 've never dined in , but it looks like an alright dine-in space . it 's super close to where i work so i drop in quite often for lunch . they have a nice lunch deal , too !	4046
1	really great tasting and fast chinese food delivery -- and at a good price . they have a number of vegetarian options too .	4046
1	just a quick update : this time , so and i order some orange chicken and dumplings . dumplings were solid this time , very good . orange chicken was pretty good too , had an actual orange flavor rather that weird tang/hi-c `` orange '' flavor . deliver was just as quick as last time , around thirty minutes from order to delivery .	4046
0	i 'm not a picky person , but there were a couple things wrong with my experience with china king : -delivery was late , taking over an hour and a half for a simple order . -i asked for utensils with the delivery , and the driver did not have any . -there were only 2 pieces of shrimp in my order of shrimp and broccoli . pretty cheap . -they were n't shy on soy sauce packets , but i only received 1 little packet of sweet & sour sauce with my sweet & sour chicken . does n't that usually come with an extra container with it ? i think i would have been much better off going to panda express .	4046
0	food was cheap and pretty decent . however , i did not get sweet and sour sauce with my sweet and sour chicken , they gave me orange chicken instead of general tsos , and a regular coke instead of a diet one . they also took an hour and a half to get the food to me . i also gave instructions to not ring the doorbell and call instead , which the driver disregarded . honest mistake , i know , but sure does n't help when everything else was wrong too .	4046
0	took over two hours to deliver and the food was cold and terrible . do not get delivery from these guys . terrible terrible terrible .	4046
0	i ordered from them for the 1st time today for delivery . i wo n't be ordering from them again . the food was ok - nothing special and not very warm . but the delivery driver i would have fired if she worked for me . part of my order was missing - the rice ! ! ! also she let the bag fall over because sauce was running down the outside of bag and had covered everything inside . and then to top it off when i went to pay and was owed change she said she did n't have any . all in all she was just rude .	4046
0	so . i ordered delivery and it turns out an hour later i called them and they had not even started it . as if that was n't bad enough it took them three hours after i ordered to get my food . they were running a special that included three free crab rangoons ( that i never got ) and they apparently think i am too stupid to tell the difference between general tso 's and orange chicken .	4046
0	missing items . i called and asked them to deliver the missing items , yet the guys who picked up the phone declined since they were `` too busy , '' and offered to deliver those items next time i order at this restaurant . of course that 's not gon na happen due to the unsatisfactory experience this time . i proceeded to ask for a partial refund , which the guy on the phone took very personally and shouted `` no way , no way that 's gon na happen '' , and proceed to accuse me of lying . called eatstreet , full refund . 1/10 , but thanks for the free lunch .	4046
1	my typical dish of choice is orange chicken with fried rice . it 's amazing . i wish i could afford to eat every meal there ... i no longer live in laveen , but i will be travelling back to laveen ( and who wants to do that ) just to have lunch/dinner at my favorite chinese place in phoenix . yummy !	4047
1	rice and sushi were great . service was fast and we loved that they had duck sauce ! ! we will be back	4047
1	we love this place for take out ! big portions , although i 've been disappointed by the sushi the couple times we 've tried that . but the orange chicken is good and my 18mo son loves the fried tofu . and the egg rolls are delish !	4047
1	this place has great prices , huge portions , and delicious food . we really enjoyed eating here . the service was friendly and fast too . we were very pleased with the sweet and sour chicken , mongolian beef , orange chicken and the raw salmon sushi we got . the egg rolls could use something other than cabbage in them and my husband thought the las vegas roll was missing something . on our trip to phoenix we have had terrible service almost everywhere we have gone . this hole-in-the-wall chinese place was the best by far .	4047
1	best sushi and chinese food around ! not to mention probably the cheapest . you ca n't go wrong at li 's !	4047
1	greatest place ! i love their sushi ! even if your not into raw sushi they most certainly have fried sushi like the vegas rolls ! ! ! so delicious , i so recommend this place ! if you have not yet been here you got ta stop on by !	4047
1	i 'm no sushi connoisseur , so i ca n't tell you if this is good sushi or not . i can only say that i absolutely love the sushi here , especially the fried stuff like the las vegas roll .	4047
1	one of my favorite take out sushi spots . i even bring my friends from work here to eat lunch . the sushi is very cheap but the quality is great . the food is definitely fresh . sushi rolls that normally costs $ 16 for a 18 roll only costs around $ 7 here . fried rice is also good , but i normally pick this up on the way home to eat sushi .	4047
1	general tso 's chicken is my all time favorite thing ... this place is spot on everytime	4047
1	good food , large portions and decent prices . we often phone our order in to save some time . favorites include the pot stickers , chow mein , chicken and mixed veggies and seafood dynamite roll .	4047
1	i love this place continually since they have opened . fair prices and consistently great food . they are quick to make a call in order and it never takes more then 10-15 minutes . if they delivered i 'd be in debt .	4047
1	i absolutely love to eat here . it is close to my neighborhood and is actually pretty clean . the girl in the front is always very friendly and the food is super tasty . there is a lot of variety and i as a cook myself do recommend this place to anyone that has a craving for sushi or chinese ! ! !	4047
1	such good chinese food ! my husband and i had been going to a place near us , but it was just not good . this place is awesome . truly tasty , cooked perfectly and great portions . the food was ready in no time , too . we had orange chicken- just the right amount of kick , sesame chicken-tasty and chicken low mein- plenty of yummy vegetables . this will be our go-to chinese place !	4047
1	ok- first this i not fine dining it 's a fast food that said : it has a good selection of chinese and sushi . worth a midweek stop for take out . here 's the run down . shrimp and lobster sauce- not a typical presentation but good with plenty of shrimp . gyoza- deep fried with hot dipping sauce . ate them all california supreme roll- yummy and made fresh while i watched . rainbow roll- looked good and tasted good ! yellowtail sashimi- good for fast food fried rice-standard over all worth a visit if you need take out on your way home from work . will visit again .	4047
1	i love there shrimp and lobster with fried rice . good value no frills restaurant but clean , and folks are friendly !	4047
1	amazingly great food and light on the wallet ! i usually get something different every time now that they have an expanded menu	4047
1	huge portions , way cheaper than other chinese restaurants . recommended !	4047
1	got some orange chicken and fried rice to go . fried rice needs some salt . added pinch of salt , it tasted really good and fresh . orange chicken was really good too !	4047
1	this place is great ! my family loves the food . it 's classic chinese american , and it 's always done well . i 'm moving out of the area soon and will definitely miss this place .	4047
1	i love this place . there is nothing i have tried there that was not a solid , well made dish . good sushi , good soup , good appetizers , good everything . i can not think of a single dish that really stands out , but every single item i 've tried is fresh , exactly the right temperature , large portioned , and seasoned exactly the way it 's supposed to be . the prices are very good also . i go to li 's often and will keep going for a long time !	4047
1	perfect . wings are huge and fried perfectly . all 10 did n't even fit in the box . and that is a small sesame chicken , small mongolian beef , and small pork fried rice . egg rolls are huge too but i ate them !	4047
1	omg - kung pao chicken ! ! ! so damn good ! never order the small , you get bang for the buck ! on food here with the large . the lady handed my amazing kung pao chicken , and my arm literally dropped , had to weigh it , 3.5 lbs of food for under $ 10 . general tsao 's chicken is also amazing ! not a bog fan of chinese food night , but always williing to go for some li 's bowl !	4047
1	i 've been going here for over a year , and i must say that they keep getting better and better . i would have given them a three rating the first time , but i believe the recipes consistently improve . i am a lover of general tso chicken , and get it every time i go . my wife likes to vary her purchases , and agrees with the assessment that the food is getting better as well . it 's really just a typical chinese food place , but the execution is well above average . prices are pretty good too .	4047
1	i 've tried a lot of their chicken . i love their fried chicken wings . i 've checked a lot of places in az and is hard to find some . i would take li 's chicken over churchs anyday .	4047
1	i should start with the caveat that i 'm giving it four stars considering its location . anywhere else ( san francisco , seattle , etc . ) i think it would be just average chinese food and sushi , but for arizona i think it 's definitely four stars . the sushi is decent -- nothing amazing but it 's not bad either . i 've been pleased with the entrees i 've tried and the servings are generous . my family of four usually gets three entrees and a large soup , and we have plenty of leftovers for the next day .	4047
0	i 've been going there for 6 years . definitely less in the last few years . it 's sad to see that the food quality went downhill every time i go . they went from the best orange chicken place to one of the worst . soggy chicken is worse orange sauce . the lo mein is still decent , sushi is ok and really one of the only sushi options in the area	4047
0	used to go here frequently and the food was excellent ... .sad to report that they 've gone down hill . was in the area and went there ... .my friend ordered the teriyaki chicken which he reported as flavorless ... .and made him sick in addition ! ! i ordered a las vegas roll ... ..very disappointed ! poor flavor & extremely small to what they used to be . needless to say ... ..will never go back ! ! ! !	4047
0	just not good . this was my first time dining at li 's bowl . my lunch companion and i selected the chicken fried rice , eggdrop , and wonton soup . my lunch companion said the egg drop soup was okay . however , the won ton soup and chicken fried rice was very bland and very greasy , yes even the soup was greasy . overall just not good food . i 'd like to end on a positive note . the service was outstanding . the staff is friendly and inviting and will explain everything on their menu . the prices and serving portions ca n't be beat . i just wish the food was a better quality .	4047
0	this is a chinese food place primarily not an asian fusion . the two rolls that we got ( las vegas roll and crunchy roll ) were flavorless and almost made my wife vomit . the chinese food was rather good ( chicken friend rice and sweet & sour chicken ) pro-tip - avoid the japanese portion of their menu and center in on the chinese portion to be safe . their sushi was neither fresh or tasty .	4047
0	i love the food and regularly order until today , i order for pick up and they had my order wrong easy mistake i ordered spicy tuna roll they made tuna roll i noticed before i left so was able to explain the order was wrong the asian lady in front replied `` whatever '' when i asked excuse me whatever what she said i know you said tuna ... ... .and laughed ... .she obviously has no manners not understanding she did n't have to say that and then stated whatever i fix . i have no plans to ever order from this establishment again	4047
0	very disappointed . thinking it was a resturant . it has a fast food type atmosphere from which you order off a board . food was not authentic and had some very generic tasting chinnese items . i have to say the shrimp in paco crumbs was tasty , but i would have a hard time coming back here again .	4047
0	i think any restaurant that disrespects a customer deserves a one . just took take out and specifically asked for the egg drop soup to be served dine in , while we waited for our take out . a long wait ensues - about 15 mins - no soup , no take out . our order gets called , so i come up to the counter . i point out that we did order the soup for dine-in . the woman nods then says ... `` hmmm ... whatever ... '' she proceeds to call out the next take out order . i walk out and tell myself i would never give these people a penny of my business ... ever !	4047
0	i love food and most ppl would say i 'm a foodie . with that being said , i was n't happy with the food at all . the shrimp fried rice is a joke to say the least . the color of the rice threw me off . not sure that the rice was cooked all the way either . garlic shrimp was ok . they just threw way to many different veggies in with it . normally you would get the onion and bell peppers . nope not this place here . it had baby corn , mushrooms , broccoli , onions , bell pepper and etc ... .this was my first and last time coming here .	4047
0	this place sucks ! ! i moved to the valley and have yet to find that `` go to `` chinese spot , sooo i decided to give this spot a try . i called my order in and was assured by the employee that all the food is cooked to order , always fresh . so i picked up my food , and what do you know , i got some old azz fried rice with some microwaved shrimp . wtf ? ? ! ! i give this place 2 thumbs down and i would not eat here if i was hungry as a hostage : (	4047
0	i 've been here once before and stopped on last saturday . i ordered the shrimp and broccoli and later that night i started getting stomach discomfort . the next day i had and still have food poisoning . will never return . i 'm still sick .	4047
0	pros food was good compared to other options in the area was in and out in less than 10 minutes but i was the only one there service was ok , did n't seem very welcoming but i was taking it to go cons i read so many reviews about portion size and i guess i came on a bad day , it barley fed me and my 2 year old ! i was still hungry and that never happens ! did n't care for the onions in the fried rice . there was more vegetables as well than meat . i guess if i 'm hungry for chinese i 'll come here or try some place else .	4047
0	the food is decent . the service is horrific . fist time i ordered from there they forgot 3 items in my order . second time i order from them they forgot 2 items . then when i call to ask about them the people talk to you like you 're bothering them . the restaurant was n't even busy so they ca n't even use that as an excuse for why they 're not checking the orders . never go here .	4047
0	i ordered sesame chicken and fried rice and my chicken was so soggy , and just sitting in a bowl of watery sauce . the fried rice was really just mexican rice . i also ordered sushi , and it wasnt that bad ... but obviously pre packaged . definitely not a good experience . i 'll stick to red dragon on 51st ave & baseline .	4047
0	had the orange chicken and garlic chicken and it 's ok , i 've had better . would n't go back .	4047
0	the food here used to be delicious when i first started coming here , but over the years the quality has gotten worse . i used to love eating here but now i only come here if i 'm in a hurry and even then the food is unsatisfactory . the customer service is n't really great either .	4047
0	this place is terrible . my coworkers would tell me how good this place is but i was dissatisfied . you are better off going to panda express , seriously . i did n't even finished eating my plate . never coming back here . there are hardly any good spots to eat in the laveen area	4047
0	li 's bowl has great egg drop soup ! unfortunately this is one of those places where they wo n't give you white meat for things like orange chicken , lemon chicken etc . at most of chinese spots they 'll let you substitute just for a bit more money . it 's a hybrid restaurant so they also sell sushi .	4047
0	got sesame chicken large . taste was alright , but there was whole lot of bread and very little chicken . it should be named sesame breaded instead . i feel like all my week of healthy eating was ruined by this meal . it tasted ok though . mcd asian alternative , made fresh , but very unhealthy !	4047
0	this place is terrible . i just moved to laveen and was craving some fried rice . the reviews were high so i tried it . big mistake . the food was over cooked and lacked flavor . i tried 2 sushi rolls , gyoza , and rice ... what a waste !	4047
0	am i the only one who thinks this place is bit that great . their servings for large are not that big and when i ordered beef fried rice there was hardly any beef in it . their drinks are over priced , they sell sushi but honestly would you buy sushi from a chinese place . its like buying mexican tacos from an italian restaurant . never coming back here .	4047
0	over priced and disappointed ..i order teriyaki chicken with fried rice.it came out to 12 dallors ..the chicken did n't even have teriyaki and it came with just chicken and peppers .the fried rice was small after i ate i was still hungry ..i rate the food 6 out of 10 nothing special . ..i could of got way more items and food at panda express and for a cheaper price ... would i come back no ... .they really need to add more food to the plates to make it worth the prices ... panda express is way better and cheaper ... ...	4047
0	only reason i gave them 1 star is because they have pepsi . you ca n't be an asian restaurant and not know how to make fried rice	4047
0	i ordered yellow tail sashimi and tempura sushi roll . the lady called my name and i went to pick up my food . she looked me in the eye and said `` these two bags '' . then handed me the receipt with my order . i drove 15 minutes home from a long day of work and found some fried shrimp and what looks like beef and broccoli . if the sushi was half bad as the poop wrong order she gave me i would n't even go back to get my order .	4047
0	do not eat here ! i went in yesterday with my family and we ordered a las vegas roll , beef and broccoli , orange chicken and fried rice with chicken . the flavor was just ok but the worst was about to come ! my whole family got sick ! it was horrible absolutely horrible i called the owner to give them a heads up , not to get money just to let them know they should look into it . nope ! ! the owner laughed and down played it seriously you could kill someone wow just wow !	4047
0	i 'm used to real tasting authentic chinese food . and this was far from it . i ordered change chicken lo mein and an egg roll . the crust of the egg roll had a weird greasy taste and my lo mein smelled like fish which i thought was odd . also the chicken was not real chicken . lots of coating of sauce and no meat flavor to it . i was very upset i spent my money here . i see why they had no business when i walked in . only go here if you 're desperate for chinese food and do n't care for flavor or quality . sad to say panda taste a a lot better than this place .	4047
1	great service , nice looking store ! good prices & service ! have tried the others and will always keep coming back exhale nevada ! ! !	4048
1	i lovvvveeeee this place . there is a another dispensary in walking distance of this one but this one is soooo much better . the staff is extremely nice and helpful . very reasonable prices and they even have deals/sales . soooo many options on bud , edibles , concentrate . they have everything you need .	4048
1	came in after my night out was over because i didnt feel intoxicated enough to pass out good when i got home so i stopped in exhale because its off the freeway on the way home ! first time i made a purchase here and was helped byareally friendly consultant whowas really nice to chat with and very accomodating , showed me alot of diff products and i ended up choosing a gram of platinum cookies , i was shocked when she toldme its was 10 $ out the door , what a great deal ! anditwassomepretty goodstuffforapurpleindicahybrid wow impretty high sorry about the typos , , , , , , , of bye bye : )	4048
1	open late night and the budtenders are highly knowledgeable , professional , and nice . the budtender opened up and let me know how cbd has help his depression . he did n't need to get into his personal life but that assured me that he was being honest . he knew all the laws of bringing cbds to the airport and how the airport is considered federal property . highly knowledgeable and not pushy or annoyed to answer questions . definitely recommend !	4048
1	hello , happy thanksgiving , shabbat shalom ! was how they greeted me when i walked in . very welcoming , friendly and educational ! just a few thoughts about my experience.. if you are at the palms or the rio it 's walkable , but if you are staying on the strip you can uber it for five bucks . i especially appreciate that they are open late and early and on holidays , very cool . i recommend and will return when i 'm in town ! thank you ! !	4048
0	called and asked directions to be connected to someone who did n't understand they even worked at a dispensary . stay away very rude	4048
0	i 've spent over $ 1500 here no problems till i bought a torch , a piece of shit , called they said come on back , then said take it or leave it , no store credit , very rude , never ever going back !	4048
0	manager would not exchange a defective cartridge i returned the very next day after buying . clearly thier product , clearly in my record but would not exchange it without reciept . unreal . i originally paid for a full gram cartridge and was only offered20 % discount for my next purchase . bad customer service . they suck . just started going there too . double check your product before you put it on the shelves !	4048
0	just opened some sauce i got from them and apparently they store their sauces upside down , so if you like getting home with sauce and having it all stuck in the lid and a pain to deal with and a mess then go here .	4048
0	i used to come here a lot , then after being mistreated for the first time , i stopped going . gave them another chance today because they have that great sale of 3 prerolls for $ 30 . the only thing i asked is the percentage of thc for each one of them , because i know i need something at least 18 % or more . he says : '' they are all little bit over 19 % . '' ok , great . i check the labels at home and it 's 15.52 % , 17.13 % and 18.17 % ! i live 5min away , but it 's not worth it coming back here .	4048
1	i just had a wonderful experience at this fedex office ship center . an extremely kind woman named debbie was working today , and went well above and beyond the call of duty to help me with my situation today . i had a long scan and fax to complete . debbie helped me get it completed and made sure that i was happy and satisfied with the end result . i am extremely grateful for her kindness and generosity today . thank you debbie !	4049
1	after a horrible experience at ups down the road i 'm thankful for the help of fedex . fedex was able to ship my long awkward size package for less than half the cost of ups store ! ! uriel was super helpful and patient dealing with me . but because of his customer service i will be going to be going back again very soon and continue to use them for my personal and business shipping needs . he even hooked me up with some coupons for next time ! ! ca n't beat that . highly recommend coming here to ship for your christmas gifts since the wait is little to none , unlike the nearby usps . thanks again uriel !	4049
1	just went there about an hour ago . the location was n't bad and the store was semi new and was not a `` full service '' location ( no computers ect ) . staff was friendly but not so proficient at the job at this time .	4049
1	i drove here but found no location . gps must be wrong . horrible for not having the correct location written .	4049
0	though the lady who helped me was extremely kind and apologetic , this location did n't have anything that i needed . if you need shipping , they can handle it , but certainly do n't go to this location for any kind of printing or copying needs . extremely limited selection of paper , only one machine , and the cutting service was apparently `` broken '' . maybe i 'm being overly harsh , and i know some fedex locations are simply designed for shipping only , but please , do n't list yourself as an office and print location if you do n't in fact do those things satisfactorily .	4049
0	very limited on-site printing and service capabilities . not a particularly helpful counter person .	4049
0	rude , rude , rude . they offered to sell me a $ 12 dollar box as the girl talked about how much she received for shipping sales as i walked in the door . she also complained about a customer who was in earlier that day in front of me . to many red flags about the employees of this store . i excused myself and went to ups down the street .	4049
0	by far the most expensive ( 4 ) sheets of paper i 've ever printed . i can guarantee i will never come here again . i used the computer to print 4 , i say again , 4 sheets of paper . no color , nothing special , just 4 sheets . it came out to 10.00 freaking dollars ! ! ! ! ! ! are you kidding me ? ! ! ! ? ? wth is wrong with this location ? ? are you trying to get rich at our expense ! ? ! ? ? ? ? that 's insane . dont go here ! ! ! ! well , go ahead if you want to get ripped off ! ! ! !	4049
1	i you are looking for a delicious italian meal this is the place to go ! a great selection of appetizers and dishes to choose from and on point service . i will be bringing friends back here in the near future !	4050
1	just went once , but i really liked this place . the food was really delicious and carefully prepared . i had carpaccio and the wild mushroom ravioli . they also have great options of wine by the glass . the decor is really nice and the service was excellent - very attentive and efficient . i am just not giving it five stars because it is a bit pricy for what they offer . but i would definitely go back , specially if i need to take someone to a place that causes a good impression but is not too uptight .	4050
1	definitely a neighbourhood favourite . great value in the charcuterie for two . they have a nice wine list , you ca n't go wrong with their fresh pasta and the bruschetta special is always fun to try .	4050
0	quanto basta is italian for `` how much is enough . '' the answer is - once is more than enough . our waitress was having a bad day . the food was solid , but the cloud that she brought to our table overshadowed any food that was served . it was clear she was having some sort of dispute with the other waitress , who was crying behind the bar . definitely the best way to spend my cash on a friday night in a sleepy area of rosedale .	4050
0	nice decor with quaint bar you can enjoy your meal at . happy hour deals are a nice touch . friendly service . however , this week i requested the risotto special sans veal and was charged full price for my dish even without the meat . $ 32 for average risotto with peas & mushrooms . really ? very disappointing indeed . and lesson learned .	4050
0	pros : -nice ambience ; music , lighting , seats cons : -poor service ; slow , not knowlegable , aloof -bland dishes -expensive i do not recommend getting the squid ink pasta.. not true to the dish , just black coloured noodles .	4050
1	it 's a mall that i have been going to since i first existed in 1997 . the mall has a lot of stores and free wi-fi . some parts of the mall are dated such as walmart , sears , and the movie theatre , but it is a great place if you are looking for low to high end materials . the food court is the most exciting experience , man chu wok is my favourite restaurant there and there is a kfc with a refill station . it 's connected to transit , and regional services , and across the road to a best buy and a loblaws superstore .	4051
1	士嘉堡中心連接巴士总站，go station和轻轨，交通方便。隔离就系civic centre政府办公楼。商场改造后又靓又新左，虽然改造工程还在进行中，不过多了好多大牌店铺，真系可以逛大半日。而且还有电影院在商场内，真系唔行街都可以去看电影，唔会闷亲。	4051
1	i always go to the scarborough town center ! it 's a nice please lots of different shops . the food court is big but the thing that i do n't like is that there 's a lot of indian food in the food court ! but over all it 's a nice please especially this store called caribbean queen these sell amazing food it 's really good	4051
1	love this mall as it has all the stores i need and more . also love that unlike other malls , they 've got a mix between both high-end and affordable stores to choose from . the recent renovations to the food court are awesome and modernizes the vibe of the mall . they 've also got a big cineplex movie theatre attached to the mall and i like how the mall is basically attached to scarborough centre station so you do n't need to walk outside to get to the entrance of the mall .	4051
1	it 's my fav mall . they have everything you could want and then some . convenient location and great access to the ttc and via car .	4051
1	really nice shopping mall . has some good shops and department stores . bay and sears are good . there is the usual stores like gap , disney store etc but also some really cool restaurants like moxies . i would really recommend that place . food and service is really good .	4051
1	i much prefer going to this mall rather than my local . there is such a wide selection of stores and absolutely everything i need is all in one spot ( including the surrounding stores ) . not only is the shopping convenient but there is also a ttc / rt & go terminal just over the bridge from the food court which makes it one of the easiest malls to get to !	4051
1	i love this mall , i 've come here ever since i was a kid . there have been a lot of renovations to this mall . i especially like the fact that the mall is so big and you can also get on the subway to go downtown from there . in addition , there 's a bunch of parking and restaurants in and around the mall . jack astors , milestones , they even have a movie theatre inside the mall . one of my favourite malls in the gta , no doubt ! 4/5 .	4051
0	used to love this place , it is the closest mall to us , but man is it ever full now , i do n't bother going to the food court anymore , there are never any seats , the whole mall is getting nearly impossible to navigate , there are just too many people . recently , the mall has added a few stores , this has allows the place to look like every other mall , it has absolutely nothing that distinguishes it from other malls . avoid this place until they figure out how to deal with crowds .	4051
0	consistently disappointing mall with little reason to come . the shops are all understocked and the food is all dirty . the only joy to be found is when you finally get to leave this confusing jungle of garbage . do n't bother with the this place and head to fairview or yorkdale instead .	4051
0	this mall is not for me at all . i am not a huge fan of malls so keep that in consideration for my review . i have been coming here for years and have found it 's disappointing more then i 'd like to . it 's not awful it just however is rarely enjoyable to shop here . they have a pretty good selection of stores that i really enjoy but i find the mall in way too crowded with rude people . most of the time and the staff of different stores i find not as friendly than other locations in scarborough .	4051
0	worker at michael kors pushed me and told me to move . she could have asked nicely . did n't even face me . overall , i like stc .	4051
0	not the best location , not good if looking for children things or specifically infant clothing . would not recommen	4051
0	this review will pertain specifically to my experience in the food court . i have n't experienced the revitalized food court since its reopening , so i was quite excited to have an opportunity to grab some quick lunch here . loved the new options , however , between having my feet attach to the floor because of how stick it was and battling over 15 fruit flies during my quick meal , i was not impressed at all . we could not even finish our food because of how disgusted we felt . such a shame quite frankly .	4051
0	not a fan , it seemed like the food i got was old and stale . when i asked for a cup of water they said they were all out , which is a lie because their was a lady in front of me who just got one . overall there are many of other restaurants in the town centre that have better food .	4051
0	the shops are what you would expect anywhere you go like walmart foot locker etc ... all same , im however disappointed by the food court , waaaaay overpriced . big rip off , i work close so i could go there to eat but ... .. 9 $ -11 $ for footlong sub , everything is over 10bucks and the only affordable food is mc donald 's which has a huge line always . food is expensive and portions small and stingey . i feel like they may even manipulate prices at certain times of day since all menus are on monitors and i swear after 5pm i saw cheaper prices then at lunch . scam town center .	4051
1	great beer.matt cole has matured into a great craftsmen . food is pretty good overall . smokehouse wings are the best in c-town . the brewben is one of the best sandwiches i 've ever had . the root beer floats are an old timey treat for desert . giant portions , be warned .	4052
1	having limited access to some of their bottles here in indy , i was n't sure if i 'd like their beer much . an in-person visit sold me though . noteworthy foods : onion soup ( seriously i ca n't say enough good things about this soup-it was amazingly yummy ! ) the parma karma was good and a perfect pairing with lots of beer samples . beer faves : spooky tooth , trail head and ibusive ipa . went home with a growler of trail head pale ale . bar seating was loud and crowded , due to the football game , but we had no issues getting seated and our waitress was attentive and nice . woot !	4052
1	the beer and wings are amazing.. some of the best buffalo sauce you can get . however , my one complaint is that their menu is just too large . they do n't specialize enough on things they do really well , and there 's a lot of food on there that 's ok at best . also , the chips suck and you can sub them for fries .	4052
1	great place ! our whole family loves it ! no matter how busy they are the service is always good and the food is great ! !	4052
1	i love fatheads ! the food comes in large portions , and is always top notch . they have a huge menu with a lot of options . the only catch is you can not sub fries for chips , which is a bummer . no one wants chips ... would be 5 stars otherwise ! none the less , if you need a great place to eat- go to fatheads .	4052
1	wow everything about this place was fantastic ! good cold beer , the wings were ridiculous , the twisted brisket was amazing and the bartender was a lot of fun ! thanks monica and fat heads for making a boring dinner on the road for business worth while !	4052
1	great . tons of tasty beers , and the food is really good . the menu is huge and i 've never heard a complaint about a single dish . my personal favorite would be the killer flavored smoke house wings . solid level of heat and the smokiness of the wings is top notch .	4052
1	best wings and root beer ever ! with tvs and great service , what else do you need ? some pretty amazing sandwiches on that menu too !	4052
1	fatheads is the premier brewery and restaurant in the general cleveland area , there 's a reason that there is nearly always a wait even during the middle of the week they consistently grew world class beer and serve up some really solid food !	4052
1	great beer , great food , and great service ! we visited cleveland for a hockey tournament and ate at fat heads on saturday ! loved it so much we went again on our way out of town !	4052
1	great place for a quick bite before heading to the airport . service was great and food was good .	4052
1	the only down fall to this place is the wait . it is that popular that every time we go we have to wait for an hour and half . they are plenty of beers to sample while you wait . they brew their own beer at fat head 's and it is quite tasty . plenty of room of large parties and the parking is made for the busy restaurant . i recommend really any burger on their menu ! great place for a burger and a beer !	4052
1	great beer . great atmosphere . the food is amazing . burgers , headwiches , salads , wings , shrooms . patio is a great place to enjoy in the warner weather .	4052
1	was headed to sandusky ohio and wanted to stop in to fatheads for lunch . as a native of pittsburgh i 'm familiar with fatheads and love their beer . this location did not disappoint . their were 18 fatheads beers on tap . some of the regulars and some hard to find . my mom , wife and i spilt two fish and chips and their was a lot of leftover . this kids and grilled cheese and loved it . the growlers to go was great and the gift shop was cool . only thing was they did not sell bottles just growlers .	4052
1	monster menu , fantastic beer list . something for everyone ! every time we 're here , it 's a great time and fantastic food/beer . a terrific place to take out-of-towners for a taste of local cleveland .	4052
1	this place is always packed ! great selection of beer and the servings are huge ! try the fried mushrooms ! you can order whole pizza 's or the regular pub fare there but the real hit is the house brews ! check out the back area for pool tables and to watch the games !	4052
1	came here for a quick lunch during the week and the food was pretty good . sat at the bar and service was pretty good too . my only critique was that the bartender was overly focused on making chit chat and was n't listening to the order .	4052
1	fat heads is always fantastic ! ! had to wait a bit but i did n't mind ! had the nachos and the dla headwich which never disappoint !	4052
1	wings ! wings ! wings ! ! ! go with the beasty bbq smoke house wings or the parmesan buffalo style wings .	4052
1	delicious food and drink . place was packed but the staff still brought us everything we needed . fun atmosphere	4052
1	i really enjoyed my experience here , last week ! great atmosphere , great selection of food and beers . i ended up getting a pesto chicken sandwich and a bumbleberry lemonade . both were delicious and would recommend ! i 'll definitely be coming back	4052
1	huge menu , huge portions ! next time , i 'll definitely split a meal with my husband . beer is delicious , of course . our server was awesome and had great recommendations . we will definitely come back if we are up this way !	4052
1	took my father in law for his first visit here . he loved it . always a winner with me and he already wants to come back . he had the brewben and i had the beauty and the beasty . both were huge and delicious ! he ca n't stop raving about the crafted beer or the food . waiter was knowledgable and gracious . will be returning as soon as possible .	4052
1	i will tell anybody the craft beers here are off the chain and they have the real deal nyc hard apple cider.the portions here will give you a heart attack and high blood pressue.i know the place is decent because the saturday night we came the place had atleast 500 to 1000 people in here eating and the bathrooms were clean.i will say give fatheads a try .	4052
1	food is outstanding . if your a craft beer person it is a great place to go . however i am not .	4052
1	first time at fat heads brewery in north olmsted , and i must say why have n't i been any sooner . the beer is good the food is good the atmosphere is good . all around great place to hang out for the evening with some friends and family . this place is caters to all ... i definitely will be back next week to try more beer and food .	4052
1	this place has great fresh sandwiches and fries . to top it off -- great craft beer . my only wish is they always had the gogglefogger and bottled it . also would love to see less of a wait and more specials . the cheese fries are sooo good but a little steep at 8 bucks . also love bumble berry beer .	4052
1	great food here at fatheads ; as a matter of fact , of you have a craving for baby back ribs , you will not be disappointed ; they are very tasty and tender , but i would at least order a half rack ; their ribs are already filling enough . i also once ordered the fish and chips dinner , and i got one or two huge size fish fillets , very tasty as well . and the beers ? well , one of my very favorites is the bumbleberry , even better when you ask for double the blueberried for a garnish . all their beers are excellent ; got ta support your locally-made beers . no crap on tap - only craft !	4052
1	i had a chicken club sandwich that was amazing . my husband got some monstrous burger that he loved . we live out of town but will definitely come back when we are in the area again !	4052
1	i love fatheads ! the sandwiches and burgers are all great , i 've tried probably 7 of them at this point . the spicy cuban sandwich is my favorite , i 'd only recommend it if you can handle some heat . portions are always huge as well , i often take half a meal home . the beer is always good too , i love trying all of their seasonal rotating beer . their sunshine day dream is one of my favorites there . check out this place if you have n't .	4052
1	my son 's friend works here so i have to give it a five star . with that said , the service was great and the atmosphere just fine . it was crowded , that should tell you something : )	4052
1	i went there for the first time last month . the place was packed . i wish there was better sitting area during our wait . it was raining , so everyone was inside . the menu was vast . my food was pretty good . i ca n't wait to go back to try something different .	4052
1	fabulous beers and heady brews ! sometimes up to two hour wait which is nuts ! but definitely worth the wait . have a headhunter or two to pass the time !	4052
1	grilled chicken sandwich with banana peppers , onions , mushrooms & swiss cheese . salad everything included & blueberry beer taste good	4052
1	great beer huge sandwiches enough fries for 10 people . efficient but we had to work to get our server to smile	4052
0	if you like customization this place is not for you . if you order a wrap you get chips . burgers come with fries . too bad ? well you can pay an extra $ 4 for fries with your wrap . that sucks . the best part about this place is the beer .	4052
0	beer is fantastic but the bartenders could n't care less about their customers . i 'm here from chicago so rest assured i do not hold a grudge against this establishment ... the bar tenders seemed like robots who cared little for human interaction . 4 of our 5 beer orders were taken with no words . at the end of our evening the bartender was eating behind the bar and checking out a fellow employees new prescription . weird . never felt like less of a guest than this . btw , the beer is pretty good . just do n't expect to be tested like you 're welcome . also , bar back guy is awesome .	4052
0	heaping portions of really average , somewhat tasteless food -- that was our experience of fat heads . if you go for the beer ( and we did n't ) , it may be a different story . food was really uninspired in all 4 of our meals . just really meh .	4052
0	not bad , but not great . portion sizes are out of control , so its definitely a quantity over quality type of place . smoked chicken wings were enormous , but were tough and had little to no flavor , which was disappointing . loaded fries as an app were good , and the enormous portion was enough for 4-6 people . prime rib sandwich and 1 # hot dog were alright , but nothing to write home about . the menu is very large and would probably go back to try some other items .	4052
0	good food - cheese sticks and prime rib dip were on point . unfortunately , there 's a pretentious rule that you ca n't sub fries for chips , and it 's apparently not communicated to patrons politely . not everyone enjoys thick-cut chips . bartender service was inconsistent ; one rolled his eyes over a request of ranch while others offered prompt , courteous service . we waited 15 minutes to cash out the tab . not many patrons enjoy feeling they 're at the subservience of the establishment . important to note , the bartenders had plenty of time to check their phones repeatedly ...	4052
0	its always so talked up . the food is meh , but you wont leave hungry . the beer selection seems wide , but i do n't overpay for beer so its lost on me . go for the beer if you know what you are ordering . always a wait . always feels dirty , given last visit the roof was leaking which was obviously not intended . parking is terrible . annoyingly loud people . not much positive to say ... oh blueberries in the bumble-berry was actually pretty sweet . but that is all i got . i 'm dropping the over-hyped card on this one .	4052
0	this place feels like budwieser bought an applebees . ugh !	4052
0	large and loud dining room . booths are all wood and quite uncomfortable . some tvs but not as many as i expected in such a large place . surly waiter . he was good at taking clues as to when we needed refills and were ready to order . highest priced wings ever- and they 're not any better than the ones i 've had elsewhere . average sandwiches and super-gready chips that you are not allowed to substitute under penalty of death .	4052
0	i 'm currently sitting at the bar . i just finished a over done burger and i 'm drinking a coke because i have a professional engagement . my meal has been finished for close to 20 minutes . i mean , plate empty , glass empty , waiting for the check finished . so where is my server ? i do n't know , and if you find him , could you send him over with my check , i got somewhere i need to be . update : 20 minutes later as my server was leaving for the day , he notoced i was still there . amazing .	4052
0	new servers suck and they will overcharge you for beers even if you did n't even drink em ... stay classy !	4052
0	an hour and a half wait for an out of towner , that beer better have been touched by jesus ... they should open up a second location because this brewery was as packed as a school dance . we ended up going next door .	4052
0	love the beer obviously . .this rating goes to the queens of mean..kelly and monica . ..1 star for them ... brother in law /wife and friends treated poorly by those two ... do n't get it ... .great place , rest of staff is good . i 'd be pissed if i had to share my tips with them .	4052
0	this used to be a great place . a hidden little gem . not any more . while the food and beer have stayed the same , the atmosphere has n't . they have recently added a bottling machine to the brewery . it is unbearable ! so loud , you ca n't have a conversation . do not go here anymore . go to the one in north olmsted .	4052
0	went at 6:00pm on friday with a group of 7 . the wait was 1hr 20min , which is n't surprising based on the time and our group size . the portions are huge , and everyone 's food was pretty good , but not great . i was not very impressed with their house beers . again , not bad , but not worth a return trip . the service was above average . overall the place is fine . i did n't come away with any complaints . but for the calories consumed , i 'd much rather have eaten somewhere else .	4052
0	i ordered the philly cheesesteak because the server said it was one of their more famous dishes and it was less-than-inspiring .	4052
0	make sure they give you the bacon you are due . my triple bypass burger came with a half slice of bacon and when i asked about the menu description , `` lots of bacon '' they said that was a play on words . how does lots of bacon become 1/2 slice of bacon . do they mean bacon molecules ? ? ? ?	4052
0	no just no . horrible service ! ! ! ! when will they learn it 's okay to substitute . i 'm the customer i want it me way . lol	4052
0	take out steak salad was just plain awefull . i 've had it in the dining room , and it was great ... take out sucked . it had one quarter of one red potato , no grilled peppers , and the steak was 75 % grizzle . the `` greens '' were iceberg lettuce . if i got this dining in , i would have returned it ... very disappointing .	4052
0	2nd time here from nc . good beer ( jack straw pilsner ) , but food is not good . in our group , ribs came out burnt , when returned under done , sandwiches are big , but a lot of bread . to me , typical of ohio- a lot of quantity , but food quality is lacking .	4052
0	called ahead for a large table ... when speaking to the host on the phone she assured us that we would have a table upon arrival . when our large party arrived they claimed that we had not called ahead ... .. i pulled out my phone and showed the manager my recent calls and provided the name of the employee i spoke to ... . this was a huge inconvenience for all of us . will not make arrangements to come here again .	4052
0	a big fan of bumbleberry so thought we 'd try the restaurant . unfortunately we were sorely disappointed . dirty restaurant , slow service , rude service , flat beer , i could go on . food was okay which is only reason it gets a second star . i really wanted to like it , but just could n't do it . stick to buying the beer via retail .	4052
0	only 1 word describes this place ... ... ... ... . yuck ! bad food , bad beer , bad service , bad atmosphere ... ... ... ... ...	4052
0	great beer . really bad food . i got a party melt and there was a small 7 oz burger in the middle of a huge pirerce of bread . so much bread left over , the server asked if i wanted a box . the chips were in edible . so old , and soggy , that i could not get my teeth through them .	4052
0	farrrrrrrr from impressed . you can get better food from anywhere . the place was really cool , large , and festive but the food was very mediocre . no one finished their food or took boxes to go . when this happens with my family you know we were farrrrr from impressed . burger buns were hard and the cheesestake was not impressive . what sucked so much is that we were dying to eat here and left wishing we had n't wasted our money .	4052
0	if you are not a beer drinker ... .do n't go . food is subpar and drinks taste watered down .	4052
0	i used to love this place , but lately the food just is n't that great . the sandwiches are soooo big but over-priced . i really wish that all the sandwiches would come with fries instead of having to pay extra for a side of them . the blueberry beer is good , however , it tastes different depending when you go ! wish they had some tasty fried pickles and that the soft pretzels were fresh like they used to be !	4052
0	i did not arrive until 11 pm , but the place was dirty , bartenders were disinterested ( more interested in watching the nba game ) , and the bar smelled a little like barf . made my way here because i thoroughly enjoyed my pittsburgh fh 's experience a few years ago . did n't love the cleveland version .	4052
0	lovely wife and i had dinner at fh tuesday night and we wo n't be going back any time soon . it 's definitely not our style of food but we found a couple promising items . our wings were dry and had very little flavor , wife 's salad had some rotten lettuce and my chicken sandwich was small with dry meat . the server seemed pissed off too . i guess i can see the attraction here but i hoped for better food .	4052
0	went here for the first time on the 4th of july . we didnt have to wait to be seated . took a few minutes for our server to arrive and take our drink orders . she was apparently not happy to be working on the 4th and it showed ! we ordered the sampler of 8 different beers . they were ok , nothing great . my husband ordered a sandwich . it was giant , but he said it wasnt anything great . i ordred the black bean veggie burger and it had no taste at all . overall we were disappointed . the service was not very good and the food was mediocre . wont be going back .	4052
0	i would have rated this place higher if they did n't charge for a sample taste of their brews . $ 2.50 for a sample ... c'mon ! granted it was a 5oz glass , but when i say i want to `` try a taste '' , do n't hand me 5oz and then charge me for it . the food was good . not great , but good . portions are very large , so you do get your money 's worth . atmosphere is very good . i 'm just very hung up on the sample charge .	4052
0	this place is terrible food wise . i would not recommend this to anyone that i really liked or cared for . the food is very spicy & not worth the money that you work hard for to pay for something that you ca n't even eat . it is terrible . i was sick for 2-3 days from all the spicyness that they have on their food . it is well over rated . building is pretty but that is about it .	4052
0	what can i say but `` where 's the service ? '' how can you have so many servers running around and still not get any service . i am not sure if it is lack of training , the age of the servers or just their attitude towards their job , but it will sure hurt their business if they do n't address the issue . restaurant owners need to understand that their staff can make them or break them . i know we will think twice before returning .	4052
0	the only reason , and i truly mean the only reason i come to this establishment is because my boyfriend loves the beer . but i do n't find it appetizing whatsoever . the `` headwiches '' are incredibly soggy , have almost no flavor , and extremely difficult to eat . the wings however , are pretty good . though , i 'm able to eat the `` killer '' wings and not think they 're spicy at all , they 're perfectly cooked though . since i do n't drink the beer ( which i 've tried and think it 's gross ) i drink the wine , which is tasty . i stomach through this meal just because my significant other loves it .	4052
0	horrible service , our sever was rude did a bad facial expression when were ordering . will never return . we felt mistreated will never support this beer or brand again .	4052
0	service was good and the foods that my friends and boyfriend ordered were good ( pizza , burger and grilled cheese ) but my veggie sandwich was just okay . the portions are huge so i took half of my sandwich home where i found a hair in it the next morning . definitely not happy . i would give them a higher rating if not for the hair . i would probably try it again , but would double check my food or just drink beer .	4052
1	we are getting our rental house ready to put on the market , and reached out to nunez painting to repaint our fence and do some drywall repairs on our patio ceiling . they were prompt and courteous , and even finished the work a day earlier than expected . they did an awesome job - i will definitely be calling them for my next paint job !	4053
1	nunez painting team did an excellent job on the exterior painting of our two story house . the detailing is defining and the overall outcome turned out the way my wife and i envisioned . joe and crew worked like a team by assisting each other , always moving strategically to keep the project going forward and providing a quality experience . i arrived on monday to discuss details and ensure we both were on the same page . if anything was discussed , they made it happen . i checked in on the final day and as we did a walk around , anything needing adjusted was done immediately . thank you for the hard work and service provided . eric d .	4053
1	excellent job ... they came in and taped off the kitchen n entry way , painted and cleaned up in 2hrs ... very neat would recommend highly !	4053
1	lorena and her crew did an exceptional job painting the whole exterior and most of the interior of our 2-level home . they were friendly , professional , and efficient . i am amazed at how much they accomplished in only 3 days . i was n't looking forward to moving anything to get ready for the paint , but i did n't need to worry because the crew took care of it all . lorena and her brother came to the site each day and were very attentive . lorena 's pricing is very fair and competitve as well . i 100 % recommend this company and will use them for all of my future painting needs .	4053
0	do n't waste your time with these super unprofessional people ! whoever answered the phone does n't even use a business name or tell you who you 're calling and when i scheduled an appointment for an estimate they never even showed up or called . call anyone else .	4053
0	i 'm sure they do good work , but i 'll never find out . i 've been trying to contact lorena for almost a week now and cant seem to get a response . i 've tried messaging and calling , still no response . if this is how they treat someone that wants to hire them , i doubt they 'd respond to an actual paying customer .	4053
0	well i guess they only need the business when their hurting for money . no way to run a business people can trust . you never know , you may have everything ready to go and another job comes along that pays more money and they forget all about you ... ... ...	4053
0	emailed for a quote . was given a time they would stop over next day . two hours after appointment , no show . emailed back hour later . receive response next day of , `` what time will work for you today . '' no explanation as to why they did n't show up the day before , no excuse , nothing . very unprofessional .	4053
1	iam rather new in scarborough . i 've been to two other breakfast joints around the area , so far this was the best . the service was on point and the portion sizes were decent . ca n't really think of anything negative to say , but i am definitely coming back .	4054
1	this is my favourite sunset grill so far ! it 's the cleanest , has the best atmosphere with the friendliest staff ! i got the eggs sunset , and asked for added spinach . the portion is generous-worth the price and it did not disappoint ! the eggs were the perfectly cooked ( asked for overeasy ) , delicious home fries and they did not cheap out on the hollandaise sauce . my boyfriend got the sunset super , which he was very pleased with . he 's very particular with his pancakes but they were delicious- fluffy , soft and moist ! our server sarah was great ! she was knowledgeable and attentive . definitely will be coming back here very soon !	4054
1	it 's like sunday morning breakfast at mom 's . friendly staff that always remembers you and food is always on point . extra bacon regular style ... yum !	4054
1	not a bad spot ... very clean and presentable . food was fast and quick . i would say french toast would be the way to go if your a toast man . unlike the other franchises this one actually makes the french toast from scratch ( some cinnamon and nutmeg would make it stellar ) . but ye ... . if you in the area , hit it : p	4054
0	i ordered the eggs sunset and asked for my eggs to be poached soft . 1/3 eggs were actually soft , the other 2 were medium . should 've gone to eggsmart . not impressed . the home fries were good though but does n't make up for the botched eggs i received .	4054
0	we go here occasionally with a lunch group that gathers every friday at different restaurants . the food is pretty good . my complaint is they ca n't seem to serve a group of 8 to 12 people and get all the orders right . plus , they serve half of us and by the time food comes for the others , the first bunch is almost done eating . toast never comes out at the same time as the meals . it 's toast.how hard is it to make that ? i think if they had even one more person on staff , they could get it right . and yet , we keep going back .	4054
0	i been this place many times because it was close to my home . however , they most look like always have short stuff . food take long time , the waitress always in rush and go . it 's hard to find for call for help . the most problem is jam , honey , all other condiments are only available when you ask them and they bring very little . they need to hire some more friendly waitress before they lose their customer . all availability condiments should be on the table . good luck .	4054
0	horrible service . had to grab my own menu , my own cutlery , food was sub par for what they charge ( a side of bacon is the same cost as purchasing an entire package at a grocery store ) . over cooked , and small portions . `` fresh squeezed '' orange juice.. not fresh.. full of preservatives . server threw the bill at us at the end of the meal . it was n't overly busy , and we never raised complaint , so her behaviour was kind of unexpected and rude . wont be going there again and will be advising others that it 's not worth going to . next time we stay home and just make our own..	4054
1	i enjoy this place because its near my apartment and its open until 3am every night ! forget the appetizers and sides..none of them are exceptional . just get 2 petitte filets rare with no butter and save room for the bananas foster for $ 30 ... .a pretty pimp dessert indeed .	4055
1	good points - open till 3a.m ! like a good steak house in vegas should be ! live music good appetizers love the sizzling dishes that come out - loaded with flavor yummy garlic mashed potato 's great service laid back yet upscale off the strip and easy to park downside - not the best location , but it beats fightin your way into a big hotel on a busy weekend and waiting in a long line to get in , walk thru a giant casino , wait for table , walk alllllllll the way back to valet , wait for valet !	4055
0	i have been to another one of these in northern california and i have to say i was disappointed in my steak . it was charred on the outside and i could n't cut it with my fork like i normally can . not a good place to check out in vegas . i would try another steakhouse .	4055
0	typical ruth chris and any other `` big steak '' and `` big side dish '' place . not an attractive location . we are better off that it is closed .	4055
1	ok , i 've been living in madison for over a year , and had been trying to find a place with decent but inexpensive chinese food . fugu was ok , but overpriced and their delivery is slow . ichiban seemed just ok . i 've tried others with no luck . finally i tried double 10 , and i 'm soooooo happy ! it 's really good , but also way cheaper than anything else i 've found in town . i really liked the garlic sauce they have . they also had super fast service . this is my new go to chinese place !	4056
1	fourth time here and the food is so delicious . tonight i 'm having the garlic chicken which is virtually perfect . my son is having the traditional kung pao chicken which is too spicy for me but the flavor is wonderful .	4056
1	would recommend it . a north china flavor and very good service . better check the chinese menu if you wan na try something really chinese .	4056
1	love homestyle tomato & egg ! my favorite dish growing up and i was so happy i found it here . also the braised pork belly is so good .	4056
1	i eat here at least once a week . if you come here do yourself a favor and get something from their traditional chinese menu . great bang for your buck .	4056
1	this place has some authentic northern chinese dishes and the dumplings tastes great . the location is very convenient .	4056
0	seriously disappointed . i ordered sesame chicken and fried rice . a classic meal that should be pretty straight forward for any chinese restaurant , but no . the chicken tasted nothing like sesame chicken and it looked more like sweet and sour chicken with sesame seeds thrown on top . the `` fried rice '' was more like regular rice with a bit of soy sauce and scant appearances of egg . seriously disappointing . i have no idea how this place got such high reviews .	4056
0	no . i do n't care for this at all . we ordered delivery . even crappy chinese usually has enough msg to make it tasty . this was bland and dry ! we ordered curry chicken combination and general tsao 's chicken . they were both not spicy enough and dry . let it swim in the sauce please ! the veggies in the dish were few and far between . the egg rolls were not crispy . bland . boring . i will try somewhere else next time . the star is only for delivering to the correct location .	4056
0	definitely overrated . they screwed up our order . overall their food is bland and disappointing . the only positive is that their service was fast despite how understaffed they are .	4056
0	i literally had the worst singapore mei fun in madison . except for extremely hot , it was tasteless . i do like hot food . but this dish is simply great amount of hot sauce mixed with mei fun and a little meat . i wonder if the cook ever know what is singapore mei fun , or he/she ever try his/her own singapore mei fun .	4056
0	ordered delivery , they never brought it . hunger levels very high right now . mad .	4056
0	the orange chicken was mostly dark meat and very tough and not spicy . the lo neon was very salty . the soups were average and the price reasonable . you get what you pay for . not the best .	4056
1	i really enjoyed my meal . i got the rack of lamb and i would have sucked the bones clean , except it 's kind of a nice place . the husband got the fillet and we split the calamari , which was outstanding . it comes with this jalapeno jelly which was sweet and spicy all at once . it 's a little off the strip , but well worth the trip . the live piano music is pretty neat , too .	4057
1	if you are looking to get off the strip and chill at a trendy spot this is a must try . the bar/lounge area gives you a lot of versatility for people watching and mingling . the happy hour offers 1/2 off on all appetizers . score !	4057
1	chef eric nennaman cooks the best lamb chops in the world considering i do n't usually eat lamb ; d i hope that tells u something . his calamari appetizer is to die for !	4057
0	love the artisan ... ..i do n't feel the same about mood . it almost took 45 min before we got service , before then it was sooo empty with nobody around that i could almost hear the crickets over the club mixes coming from right outside the door . the place looked like a set off of the movie clue , the server was just bad and she brought my friend burnt hard toast with out the idea to replace it ... ..	4057
0	too bad . kind of disappointed considering the pedigree of the chef . i did not except robuchon style food but definitely a little bit more inspiration . on a sunday , service at the bar was `` detached '' and uninterested . the green salad was plain . the seabass was cooked properly but with just some mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach on the side and no twist . with places such as lotus of siam , raku , ichiza off the strip , why bother ?	4057
0	i did n't like much about this place . the service was poor and the food was n't good at all . the staff was not polite . i ca n't even say anything else but do n't go there .	4057
1	this is a great aroma , that manages to get even custom orders correct . rarely too busy , and a fast kitchen , too . food is comparable to other aromas . parking is a little crazy because of the bottleneck where it is . otherwise , no issues !	4058
1	great location bright and cheery . friendly staff make you feel at home and of course great selection of healthy food options . their bread is sooo delish ! ! if you 're looking for a good place to meet friends for a quick meal or coffee , this location is awesome .	4058
0	dont go to this location if you want a proper iced cappucino . the service was slow and guy seemed like he couldnt care less . the manager needs to do a much better job at hiring people .	4058
0	on a good day , it 's a five star . last visit got it two stars as two of three sandwiches were prepared wrong . they have to get their act together .	4058
1	when i first was booking my megabus ticket from pittsburgh to nyc i was very skeptical about taking the megabus because of the reviews , especially because i was going to take an overnight bus . do n't worry ! the bus was great ! the bus drivers were nice , yes they were bold but also hilarious ! i slept like a baby , but would wake up at the rest stops . if you are traveling alone and are freaking out a bit , there are tons of people on the bus and you automatically feel safe . hop on and enjoy this affordable bus ride !	4059
1	we just returned from a round trip from pittsburgh , pa to nyc . this was our first time we traveled to nyc this way . the trip was awesome . our driver to nyc was incredible ! she drove through heavy rain , assisted a disabled passenger with compassion and care to assure her safety , even asking if we could get her food when we stopped for lunch and kept us abreast of our journey and time frames . we would do it over and over again . it was nice to have someone else to safely take charge of the road .	4059
1	was a smooth ride roundtrip from pa to ny . the drivers were nice , the bus was clean and everything worked as advertised . even the restroom aboard was clean . reasonable rest stop too . i was very pleased with my 1st experience , for the cheap price it exceeded my expectations and that 's coming from somebody that traveled with two young children too . oh and the arrival departure times were on point too : )	4059
1	first ride ever on megabus . it 's going to be full after college station . weekend trip to nyc . the bus lift right on time . i like having power to charge my phone .	4059
0	the driver was one of the rudest people i 've ever met in my life . the driver said the bag was too heavy so i took out a second bag and tried to buy a second ticket but she would n't let me because she said the bag was too heavy . it was a circular argument . when i tried to call her out on her faulty logic she walked away from me . the bag was not more than 50 lbs . i know this because it actually weight less than it did when i took it from the airport .	4059
0	the most horrible bus company in the world the bus driver keep yelling and screaming on us to go against the wall like we are criminals and i 'm talking on all the passenger i could n't handle it so i just left i called five h after to the customer service . a guy named david answer the phone told me there is no refound he can not do nothing when i asked to speak with a manager he just denied and hang up ! ! ! do n't use them i know there is no other untalented but do n't use them ! ! ! ! ! the bus driver from pitt to new york is a horrible person !	4059
0	bus was late 2 hours on friday night . what a surprise nyc delay was due to traffic ... come on , plan it better megabus . bus wasnt up to par in my book . it may look cool but wifi didnt work most of the time . very tight seating and there wasnt an empty seat at all . could not get any sleep . update-took greyhound back-very cheap but very ghetto . lots of dudes rolling joints in the back of the bus and smoking . on the plus side , lots of seating and lots of leg room . i actually did nod off for a few hours . tip-stay in the front near the driver if you 're into safety .	4059
0	horrible customer service and policies not designed to help you as a traveler but take your money .	4059
1	if you want good customer service this is the place to go . staff is always super friendly and actually enjoy being there . portions are also great and they do not cheap out and cut back on them . restaurant is very clean . 10/10 will recommend .	4060
1	i just picked up 2 sandwiches . this location is super clean and the two ladies behind the counter were super friendly and neat . they made conversation and gave great service . i would come back	4060
1	cheap , fast , and consistently delicious ... definitely a regular stop for students in the area .	4060
1	food is always good , get it to me quick . only issue is bathrooms are not kept up . a little gross at times .	4060
1	been coming to this location for many years and today after picking up my sub i really felt the need to say that i 've always had fresh food at a great price at my subway and today again i had exceptional customer service . the young man was super friendly , fun to talk with and very engaging . good job ! !	4060
0	we just walked in and then walked right out ! the employee that was working was coughing and sniffing and snorting all over the food ! !	4060
0	i told the employee i would like extra cheese 3 times and i ended up with double meat . i was the only customer in there and she seemed distracted . when i got home i took a bite and thr bread just crumbled into pieces . i will never return to this subway again .	4060
0	was greeted as i walked through the door which made me feel like i was about to receive good service however the sandwich line of about 3 people seemed to be too many for the 2 gentleman who were working . the care in making sure the sandwich was made to satisfaction was not there . was really poorly put together.. things were forgotten that i asked for and has to bring up when it was halfway wrapped ... dissapointed .	4060
0	one if the worst store i ever seen in usa . the old man and the young lady who works here are not friendly . and they dont want to work . work very lazy . and very very bad . avoid this plsssasasss very very badddddd	4060
0	i 've had subway many times before moving to arizona so i know they have good sandwiches . however , i will never eat at this particular subway . my husband ordered two turkey sandwiches to go and it was literally the worst sandwich i ever had in my life . stale bread , and something definitely funky with the turkey , cheese , and lettuce . like they used old ingredients . i was sharing my sandwich with my 3 year old but after tasting it , i threw it in the garbage because i was afraid that we were going to get sick . will not try anything from there again .	4060
1	so badass ! ! ! this show is kinda short but only cuz i wan na keep seein ' this dude do his thing . it 's fake , it 's real , a trick whatever ! ! just scope it out and have a good time	4061
1	cool show ! due to his `` abilities '' he made a lady in the audience cry and made us the weak girls tear up lol . he told her that her new partner and her would have babies in the future together . this made a huge impact on the girl and the news filled her with emotions . he has several acts that i like but i do not want to spoil it with detail . i enjoyed the drawing part , the basketball part , but most of all the nail gun act ! ! whether he was for real or not it was a great show . . . just be prepared to listen because he does a lot of talking !	4061
1	this was a pretty entertaining little show for me my husband and 14 year old daughter . the theater is intimate . and great interaction with the entire audience . of course i am a complete skeptic and do n't believe in him knowing people 's lives randomly . but the opening act he explained how he did the trick . it was good night	4061
1	show was fun audience involvement was fun i laughed alot free tix on his website	4061
1	very entertaining . lots of audience engagement . get 2 free tix by going to mentalist.com and clicking on `` las vegas '' link and signing up for his newsletter	4061
1	just got out of the mentalist show and gerry was freaking amazing . my wife and i had lots of fun watching gerry work his show . next time we are in las vegas we will definitely go to his show again . amazing show you really need to get out and see this show .	4061
1	great show ! gerry was so good funny engaged the audience . would go to his show again !	4061
1	great show , i was completely mind-blown by his acts ! ! ! we got free tickets & upgraded to vip for about $ 20 . we were seated at the front row but it 's a very small & intimate venue . he keeps the audience very engaged by asking for participants throughout the show & surprisingly enough , i was the first to be picked to go on stage for the first act . i was very entertained by his humor & mind tricks . not a kid-friendly show but i definitely recommend watching it at least once !	4061
1	it was a good show . my wife and i liked it . i dont know how he does what he does but it is very interesting . i dont think it is the best show . but it was entertaining to me . i probably like it more because i got free tickets off his website when i went . i paid 20 to be up front . he is talented . i dont watch the tv show but i liked this one .	4061
1	gerry mccambridge 's show is entertaining ! i highly recommend him during your stay in vegas ! you will be blown away by his presentation and wit ! check it out and have a great time !	4061
1	we got almost free tickets to his show at hooter 's a few years ago . i think all we had to do was buy a drink maybe ? anyway it was worth more than we paid for . entertaining show , i 'm not sure how he did some of the tricks in his act . there was one where people from the audience threw numbered nerf balls into baskets and he got the order 100 % right . i was impressed ! he did photos and autograph 's after the show which was nice .	4061
0	not family friendly . performer is overly fond of the word `` sh** , and its variations . performance centered on 2 overdrawn routines . there are much better shows of this sort in vegas .	4061
0	the show was worth the price , unfortunately the price was free , this show will catch your attention for awhile but progressively fades away with parlor like tricks and a sales pitch , if you are into his tv show you may enjoy this . honestly not the worst ive seen but will not get me to go back	4061
0	do n't bother . take a lighter and burn your money right in front of you and you will have more fun than giving it to this guy . he spends most of the time promoting his dvd and resume . my 15 year old son was in shock when the show finished . `` that 's it ? '' he said . what a joke .	4061
0	honestly , this show sucks , it 's short and boring , just know a few things about urself and i 've already know how he knows others ' personal information . it 's actually a group of hackers using computer to search ur personal information , like hack in ur facebook account , stuffs like that . cheap show . not worth going even it 's a discounted ticket .	4061
0	total ripoff for general admission ... .way in the back ... .most seats require `` vip '' pricing ... .save your money	4061
0	this show seems like it 's lived it 's life . the mentalist has clearly done this act countless times and has a hard time keeping the audience engaged with what he is doing . although , one act in particular was pretty cool , when he tells you the persons name and what they do for a living plus he gets a bit more personal all while fully blind folded . so i gave it 2 stars for that alone .	4061
0	i 'm really glad these tickets were free because i knew it was a dud the first 10 minutes of him going on and on just talking about the whole 'mentalist ' background . this show could n't have been over soon enough , a real disappointment and not at all entertaining . skip it !	4061
0	the check in process took way too long which caused us to miss the show . the show itself was fine , but not worth more than 10 dollars .	4061
0	hokey hokey hokey .. audience plants were obvious . save your money . sorry mentalist . we were bored .	4061
0	not for the family . a lot of language . his tricks were pretty cool but he also promoted his dvd a lot .	4061
0	i do n't know what these 5 star reviews are about . the show seemed rigged , it was n't entertaining . really disappointed .	4061
1	i ordered a medium pizza with halal beef pepperoni , red onions and jalapeños . the cheese was exquisite , the onions and jalapeños fresh . the pepperoni was delicious . with the pizza i ordered 18 wings with honey garlic sauce . the sauce was beautiful and the wings were perfectly cooked . the owner was very good with customer service as well . i will definitely make this my to go place for excellent pizza and wings .	4062
1	good halal pizza . but the owner ( chef ) likes to count the number of each topping . say if you order a chicken or beef pizza the quantity is very less . would recommend to others as pizza itself is good and halal .	4062
1	ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and 1 large peperoni pizza , everything was yummy , prices were nominal . nice clean place majority of their business is either pickup or delivery .	4062
1	this is actually such a good place to get pizza . it 's really cheap & extremely underrated . the only downside is if you 're waiting inside the place for your pizza , or dining in , there is no air conditioning & no wifi . i love everything about it except for that .	4062
0	terrible . just terrible . horrible service and mediocre food . you 're better off ordering from pizza pizza .	4062
0	i came in here recently for a quick slice of pizza . i did n't know what to expect , but i figured that even bad pizza is usually still not so bad . at around 12:45pm , the remaining pizzas on offer for slices were looking pretty sad , as though they had already been sitting there for hours . i 'd gone far enough to walk in , so i picked one anyway . it was ... not what i 'd hoped for . it had a crust , and sauce , and cheese , and pepperoni ... but i feel it may be overly generous to call it pizza .	4062
0	whatever the delivery time that your quoted make sure you double it , and be cold when it arrives . it seems every time we ordered from here , things get a little worse . it 's a shame because i was so happy with the first order . i do n't recommend this place to anyone .	4062
0	halal meat is served here per signs on the restaurant and menu . made the mistake of trying the burgers ( new item ) from here instead of the pizza . the beef and chicken burgers were bland and stale . looks like they use frozen patties ( al safa or something similar ) instead of making it fresh . luckily i did order some honey garlic chicken wings on the side and those were pretty good . i hope their pizza is better than their burgers !	4062
1	there really is not much else to say about this place that has not already been said by past reviewers . choose dough , choose mix ins , wait 5 minutes , experience heaven on earth . the store has ample seating and has a variety of preselected cookies for the less creative . something for everyone , go there , now , and bring me back a peanut butter cookie with snickers and toffee .	4063
1	i 've been to sweet flour twice now , and have been impressed both times . i love the idea of choosing your own dough and mix-ins to create a custom , fresh-baked cookie , and they always come out of the oven delicious ! the first time i had one of their specialty teas , which was delicious , and the second time i had a latte , which was just okay . the only other negative i can think of is that their sitting area is on the smaller side and the chairs are n't very comfortable , but i think if they were then people would never leave !	4063
1	i love love love love this place ! ! ! ! my sister lives in bloor west village and since she had moved here , this has become my favorite place to hit up some coffee and baked goods in the morning during my visits . my sister is an addicted regular ... she visits two or more times a day . my recommendations are their seasonal pumpkin spice latte they have right now during the fall season ... the low fat wild blueberry muffin top is to die for ... .chewy and cock full of blueberries ... absolutely delicious ! ! ! mmmmmmmmm	4063
1	sweet flour will blow your mind . you get to pick your dough ( regular , peanut butter or oatmeal ) , and then your mix-ins ( chocolate , sprinkles , nuts etc ) . it basically allows you to bake your own cookie shaped orgasm ... with your choice of nuts . i had a peanut butter with white and milk chocolate . when it came out of the oven , the cookie was soft and chewy and the chocolate was all melted and god-like . and to top it all off , the service was top-notch .	4063
1	this is the only place where muffin tops and seinfeld references are okay with me . such fresh , warm , gooey goodness . pair your hot cookies/muffin tops with some equally fresh , natural froyo and experience perfection .	4063
0	worst cup cakes ever - my husband and i tried the salted caramel and the peanut butter and chocolate and they were both very dry and heavy . there was no hint of salt with the salted caramel cupcake .	4063
0	the build your own cookie did n't seem too special . we built a cookie based on the oatmeal dough . maybe canadian cookies are different ? i felt that there was too much flour in the dough . really quite dry and crumbly for a fresh baked cookie .	4063
0	the concept is great , design your own original cookie and get a fresh one baked in front of you . the product is lousy . id rather a bakery cookie from a bakery who knows how to actually make a cookie . if they could make their cookies actually taste good , they would have a winner here .	4063
0	on tuesday 09/22/2009 my daughter & i walked in for a tea & a muffin top . very disappointed with the muffin top ( bran dough , almonds & sunflower seeds ) crumbled all over the place . i guess next time i will try out a cookie & see how that goes ! btw the service was great the guy behind the cash register gave my daughter some crayons & paper to play with while i was enjoying my tea & the crumbled muffin top .	4063
0	was looking forward to trying this bakery but the service was bad and then to top it off the whoopie pie was so dry and had a strange after taste .	4063
1	one of the nicest , cleanest hotels i 've ever stayed in . no dirty carpet here , nice engineered wood floors . i will definitely stay here next time i 'm in toronto .	4064
1	it was only for a night , and we were lucky to score this hotel through hotwire on a great deal . hilton garden inn is right at the heart of the entertainment district . it is walking distance to chinatown , kensington market , and hundreds of restaurants . the staff were friendly and the rooms were cozy and clean .	4064
0	the partiers from the surrounding clubs will come inside and have loud sex in the hallway outside your door . the hotel will do nothing about it .	4064
0	linens and comforter were n't great quality . the mattress was hard . that being said , i would have given them a 3-star rating had it not been for the post-checkout issue . i called to ask if anyone in housekeeping had found a kindle . instead of checking , the operator referred me to a random website that had no brand affiliation to hilton . i asked the operator if i could speak to someone directly about the lost item and she said no . not cool .	4064
1	you ca n't really find anything wrong with this place , the pastas and pizzas are both amazing and high quality , the price is very reasonable , the owner and the staff are very friendly , if you 're in downtown check this place out , a lot of people think just because it 's downtown there are lots of options around but that 's not always the case as there is also a lot of poor quality food in downtown as well .	4065
1	my friend and i were looking for a quick bite to eat and decided that pizza would do . did we get pizza ? no , no we did not . but , only bc there were so many items on the menu that sounded delicious , and they were . we ordered the caprese salad , ravioli , and steak sandwich . it was awesome . flavors were on point . this place is on the small side though , with tables only on one side so there might be a little wait if they get busy . overall it 's a nice little place that i would def recommend . hope they keep it up !	4065
1	delicious pizza - had the canadian and a glass of wine . no beer on tap which would have been my preference , but the wine was good too . a great spot , quiet and wonderful service . a short walk from our hotel in the rogers center and we got out in plenty of time to make it back before the blue jays game started .	4065
1	the food was great . to start of the garlic bread is one of the beast breads i have ever had . the forni fritto melanzane is great aswell . the caneloni was good but a bit disappointing because the pasta was bland and felt like it was microwaved . but other starters look amazing .	4065
1	love this little place . great thin ( -ish ) crust pizzas . salads were nice also . there is some seating at tiny tables and i can recommend eating in for the nice wine by the glass .	4065
1	this place is perfect for take it for locals . it 's a thin crispy crust that does n't feel you feeling bloated . fresh ingredients , reasonable prices and a fast turn around . they do n't seem to get a lot of sit down business , but i think uber eats and foodora keep them busy . give it a shot , you wo n't be disappointed .	4065
1	5 stars for saving the day . we ordered food from another place and they were a no show . so after midnight , starving and grumpy , we placed an order here through foodora . i called and they received the order immediately . food came in 25 minutes and was delicious . will order again or maybe check it out in person .	4065
1	we started with salads , nothing fancy , but nicely cut and obviously fresh with a good vinaigrette . i was very happy with the pizza they served me here . nice crust , good toppings and great service . i asked the waiter to keep the basil on my margherita to a minimum , they did , i was happy . we drank rum and coke , the pour was generous , i was even happier . i was worried this would be a tourist trap , it was not .	4065
1	i love places like this cozy restaurant feel , personable bartender/waiter and someone 's grandma in the kitchen making authentic meals . i think it 's a family restaurant but its very clean abd trendy . the pizza is amazing i ca n't wait to go back and try a pasta dish . the service is top notch and the food is outstanding .	4065
1	the food was really good . my kids loved the pizza . i had the apple/pecan salad and it was also very good . i would recommend jzs as a great place to eat .	4065
0	maybe we came on an off day but this was really nothing special . margherita pizza was just shredded cheese pizza with little flavour , and the salad was just ok - nice toppings but iceburg lettuce made it a bit bland . everything was meh . i had high hopes ... the prices were way too high for what we got .	4065
0	had the spaghetti and meatballs to go . the taste was slightly below average . tasted/looked like fast food pasta you can get at a foodcourt for 5.99 . very overprice ! paid 14.99 ( us dollar ) for a small pasta dish that tasted not so great . would n't recommend for the price you pay .	4065
0	nada sobresaliente . no es malo sin embargo por el precio esperaba algo que realmente valiera la pena . estoy seguro que se pueden encontrar mejores lugares con los mismos precios .	4065
0	i ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and tomato sauce and was very disappointed . the meatballs were dry and the sauce was overly acidic and did not taste home made . definitely not recommended if you appreciate good italian good .	4065
0	pizza crust is dry . sauce is unique . overall dining experience and customer service are great but the actual pizza not so much . did not try the pasta . the pizza toppings and composition are well thought out but not necessarily filling . the pizza serving is good for one per person .	4065
0	terrible , terrible , terrible . the pizza was bland and their salad looked like brown mush when we got it delivered . their bacon tasted funny and my fiancée had ordered their ravioli and got 5 pieces which was severely undercooked and had no flavor . i do n't know how this place has gotten such high reviews ! if your looking for a margherita pizza to look more like a cheese pizza with maybe 4 flecks of basil ( not leaves , just little flecks ) then this is the place for you .	4065
0	do n't really know why this place has a good review . ordered the braised beef ravioli and an all meat pizza . the food looks good but it was super bland , no flavor . not worth the price . felt like i 'd be better off ordering pizza hut , but this was within walking distance . ordered for pick-up . the waiter did n't even include utensils , had to ask . was only given a fork and no napkins .	4065
0	pros - service was good , the pizzas are loaded with toppings . cons - the crust was a bit burnt and it 's a crispy crust which is not my usual preference . the seating is limited ( although it 's not packed ) but it feels like a spot for take out .	4065
0	the inside is pretty and the outdoor patio has a good view all-around , but the food was not the best especially the wings . the most unusual chicken wings i 've ever eaten . i really could n't finish them . other than taste and feel , i also could n't finish them for the sake of getting to my bus on time being a walk around 30 minutes . so , it was a so-so pizzeria !	4065
0	pizza was over cooked and pasta was undercooked . only redeeming quality was the service was polite and the food came out fast .	4065
1	we had breakfast there today for about $ 25 each with tax and fees included but 2 of our party of 4 were covered by the bed and breakfast deal from jw marriott and they did n't charge for the kid . food was ok but plentiful and what makes it a 5-star for me is the ambience and the patio with the beautiful koi pond and cascades , refreshing in a summer morning . staff was attentive amd we were there at 10 and breakfast ends at 11 but did n't fell pressured at all and nobody gave us looks for taking some fruit with us on our way out ; - )	4066
1	service was exceptional . the food was also wonderful . i ordered the filet and it was tender and juicy . my friend ordered the ny and i found it a bit chewy and with more fat , it that 's how he liked it . loved the bake potato . cooked perfectly . dinner for two was $ 150 which was a bit on the high side . they also have a good brunch on sunday . it 's again a bit pricey . $ 30 . however the place is nice and service is great .	4066
1	i go here every year for thanksgiving and wow is it incredible . it is just the right amount of fancy and official with some killer food and a beautiful surrounding . amazing place to spend thanksgiving . it 's a giant buffet that day and while incredibly expensive , it 's worth it . they have every food imaginable , not only the holiday classics with ham , turkey , stuffing , mashed potatoes ect but crab legs , chicken tenders , pasta , everything ! their desserts are delectable and you 'll want to try them all . finally , their is great service and they 're always happy and kind . i 'll forever enjoy this place .	4066
1	awesome new spot at jw marriott ... i love the `` wall of wine '' at the entrance ; gorgeous re-do of the former space ( carmel room ) with beautiful fountain views and outdoor patios . ( the architecture , lighting and chandeliers were stunning ) the menu is extraordinary , making a decision was tough , everything looked yummy . ( the steaks were perfect ) take time to meet tari , the greatest maître d ' around ! the deconstructed banana split for dessert was unreal ... google pics of the lounge and bar area , it 's really that beautiful in person and more .	4066
0	i 've been incredibly sick since eating here . i thought my caesar salad dressing tasted fishy ( not just a little salty from anchovy , but fishy ) . ate it because i was in a hurry . big mistake . was here with a group of 11 for lunch . many complained to me that their lunch was n't good . even if the food had n't produced a stomach ache , i 'd still say the experience was very disappointing for many who joined me . on the upside , it is cool decor inside . service was decent and friendly .	4066
0	we went there for the first time for christmas dinner , it was sad because out of the 3 of us 2 meals were not good . dover sole was too fishy to eat and extremely small portion , the beef wellington was over cooked inside and the pastry was undercooked . how is that even possible ? ? on top of everything , the busser dropped a glass next to our table and splintered into my mums leg unbeknownst to her . i noticed the blood down her leg in the car driving home . the restaurant itself is beautiful and the manager was very fair . christmas was not ruined but very sad dinner .	4066
0	beautiful bar with a nice outdoor patio . service was just ok. burger that i was told was great was not . it was over cooked . as a local i wo n't be running back here ! get your act together because you have a nice spot .	4066
0	went here for lunch today . artichoke spinache dip appetizer was good . everything else was bad . i ordered the short rib flat bread . it had about 15 1/4 inch pieces of meat flakes on it . did n't taste like anything . my partner ordered a burger medium rare . it came black and blue without any seasoning . chips that accompanied the dish were not salted and had a burnt taste . we wo n't be back .	4066
1	good , clean , friendly , accommodating , and professional . not to mention an interesting menu based on the geographic cross roads of its owners . i have tried their chicken shawarma , iskandar kabab , and the royal pilaf ( rice pie ) ... as you can tell , i have already been back .	4067
1	the food was very tasty and very reasonably priced with good portions . the service was fast and friendly as well . for people looking for late night cheap eats ( aside from fast food and diners ) , adana has awesome hours . would highly recommend to everyone !	4067
0	quality sucks . it was really good in the beginning , but changed the way how they make business	4067
0	it was disgusting.. the cook never uses gloves . the worst kebab it was.. never use washroom it was full of napkins and bunch of crap .	4067
1	just traded in my brz for a beautiful lifted gmc 2500hd ! ! i love it ! ! ! jae was amazing ! ! ! he worked hard to find me the perfect truck ! ! he was funny and extremely nice ! ! he was patient with how long it took for me to get everything in order and get my husband out here to sign the papers ! bill was a great help also ! the whole team was very welcoming and worked hard to get me what i wanted ! thank you so much ! ! i will be back for when my husband wants his next truck ! love you guys ! !	4068
1	great place to buy your next lifted vehicle , salesmen are non pushy and knowledgeable . morgan and ryan took time to talk to us and answer all our questions , i would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a lifted suv or truck.great selection , great staff . to top it off bob went above and beyond to make our deal happen , thank you bob . one happy customer ! !	4068
1	if you 're looking for top notch service and the best price for your trade in , lifted trucks is the place to go ! bob was very knowledgeable , did a fantastic job with my entire deal , answered my questions fabulously . thank you very lifted trucks ! i love my jeep and we will be back in the future ! !	4068
1	bought a truck . all worked out great . highly recommended . they 'll work with you on whatever you need to get the deal you want .	4068
0	i went to lifted trucks to obviously look for a truck . i was very specific on what i wanted . they did n't have anything on their lot that i liked . i told the salesman that and he would n't let me leave . super pushy and kept trying to sell me something i did n't want . i was looking for a diesel truck and the salesman did n't know anything at all about diesel trucks . just because a motor is the same size do n't mean they do n't change things year to year . finally i just walked out on them in the middle of the salesman talking ... . i would not recommend them to anyone .	4068
0	horrible service , very unfriendly when we decided to decline they 're offer . promised things that they could n't make happen , lied to us 3 times and plainly admitted to us in our faces . beware of this place !	4068
0	beware : i had to give at least 1 star to write this review . horrible customer service and disgusting product . lemon law exist because of these people . i 'd rather walk then buy another vehicle from this place . as a matter of fact it 's what i 've had to do because they would n't fix my truck after the first week of buying the vehicle after it broke down on the freeway .	4068
0	yelp suspected my review was false and removed it and aske me to resubmit ..s ..anyway management claims they had no record of my visit but thats on them . i advertised my mustang for sale in another venue for a straight trade on less valuable 4x4 and management contact me . promises me they can do a deal . i bring my vehicle down and all they do is try to ripp me off so i drive 30 miles to the location and the manager i was supposed to deal with had to leave and leaves me with a rookie salesman and scandalous management team who tries to take my 18k car and put me in a vehicle valued about 8k	4068
1	wow- what a nice looking restaurant ! the pizza , subs , and wings ca n't be beat . i ordered the pepperoni magnifico and the white cheezy pizzas . the staff were all very helpful and friendly .	4069
1	back again for another pizza from marco 's . i always order online and pick up in person . always ready before the noted time . pizza was very tasty ( love the crust and sauce ) and the toppings were plentiful . marco 's has been running a number of specials , which makes the experience even better ! the restaurant look and cleanliness is appealing for those that want to eat locally .	4069
1	ordered a small pepperoni pizza and it was delicious ! the cheese was good , the sauce all the way to the crust ! excited to try out other things from their menu ! we 've found our pizza place !	4069
1	took the whole family and a friend out for dinner tonight . excellent service and friendly . clean and fast . plan to make it an every wednesday outing .	4069
1	good pizza , and not in the `` all pizza is good pizza because its pizza '' kind of way . ample toppings and good crust .	4069
1	went there with my mom on for lunch . got fantastic service . the girl there who rung us up and brang us our pizza , matti , was great . told her we didnt have much time because i had to get back to work , and she made sure our pizza got put in right away .	4069
1	solid pizza . not a thick crust and not a thin crust . good fresh taste and good crust . i have also had the meatball sub . it was good too . service is good , place is clean .	4069
1	ordered pizza from marcos tonight and it was superb . way to go marco 's . even the driver that called me was super polite and pleasant to speak with . the wings were on point . both the barbeque and buffalo . ca n't wait to reorder . little caesars and pizza hut lost a client . # support # locals	4069
0	long wait , nothing great for food , soggy wings , doughy cheese bread . sauces are warm and disgusting . crust of pizza was good but that 's it . i wo n't be back ... too many other options in area .	4069
0	five star reviews for this very average pizza ? not in this world , workers need food handling training for sure and no gloves ? nasty ! now the pizza , boring and not much to like , i expected alot since they say authentic italian on the box , yea right will never be back ever ! !	4069
0	they might want to update their hours . i showed up at 8:30pm since it shows up open until 11:00pm and they were closed . very disappointing especially since it was pouring when this attempt was made . only received one star since it forces you to give it a star .	4069
0	pizza delivery service was a 1 hour and 20 minute problem ... driver was calling me from 43rd ave and northern , could n't find my house ? i 'm on 43rd and bell ! pizza was not worth $ 26 + tip . might have been better if it was fresh ? cheese bread was free with a coupon , but i would n't recommend that either ! it was a big blob of salted bread served with hot ranch ? yum ! ! for $ 30 with tip , i 'll stick with barro 's or stevie 's .	4069
0	never coming here again . i ordered online and not only was it made wrong , but the manager , mariel was extremely rude and placed the blame on me ! who does that ? `` this what you order ! i no make wrong ! you pay now ! '' i 'm telling everyone i know how horrible she is , and shame on them for hiring her in the first place !	4069
0	pizza is horrible , just get dominos if you want crap . they use fake processed 3 cheese blends . but i have to say the pepperoni and mushrooms are great . last the dough is machine processed also . doubt its hand tossed and fresh . it doesnt taste fresh . i am sorry but i have had way better pizza from little ceasar . and even that 's not that good . if you want real cheese and real fresh crust go somewhere else !	4069
0	i ordered the white cheesy pizza and 10 wings . when i arrived the girl in the back was asked about the pizza and she said she did n't make it . the other girl then came up and told me they must have given it to another customer by mistake and that it would be another 10 minutes . i left and came back . it was ready in the time she stated . the pizza was good but not great . i would not order the wings again . they remind me of pizza hut and domino 's wings . not good at all and very small . also they had been sitting a while . i would not recommend this place .	4069
0	we had two pizzas there today , the pineapple on the one pizza tasted weak , like it sat out too long ! the other pizza was adequate , not much flavor ! if you like peter piper pizza , well there compatible . l ca n't recommend this place , it 's just at best generic .	4069
1	i used a groupon and had no problem getting in contact with them to schedule an appointment . the smell that other reviews mention , does exist when you first walk in . it smelled like maybe an animal had lived there before and cleaner over it . it did n't bother me much though and the business was visibly clean . nathan greeted me by name and he and the other staff were both very polite . the massage by nathan was excellent . i did n't have any concerns and really enjoyed by relaxing massage .	4070
1	i visited over the weekend with my mom and sisters to celebrate my mother 's birthday . we had the massage , facial and spa pedicures done . i booked it late and they were very accomodating . the prices were reasonable and the employees and the owner were all very nice and professional . everyone enjoyed it and we all felt very relaxed when we left . we will definitely return .	4070
0	worst massage i 've ever had . i could have rubbed moisturizing cream on myself .	4070
0	i had a coupon for this place . the massage was ok , hardly any pressure . the worst part was my feet . i paid for a massage and a foot scrub . when she did the massage , she did n't even do the feet ! my favorite part ! the so called foot scrub was less than five minutes of slathering on salty liquid . would n't do it again ! my young son gives better massages !	4070
1	i love this place ... . i be went there one time and they have a very wide selection of hair ... . i 'm definitely going back to get my clip on hair .	4071
1	there is a huge selection or wigs , weaves , creams , oils , sprays , knockers , rubber bands beads , headers ect ! all things hair related is in this business and at a fair price ! there are also `` clothes '' kinda the quality is more like a mix between wal-mart and fallas so the quality is questionable ... but one time wears are cool too ! need less to say in any given week i could have long hair or a fade so i 'm down for a good midwest type hair store !	4071
0	got a wig from here today and i got home to wear it for the night and `` brand new '' out of the box it is already completely matted and feels like it 's been used . wasted my money here . very upset at the quality wish i could get my money back .	4071
0	poor customer service . rude staff . they have a good selection of stuff but i will never go there again .	4071
1	my son has played tackle football with nys for a few years . the sign up process is easy , affordable and most importantly organized . we appreciate the ease and convenience of their processing . they keep the teams in order but establishing sound rules , regulations , and schedules . we always have officials when we are suppose to and never find ourselves without a field . i am definitely a huge fan and supporter of nys	4072
1	they have built a great team that cares about the athletes . they have great people in leadership , and do a great job creating memories for us parents and our kids . i definitely believe they are developing young people emotionally , physically , and in their character , preparing them a great future . thank you !	4072
1	been playing here since my boy was 8 and it 's the best league in town . no complaints at all ! fun !	4072
1	very friendly staff . they are always there to answer any and all questions . they offer sports year round , so it 's a great way to let your child try different sports , without the commitment and pricing like those of club teams . they really care for the kids and the experience they have . this league has greatly improved in the last few years .	4072
1	just relocated and our 1st season with nyd we are really excited . the nys staff is friendly with parents & the kids . they are prompt in addressing questions & concerns . the price point is reasonable & my child 's experience is worth every dime ! if you are looking to get your child involved in a team building , socialization teaching , fun environment i highly recommend nys nevada	4072
1	nys has been so helpful . my daughter absolutely loves playing tball . it was very easy to sign her up . i 'm very happy	4072
1	our family has been with nys for 10 years and watched many other leagues come and go in that time . we 've had our 3 children in soccer and tackle football . in the beginning we were n't happy with the organization or office staff but with the turn over a few years ago everything has improved a ton ! sign up is easy and convenient especially since they offer registration nights close to my home . fees are reasonable once your kids are set on a sport and have all the equipment . it is volunteer run but if you have involved parents it should n't be a problem !	4072
1	our 2 sons play football with nys . we have had a great experience . they 're very welcoming . our coaches do a great job of teaching our kids the game . the staff was very accommodating and made registering very painless .	4072
0	how do they have people being nominated for mvp when : 1 ) their team has a losing record ? and 2 ) the same kids do not make the all-star team ? coaches kids or something ? ? ?	4072
0	this place is a joke ! favoritism at its finest . racist people is unbelievable.. people sign kids up and not knowing the rules . team moms are out of control , didnt know they had control over the game . i thought thats what coach for ? ? ! i had an issue reached out to the owner and he basically said , its up to the coach ! wow . your weak boss ! no wonder why you cant take care of your buisness and loosing customers . i will never ever give any dime to them again , lost a good customer .	4072
0	ridiculous is the only word i can say . the team is here to take pics ... ..along w/ 100 more other teams @ the same damn time . and to top the cake , it 's a tuesday & picture time was scheduled for 8pm ! ! it 's 8:30 on & we still have n't taken pics yet . this organization is not the best at all ! # $ $ $ $ $	4072
0	if i could give nys henderson zero stars i would . they just do not have their act together in any way . they screw up repeatedly -- processing registrations incorrectly , getting the schedules out late , messing up gym rentals , failing to get referees to the games ... it 's all a complete mess . all of the parents complain about them . they need to hire better management and get their act together .	4072
0	super unorganized ! ! and pretty pricey . coaches are parent volunteers and were great . but as for this organization , they need to step it up	4072
0	this is a parent volunteer organization . volunteer meaning that it 's possible your coach may not even show up or you may have to be moved to another team if your coach flakes . there are no refunds under any circumstances . that being said , good luck ! !	4072
0	a little unorganized and preferential treatment given to certain teams/coaches . our daughters participate in the girls volleyball program . nys divides skill level by recreation and elite leagues . however , the nys league does not place children by a skill assessment or tryout of any sort . basically , you have brand new players in the elite league or someone who ca n't serve the ball over the net . it 's just sad ! it makes me think this program is just about money .	4072
0	two seasons with nys and two sh ! ++¥ unorganized teams , 16 badly run games ( referees ca n't even count the number of players on the field ) , and a field with a large pothole/pond of mud smack in the middle of it . my daughter who once loved soccer now dreads it and begs not to go . she has no clue who her coach is because every practice and every game its a totally different person .	4072
1	american style burgers are not easy to find in canada . if you 're craving for one , you will not go wrong at five guys ! the single cheese burger is a perfect working dinner . while you wait , there are complimentary fresh shelled peanuts . something i 've never seen at a burger joint . and that 's because the company started in virginia . according to wikipedia they 're the largest growing franchise business .	4073
1	first time there and it was really nice ! the price range is totally reasonnable ! for 1 bacon cheeseburger , 1 cheeseburger , 1 small fries ( way enough for 2 ) and 2 drinks we paid 17 $ almost the same as mcdonald . food wise the experience was very positive . bacon was crispy , meat tender and not too cooked and we could customize our burger . the fries are delicious , crispy and they arrived very warm . at the end we were super full and i 'll definitely come back to 5gb !	4073
1	best fast food chain in the area . they 're fast and have whole peanuts while you wait . love the music too ! plus , they 're open till 11pm every day .	4073
1	definitely one of the best burgers in montreal . somewhat expensive , but well worth it . you have to have the cajun fries with which they are very generous	4073
1	burgers are good but soggy . you need to ask them not to wrap the burger in aluminum foil or it will be dripping wet . fries are good . pricey for fast food .	4073
1	i 've had my fair share of burgers . overall , this nails everything a quick burger should be . affordable , greasy , filling and tasty . if you 're a health freak , i think you can add lettuce to your bacon cheeseburger . also , try the cherry milkshake .	4073
1	working in montreal financial district and need a quick burger fix ? this five guys should be on your list . burger patties are juicy and flavorsome and the staff is friendly , always delivering your order with a smile . there is a good list of condiments which should satisfy most but do n't expect anything too fancy . you can snack on free peanuts while you wait for your food , which can take 5 to 10 minutes around lunch time . will go again !	4073
0	j'ai mangé une poutine , le goût était passable mais c'est pas digerable ! énorme mal de ventre moi et mon amie même 6 heures après avoir manger . j ' y retourne pas certain .	4073
0	i ordered an overpriced cheeseburger with bacon , that tasted like it was cooked while still semi-frozen and without any seasoning . if it were n't for the condiments , it would have tasted even worse .	4073
0	blech ! i was really looking forward to this but ended up grossed out and remorseful . probably would have been fine had they gotten our takeout order right . all 3 of our cheeseburgers were mistakenly made doubles . after taking the extra beef patty out the burgers were just sloppy , soggy messes . just gross . definitely wont be back ... yuck !	4073
0	the restaurant is kind of dirty , the service is ridiculously slow , and the food is not good . you 're better off going to mcdonald 's .	4073
0	overpriced , bland burgers that are soggy with who knows what and do n't taste anything . the fries ? i can see through the paper bag , just like when homer gets fat . mcdonald 's make better burgers , and that 's kind of hard to beat .	4073
0	great burgers , fantastic fries , but you have to take it to go from this particular location . the barking the tiny cashiers do is ear splitting . when asked why they yell , they give you a cold stare , blink once and take it up several octaves while their fingers edge up the volume on the music . the place is clean , the complimentary peanuts a great while wait treat . if still want to choose this location over others , bring along some ear plugs .	4073
0	overrated ! i was disappointed with my burger . i mean , it was good , but not worth the price . you have to purchase your fries and drink separately , which runs up a bill of around 20 $ . that seems a little steep for a fast food joint . i could get a full meal at a & w or wendy 's for half the price . they advertise free condiments ! are you kidding me ? i hope the condiments are free , my meal is already 20 $ ! oh but wait , they offer free peanuts . yahoo i will not be returning . waste of money	4073
1	i 've been coming to see cydney r for months . she is exceptional to work with and very friendly . the ladies at the front desk are professional and clear , especially this one lady but i ca n't remember her name . i will be sure to edit my post for when i 'm back for my pre-booked appointment . the office and wax rooms are nice and clean . overall , 5 stars for this location . i 'm chastity and i approve this message .	4074
1	expensive but clean and the staff is super nice . they always have fun promotions and are flexible w hours etc .	4074
1	just went for the first time and had my eyebrows done by amber . she did a fantastic job and was very comforting ; the receptionist were also very nice and professional .	4074
1	i 've been going to european wax center for years and this is by far the best location . i 've been going to yelena and she is great . brazilian waxes can be an unpleasant thing but she is quick , efficient and makes it as least painful as possible . the facility is always clean and the staff is always helpful and polite . reasonable prices and great products to purchase . love this place .	4074
1	please go see chanice and tip her well ! she is awesome- makes you feel so comfortable and talks you through the process . i am not an amateur when it comes to waxing and i know great service when i receive it !	4074
1	such great girls ! even short notice i get in and they take good care of me . super clean facility . it 's close to my house , and even though i 've been to other locations they always make sure to consult first	4074
1	i 've been going to european wax center for over a year now . every time i 've strayed i have always regretted it . they really do offer a much less painful waxing experience . i always go with allie . she 's very attentive to detail and always makes my eyebrows look great . she 's so good that i followed her to this new location despite the over 30 minutes of driving it takes for me to get there !	4074
0	do n't do it ... i got a 3rd degree burn and no resolution . i had the sweetest gal yelena ... but i kept telling her the wax was hot ! she assured me i would be fine . i kept saying it 's burning and she said perhaps because i had n't gone in a while and other things might make me sensitive . long story short i have a chunk of skin gone in a sensitive area , 3rd degree and sore and no one has called me back to resolve this as it happened last thursday . be very careful ! ! maybe try another locale not this one . so sad because i get waxes every 3 mos .	4074
0	i have been going to this location for over 3 years and i 've even posted an excellent review . recently i was diagnosed with cancer and started to lose my hair . i had paid for a yearly package and asked if i could get a refund or be placed on hold . it did n't seem that it would be a problem but after multiple requests i have heard nothing . i even emailed corporate and silence . i 've chalked it up to money lost from a very unfortunate situation that i am experiencing . european wax center is just adding to it by not showing compassion or humanity to what i would consider a loyal customer .	4074
0	over the past year this ewc has really changed for the worse , prices went up and service quality went down . during my last , and final , visit the front office staff were lamenting about how terrible their jobs were in front of clients . really unprofessional . the waxer i saw was n't thorough , rushed , and the rooms and floors were dirty . i do n't know what has happened here between now and this time last year , but i 've switched to seeing a private esthetician .	4074
0	well the girl who specializes here in eyebrow waxing sure does n't do eyebrows well . she made me eyebrows enemies not sisters . it 's going to take atleast 3 months for my eyebrows to grow back an be normal looking . and they charge 20 $ for there eyebrow waxing , which is horrible .	4074
0	i 'm giving this place two stars for being clean and the hostess was really friendly . i went there for full face wax only to leave with barely any hair removed , just to be clear my facial hair is not a lot and was long enough to be removed . the technician insisted that she did her best and i would have to wait for my hair to be longer . i 'm sitting home now doing the work myself . i wish i had a better experience .	4074
0	booooo . where did allie go ? the best waxer . i was out of town for a month or so and called for appointment to find out allie is `` no longer with the company '' .	4074
0	( updated 2018 ) yelena is wonderful , but i no longer go here because they kept calling last minute to reschedule my appointment for another day . they did it to me for the last time right before an important trip - that was it for me . i 've moved on to another location . extremely disappointing : (	4074
1	we love chipotle . eat at this one all the time . the staff is very friendly and usually gives out generous portion sizes . love the food and the fresh ingredients . obviously not authentic mexican , but still delicious !	4075
1	went into this restaurant after a terrible day . i was planning out how to kill myself cause i saw absolutely no point in life . i ordered my last meal and a genuine gentleman named patrick took my order . he could tell something was up and asked me how i was . he was able to talk me back off the ledge and made me realize just how nice some people are . men like him make this world go round . please promote him , he deserves it .	4075
1	this is one of my favorite mexican fast food restaurants . it 's clean and cool in the summer . it 's neal the theater and my house . you can alway ask for more meat without extra charge . of course , they will charge you if you ask two spoun more . : - ) the parking space is not as big as the store and it 's crowed over the weekend .	4075
1	oh , chipotle . so delicious , yet so punishing later . i 'm all for giant burritos , but damn . chicken is win . also , how come guacamole is extra ? are avocados really that expensive ? i did n't think so last time i bought some . and did n't i just pay like $ 9 for a burrito and drink ? meh .	4075
1	very quick service ! the three workers greeted me right as i was walking in . not something i am used too . the portions are smaller than at other chipotles , the rice and chicken in particular . overall a good experience . i was in and out in no time .	4075
1	excellent food . i think i am going to have to go there once i complete this review . place is very clean and extremely welcoming . the staff are very friendly and efficient . food is well priced and very pleasing to the taste buds . the burritos are fantastic especially with steak and the burrito bols are great too . oh and you get get beer here and margaritas too . i am absolutely in love with this place and ca n't get enough . chipotle can get crowded on the weekends and during lunch hours but you can still go in and and get your food in under 15 minutes .	4075
1	i see a couple recent negative reviews and i 'm surprised . my family and i eat here quite a lot . there is always a long but fast-moving line . we worry about having an available table but there 's always one available by the time our food is done . the food is reliably good and our orders accurate . the employees are always really friendly , yet fast - they work together like a well-oiled machine . i have yet to have a bad experience .	4075
1	went here for lunch today . the food wasnt great but the service was awesome . i wasnt a fan of the mild salsa but all of the employees we came in contact with were smiling and spoke to us . my coworkers seemed really happy with their food though . it was very clean and well kept . we had no complaints .	4075
1	omg burrito the size of my arm ! this is a great location , and the staff is amazing . everyone is always so friendly and nice . i love the cilantro lime rice chipoltle offers , and when i want something filling but not *terribly* bad for me , this is a great option . i usually get my order to go , and they are always super nice about adding extra layers of foil to keep my burrito at optimum munching temperature . all i can really say is yay burritos !	4075
1	obviously the food is chipoltle so it is great trendy mexican food . we really love this place because the staff is so nice and helpful . we come in late weeknights when they 're winding down but they 're always fast with service and eager to help us out .	4075
1	always fast and the food is consistent : hot , tasty . i do n't ever have a problem here and i love that .	4075
1	this chipotle is amazing ! everyone is super nice and friendly i love the employees i was just there and i was so amaze of the customer service they provided i wanted to expressed how i felt they are super caring and happy ! i totally recommend this location	4075
1	the chipotle where im from is busy with a line all hours of the day and it sucks . i walked right in to this one , got my carnitas bowl and walked right out . the place was really clean and the people working seemed cool . will be going back .	4075
1	the staff at this location are friendly and accommodating ! they are very accurate with phone in orders and online orders and the line moves fast when its busy . highly recommend .	4075
1	the absolute burrito ! no other burrito company like it and they just started offering brown rice . i 'm officially a life long customer . wow , i actually said that !	4075
1	this chipotle is sort of tucked into the shopping area . easy to see if you are in the right place , but otherwise a bit of a hunt . it has the some format as every other chipotle we 've been to . burrito prepared quickly . it was very tasty , as usual . seemed a bit smaller ( i usually ca n't finish one in a single sitting ) . but i ca n't be sure about that . as fast food goes , this is some if the better stuff .	4075
1	i love this place ! and so does my family ! it 's so cool that you can order your dinner on the internet or on your iphone , bypass the line and eat a great and healthy meal . the kids love the build your own tacos . the burritos are so huge , i usually get one to split with my wife . so , i can feed the whole family of 6 for less than $ 25 -- which is a deal these days for this quality of food . again , if you have n't tried ordering online or on your phone -- you 've got ta try it ! great food ! great service ! a+	4075
1	chipotle is dependable . i can always count on them to give me a great , delicious and fulfilling meal at a good price .	4075
1	i love the food here the only thing is it can get pricey . the burritos are huge and come with rice , beans , meat , salsa , lettuce , sour cream and other options . you can also choose a bowl instead of burrito the has all the same choices like a taco salad . they have a few things for the kids to get also .	4075
1	sofritas , black beans and pico , oh my ! seriously , love the chipotle concept , and love even more that they offer shredded , mouth watering , pepper infused , juicy tofu . this location is great because they are quick and easy to get in and out of ... ( kinda wish this shopping center would take off a little more though ) . the staff was really friendly and helpful and moved the long line of customers quickly through the process and on to the every wonderful tasty chipotle goodness . i will be back soon !	4075
1	one of the best americanized mexican restaurants in the valley . loved their burritos .	4075
1	one of my fav places to eat . i go there so often i get embarrassed ! ! haha sit outside if you want to feed the birds . lol	4075
0	saddest smallest burrito bowl i 've ever had . half scoops of everything . boooo ! rather just go to williamsfield .	4075
0	the portion sizes at this location continue to get smaller and smaller . it has become so bad that we feel like we are just wasting our money and may soon stop going altogether .	4075
0	let me just say , i love the taste of a chipotle burrito when everything is done right . when the rice is cooked all the way through and has enough cilantro , it 's awesome . when the black beans are cooked all the way through , it is awesome . but it is impossible to pick off or pick out a bad element . this location is a hit or miss , usually a miss . sometimes the beans are crunchy , sometimes the rice is crunchy or under seasoned . and if one element is bad , the whole burrito sucks and is a waste of money . sick of wasting money here , just need to find a better location .	4075
0	if you are hungry and you want to get what you pay for ... do n't stop here . this is one of the only chipotles where i get the stink-eye if i ask for a little more rice/beans/meat ( not that i 'm asking for mounds of food , but at least enough to fill my burrito ) the burritos here are way to small to be paying almost $ 8 bucks for a burrito ( i do n't usually get extras like a drink or chips ) .	4075
0	this is the worst chipotle i have ever been too . the chips , rice , and beans are consistently undercooked and they always screw up the online orders . any time i have gone there to pick up my order , there have been items missing . the meats are not cooked or prepared right either . the chicken constantly has pieces of fat and cartilage in them . terrible . terrible . terrible .	4075
0	the employees here are unbelievable . literally watched one wrap up my burrito by squeezing out all of the sour cream then rolling it in it ... plus my friends margarita took seriously 5 minutes to make .	4075
0	burrito bowl was super cold . asked if i could heat it up they say no . had to box up my food i just paid for and go home to microwave it . not much concern on the part of the employees .	4075
0	how is this place even in business still ? i mean look at the reviews . i gave it a chance , food is terrible , service is worse . used to be my favorite burrito spot	4075
0	we have given this location multiple chances and continue to be disappointed every time . small portions , not fresh , and you feel like you are bothering the employees every time you go there .	4075
0	if i could i would do zero starts ! stingy with everything ! and they also forgot my quesadilla did n't even apologize ! !	4075
0	chipotle , you used to be good to me . you had friendly staffs and the food was so tasty ! now , only friendly staffs . i ordered two steak bowl , the steaks were chewy and tasted blant . are you lost ?	4075
0	today was a very bad experience at chipotle . the staff was rude . it was chaotic and they could n't get an order straight . plus the amount of meat they put on their meals has diminished . when we ask for more chicken they were surly and argumentative there are plenty of other options in this area i would not recommend chipotle . the only reason i gave it to stars is because the food was okay otherwise i would have given it one star	4075
0	this is the third time i 've come into this chipotle only to walk right out because they ran out of certain ingredients . how do you always run out of ingredients ! ? that baffles me . whoever is buying supplies for this location , is clearly not doing a good job .	4075
0	cold food and huge hunk of fat in the meat . i ordered burrito bowl with barbacoa . meat was tender but considering how cold it was , no wonder people get food poisoning . i hope i dont get sick . disappointing .	4075
0	food was cold by the time it got to me , and the delivery was fast , so who the heck knows . my husband had a bone in his burrito bowl and bit into it ! the portions suck and there was barely any chicken in my bowl . worst chipotle location .	4075
0	the first time i 've ever had bland chipotle . ( was n't even sure that was possible . ) : ) when the tea ran out , i let the servers know . 10 minutes later , the tea was still empty . likely wo n't be back to this location any time soon .	4075
0	if you are going to be in the business of customer service , then have good customer service please . not my favorite location of chipotle . management needs to learn to train their employees to speak professionally with their customers .	4075
0	i really dislike this entire chain . i have eaten a few and have not been impressed . they make these burritos look huge by packing them in flavorless overcooked rice then put a few ingredients on . they have additional items that you can buy a la carte to put on your burrito to add flavor , but you 'd think they would be included . this is tex-mex cafeteria food .	4075
0	really bad customer service , no one says hello when you walk in anymore . they waited on a customer who walked in after me . she was picking up a phone in order . my chips were stale . i had to ask 3 times the dressing for my burrito bowl . i paid $ 16 for lunch ! ! so sad to see a great tasting restaurant fail ... .will look for a better quality restaurant .	4075
0	thought i stop by here to get a burrito.. but probably will never go to this location again.. i usually like to get fajitas veggies on mine but the one at this location was black and burnt as can be . it made everything taste burnt and it had this gritty taste all over from small burnt pieces.. could n't not finish it and had to throw it away.. felt very nauseated after . for a place that 's all about the ingredients and where it comes from.. they should take care in how they handle and cook it . never coming back .	4075
0	8 employees , one one of them doing any work . and by any work , he was taking orders , making them , wrapping them , and working the register . 10 minutes of standing there while all of the other employees goofed around was enough and we left . not the chipotle i 'm used to . i 'll stick to the other ones from now on .	4075
0	food was good , but i did not appreciate the deception the cashier used to get me to buy a drink after he indicated it was included . he seemed very dishonest and while i would eat at chipotle , i would not go back to this one .	4075
1	i give china taste 5 stars ! i order delivery at least once a week , and i have never had anything be wrong with my order in the 2 years i 've lived at my house . the staff is friendly , the food is good and in great portions , and delivery is pretty fast . the menu is basic , and everything i have tried has been tasty . my go-to delivery spot ... waiting on them to deliver my general tsos as i write this review : ) word to the wise though , order it spicy or else it will just taste like sesame chicken . the hunan chicken is also fantastic !	4076
1	love their sesame chicken and general tso chicken	4076
1	the food is really good the service is also great ! the eggroll was a little bit greasy for me but other than that everything is awesome !	4076
0	poor customer service . i requested no carrots and no celery in my dish . the guy who took my phone order wanted to argue that it was n't how i requested my order . then proceeded to tell me they would come pick up the bad order and then return with the correct order which leads me to believe they would 've simply picked them out and done something possibly worse to my food . i wo n't be back .	4076
0	greasy . my entrée was slimy , my rice taste it so be in my eggrolls were soaked as in filled in grease . absolutely dripping with grease it was disgusting . and the restaurant is filthy - the health department needs to check that place out .	4076
0	ordered chicken and broccoli with extra chicken . received a meal of 3/4 rice the rest chicken and broccoli . wife ordered this and ate this . called them up and their attitude was horrible . this was a delivery order . nasty food , nasty portions and nasty taste . i know i should have stuck with best wok the best around but they do n't deliver . i sincerely hope this place does not solicit again in our neighbor hood or we will have them kicked out . found menu on all our doors . the guy was actually walking they the streets with a flashlight which is kind of dangerous anywhere .	4076
1	fresh and delicious . excellent service . we ordered take out and we enjoyed the food . tried the mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken , dumplings , and the won ton soup was full of veggies , chicken and shrimp . best soup !	4077
1	awesome chinese food . food was delivered in a timely manner & arrived piping hot . delicious ! ! finally a great chinese place on the west side .	4077
1	this was a really great experience ! i ordered the sesame beef and upgraded the side to fried rice for delivery and it came so fast ! i 'm used to waiting at least an hour for delivery and it was probably only a half an hour until they showed up at my door ! sesame beef was delicious and the fried rice was a little bland but still good ! portion size was great for left overs !	4077
1	it was our first time dining here last night and were so delighted to see the white table clothes , flower on the table and wonderful decor . the food was fabulous and this will be our new favorite restaurant for chinese food . we had lettuce wraps , crispy duck , combination fried rice and one of the chicken dishes . so good ! ca n't wait to go back !	4077
1	chow mien house has the best service i 've ever got ! the food there are amazing ! we had shrimp in the lobster sauce last night , and it was super delicious ! my daughter loved it so much that we needed to order a 2nd plate just for her ... we will go back for more ; )	4077
1	best chinese food so far in vegas . staff was friendly , prices were great along with the food which tasted so fresh . it did not taste too oily or greasy . i would highly recommend this place .	4077
1	i was in the area craving milk tea . conveniently i spotted a sign advertising boba in the window ! the restaurant 's decor is modern . i ordered a thai tea and milk tea ( $ 4 each ) . the cup is probably equivalent to a large at other boba places . it was really sweet and the boba was a little hard , but i enjoyed it regardless .	4077
1	ordered today at 3:15 pm . everything was as ordered except they put chicken in the shrimp fried rice . delivery was before promised . all of the food was tasty . shrimp vermacelli was perfect . general tsos chicken was great . we would recommend this restaurant for eat in or take out or delivery . great place .	4077
1	fresh ingredient , big shrimps and good quality beef . they do not skimp on the freshness and quality on what goes into the dishes .	4077
1	i 've only had food delivered to me from here , but i lovvvvvvvve this food . so good . i usually get the chicken fried rice , and orange chicken . i recommend it .	4077
1	my office eats lunch here at least once a week . the food is outstanding , portions are large , and the price is right .	4077

1	we just ordered this ; from time of order and delivery was was about 21 minutes . the food was very hot and fresh . it was very good as well . the delivery guy was friendly . we even got free coke ! !	4077
1	fresh ingredients are a novelty among chinese restaurants , but this place nails it . i have n't had anything i did n't like . highly recommended .	4077
1	got ours to go , but the dining room looked nice . we really enjoyed our dishes ... .the sesame chicken was n't overly battered , and nothing was dripping in oil . it was a little more expensive , but i think you really have to pay for higher quality when it comes to chinese . we will be back .	4077
1	the best experience i 've had thus far since moving back to las vegas ! ! ! ! the food and service was amazing ! ! !	4077
1	excellent dinner ! ! ! ! we could n't help but order more and more ! ! ! yummy deliciousness ! ! !	4077
1	staff is super sweet & this place delivers . portions are huge ! ! will definitely come back .	4077
1	everything was so fresh and delicious ! ! we had , potstickers , crab rangoon , bbq pork , spicy chicken wings , egg foo yong and general tsaos chicken and man was it great . prompt service in a clean and modern restaurant , which was still warm and inviting . highly recommend especially if you 're a fan of east coast style chinese food , this place is great ! !	4077
1	crab rangoon & wor wonton soup was great ! the pad thai was n't up our alley . swarmed with peppers , onions and not very flavorful . delivery service was very fast .	4077
1	the food here is good but , just a little to salty . the service is excellent . prices are reasonable.will definitely return	4077
1	stopped in to try on a wednesday night . nice and quiet , food was excellent , service pleasant and courteous . i highly recommend this chinese restaurant .	4077
1	the mu shu pork was pretty good . it was almost identical to the same dish i 've had at 2 other takeout/restaurants that offer it . big portion , lots of veggies , lots of port but hate fat in the pork ( that 's probably not avoidable ) . this was my first time getting takeout here and i noticed the white linen and flowers on the tables as i waited for my order . fancy ! preparation of my takeout meal was lightning fast , and just as expected ! their menu is chock full of all the usual fare and i think this place is worth checking out .	4077
1	i have dined in several times and also had food delivered a few times . the food has been consistently good . everything always taste super fresh and the menu has a large selection of items . my favorite is the honey walnut shrimp ! delivery wait time has always been better than expected . inside is very clean and has a nice relaxing atmosphere . staff is very friendly and attentive .	4077
1	food was very good but i did not like i had to pay extra for white meat but all dinners were good and staff very nice and helpful	4077
1	love this place . my family and i have been going to this restaurant for over 8 years . food has always been great and the service is wonderful . they are from china and do n't make small talk unless you want to a speak in chinese . if you have special orders they will make any changes you would like . not so spicy , extra snow peas . the lunch specials are the best in town and they include soup if you dine in . this restaurant is the american version of chinese food . it is not pf chang 's or fusion . china a go go 's food is bland . thank you cook on wok your delivery service is great .	4077
0	the food is mediocre . pad thai is plain and simple horrible . god , i wish we had a good chinese restaurant in vegas .	4077
0	did not enjoy this at all . i got the singapore noodles.. they were yellow , dry , and not good at all ... . i also got the hot and sour soup . it was bland and had chunks of fatty , stringy mystery meat in it . i was not impressed by this place and will never be back .	4077
0	something in our order was wrong and i told the waitress and she got super defensive saying that she confirmed with us and we said it was okay . though that 's not how we remembered events going down , she still argued she was right . she was so rude that i was in shock . she continued to be rude and short the rest of the meal . the food came out quick but there was truly nothing special about it . there was no salt so there was absolutely no taste . i visit vegas from la often and am always eating at new places , but i will definitely not return here or recommend it to anyone i know in vegas .	4077
0	was happy to see a new possible chinese restaurant especially one where you can really sit down and eat -- but we were very disappointed . not good .. chicken was dark meat .. slop . unfortunately wo n't return ..	4077
0	chinese restaurant changed hands ... . the environment is friendlier , cleaner and more pleasing but the food is terrible even looks terrible	4077
0	ordered dinner here recently . food was some of the worst chinese food i 've ever had . everything tastes like it was made in bulk earlier in the day ( or a day or two earlier ) . king pao chicken and curry chicken we very greasy . chicken lettuce wraps filling was mushy and lacked flavor . even the wonton soup was bad ... broth tasted good and veggies in it tasted fresh , but the wonton noodles themselves were mush and obviously had been sitting in the broth for a day or more . i would n't waste my money ordering from this place again .	4077
0	2.5 stars just ok. do n't understand the 4 star rating . food was lackluster and nothing out of the ordinary . we ordered potstickers , cashew chicken , orange beef and chicken fried rice . like i said , the food was ok but was about the same quality as panda express for a higher price . we were the only diners at the restaurant and it was after 5 pm on a thursday . that should have been a red flag . a positive note ... the restrooms were very clean and the decor was pleasant . service was fast , almost too fast . we tried it based on the yelp rating , but wo n't return .	4077
0	absolutely gross . so disappointed the orange chicken was chewy and the beef with broccoli was questionable . the wonton chips and cream cheese wonton have a weird yellow tint to them do n't know if that has to do with the flavor . shrimp fried rice was completely undercooked and inedible . the only good thing was the wonton soup ... . just wondering if/how/when can i get a refund on my $ 40 .	4077
0	in my 60+ years of restaurant going , this has to be the worst case of restaurant mismanagagement . we got there about 6:20 pm , and there were lots of people waiting , at 6:20 pm there were 6 empty tables.at 7 pm ther were still six empty tables.. they made no effort to clean the tables . many people walked out in disgust.waiters would go back and forth to the kitchen carrying one item at a time . i mentioned that they should clean the tables , and were ignored.at 7:10 we finally left , not even being able to get our names on a list , or even ordering take out . i could not tell you about the food .	4077
0	i was excited to try this place because of reviews but food was very disappointing and definitely not worth the total i paid . coming from the bay area we are spoiled with authentic ethnic food i guess and i just ca n't seem to find any good chinese , so maybe this place is better than others in vegas . we ordered some spicy items but we 're spicy at all . really wish it could of been better .	4077
0	super disappointing ... hot and sour soup tastes like white pepper with corn starch , combo fried rice wasnt good at all , hardly any flavor , pot stickers were mediocre at best , chow mein was not even as good as panda express ... . the only decent thing was the orange chicken . this is probably the worst $ 60 meal i have ever bought through uber eats . anyone that says their food is good might want to seek a doctor about theirbtaste buds not working or try a real chinese restaurant .	4077
0	really messed up my takeout order ..calledto get explaination and restaurant said so what , nothing i can do ... no apology/terrible customer service..	4077
0	deeply disappointed with one part of our order . as far as the other food , the rest of the family got good meals- shrimp egg foo young , spring rolls , dynamite noodles w/prawns . the `` sea bass '' was the equivalent of over cooked fried chicken . there is no way they are using real sea bass in this pseudo dish . it was rubbery and did n't separate like fish . it was stringy like fried chicken . seriously , an imposter dish , dry and bland .	4077
0	this place is horrible . no way is this place ny quality chinese food . these people have no idea what good food is . i would never eat here again .	4077
0	first off good food but it arrived with spilled soup everything was wet soup was half full as probably because it spilled chips where wet rice was wet only thing i ate was egg roll	4077
0	for a chow mein house , it was the worst chow mein i 've ever had . there was an overwhelming fake garlic flavor that took over the dish and i love garlic . was n't crazy about the other dishes we ordered . would n't recommend this place .	4077
0	feeling upset at the moment . i ordered combination rice , shrimp egg foo young shrimp tempura crab rangoon and 2 drinks . for one they took longer the the time they told me on the phone . i get my food ands not hot . and they forgot my drinks smh ... i call them they refunded my card for the amount that will take 3 to 5 business days . but then i go to eat my egg foo young and its horrible . its burnt and no flavor . i cant tale it back cause im working . will never go here again .	4077
0	very quick delivery . we ordered spicy beef mongolian that was good but the pad thai was not great . way too many bell peppers in both dishes .	4077
0	we used to go to this restaurant a lot when it was china tango , and it used to be one of my favorites . chow mein house , however , was pretty disappointing . the restaurant was very well-decorated and super cute , but the food was a miss for me . the boba drink was not good , as the tapioca balls were not chewy like they should be . we ordered the combination chow mein noodle , honey walnut prawns , crab rangoon , and egg drop soup , and they did not taste good , that we barely ate it .	4077
0	i rather not eat here again..i pre paid and pre tipped and only asked for chopsticks , spicy sauce , and no onions or garlic.which i did n't get any request satisfied ... onions , no utensils at all , forget chopsticks , not even a fork , no sauce . the food did n't make up for that either . it was n't puke pie , but it was too salty , watery , and should be called and complained , but whatever man ... you win , you lose .	4077
0	tried the chow mein because i figured that 's what they 'd be good for ... as well as their chicken curry . both were just okay . too many of my non-favorite vegetables in the curry ( potatoes were like steak fries ) and the noodles were meh . definitely not the first place i 'll call when i want chinese food . used yelp24 and had the food delivered within 50 minutes . delivery guy was nice , service was convenient but definitely took a little longer than hoped . next time i 'll just drive the 15 minutes to chinatown .	4077
0	this rating is for the overall experience , including the service . first time at this restaurant since the name change . had a late lunch inside , not crowded at all . the waiter was n't pleasant nor did he seem happy to wait on us . took the order very quickly and brought out the food very quickly , maybe that is why the food was n't hot . taste , however , was good . there were several employees sitting in a booth next to us eating their meal . talking very loudly . we found this distasteful . perhaps they could have found a booth away from customers since the restaurant was virtually empty . would not visit again .	4077
0	terrible food ! found a bug in food n showed it to them n they said it was n't them ? do you actually think someone would put a bug in their own food after taking one bite ? ?	4077
0	we ordered food from here on doordash . while the food is delicious , we asked for our mongolian beef to be not spicy . this was ignored , and our order was much too spicy . we wound up not eating it and throwing it out . we probably wo n't order from here again as our requests seem to be unimportant . very disappointing .	4077
0	i 'm going to give this place 1 star only because the food was tasty , on the other hand bad service coupled with very bad attitudes left a sour taste in my mouth .	4077
0	chips were extremely oily , sauce was sugar with no flavor , soup was horrible . steamed rice was ok , and chicken lemon was passing ( without the sauce ... ) when the waiter brought the check he asked if everything is ok . i said i expected more . he smiled and left . after asking to speak with the manager i 've been told he is not here and they still need to charge me for the food . not going back again ! the picture shows how much i actually ate . i walked in starving .	4077
0	i used to like this place when it was china tango . the price was right for chinese food . but , now it 's way too expensive for its quality . we ordered chicken fried rice yesterday in which the rice is under cooked ! they were crunchy and hard . the chow mein has no flavor and it 's missing something . to raised their price and lower their quality is just disappointing ! ! !	4077
1	wow ! ! stopped in and was floored by the new renovations . it appeared the owner or manager danny greeted us and others at the door . we sat at the bar and the bar manager was helpful with beer and food recommendations . i had the mac and cheese along with the moms meatloaf and it was off the chain good . my buddy had the kickin chicken and he said it was great . we will definitely be back , when in the area .	4078
1	julian is the bomb . came in from outta town down on our luck . he brightened the night up with a beer and a smile . didnt eat but deal nights seem legit . just thankful for his helpfulness . management ! ! ! give him a raise . i have served and bartended for 5 yrs now . i would love to have him on my staff !	4078
1	great service with jennifer ! need to improve their food ! we were excited to try their cabbage/corn beef but not very good ! appetizer was very good !	4078
0	i came here thinking that i 'd have a nice experience at a cool sports . service was slow compared to all the staff that i saw walking around . it took at least 10 minuets just to have someone take our drink order . when we finally got our food there was a hair in my sandwich . management comped the sandwich but i wo n't be coming back here again . totally disappointed .	4078

0	where to begin ? slow service on a night where there was not many people in the place . the wings were small which is what you would expect from 50 cent wings the hot sauce while had good flavor it really was not hot . more like a medium . the worst though is a friend found a hair in her melt that was disgusting !	4078
1	case took two years but my attorney was transparent about the length of time and all the steps in my case .	4079
1	amy and chad were awesome ! we have a large family and it can be challenging to keep up with everyone . but they were super patient and helpful . they found us an amazing physical therapist who was just as accommodating . i appreciated the knowledge and support to help us in this challenging time after a bad car accident .	4079
1	these guys are great ! i never felt i was left in the dark about anything , they were able to get the ball rolling quickly and got things taken care of ! kurt , tim , rebecca and tracy were all so wonderful ! heaven forbid i ever get into another accident but if i do , i know who i 'm calling : )	4079
1	i had a really good experience here . although it has taken a while due to them going back & forth with the insurance company , they kept me in the loop and were quick to get back to me whenever i reached out to them . today i spoke with lizette and she was amazing . she worked to help me and did what she said she was going to do . i appreciate her awesome customer service skills and all that she did ! i would recommend this law group , especially cause of her !	4079
1	the service was great they are very thorough and helpful with everything concerning the legalities of my car accident . but more importantly they care ! so thank you for working my case chad , and a very very special thank you to amy wagner for working my case as well you are amazing thank you for all your help and added compassion .	4079
1	ericka and the plg got me a great result on my case . i was always well informed via email and phone calls from ericka as to what was happening with my case . i was left with no outstanding medical bills and a good settlement .	4079
1	highly recommend phillips law group ! ! my family & i were hit by a drunk driver last may & they settled our case with over 120k ! ! ! they also treat you like family . i recommend working with montana & kris . montana guided us through every step & piece of paperwork then kris personally met me at the bank & spent about 5 hours setting up our kids with their settlement money into cd accounts . it means so much to us & we really appreciate their time & dedication .	4079
1	got into my first car accident and contacted phillips law . got lucky with cindy messner , she has helped me and kept me very calm while going through this process . i could n't have asked for a better person to walk me through this all but new idea . with help from ruthanne , they have both kept in great contact and kept me updated on any details needed . i would recommend her to anyone . cheers and thanks for taking such great care of me ! - dominic manyrath	4079
1	drucilla helped me out so much throughout my process . i had got in a bad accident where my friend had passed away and i broke my clavicle . she helped me through the whole processes not just financially but emotionally as well . i 'm glad i went through phillips law group for my needs .	4079
1	my paralegal elizabeth lozano and attorney steven jones were amazing . they always had very clear communication with me regarding my case , which lasted nearly a year . they got me an excellent pay out and i 'm very pleased with their service . i highly recommend them !	4079
0	absolutely horrible ! it is friday afternoon at 3:00 pm , i go to court monday morning at 8:30 am , i still can not get a hold of my so called attorney . i called the office numerous times , all i do is leave messages , no one ever calls back . i never even spoke at all with my so called attorney , ever ! . this is the first time i am dealing with this , and i 'm left high and dry . i have been waiting to go to court for 2 years , now what ? thanks for nothing phillips law . you are exactly why most people hate lawyers .	4079
0	if i could , i would give 0 . they agreed to take my case , then while i was hospitalized for 3 weeks , which i contacted them twice to let them know about and have confirmation that they received my messages , they dropped me saying they could n't get in touch with me . when i got out of the hospital i called twice more and they have refused to return my calls .	4079
0	upon contacting their office regarding questions on my pending case , returned phone calls were never given . my last phone call complaining about lack of response resulted in them dropping my case . obviously this firm is too busy to return necessary phone calls . i would suggest that if you 're considering them using them for any legal matters , think twice and look elsewhere .	4079
0	seeking general advice , the person on the phone was very impatient , would not let me finish my story , before telling me `` its not something we would get involved with '' and hung up . i do n't recommend you call this firm .	4079
0	those individuals were very very rude they yell at you and just hang up in your face ... they was not able to at least answer my question when asked . they just yelled and said we cant help you and hung up.. i do not recommend them for any advice..	4079
0	worst experience trying to cancel my case . jason flory at x 399 the biggest unprofessional jerk in the world with complete lack of any people skills . does n't even check his own voice mail and when his assistant is out of the office they do n't get checked . had to drive all the way down there to talk to him face to face , dressed like a slob , wrinkled suit . i do not recommend this firm to anyone for anything . we have been trying for over a month to get our $ back	4079
0	they only want the big cases like malpractice that caused death . my wife had a mri that was misread by a radiologist , clearly malpractice . the radiologist said there was no cyst on her spine and there clearly was . not enough damage for them to take the case . would not even take it by the hour . greed is a terrible thing .	4079
0	went here many years ago when it was known as phillips & associates ... look into why their name changes every few years . i trusted them to represent me but instead got bullied and stole my money ! ! ! run , find another attorney because this place is a joke !	4079
0	all i have to say is i literally lost everything ! after a accident i was n't at fault for . after waiting almost a year out of 15k i will only receive 3k . they refer you to all their friends whom receive more than the client . lisette was the only professional . i was always calling and requesting updates prior to her . drops mic .	4079
0	the lawyer tried to finesse me into signing paper work without speaking to my family first.this is my first car accident so i do n't know anything i was just trying to consult with my family he said i would be charged 33 % he told me he could lower it to 29 % i asked him if i can have a day to think about this to speak to my family about what i should do and he rudely said `` take it or leave it '' it 's a now choice i 'm not waiting for a response . i almost got rushed into signing papers that would most likely end up scamming me after .	4079
1	well the staff is friendly and helpful and all but the reason for today 's review is different . there 's an employee named john and everytime i go there he goes above and beyond to help me and goes out of his way to make sure his customers are satisfied . than you for all your past and future help john	4080
1	excellent customer service . went in to see about recharging the air conditioning in my car . amber was very knowledgeable and friendly . she came outside to help us with the recharge . she informed me about some other minor things i should keep an eye on . i 've been driving the car for a few days and the air conditioning is doing great .	4080
1	had done my car maintenance done at the dealership and the dealership asked if i wanted them to do my air filter changes . i figured i 'd do it myself since that the easiest thing you could do for your car . i 'm not really a car person so i went in looking for help/advice . jennifer was very helpful with finding my the correct air filter and cabin air filter i needed for my car . she also informed me that there was an available discount for buying both which was much appreciated so it was cheaper than expected . ended up saving money due to that i changed out the air filters myself rather than the dealership !	4080
0	we work in the area so we shop a bunch here . when at the store we 've always had decent service . nothing worth mentioning either way , pro or con . but recently when i called the gentleman ( i use that term loosely ) was very short on the phone . mannersphone etiquette anyone	4080
0	these guys need some major training in how to talk to customers ! not a clue . when i first went in roger the store manager helped me and he was great ! he offered to order parts for me and made it a painless experience . then when i picked the parts up there was confusion as to what i was getting . ( roger was not there ) 3 guys were there standing around doing nothing . the big guy who helped me was argumentative and the other 2 were no help at all , in fact they were downright rude ! it was worked out but i left there feeling i will never return .	4080
0	absolutely the worst service ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they do not help with anything . i 've been there twice in a week and both times i 've wanted to pull my hair out . they are extremely rude . find a different autozone .	4080
1	cheese bread and margherita pizza is my go to order ! the stuffed manicotti is also really good .	4081
1	great pies tons of toppings try the buffalo chicken sandwich ask for it not on menu	4081
1	amazing . white garlic sauce , feta , spinach , bacon , shrimp . mother of god . please help me .	4081
1	first time ordering here , everything was great , the hawaiian pizza had real pineapple chunks in it that looks like they cut up themselves , not your typical canned pineapple everyone throws on their pizza , the cheese was high quality . i also ordered the pizza sub and that mushrooms were fresh , the pepperoni was perfect . lastly the cheesy garlic bread done right also . this could easily go to a 5 star rating if they stay consistent with the quality they are putting out right now . delivery time was good , they said 45 minutes , and it was about 35-40 minutes . the order taker on the phone was a nice young lady . delivery guy was friendly .	4081
1	been enjoying the chicken club pizza for over 5 years now , its always excellent , consistency matters !	4081
1	great neighborhood pizzeria . reasonably priced . ordered the `` america 's 3 favorite toppings '' ( pepperoni , sausage , and mushroom , and extra cheese ) , and they were very generous with toppings , unlike some chains that give you a thin layer of toppings and cheese over a thick layer of dough . they made our wings extra crispy as we had requested . they even provided paper plates , napkins , parmesan and red pepper without us even having to ask for it . glad to have this place just down the block as it is now my new go-to for pizza .	4081
1	best pizza in town - hands down ! ! forget metro pizza , grimaldis and any other pizza place.. this place is the real deal for authentic pizza . great sauces , fresh mozzarella and topings ! been in business over 12 years -- because they do make the best pizzas in this town . this is not a sit down place , order to deliver or pick up . make your own pizza -- they do it perfectly every time ! consistent quality and delicious !	4081
1	love this little spot ! hands the the best pizza in town . i 've been ordering for about a year now from here . there chicago pizza is so good , there wings are great ! 100 % recommended .	4081

1	the first time i tried pizza my dear was in 2009 and i knew right away i would be going back . for just the taste it is one of the best pizza places out there . for value , they really blow everyone else away if you order the large pizza from 10-4 . it is only $ 5 and tastes great ! my wife and i get one at least every other week .	4081
1	well , it 's been just about a year that we 've been in this neighborhood and we 've ordered from pizza my dear many , many times . it has become my favorite pizza in las vegas . i 'm from chicago and my husband is from massachusetts so we know good pizza . it is simply the best ! ! ! ! keep up the great work ... .you deserve all the 5 star ratings .	4081
1	love this little mom and pop shop ! their handmade fresh veggie pizza is my favorite ! with artichoke , sweet bell peppers , mushrooms , tomatoes , zucchini , onions and spinach . i always add pineapple to it for that extra sweetness ! ! oh my gosh it 's so good ! ! amanda , the tall girl at the counter is always my pizza maker or delivery girl . she 's like a one man show . but she is so sweet , and delivers the greatest customer service . she is the heart of this restaurant and she is why i keep coming back ! ! this is on my top 3 pizza spots in vegas ! !	4081
1	awesome cheese pizza and loaded salads wish i tried this place years ago since it 's just across the street lol	4081
1	i give their chicago stye pizza a+++++ . so glad it is our neighborhood pizza parlor . the staff is very friendly and when they say it will be ready in 25 minutes , they mean it .	4081
1	pizza my dear has become our favorite place for pizza . hands down the best we have found .	4081
1	only the best pizza . the gourmet veggie and buffalo chicken is my favorite . dont forget the cheesy garlic bread .	4081
1	i believe this is the best pizza in vegas . my favorite is the mediterranean not only is the pizza very good the people that work there are super nice .	4081
1	just want too say thanks pizza my dear ! been sick all week . nothing sounded good , could n't eat . 2day i woke up craving all my faves from you . of course you delivered ( next time i wo n't order gluten free ! ) . love you guys and gals .	4081
1	pretty damn good . salads , breadsticks , pizza and bomb hot wings . i think this is my favorite so far here in henderson ! ! everything i have tried has been super yummy .	4081
1	we ordered for the first time , delivery . hawaii 5-0 and the pizza bolognese . my autistic son , who has a crazy , limited diet , loved it and ate faster than we could feed him ! the delivery guy was super friendly . i would ask to modify the online menu to make it more user friendly for cell phone usage . very hard to read .	4081
1	this is the first gluten free delivery pizza in 10 years ! ! needless to say , yummm ! ! the gf crust was excellent ! and they make it in house ! toppings were of excellent quality too ! mediterranean salad was bomb ! and a huge amount , fed all three of us with some to spare ! thanks for the gf tasty deliciousness ! my belly is so happy !	4081
1	excellent pizza . conventionally excellent . fresh ingredients , well-made . the staff is fantastic . will come again .	4081
1	for pizza delivery it 's my go to . i always get the pizza bianca thin crust ( i add sausage ) and is really good . i also orederd their wings before which are good and the italian house salad also good enough for 2 people and leftovers .	4081
0	my kid had a birthday party at pump it up -- the large , indoor play area with inflatable bounce houses and stuff -- and pizza my dear is their pizza vendor . so we ordered about 10 pies . the crust was chewy and almost rubbery . toppings were nothing special . i 've definitely had worse pizza -- chuck e cheese comes to mind . but , i 've also had much better pizza elsewhere around town . the only way i 'll eat their pizza again will probably be at another kid 's party if it 's held at pump it up .	4081
0	from start to finish not great . ordered a steak sandwich . the price unreasonable . trying to order was nothing short of frustrating . i really could have bought steakumm and made it taste better and this was grocery freezer quality meat . the meat was dry , peppers and onions barely grilled . to receive order was almost an hour wait when told 45 minutes . wo n't order from here again . i 'll starve first	4081
0	we ordered the margherita pizza , on the flyer we received there was an amazing looking pizza with fresh basil and fresh mozzarella , so we ordered it . we received free garlic cheese bread as well . the garlic bread was okay , a 4/10 . the pizza was meh , the crust was n't crispy and the basil was shredded instead of full leaves as the flyer suggested . the reason this place gets one star , both my fiancé and i got sick from it . we threw out the remainder of the pizza , no leftovers for us ! will not order from this place again .	4081
0	while delivery was fast , the food was meh . jalapeño poppers tasted like they had been frozen for a year and cheese was n't really melted , threw them out . pizza was ok but not ny style , more like pizza hut style . not sure if i misunderstood or what , but i was hoping for the ny style . lettuce in the salad was brown and old , had to throw half of it out . kind of bummed .	4081
0	no stars not only was my late pizza , wrong , & a fairly decent tip . when i talked to the `` manager '' he told me that `` he made it right by remaking my pizza '' ... smh . i work 12 hr days and i have a dog so i dont have time for a 2+hr mess up ... especially considering a representative of the company ca n't take the blame . i sure long for my money pizza place in federal way , wa ... .pizza pizzazz .	4081
0	i 've ordered from them for years and it 's usually pretty good but today 's service was beyond awful . and , they shrunk the size of the lasagna . add both together and it was n't worth the money .	4081
0	digiorno , my dear . sorry , but need to call a spade a spade here . i had high expectations , hoping this could be my go-to neighborhood pizza joint , but the pizza was unremarkable tonight . it was an average pie , nothing to get super excited about . i actually toasted it a bit more when i got home and found it better . i 'm also a sucker for a good chicken parm ( please tell me where are they in vegas ? ) but instead of ordering the $ 9.99 version here i thought i 'd try the chicken finger appetizer to see if it warranted the price . got ta say , i 'm curious .	4081
0	when i last talked to the manager he told me that since he sent another pizza out that made everything square . that is what made me very angry . i wake up very early to work very long days so dealing with something like that is a major inconvenience for me . what really makes it a damn shame is that i was a first time customer and the pizza was actually very good .	4081
0	pizza is not gluten free . real gluten free has its own oven . used for gluten free made food . you can not cook gluten free in the some oven as normal dough . its a scam . but the hot wings were delicious & small & natural like .	4081
0	loyal customer 4 months . ordered 1-2 x week . dropped 1-2 thousand here . new driver arrived 60 minutes late then pulled a cheap hussle to scam a $ 20 tip . lip service from manager . never again .	4081
0	wow just got off the phone with the rudest girl who 's ever taking a pizza order ever from me . i almost hung up twice because of her horrible phone edicate . i 've ordered from this place many times with and everyone 's was nice . they should really train or fire the horrific voice and bad attitude who answered the phones sunday night .	4081
0	use to be good food and friendly service but not so much any more . they frequently get my order wrong and was told during my last visit , `` hold on a minute ! '' after i rang the bell . would normally not be a problem but after the delivery driver was a jerk in the parking lot and walked past me standing at the register , i 'm not coming back .	4081
0	do not order from this place . they accepted my grubhub order and then 90 minutes later when i inquired as to where the food was they would n't answer grubhub 's calls . now they are apparently closed and we are out our time and money . the chat with grubhub disconnected so we have to dispute the charge . terrible experience and the fact they would n't even answer grubhub 's calls ( their partner ) despite the fact that they were still open says a lot . update in response to the owner 's comment : it was april 20 . i have the order number . it was your store .	4081
0	my bf loves using yelp so he finds this pizza delivery hoping to stay away from the chains . i guess if you enjoy hard to navigate websites for pizza order and flavorless pizza then you might like this better than i did . i chose to start using yelp for reviews after this experience to help people avoid the disappointment i experienced . i was really craving a decent delivery pizza . the pepperoni , the cheese , the sauce , , , all basically tasteless . i hope he does n't force me to use this delivery again . i 'll drive to metro or grimaldis before i allow my taste buds to be let down like this again .	4081
0	use to be good food and friendly service but not so much any more . they frequently get my order wrong and was told during my last visit , `` hold on a minute ! '' after i rand the bell . would normally not be a problem but after the delivery driver was a jerk in the parking lot and walked past me standing at the register , i 'm not coming back .	4081
0	very unfriendly and inpatient in taking orders , pizza may be ok but nothing replaces good customer service	4081
0	the staff here misrepresent the truth when asked about the food . this is not authentic anything ! they use the same conveyor belts that sam 's club and costco and domino 's use ... ... believe me , its not very good..sam 's does a much better job . the pizza is overpriced and without flavor , absolute garbage ... stay away if you want even a decent pizza .	4081
0	another bad experience . i 've ordered wings from them many times because they are good . i always get them hot and they have quite a bit of sauce on them . this last time , 75 % of them had no sauce on them and the rest had just a drizzle of sauce . some wings are ok with no sauce but these were extremely bland .	4081
0	was craving pizza and decided to give them another try because their food used to be awesome . sadly , it 's still sub-par . the crust was so dry , it was hard like those end-pieces that are in the box after 3 days .	4081
0	ordered two items , pizza and a salad . there was no sauce on our pizza , not sure how you forget that . also , asked for no chicken on our salad and there was chicken all over it . called and restaurant offered a $ 5 coupon . unbelievable .	4081
0	i ordered pizza , and a few other things , at 7:40pm . my order was confirmed , i was given confirmation code and an estimated delivery time of 55-65 min at 8:44pm . at 9:00pm we called because our pizza had n't been delivered.. the number took me to grubhub where the woman told me my order had been canceled because they were closed ... . long story long basically dont order pizza from this place on yelp . they may have good pizza but they dont know how to deliver it	4081
0	i ordered pizza for my company meeting . when the meeting recessed 90 minutes later the pizza had yet to arrive . i had a missed call informing me that we were outside their delivery range ( then why did the order go through ? ) . we spent the last 30 minutes of our meeting starving . i felt so bad i authorized bonuses to be paid to the staff for missing dinner . their mistake cost me a significant sum of money and made me look the fool in front of my crew . by this time the pizza place had closed and we had missed the opportunity to order elsewhere . never again !	4081
0	great , great service but pizza is n't that good and the wings are awful . i ordered the margherita pizza and it had way to much basil on it and almost no sauce . the cheese was like plastic , picked a piece up from the side of the box and spit it out bc i thought it was paper , then i realized it was suppose to be cheese . the wings were really dry and it was just hot with no flavor . the toasted ravioli barely had no cheese and was not crispy but that 's understandable because it was delivery . would n't order from here again .	4081
1	came across this gold mine just walking down main at on friday night . good tunes , reasonable prices and fun staff made the evening a great experience . definitely making it a regular watering hole since it 's so close to home .	4082
1	we had a big group in for a wedding brunch a couple of weeks ago the wait staff are awesome super friendly and accommodating the food is good i would recommend to anyone	4082
1	great butter chicken and naan . even better with pint of muskoka detour . service is excellent .	4082
0	i have been here twice for lunch . both times the service was extremely slow . there was no way that you could eat here if you just have an hour for lunch . on both occasions my food arrived and was not that hot . i ordered the guinness pot pie the first time and the chicken club the second time . i would say both of these meals were ok . i have not been here in the evening so perhaps it is different ?	4082
0	like i said before which was removed , sadly . if you enjoy a good bar fight with a bunch of drunk roofers then the tipsy cow should be your destination of choice ! ! the owners have no control over their patrons which usually end up yelling , screaming and fighting every friday and saturday night up and down main street ! ! ... ..what else can i say `` flies are attracted to shit '' ! !	4082
0	can i do 0 stars ? server did n't seem like he wanted to be here did n't know specials could barely coax a word out of him , and it was a ghost town . reviews tell all , probably not worth ur hardearned dollars . granted his saving grace was he did n't charge us for the pops we ordered before we decided to leave . they were flat and terrible but good on him for doing the right thing .	4082
1	my boyfriend and i have been wanting to get a couples massage so i thought i 'd try this place out for valentine 's day since i was able to get a great deal on groupon . the facility was clean and had a relaxing vibe . our two masseuses were very nice and made sure they knew exactly where our problem spots were so they could take care of them . prices were a little higher than we 're used to , but we would come back again .	4083
1	great location and they care to customize the experience for you by asking questions about goals , preferences . they have a very relaxing waiting area , helpful and personable front desk staff and most importantly experienced therapists . i liked every therapist they 've recommended to me so far and their wellness program/membership is surprisingly super flexible and quite reasonable !	4083
0	i purchased on groupon for the one hour massage . but little did i know if you purchased two coupons , you can only use one and only for new client , i had to give away my other coupon to a friend of mine . i did n't pick my own masseuse , and i did n't enjoy the massage that much .	4083
0	went during spa week for the first time , and while the staff were all very friendly , the room was freezing and i was very cold the entire time . also i paid for an hour massage , which in their world apparently only means 47 minuets . felt ripped off in the end . wo n't be back .	4083
1	hands down , best cvs , linda , super friendly cashier greeted us upon arrival & kevin & ray in pharmacy were especially helpful . minimal waiting too ! i 'm so glad to have a cvs that treats their customers like human beings . the cvs pharmacist on e riggs treated my husband poorly , i tried to rectify the issue & both my husband & myself were asked `` to leave & never come back '' thanks ray for rectifying the other cvs 's error . i 'm glad i do n't have to go back to e riggs cvs ... .ever ! !	4084
1	everyone was nice . the front cashier greeted me when i entered and when i left . amy the fnp was great !	4084
1	the professionalism and consistency of great shopping experiences points to solid management at this store . you could go to other options a mile or so away , but you 'd be making a mistake .	4084
0	very disappointed in their landscaping they do not keep up the grounds when i first pulled up i thought the cvs was shut down because the landscaping was overgrown l weeds every wear and palm trees look like they have n't been cut years hope they clean it up soon ! ! !	4084
0	horrible customer service , usually out of stock on prescriptions if you need more than 1 or 2 . zero help from pharmacy staff . texted me at 7:59 pm that my rx was ready , went to the pharmacy counter , greeted with metal shutters . pharmacy closes at 8:00 pm . getting ready to move prescriptions someplace more reassuring and helpful . dirty exterior and grounds too .	4084
0	put up a nicely printed laminated sign saying restrooms were out of order `` sorry '' ... yeah right ! i looked through the window and no maintenance was going on . they just do n't want customers using their restrooms ! what jerks ... wo n't be filling my prescriptions or buying anything from that store any longer ... '' sorry '' !	4084
1	love this place ! have my nails and daughter 's nails done here . friendly staff , clean and always a great job . kathy and veena great jobs . they are busy but i do n't mind waiting . have tried most nail shops around here . this one is my fav !	4085

1	salon is beautiful and always immaculately clean . staff is friendly and attentive . great products and choices for mani and pedi !	4085
1	in from out of town randomly went here . they were great ! the front desk girl sabrina was really nice and lisa did a great job on my nails . they did n't do massage on my arms like they do in la , but other than that all was wonderful ! it 's a bit far from where i 'm staying , but will be back for sure !	4085
1	first time coming and i love it . nancy really gave me a set of nails that i asked for . the salon is beautiful and they have reasonable prices . all the technicians are friendly and i will definitely be back in 2 weeks .	4085
1	love this nail salon ! close to my home , quality service , very professional , trendy ambiance . they have a loyalty program as well , i 'm one visit away from a discount	4085
1	nick was the best nail tech i 've had . he did a great job with my coffin nails which is hard to find . i have gone to lavish nails a couple times but nick by far was the best !	4085
1	finally ! ! sanitary , really friendly and detailed ! i do nails myself and it 's always hard to go to a walk in place but it 's something my mom likes to do together so thank you sabrina & michael , my mom and i gel mani and pedi looks perfect !	4085
1	this nail salon comes highly recommended . efficient , clean and had a great selection of services & colors . they made room for us in with 15 minutes notice , plus the salon is beautiful ! bic is amazing ! ! she is friendly and does a pristine job !	4085
1	beautiful inside ! very busy due to the holiday weekend , but i waited approximately 15 minutes before being seated ( without an appointment ) . nail tech did a quick , but nice gel manicure . she was also assisting customers as they walked in , setting up pedicures , and answering the phone . she thanked me for my patience throughout . i will definitely return .	4085
1	i 've been going to this salon for a couple years now and love it . the nail technicians are all friendly and do a great job . i get my pedicures and gel manicures done here . they have a huge variety of nail polish colors to choose from . they are open 7 days a week so it 's perfect for my schedule to just walk in whenever i want . definitely recommend this salon to everyone .	4085
1	best place in town to get your nails done super clean , professional and lan does my nails beautifully love this place	4085
1	this nail salon comes highly recommended . they were friendly , efficient and did great work ! they made room for us in with 15 minutes notice , plus the salon is beautiful ! we will be coming back !	4085
1	amazing amazing amazing ! nail techs goes above and beyond , pays attention to every detail , and are very sweet . i 'm never disappointed with my nails ! theyre perfect every time . the salon is very luxury , decorated very high-end , and clean . prices are reasonable . always remember that coffin nails are gon na cost more !	4085
1	best place in town to get your nails done i got the silver chrome design and i get lots of compliments . very clean and inviting it 's my little get away to pamper myself .	4085
1	lavish nail lounge is the place my daughter and i choose for all of our nail/wax services . my favorite technicians are michael and bic but honestly everyone is fabulous , i have never been disappointed . i just enjoy michael more because unfortunately i have really bad cracked heels and he takes real good care of me . make an appointment , they are always busy and they offer a punch card . see you soon michael !	4085
1	my nail tech , michael , moved to this salon just recently and i followed him and so glad i did . it has the feel of an expensive salon with the decor . everyone is so nice and it just has an overall calming feel to it .	4085
1	i absolutely love lavish . it lives up to its name . the ambiance is lavish friendly and creative . i 'm always happy with my nail art and quality . they seem to use good quality products that last my 3 week plus appointments . i love the friendly staff . you should make them your nail place !	4085
0	i tried one time to go to the owner because lan was out of town . i said 3 times , i would like my nails to be square square . she began to file them in a coffin shape , when i asked why she would do that . she stated because she thinks coffin is more elegant . i thought they were my nails . lan is wonderful ! she has moved on and so will i .	4085
0	had an awful experience in this salon today , as the nail technician insulted my eight year old daughter about her weight . the situation was so bad that another patron of the salon ( the most amazing , kind hearted person ) unbenounced to me paid for our services as she left the salon . the salon attempted to make the situation right by offering me a twenty dollar gift certificate . this person also tried to explain that `` she comes from a different culture '' . she was the second person to use this poor excuse . gave the gift certificate to another patron , as i will never go back there again .	4085
0	i had an appointment at 12:50 . they did n't start my appointment until 1:15 . i had told them i wanted a regular manicure and pedicure and they were very pushy for me to get the gel instead . i said no about 5 times until she finally let up . the woman ended up making my right toe bleed , and i have small cuts on two fingers . i would not recommend this place .	4085
0	horrible . i went in for a gel fill yesterday and the nail tech was very rude . she kept pulling my arm and had a terrible attitude . before i paid i asked if she could file my nails a little bit more . before i finished my sentence she said no . i 'm not happy at all with my nails and the service . will not be returning	4085
0	the man that works here is one of the worst manicurists . he rubbed my skin raw and told me i was just being too sensitive . the acrylics nails he put on me are already falling off and it has been less than 2 weeks . he rushed through the whole process and burned through my nail a few times . he kept glueing my skin to the nail . he nicked me with the grinder countless times . only redeeming factor was his wife did an ok job with the polish . which was still thin enough to see through ... very disappointed .	4085
0	they are racist and rude as hell ... . they try to charge for every single detail.. they never have good phone etiquette . looks like only really old white people come here sorry not sorry	4085
0	i was excited to try this place . i made an appointment for myself and my sister . we got a pedicure and gel manicures . i felt very rushed . the lady that did my services kept rushing instead of taking her time . my sister also tried to paid with her discover card and they did n't no accept it but on their window they stated they do accept discover . when she asked what should she do they actually told her to call me and see if i could come back and pay ! completely unacceptable ! ! !	4085
0	their customer service is terrible . i get my nails done once a week u would think i would get much more respect . i 'm always getting put last . they let this lady go ahead of me n this also happened last week as well it 's getting irritating and i 'm going to go else where . so beware on how they will treat if u have ur kids with u	4085
0	i had my brows waxed and when she handed me the mirror it was ok but when i came home in lighting . my brows i asked to be cleaned up and it was not cleaned up much at all i had to clean the rest of the area where i saw hair to be pulled ths is not the best place for wax i rather go back to my original location .	4085
0	this was my first time at this nail salon and it was a very unfortunate experience . 3 girlfriends and i had appointments at 4:30 and waited about 10 minutes before we left . it was packed . some of the regulars say this is a common experience when they come to this salon - this salon is not able to keep appointments . there was also not a single employee who even said `` hello '' to acknowledge our presence , which may have pacified me a bit . very unprofessional .	4085
0	this place is a joke . prices are outrageous . they treat people horrible . management is a joke , my wife went in to have a nail replacement and was charged $ 45 . and was treated like shit . i highly recommend you pass on this place , many more out there that would love the buisness .	4085
0	my first time going to this place was 8/12/17 @ 1 pm . i really liked that they can see me right away after all the good reviews i decided to give them a try . it is now 8/13/17 11:26 , not even 24 hours and a nail already chipped ! ! ! so upset	4085
0	so far , not so good . i called ahead to make my appointment , but first asked if they were busy . she did n't answer my question , but got my name . i was not greeted , but everyone after me was . i was seated 15 minutes after my appointment .	4085
0	we waited forever when we had an appointment . they would n't fix my cousins nails when she said something was wrong with it and she 's getting married saturday . they expected her to pay after spending $ 110 . the nail technician called my cousins fingers fat and she 's not even fat . she 's skinny af ! ! ! ! ! we had an appointment at 1230 and we did n't leave until 330 .	4085
0	very clean , nice environment . very rude technicians . instead of letting me know she was done with one foot by telling me . she would keep tapping my legs which apparently meant to switch legs . no greeting . informed her to trim my nails and she did n't . not personable . not worth the money . : /	4085
0	i would 've given this place 5 stars . i do when the male owner is around he makes this place very inviting . the female owner on the other hand ( his wife ) very rude . it 's obvious she speaks a different language when she 's talking about you . usually i would n't mind but it 's so impolite . very unprofessional as an owner . there is another nail salon being built in the same shopping center . we will see if that one is better .	4085
0	my nails turned out fine and the manager is very nice but the stylist i had wasnt what i would call friendly . this was my first time getting my nails done so the process was overwhelming and not the best experience . the stylist my fiance had was rude and made an extremely offensive comment about lesbians and because of this we will not be returning .	4085
0	absolutely terrible experience . i needed a dip soak off and a regular manicure . the paint job looks like a child did it . the clear coat around the cuticle is jagged and the polish is already wrinkling . i will be taking off as soon as i get home to do a better job myself . will not be back !	4085
1	my wife and i have been coming here for years and years and we love this place . rosa and brenda are the best !	4086
1	my wife and i have been coming here for about a decade . service is consistently good . i had one problem a few years ago and the owner responded quickly and effectively . the prices have risen but they still are very competitive . i appreciate that the prices are clear .	4086
1	this is a wonderful dry cleaner . they are really inexpensive and they do a great job ; my clothes never have that chemical smell that some of the places have afterward .	4086
1	do n't look for a sign for malibu ... just look for $ 2.25 cleaners . it 's right next to the jamba juice . they are affordable and really quick . had my stuff in at 11 and it was ready by 4 even though they were pretty busy ! ca n't really complain about that !	4086
1	excellent service . even though the guy working out front is a lil youngin , he thoroughly explained their services and prices ( which are very affordable ) they offer fast service , did a good job on my clothes , and i even got a phone call thanking me for trying their service and gave me a coupon to use for next time . now that 's customer service ya'all ! only drawback is that i was hoping the do alterations which they dont , but they did recommend a nearby place that could help me . i found my new dry cleaners !	4086
0	rude owner and staff . i had an issue with a garment , and they refused to acknowledge that it could have been their fault , and then they insinuated that i probably knew it was damaged and was trying to con them . been there dozens of times . i 've been there dozens of times , but i 'll never go again .	4086
0	i have gone here for the last 3 years and will not be going anymore . in that time the prices went from great to nearly double . i 've already searched around and found cheaper with similar service and quality .	4086
0	this place is bs the workers have to work in this sweat shop with no ac that very sad and very selfish of the owner	4086
0	here 's a quick update . i did n't see it right away , but they attached a little note to my husband 's dress shirt stating `` they apologize , but they could n't get rid of the wrinkles '' ... ... ok ... no seriously ... . why are you in the dry cleaning business ? ? ca n't get the stains out , ca n't press ... .fantastic .	4086
0	they have a sign that states `` same day service available . '' i brought a jacket in there this morning at 9:15am and asked to please have it done today . the girl was not friendly and said `` you had to be here before 9 . '' again it does not state that on the window and i was there by 9:15am . as a brand new customer , they have ensured i will never be back . horrible customer service !	4086
1	i went here yesterday . i was in and out so quick i 'm still kind of in a daze lol . the lady at the first chair did my eyebrows and she did a good job .	4087
1	agree with the below post - the ladies here consistently do a great job on hair removal . the building is not the fanciest place ever , but the quality of the threading is good every time and cheaper than when i used to do waxing . also agree , they are not very talkative , but neither am i and i appreciate the quality and cost more than any small talk . overall , great place for hair removal !	4087
0	i went and i asked for my eyebrows to be cleaned up and instead they made them way thinner than i wanted . i have been trying to grow them out for a year , and they had just started to look how i wanted them and now they are ruined ! ! also it hurt pretty bad .	4087
0	i 've been going here for two years only because i did n't know about the other place in town . every time i come the workers never ask how i am , let alone carry a conversation with me . how could they with the movie playing in the background ? two of the three girls who work there always end up cutting my skin above my eye which already a sensitive area . they never smile . only go here f you are in a bind otherwise look up the other place in town . it 's cheaper and the gal is much more sociable .	4087
1	we love this pastries shop during our stayed in montreal . i tried a few other bakeries near the area , i do n't believe in going back to the same place twice when exploring a new town . however this place is so good . they have the most amazing chocolate croissant , almond croissant , blueberry tart and not to mention their specialty kouign amann . the only thing that we did n't like was the apple turnover ( a little tart for our taste ) and the cafe au lait ( a little on the light side ) .	4088
1	i had to write a review for this place . the almond croissant is the best baked good on this planet . you can not make something better . it 's stunning . go here .	4088
1	awesome almond croissants and kouign amann . the kouign amann was a little heavy for me but still delicious . i luckily got a piece of a fresh baked one and hot and flakey . the sugar on top crystallized and was a nice touch . the almond croissant was just as good as mamie clafoutis so i ca n't rly say which one is better .	4088
1	five stars if they went cash only - or credit cards only over a certain amount . it seems like montreal has slow data and everyone here was buying a small order and proceeding to pay with a credit card so the line was extended needlessly . also - to non french speakers reading their english/french dictionaries and guidebooks - just speak english to the staff - no one will yell at you and you can save your self respect .	4088
1	great food . amazing pasteries . only problem is there are only two tables for sitting . we had to grab pur food and eat somewhere else . but totalllly worth it !	4088
0	what ? ? ? why do people like this place so much ? i am french and i came here with my boyfriend who is from brittany ( where kouign amanns are from ) . we got a pain aux raisins , a pain au chocolat , and a kouign amann . super disappointed with everything . so boring and nothing special	4088
0	this place may be amazing but i would n't know . despite the hours listed showing that they should have been open at 9:30am they were still closed	4088
0	so today i would like to share my grievance with patisserie au kouign amann on mont royal street . right before leaving montreal i decided to buy a croissant fromage from them , but never got the chance to eat it . thank god i did n't , because today as i bit into this croissant i crunched on three pieces of glass . i was shocked and bewildered to learn that something so dangerous was found in my food . i 'm not there anymore , but for anyone who still goes there be careful , because there is clearly someone who is negligent working there . i included some photos in this rant as further proof of this gross negligence .	4088
0	wanted to stop here on our way out but noticed they accepted cash only . we were traveling , what a shame .	4088
0	the kouign-amann that i 'm used to is laminated dough with sugar in the layers , that is baked in individual cups to crisp caramel perfection . this bakery bakes their version in a cake pan and serves slices - the crisp effect with light buttery layers is totally lost . i do n't know which technique is more traditional but i certainly have my preference .	4088
1	wow ! this was the best pedicure that i have had in a long time . i had one not too long ago at oasis day spa for $ 60 and it did n't even compare . they recently got new massage pedicure chairs that are amazing ! for only $ 30.00 it was really great service . they really take their time and give you an amazing foot and leg massage and the people are extremely friendly . they even offered us each a bottle of water when we walked in . i will definitely be back and i sent my mom there and she loved it too ! no more groupon pedicures for me !	4089
1	the best , most thoughtful , and well done pedicure i 've ever gotten ! the entire staff was unbelievably kind and so friendly . the man who did my pedicure did an incredible job . we will be back !	4089
1	i got a very nice spa pedicure . the technician spent a lot of time shaping my toe nails and massaging my feet and legs . my only complaint is that they had jerry springer on the tv the entire time . it was hard to relax when people on the show were fighting .	4089
0	my granddaughter and i just went for a parafin manicure . we never received the wax treatment . then an elderly senior lady did a horrible job on my granddaughters nails . she even had polish on the back of her hand . she did n't show me until after we 'd left . she said the owner sent the woman away and tried to fix her nails , but did n't start over . i had to clean off extra polish from her hands , but the basic polish job is caked , splotchy and basically a mess . also , they make you feel really awful unless you pay cash .	4089
0	the workers are very talkative and fun . i went for a pedicure while my friend got a manicure . although the prices on their wall say $ 30 for a pedicure and $ 20 for a manicure we ended up paying $ 50 and $ 35 . i 'm assuming because they failed to mention that the colors they handed us to choose from were gel and would cost more . the pedicure was nice , for the most part , but the woman kept using a towel to rub my toes and i left bleeding . not a good experience .	4089
0	got a mani/pedi here . used shellac and got charged $ 25 extra each for the mani and pedi . i did not expect to pay $ 50 extra ! ! ! was there 2 hours and as much as i told them i had to pick up my son at a certain time , they still had me out late . not cool and not worth it .	4089
1	it 's like going over to you persian aunt house for dinner . family run , excellent service . try the stews ! somehow the prices went up , still good but pricey .	4090
1	we were visiting toronto and stopped by darband to get some food ... . it was clean and nice ... also staff were really friendly kale pacheh was really good ash was really good too	4090
1	excellent food ! the service and ambience was great . the kudidehs ( both chicken and beef ) were excellent .. i have been to many persian places in us , and dubai but this is one of the best so far .. i would highly recommend anyone looking for persian food .. one of the best thing is that they serve alcohol ! ! they do have nice collection ..	4090
1	good food , the service was amazing . zohreh ( our waitress ) was great .	4090
1	took an out of town buddy here , he liked it so much he went back the next day . case closed ! if they try to be bit more friendlier they easily a 5 star in my opinion	4090
1	we discovered this place several weeks ago and had already gone there 4 times . the fesenjan and the chicken breast are out of this world . the flavours are just spectacular ! the persian tea is the best i 've had in toronto and the mint tea is made with real mint -- which i always appreciate . the service is always great and the atmosphere in the restaurant is perfect -- it 's quiet , twilighty and romantic which to us is important -- i like to be able to hear my companion when i go out to dinner .	4090
1	i live in michigan and every time i visit toronto , i make sure to stop by here . the food tastes like authentic iranian food , something that is not easy to find in north america . such food quality is a win even in iran . stews , kababs , and lamb shank are great . the place is neat and classy . staff may at times be slow , but when you ask for their help they will be available .	4090
1	the food is amazing ! unfortunately the service is ok. been there 4 times , our bills were mixed up 3 times ! once they totally forgot to bring our drink ( dough ) !	4090
1	friendly staff , best barg ( tenderloin ) kabob in town , best yogurt drink , very delicious ground beef kabob . would definitely go there for persian food .	4090
1	the persian food here is phenomenal ! ever since we found out about this place from our friends who live in the area , we have been coming every time we are in town . after having been to many persian restaurants that are hit or miss , it nice to find a place that consistently serves quality food . the service is exceptional and the ambience is warm and relaxing . i am deducting 1 star because the cups of chai were the smallest i have ever seen for $ 4 and on our last visit we sat in the back for the first time where the tables were way too close together/claustrophobic .	4090
1	great atmosphere , family operated , and the service is outstanding . the dishes are too die for . it 's highly recommended in my books . try the appetizer platter , you wo n't be disappointed .	4090
1	it 's a new persian restaurant and a good one . i loved the decor and the vibe . the staff were really polite and friendly and the food was great . we had the soltani kebab and the chicken kebab with the eggplant dish . kebab was juicy and tasted wonderful . the food is more expensive than other persian restaurants and small portions too and that is my only complaint .	4090
0	they were very manipulative and literally ripped us off . do n't go there because the price is absolutely not worth the food !	4090
0	the food was really bad ! it was too expensive ! ! 180 for 2 people . not worth it . also the customer service was awful	4090
0	pretentious to say the least . i asked for water with my drink and she brings out bottled water , i said i did n't want bottled water just a glass ( like any restaurant including any 5 star restaurant would bring ) . she told me they do n't have tap water . really ? you do n't have tap water ? makes me think what 's wrong with you plumbing and what the hell do make your rice with . and if you 're going to act all pretentious at least serve high end water , not cheap nestle bottled water . i lost all interest in this place after that . their food is nothing extraordinary .	4090
0	great customer service but the food is just average their kabab torsh was horrible the worst i had but their barg and jooje are average . . and the price is too expensive for the quality .	4090
0	omg . paid $ 200 got food worth of $ 60 . never going back , embarrassed in front of my guest for the food i got . do n't ever order from here .	4090
0	good decor , good food . but honestly , $ 45 for a soltani is borderline theft , if you ask me ! go to north or some other persian restaurant which is as good , and save yourself $ 20 . at $ 45 for a meal , you can get a decent steak at a steakhouse . with apps and a drink , you 're paying close to $ 80 with tax and tip .	4090
0	we used to go to this place a lot for a descent persian food , but the quality did n't keep up with the prices , so we decided not to bother any more . the food was of highest quality and also the most expensive in toronto , but the quality kept getting worse . another thing , the last time we dined in , the staff recommended the appetizer platter ( which was not on the menu ) and charged us 50 bucks for it . seriously ! ?	4090
0	short review : totally unacceptable experience ! long review : 1- over priced menus 2- inability to serve a large group of people who booked one week in advanced . 3- unprofessional attitudes ; requesting minimum order for each person 4- could not manage each and everyone food service . 5- over 90 minutes to bring the main dish .	4090
0	for sure it does not worth it . it is not just the expensive menu ! you can choose to eat or not but the thing is you should keep this on mind they screw the bill by adding nonsense items which is not regular at persian restaurants . even once does not worth it to try . trust me . they charged for a free item in all persian restaurant `` tahdig '' $ 23 ( everywhere this is free ) ! ! and they charged extra $ 8 to exchange the rice type which is not an option ! ! !	4090
0	decor - the place was very clean and well put together , however , the dark lighting coupled with the music choice resulted in my partner and i almost falling asleep before the meal came . food - we both had the rice and chicken breast kebab plate . the rice was devoid of any flavour and the chicken was fairly greasy but at least it had some taste to it . service - very friendly and helpful . the woman serving us was very helpful . price - paid about $ 60 for two kebab plates . much more expensive than typical persian restaurants but unfortunately the food tasted worse than the grease joints north of yonge and finch	4090
0	i do n't know about the food because we were not welcomed here . today at noon we were walking by and saw the open sign on the door . my wife and i walked in and said hi . two staff members were talking to each other . they saw us but they did not respond . i said hello ! . again they looked at us and kept talking to each other . we ended up walking out the restaurant . the food might be good but i am sure the service will not be friendly .	4090
0	the food was definitely not worth $ 150 for two . we sat by the door in an empty resturant and they claimed all the tables are booked for the night !	4090
1	this rosati 's at valvista/elliot is a disaster . very inconsistent quality of pizza and terrible service . i drive down to the power rd location now to get my chicago deep dish . i just had one last night and it was awesome ! great location ! i am from chicago too .	4091
1	had some folks over to the house last friday evening where everyone was supposed to bring a dish . i ordered a 20 '' super supreme and it was snorted down ! it 's a thin crust pizza with lots of goodies on top : sausage , pepperoni , mushrooms , green peppers , onions and black olivesi was hoping to have some leftover , so much for that idea . we had 12 people here , everyone enjoyed it and asked where we got it .	4091
1	i 'm not sure why the ratings are so low , the quality of the food is worth the price ! this has and will always be my favorite pizza place . i would rate a 5 , but we have received one burnt pizza before- it was still delicious so we had no complaints ! get the deep dish	4091
1	best service . great food . good quality ! their pizza is fab . appetizers , sandwiches . and desserts rock it too ! !	4091
1	very chicago style . quality taste is great . please expand and open a patio so surrounding communities can ride bikes to your establishment eat pizza and have a beer .	4091
1	i saw this place online , so i called for delivery . the girl that took my order was very sweet and friendly . delivery was fast and food was amazing ! i ca n't wait to eat here again !	4091
1	i love the chicken parmigiana here . it tastes just as good as more expensive places but 1/2 the cost . salads are fresh and my kids love the pizza . this is a hidden gem . service is always good .	4091
1	got a medium 14 inch thin crust with extra sauce , salami , and meatball . absolutely fantastic . the pizza was picture perfect . the chicken tenders are my favorite appetizer . extra crispy and the buffalo sauce is very zesty . the barbecue sauce is really thick with a good smoky flavor and the ranch dressing is awesome . my favorite sandwich is the cheesy beef . the sandwich is loaded with beef , melted mozzarella , and goes well with sweet or hot peppers on top .	4091
1	this place is something of an anomaly . they do a thin crust pizza that is cut into little squares ( and tasty little crust-dominated corner pieces ) . this is one of my favorite pizzas on the planet . the only reason i hesitate to give this place five stars is because the length of time it takes the pizza to reach your front door and their prices lean more towards the one star range . when i 'm in san francisco , i 'm used to paying $ 23 for a large pizza . not in gilbert , arizona . if this place dropped their prices a bit i would order from them two-to-three times a week .	4091
1	this pizza is amazing ! ! we had a thin crust canadian bacon and pineapple with black olives and an all meat stuffed pizza . both were delicious ! ! the service was excellent as well ! ! does n't get much better than this ! !	4091
1	first time in years we had pizza . they have a place down the street from us . i ate in italian sit-down joint across the street and it was joint . ordered a margarita pizza , it was amazing , thin crust , great flavor was terrific , it make eating out a pleasure , i will be back ! thanks for a great experience .	4091
1	ordered the large 20 inch pizza ample toppings very tasty and hot if you keep to the specials they are reasonably priced if you order alacart it will get pricy used the online order system works great pizza done on time this location has only pickup and delivery .	4091
1	i love to order the cod dinner with fries for lunch . it always arrived hot and it 's delicious . i do n't order it for dinner because they are busier ; the delivery takes longer and my fries are always soggy .	4091
1	just got a large thin pizza , got extra sauce and green pepper and sausage . we like a decent amount of sauce . pizza taste was great . the sauce is very flavorful . me and da wife highly recommend it . tip : if they say 30-40 mins , plan on the 40 min frame . quality pizza takes time unlike the chains .	4091
1	rosati 's has the best thin crust pizza that i have yet to find in arizona ( and being from chicago , i have high standards ) . this location is delivery/carry out only and can make a pie in about 20 minutes from the time you order it ( plenty of time to wander around one of the stores in the strip mall it 's located in ) . the service was good- the phone was answered within a few rings to place our order and we were greeted immediately upon entering the location . if you look a good thin crust pizza , this is the place to try . oh , and their sausage is pretty great too : )	4091
1	not the first time i 've had rosati 's , but this store is fantastic ! their super supreme stuffed pizza tastes amazing and is surprisingly filling ! the management is quite friendly there and the delivery is pretty snappy ! try it out.. you 'll love it ! !	4091
1	thank you rosatis for coming out here.. now i dont have to drive 20 miles for good pizza . the thin crust pepperoni classic is delicious ! ! before they came out here , i tried to go to pizza hut and as barkley tells it , , just terrrrible ... r & r is ok and we all know about dominos ... fyi , , go on fridays , , they double the coupons so you can order a good sized pizza and some wings for under 10 $ if you use the 5 dollar coupon .	4091
1	for this type of restaurant , we were very pleased . its not 5-star , but it is really good food ! the portions were more than plentiful ! we fed our family for $ 25 and everyone was full and satisfied . to us , that 's what matters . thanks rosatis , we will be ordering again often : )	4091
1	best pizza in the valley . tastes like authentic chicago pizza . everything on the menu is delicious ! also great service !	4091
1	we really have enjoyed rosati 's . every one in a while we have issues with the sauce ( or lack there of ) in the pasta . but they have rectified the situation when we have issues . it 's yummy but a little expensive compared to other pizza places .	4091
1	update from previous review '' the manager called and apologized and made a gesture to try them again . we took the leap and tried it . it was superior ! ! the food was prepared well . toppings were bountiful . we were very impressed and will keep ordering rosati 's for the family~ thank you for the follow up	4091
0	disaster for customer service . i was quoted 15 minutes and waited 40 . people working there seemed clueless . salad was terrible . pizza very expensive . the one in chandler is better . stay away from this location ! ! ! !	4091
0	dont waste your time or your $ . i ended up here because barros shut down . large 2 topping at barros is $ 13 . here it is $ 25 .	4091
0	pizza is good . service is not . most recent trip , ordered works with no green peppers . my receipt clearly say no green peppers , but there are peppers on this pizza !	4091
0	the most difficult experience i 've ever had try to order a delivery pizza ! haggling over specials posted online , put on hold twice and still no resolution . called back and stopped order within 2 minutes . manager was `` ok like sorry man , it 'll be 45 to an hour '' . if it 's too close to closing then close an hour earlier ! used to love this place -- what happened	4091
0	new owners ? we ordered from this place about once a month . we reallllllly liked the italian beef sandwich ( the chief ) and their thin crust pizza was great , but this time around ... .not so much . one of the biggest draws was that they double their coupons on fridays-no longer accepted . albeit , they 've lowered their prices but also lowered the quality of food . being from chi-town , i can not believe they sold out by selling their name and reputation to people who lack customer service ( honoring coupons ) and cut corners in food preparation . so long , rosatis ! it was great while it lasted i 'll be across the street at barros !	4091
0	if you like this place , then you have no idea what real pizza is . period . buddyz down the street makes the chicago failure look like there football team . not even close . please read and avoid . this place has dead pizza .	4091
0	typically really good pizza . tonight was a horrible exception . not only was my food prepared wrong , when i called to let them know i was dismissed then hung up on . poor customer service , marginal food and an exceptionally long wait time to receive delivery . your better off choosing the competition than this store . check out the photo of their `` fresh cheese stuffed calzone '' not a shred of cheese was in it . also ordered extra green peppers , not 1 inside . a waste of a $ 50 order for me	4091
0	the most difficult experience i 've ever had try to order a delivery pizza ! haggling over specials posted online , put on hold twice and still no resolution . called back and stopped order within 2 minutes . manager was `` ok like sorry man , it 'll be 45 to an hour '' . if it 's too close to closing then close an hour earlier ! used to love this place -- what happened	4091
0	we usually have a great experience ordering from rosati 's , but our order last night was awful . we ordered an 18 '' with four toppings , along with an order of mozzarella sticks . the pizza appeared to be missing two of the ingredients and it definitely did n't taste like they were there , the pizza was smushed to one side of the box , and the entire order was cold ... .not luke warm , but actually cold . overall , it was really disappointing and given how pricey they are , we were shocked at the poor quality .	4091
0	this was quite bad . we received a deep dish pizza to our door that was literally cold in the middle . of course we had the pleasure of paying $ 30 for it ! pass . better pizza to be found within a 15 min drive .	4091
0	never cared for their pizza , i consider it more of a flat bread with cheese nuked on top of bread , it does n't pull away from a pizza like it should . gave their wings a try , buffalo style . they only had two to choose from which kind of sucked . they said they would be crispy but they were very soggy . they were a descent size and not horribly priced . the sauce was straight forward hot sauce , nothing special . if i was in dyer need of wings i 'd hit them up , but nothing close to being anything special .	4091
0	horrible . that 's all i can say . i ordered a pepperoni supreme but my pizza did n't even have pepperoni on it ! it was bland and had so much cheese my daughter was choking . i only ordered because i kept seeing on groupon ( this location did n't even participate in the groupon offer ) and it looked really good . i 've learned my lesson , no more rosati 's .	4091
0	probably the worst customer service i ever had . i call and order three things for delivery they show up with two because they 're out of wings but do n't bother to call me on the number i gave them and say they called some other number so now i have to sit here and not eat dinner ? yeah that 's ridiculous . then i call and they do n't even do anything about it . never again . save your money go somewhere else .	4091
0	i understand that this location is under new ownership but the only thing that stayed consistent is their stale garlic bread . we ordered our usual , family-sized baked mostaccoli with marinara , and the tray was 1/2 the size for the same price ! also , they have chosen not to include salads with this order anymore ! then we tasted the food and it was comparable to the sauces off the shelves at walmart . we used to love rosati 's , but i guess their new ownership does n't get it . besides that , they were rude and uninterested in resolving our concerns . we will never go back , and i advise the same .	4091
0	what happend ? we would order from here even when our chicago friends and family came to visit . now it is a last resort because there are not many late delivery places in gilbert . they have messed up the last three orders and the quality went way down . management or staff needs to start paying attention . its giving a bad name for chicago pizza . good luck .	4091
0	ordered a pizza at 3:30 for pickup at 4:30 . got there 11 minutes early thinking i would have to wait for it but it was ready . short ride home and the pizza was cold , dry and burned . how long did it sit in the warming oven , my guess is too long . worst pizza ever , threw most of it away .	4091
0	had to go to 1 star . pizza has been awful and i do n't know what happened . so disappointed . sorry rosatis but i need to find a new pizza joint .	4091
0	i am not a fan . my wife and i found this place through an online coupon deal . we ate there , and were not happy . service was slow . the salad was soggy , and the pizza had to much sauce and cheese . we have the deep dish and thought maybe we just did n't like deep dish . the next time we ordered the thin crust to go and still were not happy with the pizza . the sauce was n't that great , and there was tooooo much cheese . we wo n't be going back .	4091
0	have reviewed before but only for pizza . we gave 4stars for flavor . had our first sandwich today and was basically shocked . ordered italian sandwich and when i got home was shocked . sausage on dry bread . that 's it . never again .	4091
0	being from pa , this is the closest pizza to those we used to get back home . great and crispy crust . very impressed . that being said , this place is very expensive for no reason . the portions are not great and it 's just good ol fashion pizza with ordinary ingredients . $ 17 for a 12 '' pie is a bit ridiculous . we also ordered the zucchini fries which were way over battered and there are only about 9 pieces for $ 6+ . although i am a fan of the pizza , i do n't see my self dropping $ 30 on a 12 '' pie , zuchini fries and cheese bread .	4091
0	this place used to have great pizza 5-6 years ago , but has gone horribly down hill . one pizza sticks out in memory . it smelled like fish . i called and asked why they put anchovies on our pizza we did n't order it that way . they said they did not put fish on pizzas there . scared the heck out of me . i guess it was something else on the pizza that was rancid . we 're done with them .	4091
1	took my girls here for new glasses and we were in and out in no time . entire staff was polite and helpful . will return again in the future for sure .	4092
1	i have been going to dr. dadej for 5 years now . i have found him very professional and helpful . his office staff have always been very patient and helpful also . his new office on no . durango is gorgeous .	4092
1	i joined yelp just so i could write a review about these guys . very helpful and personable . i lost my first pair of trial contacts and they replaced them and then while waiting for my prescription to come in they have me another pair when i ripped my left contact . also dr.d is one of the coolest doctors i have met .	4092
0	never received a call when my glasses were ready , i had to call and check everyday yet everytime i came into the office they were not busy at all ... i guess they have better things to do than to give little ol ' me a simple call . they up-sell you to get thinner lenses even if you are poor and have medicaid . exam prices are high aswell . young african american girl was nice with the fitting and check-out , other than that this is a below average optometrist who does not give alot of attention to the patient in my experience .	4092
0	made a mistake by coming into the office . i thought i was in the correct office for my eye exam . rude , no customer service and full of attitudes ! i asked if they could see me since i was already there , the answer `` i guess '' . the three women there today really need a customer service lesson . the owner should invest in this for his office , i would certainly be embarrassed .	4092
0	this place sucks . they charged my wife and i for services that our insurance covered that they said was n't covered . we called our insurance and were told that not only did they charge us , they also charged our insurance . we called and complained so we got our money back . when we went back in to receive our refund , they were very cold and rude . i can imagine that they double bill their other patients but have not been caught too many times . if you had the misfortune of doing business with these people then i recommend that you carefully look over your charges to make sure you were n't ripped off .	4092
1	we went for breakfast after seeing this place on diners , drive-ins and dives . so amazing , i had the stuffed raspberry french toast . everything tasted so fresh and delicious , worth the wait if you go ! my kids tried the hot cakes , so much better than pancakes !	4093
1	a breakfast favorite . always good . try the banana chocolate chip pancakes ! beware that it is small and you often sit elbow to elbow with folks at the next table . it 's also very busy on the weekends . totally worth it .	4093
1	wow ! ! my wife and i had breakfast at the dor-stop this morning and it was outstanding ! ! we had about a 20 minute wait to get in but it was worth it . the service was fast and the food was great . we will surely return ... ...	4093
1	great place for breakfast . made to order . pancakes are to die for . there is usually a line on the weekends . great nostalgia on the walls .	4093
1	i heard a lot about the for-stop from our recently transplanted son , who is a big fan . the place did n't disappoint . lots to choose from , decent prices - i 'd come back just to try other stuff ... ..	4093
1	what an awesome spot for brunch . though we do n't live too far away the traffic was horrendous and all we could think about was some yummy food to shovel into our mouths . even though the place was packed we were luckily seated right away and presented with menu eery person wants to see on a saturday morning . we all ordered what we wanted and did n't have to wait too long ! best part is , everything is made from scratch and you can def tell . we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at a decent price and we will for sure be back .	4093
1	probably my favorite breakfast spot in the city . yes , pamela 's hot cakes are amazing , but this place has the best all-around breakfast for sure . best thing to do is get there right when they open . do n't be surprised if there is n't already a crowd standing outside . if you do have to wait for a table , be patient , it 's totally worth it . try the hotcakes . my favorite is the pumpkin flavor they have end of summer/fall . they 're so fluffy and delicious .	4093
1	my breakfast was absolutely phenomenal . i specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes . they did not disappoint i tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck . i even promised some things i should be ashamed of lol i would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here !	4093
1	great breakfast . pancakes are super rich , good luck finishing them . the jumpot could use more meat but overall fantastic . highly recommend .	4093
1	all of their food looks so good it was hard to decide . ended up getting the veggie burrito and all i have to say it omg ! ! it was so good . i will definitely be getting that again .	4093
1	went this this morning and i am wondering why the hell it tool me so long to go here . awesome food , fresh and the staff was even better . wo n't eat anywhere else for breakfast in the burg ! got ta get here	4093
1	i 've been coming here for years and you ca n't go wrong with anything from their menu . when i heard they were under new management , i was sad , hoping that the quality of the food would n't change . but good news ! the food is still amazing ! my favorites are the eggs benedict , lori 's stuffed french toast and any of the hot cakes . but like i said , you ca n't go wrong with anything you order . hands down , the best place for weekend brunch .	4093
1	went here after a wedding , the wait was long but worth it . i think we about ordered everything b/c we could n't choose and it was all good from the eggs to the pancakes . i will be back .	4093
1	a busy sunday place at 12 noon . clean and friendly employees . the food was fresh and good . i especially loved the potatoes lyonnaise ! i ask for eggs over medium and got over easy . the bacon was good but a tad too salty for me . the pancakes where very tasty however thick and heavy . i like a thinner lighter pancake . i will return to try the stuffed french toast ! looked and smelled devine ! definitely a great place to eat and socialize ! even the guests were friendly !	4093
1	awesome local breakfast dive ! ! amazing pancakes , jumbot , sandwiches , and egg dishes . breakfast and lunch only joint . everything made from scratch !	4093
1	great food with a local twist . service was amazing . raspberry tea is a must try . kids got grilled cheese-yum ! try fries with gravy . pancakes are too good to be real ! ! this place is worth all the hype . a must try and super kid friendly .	4093
1	i had the italian jombot here it was so good , and the service was awesome ! ! ! i will definitely be back .	4093
1	omg ! hands down the best pancakes i have ever put in my mouth . sometimes i day dream about dor stop pancakes . too bad i live 6 hours away or i 'd go there everyday . the service was just ok , but the place was packed and the food was well worth the wait .	4093
1	now i understand why food network made a pit stop here ! awesome breakfast - i highly recommend their pumpkin chocolate chip pancakes and german potato pancakes . it can be a wait but quite worth it !	4093
0	used to be ... until guy , now it seems they rest on those laurels . well loved hotcakes now always raw and mushy in the middle . potato pancakes ? limp and soggy . this is based on more than one visit . last time service was dreadful . no water refills . order was wrong , twice with no apology . charged for wrong order and for something not ordered at all .	4093
0	been here twice . hate to say it but nothing special . the usual breakfast items but nothing stands out either in preparation or presentation .	4093
0	found the place to be average at best . pancakes were not very good . they tasted like they were made from a mix , mushy in the middle , and they came with powdered sugar which i do n't like ( wish the server told me beforehand ) . average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive . oj was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store . i like the fact the place is not a chain , and i 'd be up for trying other food there , but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype .	4093
0	had high expectations but was disappointed . the hot cakes were very dense , seemed like not fully cooked in the middle . definitely not light and fluffy . the western omelette was ok . they mix everything in and cook it all in with the egg so the cheese was dried out , not melty like i prefer . home fries were very good . maybe we just got the wrong things off the menu .	4093
0	this used to be one of my favorite places for breakfast but the quality has diminished noticeably . eggs over medium were runny and the pumpkin pancakes , that used to be my reason for going , lacked flavor ... they were very bland and were a little raw on the inside . maybe the food is better when they are n't so busy ?	4093
0	this is one of those places that is really overrated - popular because it is appeared on a tv show . i would n't mind the wait if the food was worth it . i live local and have tried this diner 3 times- each time i had the same problem- my food was served to me stone cold.and the service is slooooowwww - too many other options in the south hills to try this place again .	4093
0	while the dor-stop is a cute place on a nice tree lined street , i 'm not sure what the big fuss is all about . the food was only fair and they do n't even have real cream for your coffee . it 's that nasty fake nondairy crap . it also gave me the heebeegeebees due to the `` christianesgue '' motif .	4093
0	we stopped here with on a rainy saturday morning with great anticipation given the reviews and i agree with lawrence w. and krissy d. that i dont really get the hype . the place is small and loud so there was a wait which was fine , but the wait staff was not particularly friendly and very distracted . they were much more interested in turning tables . we had a variety of food and it was all just ok and none of it great . some of the portions were huge to their credit , but very average . even though its more `` corporate '' , pamela 's was a much better diner experience than dor-stop . i doubt i would wait again .	4093
0	my first review was filtered for some reason . if you want a full picture of this place , be sure to read the filtered reviews as well . many of them are not positive , and would lower the 4.5 star rating if fairly counted .	4093
0	folks this is very overrated.. they had guy 's diners drivein and dives there only because guy 's parents knew owner . this is very avg food at best . its nothing special.i wont go back.. very small and uncomfortable . they have a large sign in window to play on guy 's visit a number of years ago . dont fall for it .	4093
0	pancakes , pancakes , pancakes . everybody told me i had to try and their pancakes . well , the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes .	4093
0	i really , really wanted to try dor - stop , but it was n't open when i went ! my wife and i woke up early just to go there , and the diner was closed for the next few days , even though it didnt say that on the website ! such a waste of time . if you 're going to go , make sure you call ahead , just so you do n't get screwed over like we did .	4093
0	if you are looking for something retro ( but new ) this is not it . it has an `` old neighborhood '' feel . the food is ok . the pancakes have a sweet cornbread flavor and are a bit crisp , but the bacon was not . go to the original pancake house about 10 minutes away for a better breakfast .	4093
0	used to love this place , but paid $ 15 for 2 eggs , bacon , coffee & hot tea ... ( no option anymore to do ala carte items ) just seemed crazy to my wife and i . looking for a new breakfast joint in dormont	4093
0	dorstop is my favorite breakfast spot but on this visit i was extremely disappointed . i stopped in on a whim alone and sat at the counter . while i was eating my delicious breakfast a dishwasher stood in front of me and spit in the garbage can on the other side of the counter literally a foot away from me . i immediately wanted to throw up . i did not finish my meal and got up and paid and left . they were too busy too mention something and they never asked how everything was or i would have said something . i am not sure if i will go back which is really a shame . i love that place .	4093
0	2 stars only for the food . the food is what makes me come back ... the service is horrible , it 's what 's keeping me away .	4093
0	featured on triple d or not the inside of my pancakes were raw and that sucks . my husbands egg scramble was good though . i ended up guilting him into letting me eat some of his so i was n't starving .	4093
0	this place has been on diners drive-ins and dives . and they do n't let you forget it . unfortunately , it seems the talent that got them the attention of the show is no longer apparent . it feels like they have rested on the guy fieri laurels for quite a while . the food is lackluster and bland . service is brusque but efficient . i had the burrito . it showed up luke warm with congealed cheese and what i can only assume to be canned salsa on top . we also ordered the texas french toast . which turns out to be wonder bread lightly soaked in egg and grilled with a little sugar . all in all it was just bland .	4093
0	did n't like the crab benedict was fishy and old crabs ! the pancake of done it 's not good too	4093
1	they did great work . staff was friendly and took the time to draw up a custom design . pretty expensive for small/simple tattoos .	4094
1	i got my nose pierced by daria . the place was very clean and neat ! she was so relaxing and knowledgeable . the piercing was quick and not that painful . after she put the jewelry , i ca n't even tell my piercing is there ! definitely will be coming back ! !	4094
0	i did n't get anything done here because they would n't let me . i wanted to get my nose pierced and i 'm only 17 , so they said i had to have a parents bring me with proof they are my parents . i am adopted and was not going to bring all of my paperwork in to get my nose pierced . it was kind of ridiculous , but i guess it 's the law . i went to south side tattoo who had no problems and did n't need to see anything but my moms license .	4094
0	i went in on friday the 13th , priced a piece of flas $ 150 after receiving my tattoo i went out to the parlor and he says that will be $ 150 . i gave him $ 170 , to give my tattoo artist the $ 20 as my tip . i got home that night and checked my instagram , the whole day they 're having a $ 13 off sale . no one told me , i 'm guessing to make a little extra ? the tattoo was originally $ 163 ? ? it did n't sit right with me . the tattoo is really nice , though . so ...	4094
1	i recently drove thru on a roadtrip . the service was friendly , the food was just as i ordered .	4095
1	came to dine in at wendy 's and was greeted immediately and served with 3 min . the food was fresh and my order was accurate . what else can i ask from a fast food restaurant ?	4095
1	stopped by the drive-thru tonight about 9:30 and ordered 2 spicy chicken sandwiches . they were surprisingly busy at that hour so it took about 10 minutes to get my order . the drive-thru cashier apologized to me for the wait and was very polite . anyway , my chicken sandwiches were absolutely delicious . well worth the wait . : )	4095
1	it 's fast food , it tastes great , it 's got courteous people working there and you wo n't get mcslimed , not ever ! note this was at 12:00pm . the lunch hour .	4095
1	i have always had good experiences here- the burgers , chicken sandwich , fries , and chili are good . the quality seems better than mcdonalds .	4095
0	i love wendy 's but will next time go to one of the other locations within the city when i get a craving for a frosty . the staff is a little harsh , my order was not right and the fries were cold . text book failure . i might have gotten them at the wrong time so will try again and hopefully they will redeem themselves .	4095
0	spicy chicken caesar salad from the drive through . one dressing packet , which is n't really enough for a full size salad , should be one for a half size and two for full . more importantly , no croutons ! thanks for nothing except taking my money . is this job really that hard ?	4095
0	i once walked into this wendy 's and walked out immediately bc it smelled like sewage . i gave them a second chance and this time they forgot my fries and i did n't realize it until i got home . plus my nuggets were cold af . i paid for that . thanks wendy 's of fitchburg .	4095
0	really zero stars ! ! ! i do n't know why but they ca n't get my order right . the order taker gets it right because when i check my receipt , it is correct . the food in the bag is always wrong . my kids like wendy 's but we will not try it again . i called once because they did n't include one of the meals . went back to get it and they still messed it up . it 's fast food , how hard is it to get right ?	4095
0	ate lunch there yesterday and it was pretty gross . my partner tried the new asian boneless chicken wings and when she opened the container to eat them there were two fries in the container , gross . why serve a baked potato with vegetable oil spread instead of real butter ?	4095
1	my wife and i came to this location for the first time today , and i was very impressed . we all know smashburger has some good & juicy burgers , but their inside was very clean . when i got there , the understaffed manager was manning the register and delivering orders to various tables while still being very courteous & friendly . fifteen minutes later a server showed up . the food was amazing , with unlimited refills on our sodas . i really like this place , and would recommend it to others .	4096
1	honestly i do n't expect much from fast food burger joints but this was great . my friend had the classic smash dressed up according to rob the manager 's recommendation . he devoured it within minutes - i had the buffalo blue cheese with smash tots and it was awesome . for sure will be back to check out the rest of the menu . make sure you ask for rob and ask him for what he recommends .	4096
1	food is great ... .. service is great ! always a pleasure . join the smashclub too , its a great customer loyalty perk . i 've saved lots of money when i would be coming anyway .	4096
1	we had a wonderful dinner at smashburger this evening ! the dinner was delicious and andrea is an amazing employee . our son 's shake spilled , and she quickly cleaned up the mess and brought him another one ! great atmosphere and great food .	4096
0	the classic burger looks better than it tastes . the sweet potato fries were tasteless and a bit limp . cute way of serving the entree though . the chocolate malt was amazing even though it took forever to get it . but it was worth the wait . i was not impressed with the cashier that took my order , not friendly and did n't speak clearly enough to understand . many tables needed to be cleaned off.floor needed cleaning up as well . not a place i would return to unless i was desperate for a chocolate malt and it would have to be to go .	4096
0	heard about smashburger and thought i 'd give it a try . i would take an in & out or five guys any day of the week over smashburger . very greasy . the smash frys were really good . i doubt i 'll eat there again . i know there are a lot of people that like smashburger and that 's great . it 's just not for me .	4096
0	this was our first time at a smashburger so we are not certain if all locations operate the same way , but this was not a good experience . first , the cashier/order taker was very helpful navigating the menu and was efficient . next , when the food finally appeared , it was good . the problem is staffing and cleanliness . no one removed order numbers , cleaned the tables or bothered to empty the clearly overflowing garbage can or removes used glasses and dishes . we were there about 45 - 60 minutes and never saw anyone take action . lastly , it appears smashburger is under-staffing and we wo n't likely return as organization and cleanliness are key to us .	4096
0	do n't come here during lunch . one person working the register , long line . poor guy was trying the take orders and deliver orders to people waiting to eat . burgers were backed up under the heat lamps . a girl finally showed up and delivered the burgers and then disappeared and the guy was trying to do both jobs again . my burger sat under the heat lamp for over 5 minutes .	4096
1	had my garage door 's , opener done by them highly recommend , makes my house look like million , brian g.is the man , quite and showed me all the different ways to use the garage app	4097
1	not happy that my garage door broke but wildly impressed with the service from wayne dalton . they would have come out late sunday evening but i told them that the next morning would be fine . ernie arrived exactly when promised and took care of the door . so impressed that a service company makes and keeps commitments and that their employees are well trained professionals both in the call center and in the field . kudos and thanks to the team ! !	4097
1	my garage springs broke a couple weeks ago so i called to get a quote . they were out here on time and called before arriving . i paid exactly what i was quoted and they did an excellent job . i was a little hesitant based on past experience . wo n't hesitate to call them again .	4097
0	to bad there is not a less than one star . the customer service is not there . this is stupid . you come out to a house that my company manages . you fix the garage door and then it stops working again . then you come out less than 30 days later and replace the garage remotes . problem is still there . now when i ask you to credit the work that you did and to fix the problem you say no . sorry that does not cut it in my book or in the customer service manual . once you fix the problem correctly i will make this is a 5 star .	4097
0	i bought a wayne dalton door in 2012 . the door was a 9100 series 16x 7 . the cracked in the middle and the company would not stand by their product . lousy company and poor product .	4097
0	excuses and lies , get anything but door springs installed from these guys . i ca n't stand a bs liar ; finally buying my springs from on line , and doing it myself . if you do n't mind excuses an lies along with bs these are your guys .	4097
1	car buying process made easy ... thanks jr cavaness and aram in financing ... dealerships could learn a lot from these two about customer service ... great work	4098
1	i was in a hit and run recently . i took my car to friendly ford bodyshop since it 's close to my home and work . they gave me an estimate and fixed my car in a timely manner . everyone at the shop is great , gus and tonny took care of me and the girls in the office were very nice . highly recommend this shop . great service ! !	4098
1	i have been to many body shops here in the valley , but never had work done or customer service as good as i did in this place . gustavo , tony and the whole team did an amazing job on my truck . i really recommend this place if you want to be satisfied with body work .	4098
1	great body work on my jeep grand cherokee ! i was n't inconvenienced at all and they did it all in the perfect time span . mike and d.c. did an amazing job with the whole experience . thank you , and highly recommend , even if you do n't have a ford .	4098
0	i brought my mustang gt in for servicing . their mechanic took it for a test drive and got into an accident , damaging 3 panels on the passenger side . they refused to repair the damage and forced me to file a claim on my insurance and get the damage repaired on my own . awful place and awful customer service !	4098
0	worst dealership i have ever delt with if you do n't want to be ripped off go anywhere else	4098
0	took my 2014 ford focus in for its yearly clutch maintenance ( these cars are lemons ) under warranty . they realize the battery is cracked but wo n't let me bring in one to replace it , i have to buy their overpriced one and have them install it . $ 170 later i look at the work done and it is pathetic . did n't even clean the corrosion off of the terminal . last ford i buy .	4098
0	do n't use friendly ford shop without getting a second opinion . had to take my car to another collision center to find out that a simple job was done wrong . door was leaking , gas cap was put on wrong . doors were not aligned properly . never answered phone calls for status of car . manager took the car back into the shop when he was told that the job was n't right and did nothing . second collision center fixed all problems and additional problems found .	4098
1	outstanding food and service . it is so great to have such a friendly place right around the corner . they really bend over backwards to give you what you want . i love their flatbread pizzas . the blt flatbread is to die for . just a great friendly place with great food where everybody knows your name . how can you beat that . try it you will love it .	4099
1	jessica and shania always treat me like royalty . they have reasonably priced beers , exceptional food , and live entertainment . not to mention they have an open mic night every wednesday which is fun for amateurs like me . keep up the good work everybody	4099
1	great little place to hang , get a bite and listen to music . the food is really good for a bar ... better than `` bar food . '' you can tell they take pride in what they do . the staff is super friendly and quick . great drinks , great food , great music , great service . what more could you want ?	4099
1	i made the trip about 30 min . away because rich spina was hosting open mic . was i glad . i loved my cider and grilled romaine salad . regulars told me to try the wings next time , too . the music was wonderful and quite a variety of players and genres being open mic night . the layout is n't overcrowded . there is regular table seating , bar seating and high top table seating . there are tvs to watch if you want to . convenient restrooms . easy parking . i 'm glad i found this place in beautiful berea , oh just down the street from baldwin wallace college .	4099
0	would 've been great except for the fact that the staff was rude . the atmosphere was cool . love the lighting against the wall color . bar is well stocked and cocktails are pretty good . but the staff , manager mainly , was beyond rude while the band was playing . making a scene about how bad they were even though everyone there loved them !	4099
0	this place is absolutely awful i would not suggest anybody to go to this place it is the most disgusting service owner is not nice and when you order food you wait for a very very very long time the drinks are awful it does n't matter what you order its water down and nasty absolutely disgusting do not go to this place ever	4099
0	staff often as attentive as possible . place often too loud . as a paying customer was asked to leave after only one drink because someone i knew quit working there that night . obviously not interested in a quiet patron . no reason to return .	4099
0	food was overcooked and the waitress did n't really seem to care . kinda of got the vibe it 's for drunk college kids , i 'd pass there are alot of better places in berea it 's a flaming bag of garbage , take your hard earned money somewhere else	4099
1	great food and super affordable drinks . highly recommend this restaurant if you are on your way to cleveland . service was great also . they all work together which you do not see often .	4100
1	i should have more check-ins here ! i 've only eaten there once and the chicken sandwich and fries was good . the servers are always friendly , and i like the live music they have , too . there is a back room that looks like a sun room and a bar outside as well that is open in good weather .	4100
1	first time here . was hesitant based on the ratings . not sure why they rate this place low . service was excellent . i had the wings . they were meaty and not breaded and great tasting . my wife had a chicken wrap and chips and she really enjoyed it . we are glad we came and we will definitely be back . thanks to the staff for great service despite being crazy busy .	4100
1	one of the few places on the west side that you can get fried clams ! love then and the fresh cuts with a cold draft ! great pizza too !	4100
1	service ! service ! service ! excellent job on the staffs part ... went for lunch on a busy sunday . the staff rocked it . they all worked together and nothing was overlooked ! food is a great deal . and it was all delicious ! they also have a great patio !	4100
1	wonderful place , great and friendly bartenders , very diverse crowd , good food , and wonderful outdoor patio ! i 've never had a bad night there , good vibes all around ! drink are made very well and not watered down , as well as cheap . daily specials are always good option !	4100
1	love mulligans ! the french onion soup is so good ! i usually stop every few weeks with the kids for lunch . they ask for `` the usual '' and the servers know they want two cheeseburgers . the staff is always so sweet and takes good care of us . they made me a titos moscow mule . ( on a no kid day ) and it was soooo good ! it was nice to have a mule that tastes good ! the outdoor patio is wonderful ! the fire pit is beautiful ! the bathrooms are always clean ! it 's nice to have such a cute place right down the road .	4100
1	service aws great and they have an excellent grilled chicken caesar salad : - ) they put cherry tomatoes in the salad and dressing is very good / not too thick .	4100
1	great food , very reasonable . we got a basket of fries , 4 beers , philly cheese steak , a double decker blt , both with chips and french onion dip and it was only $ 40 , that included a 20 % tip . the service was great and the wait staff is very attentive .	4100
1	a buddy and i went after a round of golf . wings were excellent . you know how most people ask for well done and it 's a crapshoot ? where they 're papa bear wings that are still not cooked enough or mama bear wings that are dried out ? well these are baby bear wings ... ... .just right ! service was excellent and food was very good .	4100
1	great place . a group of high school buddies chose this place for a sort-of mini-reunion . nice to see a quality , upscale , but casual place in the hometown area . food and service are excellent ; live entertainment and a patio are nice extras . i recommend this place highly for drinks , casual dinner or get-togethers !	4100
1	i stop here for lunch every now and then , nice turkey sandwich and soup ! ( french onion yum ! )	4100
1	i love this pub . the drinks are great and afforable . the servers are very nice and the service is exceptional . the menu food is tasty as well . the always have events and specials . great place to hang out with friends .	4100
0	came in on a sunday night . lots of folks in for the football games , but cleared out rather quickly . was very disappointed in several aspects of the food ( baked potato was ice cold ) , the chicken teriyaki was very bland . not sure whose teriyaki they use , but it needs to be changed . as for the staff , once they sat me ( stood by the door for almost 5 minutes before i was seated ) my server was very nice and came by often .	4100
0	this place consistently rips off people looking for good food for a fair price . do n't get me wrong.. food is good , but the portions are way off standards !	4100
0	we walked in to many open tables and were still told to wait to be seated . the music . fail . first nickelback , and now let it go from frozen is playing . have n't even eaten , this is a fail .	4100
0	today was not a good day for mulligans the wait staff was the worst i 've had here . very slow for happy hour and the service is still quite poor here .	4100
0	two stars only because the design is awesome , looks like a nice joint ... until ... you get onto the patio . filled with smokers smoking cigarettes . nasty . oh well i 'll never be back .	4100
0	absolutely the worst food i 've ever had since i moved to neo in 1980 it was wing night and i ordered the garlic buffalo sauce . the wings were small and over cooked . my companion had the fish and chips and made the statement that arby 's fish sandwich was better . i was extremely disappointed .	4100
0	poor set up for bands . not really a stage and difficult sitting in booths with your back to the band	4100
0	we had stopped here on our way home from cleveland , and definitely wish we would have picked somewhere else to eat . my husband and i both had the double cheeseburgers and they were dry also the buns were stale . also after the server took our drink order along with the food order she never returned until it was time to bring the check . definitely not worth spending the money .	4100
0	this is place seems to cater to the regulars ... .if they dont know you good luck getting good service.. to bad the food is good ... . but i think they 'd rather be a bar and not a restaurant .	4100
0	avoid . bartenders and servers were doing shots in the kitchen . granted is was new year 's eve but only 3pm . slow service because of this . manager was the one carrying trays of shots back to the kitchen and then calling all the bartenders and servers to the kitchen . food was cold and not as described on the menu .	4100
0	i used to go here once a month or so for drinks and a quick dinner . one day i noticed they had a lobster zone `` game '' . i 'm not sure who thinks it 's ok to have lobsters suffering in filthy water while a bunch of hillbillies try to snag them with a metal claw so they can eat them for dinner . it 's like something you 'd see at a carnival . i get it ... this `` game '' totally caters to their clientele . i personally find it completely unacceptable . what kind of owner would allow this in their building ? i wo n't go back .	4100
0	it 's just o.k . summary : talky bartenders ( they talk more to themselves than attend to anticipating your empty beer glass . food got better and now average . this place has never been about great selection of current craft beers . the usual guinness , dormunder gold , etc . you know the drill . go anywhere else and have more fun . the patio is real nice if you like nothing but cigarette smoke while you enjoy the fresh outdoors . a real waste in my opinion because the design was well executed .	4100
0	ok place to eat , good place to drink . the service is average at best and there is nothing that really stands out on the menu . open patio in nice weather is a plus , but not enough to save this place . luckily there is nothing else around them on 611 so no one steals their business .	4100
1	they carry a broad selection of pet food and supplements , and their prices are very competitive . also livestock supplies and toys !	4101
1	*only* place in phoenix metro where i can purchase standlee timothy/alfalfa pellets which have no fillers or alfalfa !	4101
1	nothing to say other than this is one of 2 places that i can find pro pac products for my dogs . also , this is the place where i go for shots for my dogs . on saturdays , they have a veterinarian there who gives the required shots and then does a brief physical exam on your dog . staff is accommodating and store is nice .	4101
1	i 'm here on a weekly basis picking up crickets , worms , cat food etc . employees are knowledgeable , friendly and helpful . we 've been to the discount shot clinic which does save money nut takes a long time in the waiting line .	4101
1	stopped in tonight , a sunday , right at closing to get some crickets for our new family gecko . surprisingly , they invited us in for a $ 1 sale after closing time . it 's service like that that will bring us back and keep us from the big chains !	4101
0	i 've been buying dog for here , the best and most expensive they carry , for 5 years . i arrived 2 minutes prior to closing time today and they refused to serve me . i 'll be going elsewhere from now on .	4101
0	i went in looking for pet supplies and ended up leaving absolutely disgusted ! the bunnies had no water or food , the betta fish on the counter were in such murky water you literally could not see them . i am going high up as i can on this one . absolutely inhumane ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4101
0	this place is good depending on what you 're looking for . i 'm going to write this from a reptile enthusiasts ' view . simply put , this place is the worst . animals all housed improperly , i 've seen some snakes that were rescued from here , it smells , and it has been this way since the 90 's . if you 're looking for reptiles , avoid this place !	4101
0	this place smells weird . they have some weird brands of cat food . i guess some is organic or something . one is dick van patten 's brand . lol . i guess 8 was n't enough for him .	4101
0	this business is located near my home . we stop in maybe once a month just to check on the poor animals they sell there . each time we have been there , the pet cages have been absolutely filthy and sometimes the animals do not have water in their water containers . if they do have water , it is also filthy . the owners and staff do not appear to care when we bring this to their attention . i would not recommend this place to anyone .	4101
1	just stopped here for a quick lunch . the entrance was a little confusing , but we quickly realized that we were walking through the brewery which was super cool . our waitress was super friendly . i got the chipotle bbq chicken sandwich and the bbq pork sandwich . both were delicious and good sized portions for the price and those fries ! the menu said they were homemade beer battered fries and they were amazing ! i also got one of their house brewed beers on tap which was also good and the pricing is more than reasonable on a pint ! i was extremely pleased with our entire experience and we will be going back often !	4102
1	their reuben is one of the best i 've had in a long time . the potato pancake really sets it off . friendly staff and great location . one of our new staples	4102
1	i liked this place a lot and would like to go back but since i live nowhere near here , doubtful i will ever make it . they had maybe 6-7 beers on tap . i had a stout , ipa and a simple lager infused with a blueberry concentrate that were all very smooth and drinkable . the food was very good also . loved the beer cheese soup and the macaroni with cheese , andouille sausage and tomatoes was very good . there lots of brew houses here and there and some are good , some not . this is one of the good ones .	4102
1	awesome place for date night ! especially if you 're going to a movie because amc is right across the street . great beers , good prices , great service .	4102
1	we have been coming here for years ! the food is great and the fries are incredible ! i 'm not a beer drinker and neither is my husband ... we just love the food ! ! they have gluten free options which is wonderful for our dear friends and with my dairy allergies i know they have always been great about mixing things up for me ! !	4102
1	definitely a good place to take a group , food is a great value and service has been very prompt when i have been there . for sure it 's a must try while in rocky river . if you like american food and want a quieter than most atmosphere for watching a game you should go here over say a local bar . it is also very kid friendly and the fact that it 's a brewing company does n't mean you are obligated to get a beer , definitely a place for all ages .	4102
1	1/29/16 the one negative comment i have is that even though we called ahead and were told we 'd have to wait 15 minutes , we still ended up waiting 30 minutes . though it seemed like everybody and their mother we 're out to dinner that night ( it was our third restaurant we tried that was n't an hour wait ) . despite the busy atmosphere our server was very nice and always had a smile on her face . the menu had so many yummy options it was difficult to chose ! went with johnny 's three mac and cheese . large portion to take some home . in house brewed beer was very good as well . would definitely go back .	4102
1	as a vegan i love having food options ! ! my spouse is n't a vegan and got the strip steak and said it was really fatty and lots of grit . my planet power tacos where great except the corn tortillas . the tortillas fell apart so i ate them with a fork . beers were good we sat outside because inside had a wait . sat next to heated which was nice . the waitress put the clemson game on the tv ( until the ohio state game came on honestly no complaint there ; i get we live in ohio ) . we will be back	4102
1	interestingly enough , the beer 's not the draw for us ; the food is . they have great sandwich-and-burger style meals with a twist , and i 'd highly recommend their asian nachos , which come with chicken , cheese , and a lightly-spiced wasabi . they have great pretzels . their salads are surprisingly good . the beer ? decent . like most local brewpubs they adore hops to the point of bitter beer face , but it 's cleveland beer . about what you 'd expect . but the brew company as a whole is rarely disappointing .	4102
1	wife and i came here for lunch , got lucky and got seated right away as there is usually a wait . the burgers are delicious and the service was solid . nothing to complain about will be back in the future .	4102
1	warm and laid back . love the meatloaf and the $ 12.50 steak and pint deal on monday is superb ! beers are solid and the christmas selections were the best i 've had there . patio is full of regulars , which says something about the place , family and date friendly , check it out . price point is fair .	4102
1	i 'm surprised this place gets so many bad reviews . the hefeweizen is really good - i 'm a huge hefeweizen fan . the food is pretty good , nothing incredible , but it 's a brewery so their main focus is more on their beers !	4102
1	flew into cleveland and immediately looked at yelp for a brew pub ( love trying local beers ) . this place was about 3 miles from the airport so my trusty gps & i headed here . porter was good , but amber is amazing ... brewed with peanut butter ! i ordered the pretzel crusted baked chicken ... pretty damn delicious . it usually comes with mashed potatoes ( which i should have opted for ) but i went with rice . rice i did n't care for at all , but i loved the chicken . the service was amazing and the atmosphere was very welcoming and relaxed . they treated an out-of-towner like family .	4102
1	danny would say this place `` has more charm then what it appears '' . service was friendly but slow . beer selection : top notch . food : applebees . i 'd appreciate it a bit more if the servers could describe their house brews a little better . i 'd go back and sit at the bar .	4102
1	nice classic looking bar/restaurant with comfortable seating . service was friendly and fast , although i did visit around 1pm . christmas ale was tasty , and i recommend the asian nachos , but you may want to pass on the potato pancake reuben , as it 's impossible to actually pick up . with so many bars like this in western cleveland , you really red to stand out , and this did n't break the mold .	4102
1	great family spot or place to watch a game . service is always efficient and friendly . food is outstanding everything seems to be made from scratch . in house smoked chicken or pulled pork street tacos are a must try . my other favorites are california chicken sandwich , blackened tuna cobb salad and chicken ranch pizza . house brewed beers are very good . the blueberry beer is excellent and a good rotation of ipa 's .	4102
1	the bar/patio outside is great for sunny summer days/warm summer nights and the beer sampler is a great way to try their brews as long as you have someone to share them with as it 's a lot to drink ! i tried the beer cheese soup and was not impressed , i would not recommend ordering this , but i would highly recommend the asian nachos . once again i will have to say that the burgers are delicious and definitely something everyone should try !	4102
1	very impressed for lunch . unique menu including your standard bar menu with a twist . highly recommend the thai chicken salad ( add cucumbers ) . perfect balance of spicy and sweet . christmas ale with a cinnamon sugar rim was the cherry on top ! quick and friendly service . i know this place usually has a long wait for dinner , so suggest trying to sneak in at off peak hours to enjoy the deliciousness .	4102
0	probably not awful but other places in the area have set my bar for bars to high . similarly priced to the melt or fatheads , but not as much choice and not as high of quality . not much of a beer person , but they had a blueberry something that i was hoping was as good at fathead 's bumbleberry . it was not . i had a bbq chicken sandwich . nothing special . i think , despite description to the contrary , that it was just some off the shelf sauce . got chorizo empanadas for an appetizer . not super appetizing .	4102
0	i am not really sure why this place gets such high reviews for the food . ordered the burger and was shocked to find it is a frozen patty . beer was good but i wont be back for the food .	4102
0	the last two times i have been there the service was awful , the appetizers were served still frozen and one person did n't get their meal till 30 minutes after the table had been served ... not worth it	4102
0	our server was so out of it . if she was n't so young i would 've swore she was having a stroke every time we tried to give her our order . we had the the artichoke and portobello dip and it came out looking like a pile of crappy oat meal . we gave up and paid for out drinks and eat elsewhere	4102
0	mine and my husband food could have been prepared better by my culinary challenged mother . my potatoes were dry and luke warm while my husbands jumbayla as unevenly heated , some parts hot enough to burn his mouth . the server was more interested in the game on the tv then what food was actually on the menu . to make the place even more entertaining the screech of children was heard through out our meal . there is pub food that is great and worth the aggregation of unchecked children and multiple games blaring , it 's just not here .	4102
0	1st . time back after boycotting the place a few years ago . well things do n't seem to change . ordered extra crisp garlic wings with parmesan , it 's on the menu with ranch and celery . i got greasy , no parmesan , overall not very well seasoned and worse off all undercooked and bloody wings . they were kind enough to comp me my beer ! never again !	4102
0	recently went here for hubby 's birthday . noted to the staff it was his birthday , they placed us behind a huge wall where our server could n't see us all night . had to ask multiple people for refills , plates for apps and all the normal stuff staff bring over after you order your meal . the buffalo chicken wrap tasted horrible along with the beer cheese soup . would n't recommend or come back to .	4102
0	what a mess . they do not take reservations and the hostess ' are totally clueless , not to mention rude ! if you have a party of 2 or more on the weekends , do not come here , because you will wait 2 hours , even if you did call ahead , multiple times ! horrible first impression , rr brew co ! hire some hostesses who know how to handle a crowd -- and start taking reservations !	4102
0	do n't you dare try to sit at a table and not order food ( at least before 10 ) . does n't matter if it 's 930 pm , there are open tables and you just ordered a $ 17 round of drinks ( and plan on ordering more . ) they will make you give up your seat . service is always hit or miss . only reason to go here are the asian nachos and the deep dish chocolate cookie desert . both are fantastic , but you have to deal with their crap to enjoy them .	4102
0	went in at 10pm last night and they had a decent crowd . ordered some beers and food since it took over 10 minutes for a server to greet us . food came before our beer and after a 15 minute wait . beers were sitting on bar while waitress was chatting . we went to the bar and asked if we could help deliver our own beers . waitress took offense and was unpleasant the rest of the time . so many other good choices in area so although food and beer is great ... service stinks .	4102
0	tonight was my 3 rd time at this restaurant : good service , energetic ambiance , decent beer but food has consistently been mediocre at best .	4102
0	great food and ok beer selection , but unfortunately it stops there . take my advice and avoid this place like the plague on friday and saturday nights . the teenage wait staff and hostesses could n't be any more clueless . couple that with an overwhelming crowd and you 've got yourself nothing short of a disaster . oh , and do n't bother calling ahead for immediate seating . i did just that and still found myself and family standing around the bar like a chump , waiting 60 minutes for a table .	4102
0	well if you like waiting for 15 minutes with 0 acknowledgement from staff- this place is for you	4102
0	went there with a group to watch basketball and have a few drinks . no seats at the bar and plenty of empty tables in bar so we took one . very young and immature hostess told us we would have to leave the table if we were not going to eat there , we said no seats at bar and all these empty tables it was about 9:00 dinner hour over , she said there policy was you had to eat at the table if you wanted to sit there.we left and will not be back ! moral of story if you just want to stop in for a drink with a group of friends do n't go there ! !	4102
0	good service but when i ordered the parmesan chicken the last thing i expected was onions . what fucking moron puts green onions on parmesan chicken ! this the last time i come here !	4102
0	what happened to this place ? ! beer has not been good for a few years and food is still hit or miss . the service is horribly slow . there are a lot better breweries in close proximity . the clientele of rrbc has changed muched either , still typical , uppity rock river yuppies..	4102
0	have n't been here in a while and was met by one of the rudest hostesses i 've ever encountered . miss maddie needs to be fired ! the bartender rory was very nice and accommodating . that was n't enough to make me come back . there are too many good places to go with better beer and service .	4102
0	we 've been going to rrbc and i 'm disappointed to see it 's been going downhill the last few years in regards to service . the food and beer are great but the last few times the service was so bad i 'm not really interested in going back . they screwed up our orders so badly and it took so long to get the food it 's just not worth it ... something like we ordered a burger and they brought a reuben ... stuff like that . a one time occurence i 'd let it go but it seems to keep happening . the management needs to address it . asian nachos and fish tacos are awesome !	4102
1	i was captivated to come inside given the neon flashing bunny sign . the place is quite small but cozy nonetheless . we ordered the eggs florentine ( spinich eggs benny ) and eggs hemingway ( smoked salmon eggs benny ) which came with salad on the side . the food did take quite a bit of time to come but our waiter was a pleasure . he was witty and made the dining experience enjoyable . the portion of the meal was decent with the poached eggs done nicely and the salad dressing was good .	4103
1	great place to eat for brunch i had the hash today and strongly encourage anyone to try it . great ingredients and good food . staff was excellent .	4103
1	caesar salad was amazing . gnocchi short rib was hardy but not heavy . and the creme de la creme was the pork chop . best pork chop i 've ever had . and then topped off with best bread pudding ever had . we 'll be back !	4103
0	dinner review : not good ya 'll . salads wayyyyy overdressed . mussels came out very smelly ; not cleaned well . some tasted questionable . gnocchi was hard and chewy instead of light and fluffy . burger was very salty , almost inedible with side salad too overdressed to use to balance it out . such a shame for such a quirky place . definitely a regrettable meal .	4103
0	came here for brunch and ordered the brisket and potatoes . it was all potatoes , 1 egg , and 3 bites of brisket . most expensive plate of potatoes i 've ever ordered . waiter confirmed the brisket size was not a mistake . our waiter was very friendly but forgot to put in our order and forgot what we ordered . overall terrible value . they 're just banking on the overflow traffic from lady marmalade . avoid .	4103
0	a few weeks ago a friend & i went to bunny 's since it is located close by . what a disappointment . i ordered eggs benedict which was just 2 poached eggs with hollandaise each on a three inch slice of toast with nothing else . for the $ 15 price tag i was expecting at least a side salad , some potatoes or some fruit . for 2 meagre brunch entrees , a shared french press of coffee with tax & tip it was $ 50.00 . this is not what leslieville needs .	4103
1	i love cheesecake and have probably eaten here 50+ times . people are intimidated by their huge menu , but you can really just close your eyes , flip through the pages , and pick a dish . everything is good here . my go to dishes are : factory nachos , avocado eggrolls , stuffed chicken tortillas ( corn cakes are amazing ! ) , louisiana chicken pasta , and thai chicken lettuce wraps . i do n't think i 've ever finished my entree because the portions are enormous . the cheesecakes are obviously amazing . favorites include : godiva cheesecake , pineapple upside cheesecake , apple strudel , and smores . again , you ca n't go wrong !	4104
1	my friend and i ate her today and the patio was amazing ! ! besides that our server ian was excellent and worked his butt off ! would for sure go back and love to have him again . and of course the meal and cheesecake was the best part of the visit . 10/10 would recommend	4104
1	thank you jon s. you recommended the perfect drink and helped me find a delicious menu item for my first visit . i appreciate the extensive knowledge about the menu that you were able to share . i did n't like my first choice and you encouraged me to try again . you are absolutely an asset to the company . thank you again .	4104
1	always a fantastic happy hour ! i do wish they 'd expand their happy hour white wines , and the food options ; but for $ 6 ( normally $ 10 ) , you ca n't beat the price for a glass of wine !	4104
1	brenda took great care of us . the menu is daunting but get yourself a glass of wine and a grilled artichoke and peruse until you hit your target . even after several years of high traffic , the place is still clean and well maintained .	4104
1	i always love eating here . it is a little overpriced but i 've never gotten any food i did n't like or bad service . i 'm partial to the chicken alfredo . cheesecake factory makes it the best . i usually bring my parents here when they come to visit from the state college area , where there is no cheesecake factory .	4104
1	love coming here and spending a small fortune on wonderful food ! ! ! i get the shrimp scampi everytime ! ! ! and my husband gets the steak diane we never have any problems . the service is excellent . sometimes there is a wait..but the food is worth the wait .	4104
1	good food , good service , beautiful atmosphere and consistency is key ... the cheesecake factory has not failed to deliver in any capacity . i have a few favorites at the cheesecake factory their chicken with light lemon sauce is one for sure , it is large enough for 3 meals and the flavor second to none . the buffalo bombs are the bomb and portion is enormous . tip : when parking in the garage , take your ticket with you , they validate 2 hours free parking .	4104
1	the wait is always ridiculous ( have more seating in the lobby for those who are older ) , but every time my family receives incredible service . i brought my mother in for her birthday , & our server was nothing short of professional and kind . exactly how a waitress should take care of a table . i 'm impressed , & i wish i could remember her name to request her every time we come .	4104
1	big fan of the cheesecake factory love their sheppard 's pie and tex mex egg rolls , but honestly , i 've never had anything but great food there . will definitely be there again !	4104
1	this is our first time going to this place . it was a good experience . the service and food were excellent . the dessert was expensive but it was very good . we may have pick a better day ( monday ) with less crowd and food was cooked quickly enough for our kids that most days lose their patient .	4104
1	great food . great service with a smile and good attitude ! i have visited this location several times and have never been disappointed !	4104
1	i can only comment on the cheesecake . we have had dinner there once or twice , but i found nothing negative or glowing to say about the dinners . it 's always to crowded to make this place on our restaurant rotation list . i love the cheesecake . either eat in or take out , it is such a treat ! we mostly like to take the dessert out , less crowded and have it in the peace and quite of a hotel room near by or at home . i love the raspberry/chocolate every time ! true fan and will continue to eat cheesecake and recommend to family and friends .	4104
1	it was busy , but we were seated quickly . great food and great service . our server , sage , was great , funny and provided awesome service ! we absolutely adored her ! will be back again ! !	4104
1	to preface ; i generally hate chain restaurants . this however , is my favorite chain in the world . huge variety , consistent quality , and a great bar . oh yah , the light fixtures and marble/wood accents give the place a warm feeling . i 've eaten at all the high end places in and around pittsburgh : this place is a guilty pleasure . fyi : if you 're a food glutton : come on in ! the only negative with this place : cleanliness is less then perfect .	4104
1	i only come here for happy hour from 4-6 . the happy hour deals are amazing the burger is $ 5.50 and can not be beat . the entire happy hour menu is great and you get a lot of food . drink specials are reasonable .	4104
1	i can never give cheesecake factory a 5-star until they change their facility design ( the hellish din when they are busy is what keeps me away most of the time . ) but i spotted an opportunity to dine al-fresco here at their south side location and took full advantage . what we found so great was that cf has implemented a `` skinnylicious menu '' , and it surely is skinnylicious . we loved our meals , they were tasty and low in calories ( because low in carbs , imo ) hats off to you guys , i 'll be visiting again whenever you 're not busy or i can dine outside of your horrible echo-chamber dining rooms !	4104
1	the cheesecake factory is one of the better chains in the area . the pricing is expensive but the food is worth it . very tasty food and big enough portions that you will be able to get another meal out of the leftovers .	4104
1	okay who does n't love the cheesecake factory ? you ca n't go wrong here ! great atmosphere , great options for everyone and great portions ! if you have a tough group to accommodate you can be sure to please everyone here .	4104
1	as common as the cheesecake factory is.. i mean every outdoor mall or shopping `` town center '' ... but anyway , i try to avoid mega-chains like this , but honestly , it 's super good . get past the fake italian rustic wallpaper and you 've got page after page of menu items to choose from . their salads are unique and packed with stuff - my mom , sister and i went out to lunch together and each got a different salad , all three satisfying . cheesecake aside , they actually do a good job with their restaurant food .	4104
1	my boyfriend and i went out for dinner there yesterday night while enjoying a nice night out together , and after our terrible experience with the place we had chosen for lunch , the cheesecake factory was a relief . our service was exceptional , laura waited on us and she could n't have done a better job . she was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and let us take our time and choose what we wanted . everything was absolutely delicious from the georgia peach i ordered from the bar menu to the s'mores cheesecake i had for dessert . keep it up ccf always a good choice and we will definitely be back ! yummy - orange chicken leftovers ! !	4104
1	i have been there multiple times to have their cheesecake but today , i went there for lunch . oh boy.. the food was delicious and the service was awesome . 03/17/2018 : the nth visit ... food and service were great as always . no wonder i keep coming here every time i 'm in town	4104
1	absolutely love the cheesecake factory . our server this evening was amazing and recommend a delish dish . she made us feel like we were her only customer	4104
1	always a favorite ! come early for happy hour at the bar . discounted appetizers , small plates , and drinks . we love the buffalo blasts ! my favorite cheesecake is adam 's peanut butter fudge ripple . i 've tried other flavors but that one stands out . all the main entrees are large portion and can easily take half for leftovers . staff is always friendly and overaccommodating . never had a bad experience at any cheesecake factory location .	4104
0	i love cheesecake factory out in california ( my home state ) when i moved to pitts i was super excited that there was a restaurant here . first time here as i 'm waiting for my food it 's been about 45 min not exaggerating they brought us the wrong plates apparently there was `` computer issue '' which we were not aware of so we have just been sitting here with no bread no food just starving in not one to complain but first and last time here i 'll just wait until i go visit home to eat at cheesecake . notice my picture is empty ! still waiting on something to eat	4104
0	a half hour wait for a sandwich to be served . no warning . no attention . the excuse : this chain 's kitchen is unable to serve individual customers and a large party simultaneously . so why are they in the restaurant business ?	4104
0	here now for our mothers 83rd birthday party . put our name in for 18 and they 're now telling us they wo n't hold our table past noon because not everyone in our party is here yet . guess they do n't want our hundreds of dollars in business .	4104
0	totally dissapointed . after hearing everyone e ant on and on about the cheesecake factory , i decided to try it out with my girlfriend . she got the fish tacos and i got the hamburger and fries . both dishes were very dry and tasteless . but that is what you can expect with pre made food kept in the freezer . then we decided to try the cheesecake . after all , its in the name . the cake was totally frozen and the truffle was like a rock . they hould atleast take the time to make decent cheesecake . i wouldnt mind the wait . overall , i will not be returning .	4104
0	the cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly , but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired . i 've had several entrées and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them . i 'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos ! that said , it 's a decent place to go late night for dessert .	4104
0	my wife and visited this cheesecake location earlier today for lunch ... .what a fiasco ! waited almost 50 minutes for food ... . because waitress forgot to turn in our order ... ... when my chicken salad finally arrived ... .wait for it ... wait for it ... .it had no chicken . for this i got two `` sorry about that '' from the waitress and no apology/acknowledgement whatsoever the the manager ? ?	4104
0	worst cheesecake every been to , food is gross , service is poor . horrible chef horrible uncooked food	4104
0	food can be decent but when we go to pick up it takes longer to get through the line and order than to actually cook the food . what is frustrating is that there seems to be groups of employees standing around while people wait to order having worked in restaurants much of my life i would just urge them to use their resources a bit more efficiently	4104
0	tasted like they heated up a frozen dinner for us . soggy .	4104
0	this place is overpriced and overcrowded.our food was wrong twice and when we got it was lukewarm . the server complained that it was n't his fault it was the fault of the spanish people working in the back who could n't speak english ( horrible thing to say ) . truly a terrible experience and have had similiar experiences dealing with terrible service at various other cheesecake factories . will not be going back .	4104
0	ordered the garlic noodles and had a super long hair in my food ... was told the manager was going to come over and take care of it . manager never arrived . my waitress was sweet and professional , and she got me a replacement order of noodles . bartender was nice as well . sad that the manager on duty , whoever he or she is , never took care of the situation . ca n't believe i had to pay for this food . love the cheesecake factory , but i 'm not impressed with the management at this location .	4104
0	just terrible.. ordered orange chicken- tasted like fish . sent it back , second dinner cold . manager never came to the table . obviously , do n't care about the customer .	4104
0	sad but true that you would not serve us on the patio . indoor was not an option since we had our dog with us . it was not raining and in fact sun is out at 12:40 on saturday . there appeared to be maybe 20 customer tables tops and many staff members just standing around . disappointed to make the trip and be turned away .	4104
0	this is the second time within 2 weeks that i have visited the south side location . last week our service was poor and we made a point to let someone know . giving them another chance , we are back today for lunch . service is still just as bad . it took 10 minutes for us to get water , and even longer for bread after she said she would bring some , we still had to ask after 15 minutes had passed	4104
0	i was so looking forward to going to the cheesecake factory because we do not have one anywhere close to albuquerque , nm . i did not go to this particular location on 27th , but did go to the one in ross park mall . what a major disappointment . the food was way to expensive , not tasty at all , and the service was the slowest i have ever experienced . 2 1/2 hrs . in a restaurant to eat a burger and piece of cheesecake is ridiculous . also , i did not think the cheesecake was all that great for $ 8 a slice . please do not come to albuquerque .	4104
0	i would rather eat cardboard with a little seasoning salt on it , there have another meal here at the cheese cake factory . my last time here i ordered a pasta dish the pasta was dry and the tomato sauce did not adhere to the noodles . aladdin 's cheese cake better any way .	4104
0	tonight has been the worst service ever . our waitress was rude and very disrespectful . manager was rude and disoriented . the food was cold , bland , took over an hour as the messed up our order . been here several times before with no issues . this place has gone way down hill !	4104
0	being from south side i frequent the cheesecake factory quite a bit . i called tonight to place a to go order . they kept me on hold for 8 mins and 40sec . which i feel is completely unacceptable . when i asked to spoke to the manager he seemed more irritated that i was wasting his time with my complaint rather then trying to rectify the problem . i will never visit this location again . i can spend my money where it is more appreciated .	4104
0	interesting meal with my family . first the appetizer was not prepared properly , out of the lemon chicken and then vegetables were cold . overall should be zero stars . made a comment on corporate site and next thing i know , the manager that was so crappy is stalking my linked in page . so if you make a complaint expect the managers to look you up . little cyber stalking to go with crappy meal .	4104
0	worst customer service of all time . would not try . waited 3 times on the phone to place takeout order for over 5-7 minutes each time asked to speak to a manager and they could n't even find one to speak with for another 5 minutes . poorly ran place . for basic food not worth the wait or pain in the butt to deal with that service .	4104
0	i try to review chains on their individual merits . how good is this version in relation to the other clones elsewhere ? for tcf , however , they seem to be universally deplorable . it 's criminally unhealthy , has the most gigantic and depressing menu i 've ever seen in my life , and is , as culinary experiences go , utterly lamentable . i would rather go anywhere else .	4104
0	i called to order food for pick up , and dana at the front put me on hold , and then hung up the phone . when i called back , they answered the phone then hung up . another one of my friends called from their phone , and the same thing happened again . it was beyond rude .	4104
0	i think this place is overpriced for what you get . the servers were not that nice either . not satisfied .	4104
0	unfortunately this is one of the nicer places in the city which makes me sad because everytime i come here i 'm reminded of just how disappointing and expensive it is . i had the shimp platter with what had to be the blandest shimp in the history of discovered flavor . i honestly do n't know why i keep coming back here , but i 'm sure it has something to do with self punishment .	4104
1	everyone hates moving but champion movers made it as smooth as possible for me . lauren helped me over the phone . they used two men who came on time packed my stuff up with care . nothing broke . fair price . would use them again .	4105
1	used champion movers to move my house in las vegas on sat 6/16/18 . truck arrived on time , with 4 professional movers who took the time to do the job right , but hustled enough to get the job done . it was a huge house and there was some big and expensive furniture and they made sure they were careful and got the job done on time . the whole process took almost 7 hours from load to empty ( twice ) and some furniture set-up . i have nothing but great things to say about these boys and would recommend champion movers to anyone looking for fast , professional moving services in the las vegas and surrounding areas .	4105
1	from the start , the nice representative lauren was thorough and pleasant . the communication was smooth as she gave me a quote , and moved me as soon as i needed them . the guys were timely and i did n't realize that at 8am it would be already in the 90s on the hottest day of the year , but hey did n't complain , they were professional and pleasant to be around . i will definitely refer you guys to those i know are moving in the near future !	4105
1	excellent service . very personable young men . on time , and took good care of our belongings . asked before they placed furniture . thank you champion movers . we would use you again ! maureen and david t .	4105
1	i used this company 8 years ago and it was the first and only one i contacted for my recent move . still very pleased ! tim was excellent with his guys . so quick and did n't complain that i moved to a third floor with no elevator . everything intact and took extra care of my new tv . thanks so much !	4105
1	we had a local move in las legas . the three gentleman tim , brian and will were courteous and very efficient . i would highly recommend them and their company .	4105
1	arrived on time , very accommodating on my request along with my feng shui master . great team work , alejandro , danny , arturo and ramon . highly recommended !	4105
0	horrible company beware . does not honor contracts and threaten you with a lawsuit if you write a bad review . was told as well 7-10 days but they called they day before pick up and said that they would not deliver items for 21 days . that is not what was discussed from the start ! !	4105
0	put me in a bind ! ! ! very misleading and dishonest ! ! provided competitive rates for over a week then when it came time to book , lauren put me on hold and magically my rate jumped over $ 1000 for no logical explanation ! ! i 'm less than a month away from my move and they have wasted my time ! a good business would honor the initial estimates provided and therefore win my business ! very unhappy customer ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4105
0	horrible . if you try to dispute $ 4000 up charge and claim missing boxes and items they send you an empty email impossible to fill out	4105
0	do not use that company to move your stuff ! not professional company ! ! there estimate for time they will tell you 6-8 weeks . eventually it will take them double for me and my wife they cause expenses of over 10 thousands dollar ! ! ! ! ! they not willing to pay anything back ! we have to take them now to small claims ! ! find a new moving company	4105
0	champions movers . is a scam ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do not use their services ! ! they are liars !	4105
0	it was tracy who would not give me a valid email . i tried the email adresses i could locate before calling you and they were all returned `` undeliverable '' . i am sure your guys did not want my dishes but none the less , they were ticked off over a tip they thought they were not getting enough to just drive away before finishing , effectively stealing my possessions . i have no desire to call you and debate this . that was my plan when i wanted to email you before writing reviews . you have already wasted enough of my time and money .	4105
0	their service is great if you do n't mind them breaking your furniture .	4105
1	my family and i love insomnia cookies ! we go out of our way to stop by and grab some cookies when we are near one of these . my oldest daughter just wants the `` cookie '' dough ice cream topping as we rarely get ice cream but with all our cookie purchases we can usually get the `` cookie toppings '' too !	4106
1	the `` cookiewitch '' could change your life ! who does n't want to try a custom made ice-cream cookie sandwich at least once ?	4106
0	love the cookies here and usually always get it delivered , but the last few orders they have always forgotten something . extremely annoying and starting to waste my money . i 'm currently in contact with their support team because i do not like being robbed multiple times .	4106
0	love the cookies but have had terrible service and experiences with the kent location . last weekend i ordered around 11 pm and did n't receive my cookies until after 3 am & i was in bed ! ! ! they should have given me full refund and i received a cookie coupon if i spend $ 6 i get 2 free cookies . poorly organized management .	4106
1	i recently had my bathroom remodeled by holtzman . they did an excellent job . johnny the residential designer arrived on time to inspect the area , and put together a design per my plans . a visit to their showroom allowed me to view my design along with choosing from a variety of products . all of their contractors are personable , professional , and were able to work around my busy schedule . brandon and judy have impeccable follow up . i would highly recommend for any remodel .	4107
1	i had my kitchen remodeled by holtzman i had the pleasure of working with bruce . i ca n't believe how smooth everything went from start to finish . they showed up when they said and stayed on budget and finished on schedule . this is the first time i 've ever posted a review on yelp but that 's were i found them and it 's only fair to help other people find an extraordinary company like this . and when we get ready to do our bathrooms i will update this review on that experience also . i hope this is helpful for anyone looking for remodel like it was for me .	4107
1	brandon and team painted my cabinets to give my kitchen and bath a fresh modern look . brandon met with me a couple of times as i was making my choices . his estimate was fair . he followed up to let me know when he was ready to start . a week later , i have cabinets that look like new . i would definitely recommend holtzman for quality of results and follow through and all around professionalism .	4107
1	i have known and done business with brandon and danny for over 5 years now and they are some of the nicest people i know . their work is beautiful and their prices are more than fair . the entire staff is so knowledgeable and friendly they make it fun and easy to work with them . i highly recommend you give holtzman a chance to earn your business .	4107
0	i 'm glad i read the reviews of vicki and scott below because i got a vibe of slow construction process . the sales guy / contractor who stopped by gave me the impression the company takes on lots of work and stays overbooked which would not end well for the customer . not what i was looking for but may work for others . i was supposed to receive a computer drawing of our consultation discussion about 4 or 5 days later and after about two weeks passed i just moved on .	4107
0	to steve f ... .sounds like using him could have been a huge mistake . they came out and took measurements to do a small bathroom remodel several months ago . i never received an estimate . he was in my home all of about 5 minutes ; took some measurements and left like a banshi . btw , seems to me the 1st amendment protects people like you and me from people like holtzman .	4107
0	just noticed brandon claimed i had an irs 'fraud ' issue related to an hsa , i do n't now nor have i ever had an hsa . lmao ... what a joke he is ... . quit making excuses and just do your job , do n't drop the ball and blame it on the customer . people do n't do these posts for fun but rather , to warn others of what to expect from unscrupulous businesses	4107
0	brandon is a flat out liar who can not be trusted to respond appropriately and jumps all over the place , talks real fast and twitches like there might be something else going on here . hmmm ... . if i was breaking the law i challenge him to let the irs know or sue me and i will challenge his slanderous , libelous comments which he has documented for me in his response below on `` yelp '' . thanks for that fyi , you can tell when he 's lying , his lips will be moving ... we used boswell flooring and he did a great job , quick , clean and priced competitively	4107
1	are you kidding me ? ! ! ! this place is so unbelievably amazing ! the beef from the smoker is moist ( such a gross word , but i ca n't think of another one - so get over it ) . the buns are fresh . not too soft , not too firm - just right . staff are chatty and friendly , super helpful . that alone is tough to find these days . a must try	4108
1	solid beef dip , great bun , tender and juicy . fast friendly service . glad i found this place on yelp . going to try the brisket next time .	4108
1	always a solid sandwich experience here , whether it 's the beef dip or the bbq beef . i 'm probably one of the few who does n't love the cheese sauce but they offer provolone also which i do love with the beef . you can taste the smoke which is delicious ! coleslaw also kicks butt .	4108
0	the food was very underwhelming for the price . i 'm glad i got to try it but i do n't think i 'd go out of my way for a steak sandwich from here again . the cheese sauce ( ? ? ) consistency really threw me off , and i ended up taking most of it off . i definitely did n't have a bad time , but it 's just not for me .	4108
0	ps : was contacted by someone apparently related to this business , stating they 've been investigated by food safety authorities and passed the test with flying colors . if that 's true , good for them ! my opinion remains the same , though - and yours is up to you to decide .	4108
0	i found the au jus to be extremely bland , but the meat and bread were decent . they have a forced tip option on the machine but you have to stand around and get your own food and bring it to your own table . it 's exactly the same as mcdonald 's . not sure why you would tip ! ?	4108
1	one of my new favorite spots to eat in vegas . food was delicious and plenty to go around . the peking duck , soup dumpling , filet , honey spare rib , and fried noodles were on point !	4109
1	it has such a good environment . it is definitely well liked because every time i go they have a bunch of people there . the waiters are very nice and the food comes out fast . i had my chinese friend order for me since he had been to that place a lot but it was one of the better chinese places i have been to .	4109
1	our friends brought us here-their favorite chinese restaurant . we tend to agree : the whole place looks clean ( including the restrooms-a big plus ) , nicely furnished , service pleasant , all the dishes we tried were unique by itself and tasty at very reasonable prices . highly recommended ! ! definitely will be back to try their other dishes .	4109
1	dope spot . super clean and i love the decor here . taste has really bold flavors . we ordered the jelly fish , pan fried noodles , xiao long bao and szechuan chicken with jalapeño . no complaints , the portion was really nice and service was on point . i ca n't wait to go back and try other things on the menu . my new go to restaurant for some kick ass chinese food . highly recommend ! ! !	4109
1	pretty much the best chinese food you can get . not only is the price very affordable , the flavor and freshness is amazing ! highly recommend .	4109
1	this new chinese/cantonese restaurant just opened and there 's a lot of dishes on the menu that want to try . like the duck and the squab ( which they were out of ) but i 'll try it next time . i love curry crab with steamed buns & the harbor ( spicy ) lobster !	4109
1	came here for my daughters baptismal dinner . it was okay , pricey for what you get . you should skip the dungeoness crab . place is new and clean . your paying for their upscale decor . i 've ate at hole in the wall chinese places and their food taste much better .	4109
1	i highly recommend this place if you want really good authentic chinese food ! even all the waiters were chinese . got the wonton noodle soup and it was probably the best i 've had here in vegas . gyoza was just cooked perfectly and taste exactly what what i was expecting ! and of course we ordered 2 xlb , and omg it was mouthwatering . it was soupy and i 've tried 3 places around town and they were n't as soupy as this one ! y'all need to come here stat ! ! !	4109
1	sent out the yelp feelers for something tasty . have n't had chinese in a while , so why not ? honey walnut shrimp happens to be one of my fav dishes so the siren 's song of plump shrimp deep fried in mayo lured me in . we were immediately greeted and seated even though the place quickly filled up . ordered some potstickers and they arrived quickly . they were good , not great and the service was cold but efficient . within 10 minutes here came the honey walnut shrimp . tasty ! ! ! ! ! big portion with a spoon meant for sharing . wife ordered the same and in retrospect we should have ordered something different to share .	4109
1	authentic cantonese food here , try their lunch special , has the spicy beef noodle soup , which is pretty good , portion is reasonable , will try their dinner later .	4109
1	highly recommend this restaurant ! it was authentic chinese food ! my waiter was so helpful picking my dinner . i had the clams and black bean sauce , crispy orange beef , pea shoots with garlic sauce and bbq pork fried rice . everything was very flavorful ! i ca n't wait to go back !	4109
1	the food was good . the place is new and very clean . the service was great ! they have 2 private rooms for dining and karaoke ! ! they also own the ohana hawaiian restaurant next door and serve their drinks ! i 'm definitely coming back !	4109
1	exceptional food , great service . i had the french style filet mignon , which is the best .	4109
1	great service ! ! fried rice a little dry with few eggs or veggies . overall , very clean !	4109
1	nice to have a authentic chinese restaurant near our home . the atmosphere is bright and clean nice to eat there . also , they own the ohana hawaiian bbq next door so if i want chinese and my kids want hawaiian we are both satisfied ! we 've ordered quite a bit of dishes from here and loved it all ! the only thing is food comes out sporadically..this last time we ate the our rice came out last..i need that with my food !	4109
1	went to dinner on saturday night . it was my third time here but my first time for dinner . i had 12 guests with me for dinner . we ordered live eel , yes live eel . ordered lobster with basil , chow mein , eggplant , and about 8 other things . i can say the food was good and the portions were above average for a chinese restaurant . the service was excellent and the prices were reasonable . i will be going back soon	4109
0	the crispy fried chicken was so dry . it gets stuck in your throat . other items are good . fried rice , jellyfish , veggies .	4109
0	talk about arrogance and self condescending staff . great as thought they had better people to serve and the smell of fish should have told me not to eat here . felt nausea after eating here and will never be back i would advice stay away from here .	4109
0	customer service like shit . first day we went , waited 45 mins for food . they gave some lame ass excuse . today we went back with 2 tables in the whole entire place . still waited 30 mins for food . the waitor gave the dish to another table ( their friend ) and told us our order was n't put in . then we asked the original person who took the order , she said if was put into the system . 2 waitor bullshiting customers . go eat somewhere else that appreciates their customer .	4109
0	great atmosphere , way over priced ! poor quality of meats , ordered the french filet mignon - very fatty & rough , lack of flavor ; black bean chicken - although chicken breast full of fat , tendons , lack of flavor ; crispy chicken 1/2 - best overall , great flavor & texture but very small portion especially for $ 13 . it appears that for the price , it 's not worth it , the cut of meats is more like trimmings you would discard but yet they serve it to you and charge a ridiculous amount for it .	4109
0	ordered to go and was ready within 10 minutes only to discover the food cold ( not even slightly warm ) . be careful when ordering to-go before closing time or you might get cold food packed into a to-go container .	4109
0	wrong order for the third time , and do not take responsibility , bad service , rude , never going back ... such a shame	4109
0	i love the food at this place , but i ordered food and the vegetables were dirty . i 'm at work and took time to go pick it up on my lunch and insisted i 'd go back after i work at 10 to go get a full refund . ridiculous !	4109
0	extremely overpriced . does n't worthit at all . it 's close to home so i ordered from there often . the most recent time i ordered , the portion was very small so i called and tried to talk to the manager . the manager was rude and did n't even bother to talk on the phone with me and passed it to the employee . that 's how they treat regular customers !	4109
0	took over an hour to receive the food my family and i ordered . the 4 tables that sat down after us received their food before us . restaurant was not packed . will think twice about coming back .	4109
0	the slowest restaurant i have ever visited . it took one hour twenty minutes before our food was served .	4109
0	the food was okay , been to other chinese restaurants that are far better than this one . the service was the slowest that i have been . from the time they sat us down , took our orders , placed them on our tables . they took 30 minutes to deliver our food ! ! just for 3 orders ! ! ! ! seriously ? ! ! ! they were only fast on getting the check . the tea is lukewarm when it is supposed to be hot . waiter did n't even bother to check on us wont come back	4109
0	walked in for christmas with my party . the place was almost empty but lady said all other tables are reserved . they wanted to usher us to a private room but the minimum order is $ 500 . there 's no way my party would ever order that much food . we asked if we could just do a regular order they declined our patronage . i will not be coming back because of the lack of understanding from the restaurant .	4109
0	was so excited to try this place out based on the reviews . disappointed . first of all the tea pot and utensils were n't washed and filthy . then my food came out and thought it was just ok . i had the crispy fried chicken , soup dumplings & cake noodle . maybe i ordered the wrong thing but not sure i 'll be back .	4109
0	we had family of 14 people try to celebrate christmas . soon as we got there lady was telling us all the table was reserved . she keep insisting us to get private room with minimum $ 500 food order . what a joke . i was really pissed so , we decide to go to rainbow kitchen .	4109
0	overpriced and rude ! this guys messed our order and when we called them to see if they could correct it , they didnt ggive a fuck and acted rude and didnt even bother to correct their mistake ! you seriously just lost loyal customers , beware of this place , they are n't honest ...	4109
0	beware ! ! i sent my soup back because it was cold . and when the server was bringing it back to me , my girlfriend saw the server spit into my soup ! ! ! when i went to the manager , the manager said i was lying ! wow they they supported their server and not someone who 's buying dinner in this new restaurant ! ! i will never go here again ! ! neither should anyone else ! ! gross ! ! ! ! !	4109
1	great attentive service with a wonderful buffet selection . be sure to try a bit of everything as i did my first time here . spacious dining area and a decor that matches the essence of the true indian flavors .	4110
1	had some awesome tasting indian food after long time . everything we ordered was great . service could be little better and fast . overall great place .	4110
1	great find in cleveland ! the ambiance is awesome , and especially good for a large group . the service is excellent and servers are accommodating . both the indian and indian chinese cuisines are great here- we had a variety of dishes .	4110
1	this place is excellent ! ! and i 'm from the north of england , so i 've had many good indian meals .	4110
1	tadka is probably the best place in cleveland for indian food . large selection of foods , great decor and atmosphere.you can get both the indian and indian chinese cuisines here .	4110
1	i had the vindaloo curry chicken set on medium . it was absolutely perfect , my partner had the tandoori chicken , which i have never had and he gave me a piece , it was great too ! no complaints whatsoever , love the mom and pop places . definitely recommended !	4110
1	i was feeling down and needed a hot pick me up with some indian food ... this place had it ! ! ! i had a traditional goat dish with rice , with samosa appetizer , i was very happy with the quality of the food ! the service was less then great , but still very good : ) there was more than enough for next days lunch .	4110
1	the serve is exceptional here . the server was very attentive . the food is fantastic . it is bursting with flavor . i highly recommend the naan . its served hot . i had the chicken tiki masala and it was very good . their rice really makes it . i enjoyed the mango lassi ; but it was honestly a little too sweet . the decor is very cool , and the seating is comfortable . the manager was kind enough to come over fora chat and ensure everything was fine . the only suggestion i have is they need music . the place is deafeningly quite .	4110
1	this is a great place which reminds you of good indian chinese food and great north indian punjabi food ... i have never been to the buffet ( as such i am not a fan of buffets in general ) but i have catered from them too ... great catering , great service and really good courteous staff !	4110
1	we 've eaten at tadka twice now , and they definitely do not disappoint ! tadka serves very good northern indian cuisine , in a hip , low key atmosphere . portions are huge ; large enough that they could be shared by 2 people . the waitstaff are very nice , attentive , but not intrusive . tadka is easily our favorite indian restaurant in cleveland .	4110
1	went a 2nd time and was equally blown away by the exceptional and attentive service and the food bursting with flavor . had the korba this time and was very satisfied . they do need the liquor license though . its a long time coming .	4110
1	this is the place i was first introduced to indian food and i have been coming back ever since . my favorite is the chicken makhani . the menu has a great variety and the best part is asking the waiter/waitress for recommendations . i would recommend to anyone . great service and great food .	4110
0	we just tried to eat here and i 'm pretty sure it 's closed . all the tables were pushed together , it was dark , and nobody was there . at 6:30 p.m ... . on a monday .	4110
0	first will start with the seating arrangement..chair/table were so low & uncomfortable to sit & eat..now coming to food..we ordered chicken hakka noodle & veg manchurian..the guy told me that they have thick noodle , but he gave me thin vermicelli type noodle..taste was average though..chicken manchurian was also ok..not bad . we tried in tadka columbus which was horrible . now after trying here , i am confirmed they are bad everywhere . i will never ever visit this restaurant again .	4110
0	food full of oil and grease.. i am a lover of indian food , however this place is real bad - they deceive the taste by putting more oil , you end up with stomach full of gas later . there is old indian lady in this place ( waiter , owner.. god knows.. ) , is full of attitude and can be rude . my indian friends told me , she treats brown people different - racist ! !	4110
0	very scary walked in and walked out ! went to the rail instead !	4110
0	i went here recently with my hubby , food was okay , very oily , and waiters dont really listen to your orders and they are rude , they also behave differently with indians and americans .	4110
0	weird new setting , before we used to go we could order chinese and indian food at same time , does n't matter where we sit . i went today and my whole family of 7 had to go back empty stomach as they do n't allow both cuisine at one place . we can only pick one . such a disappointment ! we are local north olmsted resident . now this restaurant is no use for our nice family dinner .	4110
0	worst service , worst response , i had to wait for 15 min to get water and occupancy was just 10 % ... . ! ! ! ! ! only visit if you are ok with 45 min of wait time for order and another 30 min for food very disappointed	4110
0	this review is for bamboo garden/ tadka . they are both essentially the same restaurant , prepared by the same chefs . the buffet held at bamboo gardens has a fusion of foods from both restaurants . the decor is great , but that 's about it . honestly , the food was crap . over salted , lacking quality , lack luster service a few times . if you want to go to an indian restaurant based on decor , go here . you can have a blast staring at their decorations . if you want to go to an indian restaurant based on amazing food , and decent decor , go to flavors of india , located down the street from this place .	4110
0	the food at the buffet was cold . we spoke to the staff about it but they seemed helpless . not going back .	4110
0	the only indian restaurant i 've been to that is n't capable of using coconut milk in curry .	4110
0	while this is my first check in and review this was supposed to be our forth or fifth time here . you used to be able to order from with here or bamboo gardens next door which was how we used to do since i am not a fan of indian cuisine . apparently that is no longer allowed so we will not be returning . they have lost our business . very sad .	4110
0	pretty disappointed . i 've been here several times with my family and we consider it the best indian buffet on this side of town ( always weekend buffet ) . this last visit the other day was quite disappointing . all vegetarian dishes were fatty and fried : deep fried okra , deep fried potatoes . also the dishes were heavily salted and very spicy . i think i have become disillusioned with the quality especially since it is upwards of 15 to 20 dollars for lunch buffet .	4110
1	i 'll admit it , i procrastinate , waited until today to use my $ 100 rewards card that expires 12/31/2017 . the pep boys did n't have the parts i needed at this location and could n't fit me in to get my brakes done since they close at 5pm . they do n't let you prepay but on this occasion , thanks to steve , they did . dropping off the car in the morning , hoping to roll into 2018 problem free .	4111
1	great service ! great prices ! ! ! ! very honest ! ! i was so happy with this place ! i will be back ! needed new back rotors and pads ... ..amazing price ! ! ! ! could n't be happier ! ! : - )	4111
1	i was referred here by auto zone to get my ac system checked . best move of the day . this is an top notch honest group of mechanics . mat was patient although the shop was very busy . he explained what was wrong with my vehicle and gave me an honest accurate quote immediately . a good honest mechanic is hard to find and i am grateful i found this place . will definitely come back in the future !	4111
1	these guys are great ! ! beyond amazing customer service ! ! ! thank you jesus , gene and younger gentlemen .	4111
1	i took my chevy suv there and i was impressed by the service i received . as soon as i pulled the assistant manager , jesus , greeted me and was able to get my vehicle in right away . when they first quoted me i knew it was overpriced , but they were willing to negotiate . they are working hard to earn your business so they will work with you when it comes to prices . but whatever you do , do not settle with their initial quote . i will mostly come back for future service .	4111
1	went in to get my brakes done and was greeted by jesus as soon as i pulled up . me and my husband were welcomed and jesus talked to my husband about my brakes and got the job done in about a hour ... very pleased with the customer service ... once again jesus is awsome ! ! ! !	4111
1	i was sort of in a pinch after my unsatisfactory visit to autozone ( see previous review ) , out $ 50 , which i did end up getting refunded , with an ac unit on the verge of blowing , and just brakes came through for me . very friendly customer service , knowledgeable , and honest . they shed some light on the misinformation i 'd been given at autozone and fixed my ac issue in a timely manner . i 'm not sure how their costs compare to other shops , but they seemed reasonable anyway , and they tacked on a military discount . they also fixed the service engine soon issue that jumpstarted the whole fiasco . thank you fellas .	4111
0	no stars ! these guys are dumb asses ! my mom took her suburban here on 7/13/2013 at 730 in the morning to clean her air filter 9 hours later they call her to pick it up and now she has no ac ? ! ! ? when she does turn on the ac it makes a horrific grinding sound ? ? they said they did n't touch it and it was a coincidence that it stopped working while it was at their shop . then they tried to sell her a new compressor ? ! ! ?	4111
0	i 'm sure changing brakes is supposed to take its time but not almost five hours , how can a place like this have only 2 guys working on cars and have their garage just about full ? not only that , their waiting area is horrible , the best they can do is tell you to go eat at popeye 's . do n't care if these brakes are insured for a lifetime or not i will most definitely not be going back to there .	4111
0	this review is on jesus ! this man should be fired ! he rushed a job on a truck at the end of the day , and something went wrong with the truck . instead of helping his crew members figuring out the issue , he was standing outside by his car why the mechanics worked on this truck . mind you this is past 815 at night and the customer is waiting inside . this man is no leader , and should not be rushing jobs at the end of the night for the sale , and he should be helping his crew instead of standinf outside his car waiting . big kudos to the men that have to work with man everyday .	4111
0	brought my car in at 8am , took 3 hours to diagnose my a/c . they then began working in my car . one of the guys said they would n't put any parts or do anything without calling me . i paid $ 1000 for a a/c compressor and to install it with labor and all . the paper after it was all done said they did a bunch of tests and runs on the car without my permission and i was charged for it . just do n't like being lied to .	4111
0	while the staff , doug in particular , will smother you in condescending kindness , what matters is that the quality of work is sub par , the turn around times are inadequate , communication between staff and customers is non existent , and ultimately the customer does not get the service and products required .	4111
0	made an appt . guy was a bit short but told me to come at 2 . by 245 , i left . in these busy times , not cool . i was told at 2 . it would be 230 , at 230 he said it 'll be just a sec . pass . done with this location .	4111
0	i scheduled an appointment for an alignment at 5pm ( for the following day ) . they waited until 30 minutes before my appointment to tell me they did n't have anyone who could perform an alignment in the shop that day . i had no time to find another shop , and i 'm now without a safe vehicle to drive . you lost me as a customer before i even walked through your doors .	4111
1	great food . try the chop its huge.friendly service and down home atmosphere .	4112
1	i like this place . maybe it 's because jake 's is a refurbished country filling station with an out-the-door line at peak times . maybe it 's their quirky menu that is so out of step with my expectations ( e.g . venison quesadillia ? ! ) . but , i think it 's because they cook their food so damn well . jake 's is a true anomaly with offerings unique enough to say , `` oh , yea , got ta try that '' and with prices just high enough to keep it from becoming a dive . did i say i like this place ? yep .	4112
1	one of the best places i have ever had the pleasure of finding . what there for lunch with a large crew worm work service was fast and food was great .	4112
1	great little place -- -very reasonably priced . salmon was best i 've had in a long while . came on top of a delicious fried potatoe cake with tomatoes and dill sauce . had pecan pie for dessert -- outstanding . ( apparently the banana pudding is great too . ) the hot homemade biscuits were just like grandmas . the only downside was they were reluctant to give us more than one biscuit . not sure why . overall , i 'll be back again but may need to bring back-up biscuits .	4112
1	great food . i mean everything is great . nice , quaint place . the only drawback is limited seating and no reservations so you need to go early or late . prime time is out the door .	4112
1	had the pork chop with horseradish mashed potatoes ... so amazing ! ! the best chocolate cake for desert ! ! had a great experience at jake 's ! ! looking forward to going back soon !	4112
1	i love stopping here ! homemade ketchup and sweet tea to die for ! i love the turkey burger and the meatloaf sammach ! do n't judge me ! the chips are killer too !	4112
1	fantastic food , interesting atmosphere . it seems like nobody knew how to dress here because there was a guy in a bow tie at one table and a kid in a tie-dye wife beater at another . definitely not an upscale place . you can tell it used to be a gas station . however , the food was phenomenal . i had the special which was tuna with eggplant ratatouille and fresh spinach . the food was definitely better than some more expensive and classier looking places in uptown charlotte .	4112
1	great place to get a burger . i loved the feel and atmosphere . the cheeseburger prepared `` all the way '' with mustard , onions , and chili was awesome . it 's hard to find good chili , but theirs was top notch . the freshly made potato chips were hit or miss . some were soggy and some were perfectly crispy . some people have commented on the service . it was a busy day when we were there and we had about a 10 minute wait . despite this the server was attentive and we never felt like we were waiting around for anything .	4112
1	this place is out in the middle of nowhere ... we 'll sort of . i found it a few years ago while hunting down diners drive ins and dive places . this one lives up to the shows reputation as crazy good food and interesting lineage . everything from atmosphere to service to food items is just great . comfy down home comfort food and friendly home town feel is the subtext of this fantastic eatery . i will visit every chance i get and if you are in the charlotte area it 's worth the trip .	4112
1	2nd time here and just as good as my first visit i think i could eat the fired green tomatoes all day the cut is perfect . the only thing is if you do n't know where you 're going you 'll miss this spot ! this is the type of place you 'll want to keep in rotation . servers were good both visits and entrees matched .	4112
0	so sad , we saw this on triple d 's and went out of our way to come and they were closed for the 4th of july week . i would have called if this was the 4th but this was the 6th of july and i was shocked that the entire place was closed . definitely , call before going to make sure they are open .	4112
0	came here since we heard about it on `` diners , drive-ins , & dives '' and we had a couple of people actually recommend it . we felt sick afterwards . the chicken wings were ok as a starter , but the fried flounder sandwich is what i think did it . the tarter sauce was n't good . the pasta salad was not either ... maybe their mayo just went bad . the vinegar slaw was nothing special . the service was good but this place was a little too dirty for us . it was a one and done , probably wo n't come again .	4112
0	we had been wanting to try this place ... it was on ddd . the best part of dinner was the croutons . bbq chicken was dry . pork chops ( which was what ddd had ) was dry . mashed potatoes tasted instant . very disappointed and wo n't be going back . definitely overpriced considering the quality .	4112
0	this place used to be pretty good but each time i 've been since , the quality has gone steadily downhill . this time , there were so many things wrong that it was overwhelming . all of us agreed that we wo n't be back .	4112
0	apparently this place really does n't need business . tried to place an order to be picked up for a local family dinner for four . was told that they simply could n't accept an order at the time . that is certainly an experience i have never had . this is a novel place , but the novelty is probably not worth the hassle .	4112
0	overpriced ! they give us the check without price so when we paid at the counter ... 38 bucks for entrée of salmon with risotto , pulled pork sandwhich , extra fries and toast . the servers are ok but their food is blah overpriced .	4112
0	never again ! if someone tries to drag you here , resist as hard as you can . it 's not worth the diarrhea !	4112
0	took my family for lunch . it 's over rated . nothing special and the cashier was a smarty pants . wo n't go back .	4112
0	heard really great things about this place since it was on that food show but honestly it was n't all that great for me . i ordered the chicken sandwich . my food was just `` warm '' , drinks were `` flat '' ( ordered 3 different kinds ) , and prices were higher than expected . the chicken was seasoned ok but dry . i tried to eat my food rather quickly due to all the flies also wanting a taste . my coworkers seemed to enjoy their meals though . maybe i should have ordered the burger ! our server was nice and the ladies restroom was clean ! !	4112
0	not eating here again . i got stuck in a corner and basically forgot about . whenever the waitress did come by with the food or drink , it was a quick set it down and run off . no interaction , not friendly at all . the food was pretty good but horrible service .	4112
0	the food was not horrible and do n't waste your time . the service was good . we will not be returning !	4112
1	on this visit we had hamachi jalapeño , albacore roll , miso black cod , and bronzed broccoli . each one was served with a description of how it was prepared . all were excellent ! our waiter florin did his job with great care and spent time making suggestions . he gave a great review of the sake list and we enjoyed a very nice $ 100 bottle of wandering poet with dinner . ca n't say enough about the menu and service here . at the top of out list of favorite restaurants .	4113
1	this place is a solid 4 . had teriyaki salmon 5***** miso soup ( too salty ) 3*** salmon avocado roll : 5***** spicy tuna roll : 2** ambiance/decor : 5***** service : 5***** price e is average to vegas .	4113
1	many others wrote about decor but i barely notice the trendy sitting area or outdoor seating looking over the treasure island show as i head purposely for the bar stools to order the all time best kobe beef sliders-mini burgers of all time ! these are a las vegas must have while i am in town , they are a melt in your mouth , not cheap , perfect sized treat before heading out to a club or other drunken adventure . another dish i have added to my must have list at social house is the yellowtail sashimi w/ tempura jalapenos . these are right up with the sliders now , who knew jalapenos and thinly sliced yellowtail could taste this good ! !	4113
1	five stars for happy hour menu - wonderful ramen ( pork belly with miso ) five stars for the tres leches green tea dessert 4 to 4.5 stars for the samurai sushi roll ( one of us loved it , the other felt combination of ingredients overwhelmed each other ) friendly staff and good lounge music - pity it seems to be quiet nice decor	4113
1	had dinner on 05/02/08 ; we had no reservations and just walked in , which made it a plus . the service was great , the decor and atmosphere made it fun , and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and the star rabbit sake were awesome..definately recommend these two !	4113
1	came here for a client dinner . nice ambiance , pricy menu but interesting selections . aria hotel 's sushi restaurant was closed for a private function so we tried this place instead and were happy we did ! we tried several small plates and shared with the table . it was great .	4113
1	decent and fresh , if somewhat overpriced food in a cool setting . i 'm not sure i would go out of my way to come here , but i was grateful that it was next door . service was excellent .	4113
1	great atmosphere , not too big like a lot of other vegas places . i sat at the bar for dinner . happy hour has great deals , and i found their menu a little less expensive than some of the other sushi places around . the bartenders were super friendly and gave great recommendations to fit my taste . i will definitely be back .	4113
1	was in vegas for my birthday/super bowl & went to social house for dinner on sunday night . beautiful décor ! we ordered the angry tuna roll & the seared albacore role & loved them both . the spicy tuna & unagi & they were good but kind of similar to most sushi places . i do recommend checking this place out & definitely get the angry tuna & the seared albacore .	4113
1	the tasting menu was good , the service was good but the homemade mochi balls for dessert was the icing on the cake	4113
1	i 'm writing this review months after my visit to social house during ces convention . we came with friends and were pretty impressed with the food .	4113
1	i went to social house with my sister and best girlfriends saturday during my vegas bachelorette party . it was definitely the highlight of our trip . we sat outside in very comfortable garden furniture , ate delicious japanese and pan-asian fusion food , had great drinks , saw the pirate show three times ( yes , we were there a while ) and had outstanding service . nate and ron were not only attentive , sweet and knowledgeable waiters , but very adorable as well ! would recommend to anyone and would definitely go back !	4113
1	i had my wedding cocktail reception here and the food was really excellent ! everything came out quickly and the staff that passed it all out was very friendly . they trays came out at a good pace , but my guests wanted more kobe beef tacos ! those were excellent ! we had the sliders , a number of maki sushi rolls , egg plant lettuce wraps that were my absolute favorite ! the bartenders for our party were awesome too . definitely want to come back and try the happy hour menu or the tasting that was advertised , sounds amazing ! thank you social house for making my wedding memorable !	4113
1	excellent service . had their premium omakase at $ 125 . you really get full , but the courses that you get were just okay ... ..nothing out of this world .	4113
1	salmon tartar best i 've ever had . we had a variety of rolls , all were good . the angry tuna roll stood out as super tasty .	4113
1	one of my favorite places in vegas . i love the decor , the food , the service & their yummy drinks . this place hits the spot ! the downside ? the tables are way too close together ! it makes things weird at times and some of the hostess are bitchy . maybe their spanx is too tight ? maybe the loads of mac makeup got in their eye . whatever the reason is it 's so not cute . but forget them and have a drink & a roll ! ; )	4113
1	went here on a sunday night with the boyfriend after a long wild las vegas weekend . we wanted somewhere to eat that was quick , great ambiance , wonderful service and bomb ! ! ! food . social house was all of the above . we ate the tomato cream cheese roll , scallops dipped in miso sauce , kobe beef rolls and some great dessert ! come here yes ! !	4113
1	happy hour is the time to go . ordered the 3 course meal for $ 20 . got the salad , tokontsu ramen ( $ 5 extra ) and spicy tuna roll cut . spot on especially after a rage night in vegas ! hahah	4113
1	handsdown ... amayyzzing ! ! ! the best sushi i 've ever had in my life ! online menu looks totally different and i do n't see the items i had but oh , how i miss this place !	4113
1	everything about this place was great ! ! made a reservation through yelp ( via opentable ) and they had a seat saved for me ... .the place was pretty empty but they sat me near the front ... not the most intimate table in the house but whatever ... .. did many of the recommendations from the server - who was on point about every dish . they had a special there - collar of a yellow-tail ... which the server described as buttery air ... and that was exactly how it tasted ... perfection . drinks were good and ambiance was nice . i wish i could have one starred my date ... she was horrible	4113
1	best meal during our stay . went w/five items from the social hour menu , and loved every item : angry tuna roll , miso cod cups , salmon , pork belly ramen w/poached egg ... drinks . great ambience+price ... and an easy walk from many hotels .	4113
1	i 'm not a big sushi eater , but what i ate was delicious ! got the california rolls ( yes , i am not adventurous ) and shrimp tempura . yummmmm . this place is kinda pricey , and this is the first time i 've ever paid $ 5 for `` japanese long-grain rice '' . it 's ok though , i was on vacation , so it was ok to splurge . i also had the tastiest lychee martini , complete with a liquor soaked lychee at the bottom ! i also heard some amazing house music being played here while we ate our dinner . probably the best i heard all weekend .	4113
1	great food , delicious assortment of sashimis w/extra ingredients . love the decor . quite pricey , but worth it . food is very good . my only complaint would be that it 's not as filling as i would like it to be . they 're a little slow in serving one dish to the next , it 's supposed to be family style . this was my 2nd time andi feel the same way both times . i was here 8 months ago and it has n't changed , just busier .	4113
1	+1 great looking place +1 food is very good- interesting rolls +1 great for parties +1 went there more than once , after trying this place in las vegas- the only place i ate ! ! ! +1 waiter was attentive- filling water , asking how the meal was , etc	4113
1	1st thing you notice is the large door when you walk in . the ambiance of the restaurant is real nice . the service is also great and quick . we started off with shashito peppers and the spicy tuna crispy rice along with the kobe sliders . the sliders were incredible and juicy . some items i think were a bit too overpriced , but overall a great place .	4113
1	food is good and the price point is n't too shabby either for vegas standards . we ordered a bunch of items . the ones that i recommend sticking clear from are the jidori chicken , hanger steak , and miso cod . oh , and the broccoli side dish too . you can totally make that at home and not be charged a leg for ; ) .	4113
1	this is now at crystals . we are still talking about this meal -- days later . we are everything we ordered family style and it was fantastic . the highlights of the meal were the fresh ahi and hamachi sashimi , the cod lettuce wraps , the hamachi app with the fried jalapeno and the steak . lowlights were the rolls . a few of them were just plain not good ; the others decent but not memorable . service was great . prices were expensive ( but this is vegas ) . atmosphere was spot on . will be returning for sure .	4113
1	came in for happy hour and will for sure try it out again . good deal , very friendly/social bartenders and great sushi and ramen soup .	4113
1	perfect place . designed to a t. edgy and classy . service is excellent . drinks are tasty . food is creative and delish . coffee is the best- but beware is espresso . patio seating outside gives you a view of the strip and a birds eye view of the used to be piratte show . the short ribs , trout , and sashimi taster are great dishes . thiswas one of my more memorable nights ever and thanks to social house for the start of this evening .	4113
1	great japanese inspired food ! i was glad to see that their maki rolls werent drenched in mayonaise ( like other americanized sushi restaurants ) . the crunchy kalbi beef roll was amazing ! im not sure how truly japanese it us , but the flavors were out of this world ! a close second was the tempura shrimp , light citrus flavor and the shrimp was tender and delicious ! we will be back for more kalbi beef next time we are in vegas !	4113
1	we eat here every time we visit vegas ( 4 times and counting ) ! great sushi , amazing appetizers , original drinks , and just plain great atmosphere . unlike any japanese place , the staff is friendly , knowledgeable always makes great suggestions . and not pricey , around $ 100 for two for a full meal with a few drinks .	4113
1	loved the happy hour ! went in for a group dinner too and it was cool sexy atmosphere . perfect .	4113
1	this is a real nice place . it has the atmosphere , the classy setting , and a hint of contemporary design . the price here is a little high , but you do get what you pay for . one thing you want to consider before you go to this restaurant is that this is not a authentic and traditional japanese restaurant . this is a contemporary style japanese food with american influence . i would love to go back here again , but i do n't think i 'll be able to afford this kind of restaurant very often .	4113
1	i came here for happy hour and i loved it ! the ambiance is low-key trendy and sexy . it definitely set the tone for a fancy sushi experience . we ordered the angry tuna roll , california roll , and kobe beef sliders . the angry tuna roll was the best and sooo good . good flavor and right amount of spiciness . i recommend it to everyone . even my bf , who does n't like fish , loved it . we also had the black river sake and it was smooth . i like this place because you get to experience expensive sushi at the fraction of the price . great date place . quaint spot from the hustle and bustle of vegas .	4113
0	some friends and i stopped in their lounge during the afternoon on our way back from the fashion show shops . nice decor . we were enticed by some drinks specials . our bartender was rude as all hell . cute but she was a b ! $ *h. i do n't know what she saw . we were not dressed like bums or hoodlums , but we must have had a $ $ h*le written on our foreheads .	4113
0	i rarely write negative reviews , but i make an exception for social house . i live here in las vegas where good sushi is abundant and reasonably priced and fun . social house has none of these merits . the sushi is mediocre , at best , over priced and the service is somewhere between poor and abominable .	4113
0	came here on sunday night and the place was dead . the sushi was average . our waitress whose name starts with aa ... did not look like she wanted to work there . we asked her about some items we saw from yelp and she looked annoyed bc it was on the lunch menu ... acted like she was busy when the damn restaurant was pretty empty . she poured our saki which overflowed a lot , and did not even wipe the damn table . the 4 stars on yelped def fooled us .	4113
0	overprice and has no flavor . i ordered the sushi that cost $ 40 , i was expecting great delicious yummy in my tummy satisfaction , but i was disappointed . my husband who got the cod was better than this $ 40 meal .	4113
0	mediocre food priced ridiculously . service was bad , there was one server in the entire dining area . thought going through my head all night and after : should 've gone to mastro 's . probably never coming back , and would n't recommend it . really should 've just gone to mastro 's for the price we paid . i love going out to eat and i really do n't mind paying but 2 so so cocktails , 2 blah apps , 2 okay entrees = $ 200 not worth it . should 've just gone to mastro 's . i feel so much regret .	4113
0	stupid place called them make me walk back n front n gave me wrong direction ! u just lost 4 costumers ! blamed it on the person who pick up the phone !	4113
0	this place has the worst service i have ever seen . waited over a hour for simple sushi rolls and nigiri and the parties behind us got similar food . had a dinner reservation at 9pm and waited 45mins to get seated . hi stress got this terrible attitude - never coming back	4113
0	maybe folks from from the midwest that have never tried sushi might like this place , but i am not from the midwest . this place was extremely disappointing . the sushi tasted like it had been sitting out for days , the service was atrocious , and it 's ridiculously overpriced . the staff was completely inept , never ceased to try to sell us the most expensive chef specials , never asked for drink orders unless i literally grabbed them 3 times and reminded them . there are plenty of other great places to eat in vegas .	4113
0	i will make this a short novel . chapter 1 : hostess fire your hostess she does not give a shit about the business . fin ...	4113
0	completely mediocre . i have eaten alot of sushi and this was a waste . especially for the money . service slow . sushi not tasting to fresh and mucho $ $ $ . had 1 roll 2 beers and 5 orders of nigiri for $ 137 ... ouch ... .	4113
0	happy hour was quite a disappointment . the $ 6 negihama roll was ok but embarrassingly tiny and the kobe beef sliders were about on par with white castle and beer selection/price ratio was equally awful . the bartender/server was super nice , otherwise 1 star .	4113
0	we ate at social house when it was at a treasure island and thought it was great . we tried it today and it was very disappointing . we had short ribs ( cold and too oily ) , various rolls ( not bad but nothing special ) , chicken teriyaki ( texture was odd almost as if it was baked and not like most chicken ) , we had several other dishes and our bill came out for five people to $ 350 . we were all unsatisfied with the food . would n't recommend this place at all .	4113
0	after going here for my and my husband 's 1 year anniversary , i believe that social house pays people to write good reviews . the $ 125 we paid for 2 rolls , a few beers , and miso and edamame might not have felt like such a rip off if the amount of fish in our rolls was even detectable . the lemon slices on top of my salmon roll were thicker than the salmon slices on top of the roll . nasty . starting to lose faith in yelp .	4113
0	i dunno . i was n't all that impressed with the place . i found the sushi ( of all places ) better at the sushi place in the orleans hotel ( forget the name ) . and forgetaboutit if you come to social house when there is a celeb there ! i wo n't mention names but when this one celeb was there there was sooo much security they shut down a bathroom for her ! ? yea , when i need to piss ... i need to piss . did n't like that . : ) service was just 'ok ' on a sunday nite . drinks expensive . i hear tao is better ... will try that instead .	4113
0	friday night . 8pm . empty restaurant except for 4 tables filled . more employees hanging around than customers . was seated by the hostess and nobody ever came to offer us a drink , water , or even a menu ! after 10 minutes we left . told the hostess we were leaving and they did n't even care . unacceptable treatment for a $ 200+++ meal .	4113
0	the hostess was very rude and she made it seem like it was an inconvinence to seat us when there was less then half the tables were full . service was slow , we waited over an hour to get our food and it was sub par . the waitress seemed tired and didnt really want to be around people that night .	4113
0	addendum to my earlier review - i did say that i would be able to give a more meaningful review on my second visit when i am actually sober . i would like to retract that . after finding out that social house messed up a reservation that i made for my bffl 's birthday dinner , thankfully a couple of days before the actual dinner , i doubt i would ever see the inside of social house again . we 're going to nobu instead .	4113
0	one of the worst place i have ever been to . the waiter upsale everything . they dont know the menu . they dont know what the sakes taste like . if you like good sushi dont go here at all . the miso cod , was cold and undercooked . the tarte-tarte was bland . actually , most of the food was very bland . cocktails are under poured . i wish , i had something postive to say but even the music sucked . i would never go back there ever again . the buffe was 4 star at ti compared to this place .	4113
0	the food is mediocre for the price . the service is continually the worst i have ever experienced . i keep giving this place chance after chance but i officially think they do n't care about making money or customer service . what happened this last visit was after sitting down and ordering they told me their credit card system was down and i would have to pay cash or room charge of which i had neither -- so they took my meal away before i could touch it and i left . i was appalled .	4113
0	make sure you eat a meal before you go . sushi was excellent . we got the $ 95 per person chefs choice . we received 7 courses of one piece of food each . everyone left hungry even after we complained to the waitress about the lack of food .	4113
0	the food was good but i do n't think its worth the price . suchi was good i loved the lobster roll but again its not filling and costs too much . the jalapeno yellowtail lived up to its hype but i would n't pay that price for it again .	4113
0	we were staying at the cosmopolitan and searched for a sushi place nearby , this place caught my eye because of the reviews , once we got there our waiter seemed to be in a bad mood , every small request seemed like such a burden , their menu changes for dinner and would not go again just because of their service , the bus boy was nicer than the waiter .	4113
0	this restaurant is probably a fun place to hang out but just do n't come here for the food if you expect authentic japanese style sushi . this place serves very mediocre american style sushi where the cut of the fish and the flavor of the rice is completely off . buying high quality sushi-grade fish is the easy part and should be a given but the price of the sushi here i would have expected something a lot better ...	4113
0	this place is just okay . it 's quite a bit of money for fairly underwhelming food . the staff seem a bit aloof as well . if you 're looking for authentic japanese , venture off the strip to raku ( but make reservations though ) .	4113
0	careful with your check . they will get your order right but the charge will charge you higher than what the menu says . our bartender just gave us a classic cucumber saketini and charge us for a white lotus lycheetini . and gave us the lame excuse that because everyone has been asking for the white lotus she made the mistake to charge us that . be smart , check your receipt ! ! ! ! !	4113
0	other than the name of this place during hh , nothing is more fitting than the name of the `` angry tuna '' roll . yes , you too will be angry as your body attempts to metabolizes this item . rice was overcooked and the tuna was nothing special . if you 're not sure what that means , go to your local kroger 's or safeway and get market rte sushi . if you do come here ( due to some drunk stupor , or you were coerced by your family ) , order the miso cod .	4113
0	very pricey . i would have rather gone to a buffet . you will leave here hungry thats forsure . the yellowtail the waiter kept raving about , was very good . but thats about it.and i wouldnt pay $ 25 for it again .	4113
0	the worse sushi we 've ever had in our lives . pretentious and syrupy service . extremely over priced for tiny portions . when we complained that the sushi was horrible , the manager took away our food and brought us something else of his choosing . we do n't even like spicy tuna and it was full of it . he said because some magazine said it was great , if we did n't like it then it must be us because it could n't be them . how presumptuous ! it was still nasty and he did n't even adjust our bill . we paid over $ 100 and left hungry because we never got to eat . i will never go there again .	4113
0	lunch special good menu except sushi ( spicy tuna ) was disappointing as too chewy and fishy like . also $ 14 bloody mary mostly ice and served on a narrow glass . been here a few times in the past and seems to not be the same experience as before . too many other choices on the strip , but will try again 1x time in the future . good location though .	4113
0	do not waste your time , and money . there are so many restaurants here on the strip , why waste your experience here . the food is lousy . presentation is presentable but no where near as nice as even some simple cafés around . service was great , because no one was in there . except you had to wait until 930 to make a reservation . this made me think it was a lucky advantage to get a table since there were very few openings . so i was shocked to arrive and no one was in there yet we were n't able to make an earlier reservation .	4113
0	cheesecake factory : grand luxe sushi roku : social house kind of , but not quite . but for all those who worship sushi roku , this is the glamorized version . food is not great , fish is n't that fresh , and it 's damn expensive . stars are for ambiance only . so not worth it .	4113
0	stopped over to this japanese when we avoided the oceans because of high prices . the food is so , so and definitely bad value for the money . i ordered the cod fish . and it came with just the cod fish on an ordinary white round plate..that it ! ! for $ 29 ! ! my date ordered the brazinio..and it only have 4 flakes ... we took 2 more rolls to fill our tummy . we regretted stopped here , and wish we get into ocean instead . at least i get my fill of beef for a high price ... . the place became noisy after 50 guests turned up..	4113
0	do n't waste your money ! ! completely over priced and bad quality as well . i expected better from a restaurant in city center . shiybu at mgm is way better !	4113
0	i live upstairs at and within citycenter ! do not go here ! i call down for a simple take out -- -yes ... a service they say they provide ... .yet we were refused service ! all we requested was for two simple rolls , yet their manager decided that they were too busy to provide service to a regular customer who is an mgm m-life platinum member ! ! ! ! loved their food and service ... .before ... .now , i regret ever tipping so generously and they will never get my business again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4113
1	i love this location although they do n't always have what i need . they are pet friendly ! that is a plus	4114
1	ordered a grill . it took a long time to get it and it did n't work properly . however jonathan did a great job making sure any issues were taken care of . new grill . what matters is the actions a company takes and if they solve the problem . jonathan did a great job . i will be back .	4114
1	they are pet friendly ... .a very progressive store	4114
0	lowes finds a way to make your project way more complicated than it needs to be and then charges you for this service . for example , if you order a granite counter top through lowes , you will need to become the gc of this project and schedule separately with the countertop installer and the plumber . by contrast , if you just called up lowes countertop contractor , sims and loeman , they would send a crew out to your house and schedule a plumber to be there when they need him . way simpler and costs less .	4114
0	it is ridiculous . $ 450 to replace a water heater that broke just after a year and a half . not our fault it crapped out but we are being punished for it . and it was still well under warranty . heads up before buying at lowes !	4114
0	this has to be the worst lowes i 've ever been in ! totally clueless about customer service . slowest checkout lines i 've seen . a smile now and then would be nice too .	4114
1	shoutout to **amna f** for the recommendation.i wo n't be writing a full on review but this place is definitely a hole in the wall.had halwa puri togo'ed-it was greasy and delicious just how it should be . this place reminded me of karachi 's halwa puri especially the runny cholay curry.i need to try more of their dishes.i will be visiting this place again !	4115
1	this is located in a shopping mall food court , food was n't bad at all , absolutely loved their butter chicken and naans , only complaint we had was the food court table and chair , wish they could be cleaned !	4115
1	halwa poori is the top .. truly pakistani , and that too from karachi .. the best that you can have in ontario .. nihari , paaye , kebabs are good but there are better ones too . the place is a food court of a random mall , but if you can avoid the rush hours , then it is certainly convenient and enjoyable to have the halwa poori piping hot .	4115
1	this is place is in the food court of a sketchy mall , there is nothing wrong with the mall , it 's just not your usual mall . i would say tabaq is the best compared to the rest . i have tried a couple of curry dishes and haleem has been my favorite . the food is spicy , and it is served with freshly baked naan , pop , and a side salad . naan is $ 1.50 and it 's worth getting two .	4115
1	best butter chicken in the gta hands down ! if you have n't had it yet - you have n't tasted butter chicken yet . i salivate as i think of it . no joke .	4115
1	the food is great here but on the weekends the line up is ridiculous . however the quality of the food makes up for the amount of time spent in ordering and waiting for the food to arrive . it really has the home cook taste .	4115
0	i give a 2 star for the food . for the location , i would give a 1 . this is not a restaurant . do not go here with family or think that you would get service and a table . this is in the food court of a small shopping center and it 's like a hole in the wall . the food here is oily and ok but nothing special . meh !	4115
0	horrible customer service . ladies on the cash register are pretty dumb and really have language barrier . the place is very dirty . no one uses gloves . naans are burnt , chicken biryani is horrible with no flavour or marination . they serve rotten salad .	4115
0	the worst chicken biryani that i have ever had ! the meat was just boiled pcs . of chicken with absolutely no marination or flavour . very unhygienicand no one uses kitchen gloves ... my 1st and the last visit . avoid at all costs .	4115
0	there used to be a time when jamil and co the owners were courteous and hospitable and the food was good.now things have taken a turn for the worse , with an exception of mrs.jamil personally present there , the other staff that includes jamil 's own sister who is extremely nasty to the customers , the staff is over worked and underpaid.always frowning at customers.no hygiene.stale food.many times i bought sabzi and by the time i reached home in 20 minutes , it went bad.i told them and they are not willing to take liability.very discourteous and rude staff which is predominantly their own family members.just peep into the kitchen area and see for yourself the condition of cleanliness .	4115
0	i would not ho to this place it is horrible . they location i 'd in a basement of an old plaza . the are too crowded in a small kitchen with 20 people and nasty food with okay price . i had to throw my food and leave .	4115
0	terrible overall experience here . waited over an hour for our order , only to then discover they had completely forgotten about us . then we finally got our food and it was easily the worst indian/pakistani food we 've ever eaten . ordered the biryani , nihari and butter chicken from here and it was all just completely tasteless . the place was very busy , so i 'm not sure if there 's at least one dish there worth trying , but surely we make much better food at home out of all the dishes we tasted from this restaurant .	4115
1	service was very friendly here , cashier very thoughtful we had the coupon for buy one get one free sandwich and we got a whopper and veggies . he did the most expensive one for free . food is great and fast . will come back again ! !	4116
1	when you compare it to the mcdonald 's across the street , the service is way better . only thing these guys do wrong is they have whoppers sitting around under a heater on wednesday , far too many imo . it 's fine to have a few whoppers premade for the lunch rush but it feels like these guys just make a mountain in the morning and call it a day . still tho . whopper wednesday .	4116
0	lots of attitude from the woman working at the drive through on thursday march 23rd . do n't like your job ? get another one . the miserable attitude carries out .	4116
0	absolutely filthy . sticky from the ceilings to the floor . long wait . would have left if i were alone .	4116
1	just moved to a new apartment last weekend , and skinny wimp moving made it about as painless as it could be . the three skinny wimp movers , noah , allen and mark , did a great job . these guys are not skinny and not wimps - they hustled the whole time and were efficient and courteous . highly recommended .	4117
1	the movers at skinny wimp were amazing . efficient , friendly , and prepared with lots of supplies to protect our furniture . allen and gabe were a pleasure , working quickly and carefully , even in 120 degree weather .	4117
1	my experience with this company has convinced me that i will never move w/o using movers again ! cameron and jahan were extremely professional and super speedy - they were also committed to getting as much of my stuff into the truck as possible . i assumed since i was paying by the hour , that they would try to squeeze out every minute , but they literally ran to and from the truck . everything arrived at our new house in the same condition as it left . without them , i would probably still be trying to get all of the stuff out of my house and none of it would have made it upstairs . would highly recommend .	4117
1	my friendals needed a move and these guys were local . they were definitley worth the call , they are very friendly and are very friendly . will use them againan refer them if i have any friends who need a move	4117
1	great service and great attitude . these guys were quick and kept busy . jason and damon took good care of everything and did a good job disassembling and reassembling my ikea bed frame . i heard of these guys through a friend and i 'd definitely use them again next time .	4117
1	these guys were great ! they were efficient , professional , and courteous . also , the price was right , especially with the groupon they currently have . i recommend them , and would definitely use them again in the future !	4117
1	super happy with skinny wimp . they got everything done in an hour an a half and took away all of the stress from moving . i highly recommend them !	4117
1	i hired 3 guys to help me move and they were friendly and efficient . they prioritized the heavier-expensive items that i asked them to first and were very careful . i will definitively use this company again .	4117
1	this was my first big move and i was very happy with having the skinny wimp company move my things . the two guys were courteous and efficeint . they helped me box things and fit all of it into a storage unit . i would recommend them to others .	4117
1	second time using this company and i will still recommend them to anyone . fast , friendly and affordable . devon and cornelius were funny and fast . moises helped out in the beginning and was very polite and professional . thanks for a great experience !	4117
1	i recently used skinny wimp moving . i saw them on groupon and then after reading their reviews i decided to use them for my move . they were arrived right on time and the 3 guys ( allen , cesar and marco ) were great to work with . they moved everything very quickly and were very respectful and courteous to me and all of my belongings . the office was also very easy to work with as far as setting up a time and payment . i will be using them again .	4117
0	no better than any other moving company . claimed to be full service , i was told on the phone that they could dismount my tv and move it but when the movers got there they said they have never taken a down before which lead to the rocket scientist trying and breaking my 2500.00 that i have yet to here anything from the complaint i filed . i 've had these guys and two men in a truck and it 's the exact same service . oh , they were 45 minutes late on arrival .	4117
0	we used this company for moving between our old and new homes , with storage of our items for one week . the movers were nice kids , and very efficient . however , after settling in to our new home , we realized we were missing one of our televisions and a desk chair . upon contacting the company , we were told by jenny that the movers are claiming they asked me about the chair and i told them it was n't our chair . we were not given an explanation for the missing television . be warned , they will misplace your items and assume no responsibility for them !	4117
0	the guys that moved my stuff were nice enough ... but , almost every piece of wood furniture has been scuffed , scratched or even dented in . my bedroom furniture is almost brand new and now looks used and worn . the movers did not have enough blankets or plastic wrap to protect my belongings . i 'm very disappointed	4117
0	everything with skinny wimp went great , until 1 hour before my 10am move was scheduled to begin , i received a call from their `` customer service '' person who informed me they did n't have a driver avaialble and my move would have to take place at 2-5pm . well for those of us who work , have kids , have appointments , and made specific arrangements at 2 locations to make this work , that just does n't fly . so if you want a reliable mover who will show up when they say they will , i suggest you take a hard pass on skinny wimp losers . talk about leaving someone hanging out to dry .	4117
0	i purchased a groupon for two hours of moving services for $ 199 . what 's not noted anywhere in the groupon is the $ 149 they charge to drive from tempe to central phoenix . sorry guys , but saying `` additional fees may apply '' in your groupon is not the same as stating that you charge an additional $ 149 service fee to all customers . that nearly doubles the cost . what 's the point of the groupon at this point ? what a scam .	4117
0	two guys worked hard , other one spent the most time on the phone . called to say they would be there in 45-1hr showed up almost two hours later . the price almost doubled at the end . i felt like i was out working the pace of the guys i was paying to move . slammed a couch into the front door and lost a piece to the bottom of one of the dressers , found additional things broken after they left , plates , couch leg ect . guys were nice enough people and the two worked hard , but overall the experience was not great . called and left msg . never got a phone call back .	4117
0	very disappointed in skinny wimps . i 'll never use them again , and i do not recommend them . i had small one bedroom and move to another one bed room and charger me 3 hours , they took for ever and didnt take all of the plastic my stuff and bed was not put together right	4117
0	omg do not hire these people ! ! ! bait and switch on pricing ... told 1 rate when scheduled ... movers took their sweet time , phone calls , breaks ... no moving dollies , no furniture dollies ... said they would be there in an hour ... waited 2 1/2 hours ... .what was supposed to take 2 hours should n't have taken 4 1/2 hours..this was a simple 1 bedroom move ... .father 's day plans ruined was just the cherry on top ... .buyer beware ! ! ! !	4117
0	unbelievable ! my friend loses a ps4 , probably in the way truck going to storage place !	4117
0	this was the worst moving company and unprofessional people i ever had to deal with take got to our house late did n't bring their tolls to dissemble the beds we had to do that for them then they broke my son 's entertainment center , they put a big deep scratch in my new dining room table trying to get it out they got lost kidding to my new house then they scraped up my brand new front door of our home taking out some of the stucco on it of the wall put scratch marks all up my wall from upstairs then charged me extra because they could n't get the beds together . i would n't give them any stars	4117
0	my furniture was damaged by their mover during the unloading process . and nobody picks up the phone .	4117
1	stop for some ready to eat cuban food . they have a buffet line for $ 5.99 a pound . was pretty good no complaints ! ! they had like four different kinds of meats , three different kinds of rice , two different kinds of beans , two different kinds of fried bananas , fried fish and a few other things . also fresh fruit and salad . they also have combination plates if you do not want the buffet line .	4118
1	easy to navigate with low prices ! i recommend you shop here for the veggies ! the prices are way lower than the bigger chains like vons and smart & final . will be shopping here again next time i get a chance . also , as a huge plus , there is a 99 cent store on the same lot !	4118
1	i was impressed how delicious their pastelitos de guayaba..wow ! and their croquetas are very good too !	4118
1	great service and quality meats . i only speak english and they were very helpful on how to cook some things properly . sketchy crowd in . store other wise a 5 star .	4118
1	every time i come here it 's organized and nice . everyone is always friendly the fruits and vegetables are organized and never to many people in line to pay . but i had the pleasure to speak yamina she was my cashier . she was extremely nice very friendly and gave a a tip on what i can drink instead of milk because i hate it . and she had a huge smile with everyone she helped made me feel welcomed . i will be going here from now on .	4118
1	a typical mexican/hispanic market , you will find fresh produce and meats , great marinades and exotic/imported spices in this place . i came here for a pork roast and found not only a nice pork shoulder , but also great customer service . the guys behind the meat counter were welcoming of my questions and requests to cut the extra fat off the shoulder and did it in no time . a few of the things you can find at this place are : * malta ( venezuelan drink ) * frozen fruit pulp * marinated meats ( fajita , grilling , etc ) * harina pan ( venezuelan/colombian cornmeal ) * lots of goya products definitely drop by and check this place out !	4118
1	i am brazilian and i love to find latin foods here . they have good service and price . the fruits and veggies are fresh ! i particularly love their ceviche . they are far away from mountain 's edge , but it worths to drive there .	4118
1	first time coming here . saw they had cuban sandwiches and being from florida , i had to try . i would have to say it was pretty damn good . bread was hot and crisp , a light spread of mustard just how i like it and the pork , damn ! the pork made the sandwich . i hope it 's consistent with they make it because i 'll definitely be back	4118
0	no stars for this business ! i bought 2lbs of chicken and its smells rotten and faul ... i called to speak to the manager , still waiting . i will not be purchasing here no more . health department needs to inspect this place .	4118
0	kitchen or restaurant part .. i was there early today i order a cuban sandwiches i ask how was made ... hard questions for me to ask ... well ask no pickles very clear ... . but like i was saying in chinese ... the put pickles the meat was cold bread was not fresh like was made yesterday ... .. the have a lunch buffet by the pound the meats was good but the tortillas ready almost went my wife and i finished her meal i will have to eat my sandwiche letter at home ... lol	4118
0	the store overall is a 5 star for but the meat section needs to step their game up . i went to buy milanesa and when i got home the meat was nothing like what i had ordered . they gave me a meat that looks like diesmillo when i payed for milanesa . i was very upset once i got home . i will still shop here i 'm just going to get my meat somewhere else	4118
0	be wary of the pre-packaged food you buy here ! the `` springfield pinto beans '' we purchased was 6 months past due and had a whole bunch of ( live ) bugs inside the bag . this was n't the first time we had this issue but we still had the receipt since we purchased it the previous night . check the expiration date ! caution : pictures attached are gross !	4118
0	this place just keeps getting worst and worst to me . not so much the service , but the customers . in the summer it was great , but now every single time i go in there , it 's like the customers do n't know how to add as they shop . every time , i have to wait 10mins for the cashier to ring up 80 things , and another 10 for her to take off 60items , because the customer only has $ 20 . i 'm so over having to deal with people that ca n't count .	4118
0	i went into this store because i wanted to make some great homemade carne . my husband and i were not treated very well at all , the prices were great though , and they have a wide variety , that is why i gave it a two star . i just did not appriceiate how we were treated by the employees that were working here . i will not go back i will be going down the street to marianas from now on .	4118
0	horrible experience . i was ashamed to call myself cuban after walking out of here . the hot food counter was literally disgusting : burnt beans , stale rice , melted plastic utensils , dirty dish rags . the service was terrible as well and when we asked to speak to a manager he was a total joke and could care less . do not shop or eat here !	4118
0	convinced their chicken is gmo or it contains way too many hormones because it was almost hard once it was cooked . i initially thought it may had been undercooked but it was n't . i would go back for more peruvian products but will never buy any meats or poultry from here .	4118
1	hello celebrity staff , i just wanted to let you know that we had a great experience last weekend on one of your party bus . it was awesome ! your staff are so professional despite of all the changes that we made . your driver brenda is the best ! she definitely went out of her way to make our event fantastic ! thank you .	4119
1	we used celebrity coaches of america for our wedding on october 13th , 2014 ! as soon as i booked online , they called me twice , once to get more details and 2nd time ( the day of ) to confirm our reservation ! we needed transportation from our hotel , to the wedding chapel ( vegas weddings ) to the cocktail reception . i paid for 2 hours . the price was very reasonable , i actually did their online special ! no hidden fees ! driver was on time and very professional ! ! i would recommend celebrity coaches of america if you need transportation in vegas ! ! than you again ! !	4119
0	bad service and left out in the heat ! 118 degrees , and broken ac unit , replaced with another broken bus with a door that would not open . then left on the curb to find our own way home . i recommend you keep looking for another company or just take a taxi .	4119
0	i would like to report an incident that happened to me this morning . a bus pulled out right in front of me this morning almost causing an accident . when i rolled down my window at the stop light , i told the driver are you serious doing that kind of stunt and he started to use profanity towards me so i rolled up my window and decided to report this driver to the company . the incident occurred just right out of the 777 casino on paradise . this driver should not have this type of job especially if he is putting others in danger . i am beyond upset at the moment .	4119
1	i have an earlier review regarding rescue one air which was n't very flattering . i amended that after the owner , jason , resolved the problem and really went above and beyond . this is someone who truly cares about his customers and his business ' reputation . please be assured that if you have a problem with your service , jason will make it right ! i would n't hesitate to recommend them and we will be using them again .	4120
1	i just had austin come check my ac-and heater . he was awesome ! i actually learned a few things today he took pictures and video of how my ac and heater is working and explained precisely how well they are working and what i needed to be aware of for future maintenance . i highly recommend this company ! austin was extremely knowledgeable about everything and anything to do with heating and ac units . he even helped me with my home warranty . i could n't ask for better service !	4120
1	very professional and personable service by thomas . he explained everything and did n't talk us into any service that did n't make sense for our needs . signed up for their 10 year service plan . very affordable and is a no brained to get . would highly recommend this company and ask for thomas .	4120
1	we have had the best service . yesterday our air conditioning took a turn for the worst and needed repair immediately . we do have a service contract with this company and are very pleased . last night our hero was david shugart . he not only got us up and running quickly but was so awesome with his professional customer service . it was great to talk to him as if we 've known him for years . he not only was prompt but he saved us in a fortune of cost . from now on any service we have done with this company we will request david for sure . thanks for saving us from this horrible heat . you rock ! !	4120
0	called me to solicit my business during dinner time , and despite the fact that i 'm on the do not call list . when i pointed that fact out ( granted , a little less nicely than necessary ) , i was responded to with a rude , `` well , the system is not infallible . '' no apology to be found . even if i was looking for someone to do my air or heating , at this point i would consider literally anyone before rescue one .	4120
0	continue to cold call me to try and have my a/c serviced . i 've asked to be removed from their call list and continue to be harassed . i 've never solicited them for any type of service and find it very unprofessional to essentially perform as a telemarketer to drum up business .	4120
0	i received a sales call on 9/26/2016 at 11:33am . i informed the rescue one air representative that i am part of the national do not call registry . the rescue one air representative became argumentative about the accuracy of the registry and informed me that rescue one air has signed many clients who were on the registry . i asked to be removed from the list and not contacted again . the recue one air representative became even more rude and told me that it would not matter and hung up on me . if this is how rescue one employees conduct themselves , i would advise others to look elsewhere .	4120
0	do not use this company . very unprofessional ass clowns . they call me numerous times per week to solicit business . they 're breaking the law bc i 've asked them to put me on the no call list , and i get mocked then hung up on . rude .	4120
1	excellent new restaurant ! unusual and tasty food . i 'm so glad my girlfriend suggested this . thank you .	4121
1	excellent vegan food . i ordered the buckwheat bowl and it was just perfect . super healthy and super delicious . excellent mix of vegetables and legume to make a very satisfying dish . other people in other party had the quinoa and couscous bowls and were also very happy . tho , i will would go back for my choice of buckwheat bowl : - )	4121
1	loved the hamachi carpaccio - terrific lite dinner with the super flavorful chicken broth ! new decor and more seating . great service . definitely make a trip to plate & bowl .	4121
0	what 's the concept ? use apteka as a baseline for the quality and price point of your food . shorten the size of your menu , make the focus of the menu meaningful , and perfect whatever your concept is . the whole earthy to be earthy idea never got me anywhere . how do you serve `` bowls '' with perogies on a plate being in the same category ? hope you reopen with a better plan . this spot deserves something special !	4121
0	got a phone call a few hours before going there with a party of 8 that the whole menu had changed and that they now had only a few ramen bowls . no more information etc . so unprofessional	4121
0	we went there last week and they have changed everything from their original menu to cut costs . and they have n't updated it on their website . they now only have 5-6 options to choose from . so the only option we had was noodles and they were canned ramen noodles without any flavor for $ 13 each . if you change the menu atleast update the website so that people can decide to go or not . the food did n't taste good either and as others said waitress was very busy on phone .	4121
1	the pizza is great ( much improved from when they opened ) and they use great ingredients . give pizza antica a try . it is worth it . informal and warm environment . great if you have kids !	4122
1	i like this pizza ! i 've told all my friends about this place . nothing fancy but very clean and upbeat ! phenominal tasting pizza with the best crust i 've ever tasted . very fresh ingredients . my new go-to place . thanks !	4122
1	this place has the best pizza i 've ever tried . the flavor , ingredients , and the way they make the pizza is amazing . the service is great and the price too for the quality of the pizza . highly recommend .	4122
1	this is the place to go for authentic italian wood-fired pizza . the ingredients are fresh and you can tell the owners are really passionate about the food they make . the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and the pizzas come out fast ! i highly recommend stopping in and getting the best pizza you 'll find in champaign .	4122
1	we are really enjoying having this restaurant added to the cu scene . only way better for us would be to have it in urbana ! ! have been there at least 4 times since opened . love the pizzas , the salads and the people !	4122
1	fine artisan pizza right here in champaign . nice service , great crust and interesting fixings .	4122
1	non-midwestern pizza - eurostyle emphasizing flavor not calories . fast service : 800 degree oven will do that for you . super good antipasti and salads . good wait-staff . simple menu . bad : no draft beer in a town with good breweries and around the corner from the pig .	4122
1	really delicious pizza . had the diavolo , which was spicy but bright and not overwhelming . the crust was chewy and firm and delicious with just the right amount of char . the pizzas are not cheap , but the quality is enough to justify the price . ordered at the front , and had my pizza within 5 minutes . definitely recommend .	4122
1	i 'm picky on pizza ... this is fantastic italian-style pizza with quality ingredients . i will be back . there is no equal in cmi for this style of pizza .	4122
1	no line when we got here , but a few people sitting at tables inside . ordering was easy , and we sat down at a half table half booth near the front . they are going for the industrial feel with cement floors and a brick wall . food took 35 minutes to come out . one pizza was enough for 2 , but if you 're hungry , count on eating your own . i agree with other commentors about the `` drizzle '' of oil on top ... too much .	4122
1	pizza is pretty good , italian sodas were great ! it 's very authentic italian crust/sauce . service was good .	4122
1	the poker group approves . nice ambiance , old world smell , wood fired pizza , no tipping policy . we will return . we felt like we were in either brooklyn or italy . nice urban industrial feel .	4122
0	try dragonfire ! ! ! cheese here is good , creamy and fresh ... pizza not cooked ( broke my 3 strike rule and still could not get it right ) .	4122
0	the pizza was good but prices were too high . no service at all and we did n't even eat on plates they give you parchment paper .	4122
0	pizza was good , but felt over priced for what you received . the service was lackluster . it was not busy yet our waiter did not find time to check on us throughout the meal . we had to wait a long time for the bill . then it was frustrating because we could n't just hand him a credit card and pay when we finally received the check . instead we went to the front register and stood . again , the restaurant was not crowded , but it took our waiter 5 minutes to come to the register . i would rather go to blaze pizza and receive a similar product for less than half the price . will not return .	4122
0	my family and i went to this place last week . ambience was good and the antipasti was good but the margherita pizza was dripping with extra water . vegan pizza ordered lacked flavor hence not worth the money .	4122
0	overpriced . undercooked . looked like cooks threw handful of uncooked arugula on top of soggy , sauce-less crust .	4122
0	they never listen to any request of how you want your pizza . service is slow , the pizza is decent only if you order there and it comes out at a reasonable time , when will you guys cook my pizza well done the way i ask ?	4122
0	never even got to try the pizza . they would n't sell me a pizza to go . who opens a pizza place and does n't sell pizza to go ? with two giant beer gardens right next door to them , you 'd figure they would want to be delivering pizzas right to the beer gardens ! nope . they just want to be snooty . smart business plan !	4122
0	i 've been here twice , and each time was impressed with the level of sogginess and tastelessness of the pizza ! i like a crispy pizza with salty cheese ... .the crust on my margherita pizza here was blackened on the underside , and uncooked on the top . proved for a messy and unsatisfying eating experience . also , service was slow and unattentive , but the ambience was great ! if you take my review for a grain of salt and decide to come here , make sure you sprinkle it on top of whatever pizza you order ! ( it 'll definitely need the extra flavor ) .	4122
0	good pizza . that aside , it 's too pricey for the champaign market and they close at 9 which is a terrible idea in that bar centric area . also the hostess is to be frank , just rude . it 's not pizza hut , really ?	4122
0	i was excited to try pizzeria antica , but unfortunately their iteration of margherita pizza was paper thin , soggy ( nearly sopping wet and disintegrating in the center ) , and the top was somehow incredibly dry and bland . service was apathetic at best . it 's a shame , because they have a great space .	4122
0	cons : over promise , under deliver . way over priced . pizza tastes good , but falls apart . `` gourmet '' ingredients , but very very sparing . pros : nice music . the pizza came out fast . oh , and i was brought here with someone else paying .	4122
0	do n't call for carryout - they wo n't do that ( `` would n't be hot enough '' or some crap like that . ) maybe these hipsters ' pizza is any good , but given their authentically twee business model , i wo n't be finding out !	4122
1	i love these shoes .. and the sales ! ! .. always take care of your feet ladies and gents .. north premium outlets is where it 's at .. friendliest staff by far out of all of them in the valley ... thank you guys ! !	4123
1	this store is always part of my repertoire when at fashion show mall . men 's and woman 's shoes found here . love the trendy fashionable variety of platform shoes , boots and sandals . i also like the accessories like jewelry , hats , sunglasses and handbags . i almost always find something here . prices very reasonable and the the shoes always fit like a glove . i bought some sparkly `` toms-like '' shoes here . they did n't have my size so they ordered them and they were shipped to home for free .	4123
1	aldo has the greatest shoes ! its so addicting ! : ) the latest styles and reasonable prices ! i 've bought at least 5 pairs of `` i-can't-live-without '' shoes this month and i 'm sure i will be returning for more . this location is the nicest one in las vegas !	4123
1	i went in to try on some flats and they did n't have my size . they ordered them to be shipped to my house . they arrived in 3 days but they were the wrong size . so 1 star for the shipping dept . but 4 stars for the service at this store . so now i have to go back to the store and either return them or go to a store where they have my size . when i called they said they had a few in my size at the aldo at the premium outlets . do you think i want to go on black friday weekend to that clusterxxxx ? total inconvenience !	4123
0	wow ... ..i have never seen worse customer service . they clearly do n't stand by thier merchandise or care about how they treat there customers . called them to get a hardly worn pair of shoes fixed . they seemed extremely bothered when over a week later i called them to find out the whereabouts of my $ 100 shoes and what was happening to them . they were never sent out to be fixed and no one had called me . i ended up going in and taking them back . i got them fixed else where and with a lot less attitude . shop there but once they have your money , do n't expect them to help you any further !	4123
0	no one picks up the phone ? i had a ordered shipped to the store . calling to confirm its ready . phone just keeps ringing and ringing and ringing . every hour of the day . ca n't be that busy . crappy service . ca n't even pick up the phone . here let me give my business to some other store .	4123
0	getting service picking out shoes was great but the line took triple the time . it does n't seem as if the cashiers know how to get the line moving . horrible service . beware when shopping here	4123
0	this aldo location has the worst sales associate i think i have ever dealt with . if shopping here avoid the tall girl with long dark hair . horrible is an understatement !	4123
1	amazingly professional & compassionate staff . we recently lost an animal member of the family , and i was pleasantly surprised today with a follow up hand written sympathy card personalized and singed by the whole group . thank you !	4124
1	we 've been to a couple different veterinarians in the past and always felt like they were n't getting to the heart of the problem . animal medical center of chandler was great ! they were clear decisive and thorough . they had are dog healthy again in no time , without breaking the bank . i ca n't imagine going to anyone else .	4124
0	this place is interested in one thing $ $ $ $ $ . was a loyal customer for years . over time , with a little success , like a few other places they became consumed with money . they will always try to up- sale . pay attention . go to riggs road or chandlergilbert or kennel care .	4124
0	i have been taking my 10 year old cat here for a few years now . the staff is great - the doctors are great - but their pricing for dental cleanings is a joke . i paid around $ 500 last year for his dental cleaning which i thought was high . a couple months ago i took him in for an evaluation - they quoted me $ 800 - $ 1200 for a dental cleaning ! that is ridiculous ! i left that practice , found another reputable vet ( that has state of the art equipment like this place ) and paid $ 230 for his cleaning . i ca n't believe how they are taking advantage of pet owners .	4124
1	this place is awesome . they have $ 2.75 ( pay with cash in advance ) drop off dry cleaning . - drop off by 9am and pick up same day by 4pm - friendly cashier that explained the process to me ( i did n't really need that but it was a nice touch ) . - got my white blazer back and it still had a tiny little stain on it , but they attached a not stating they could n't remove it without damaging the fabric . also a nice touch so i know they tried , and it was not overlooked . this is my new go to dry cleaner .	4125
1	we have used regal for several years and they have never had a lost item . staff is always friendly . a very good value for your money . dry cleaning is normally ready at least 2 hours before there deadline .	4125
1	ca n't really say anything that has n't already been said . in by 9 , ready by 4 . dry cleaning is $ 3 a piece , everything is cash only . i 've been really happy with the quality of their work and the condition of the items that were returned to me . this place is always busy and people waiting are fond of saying things like , `` i 've been coming here for 20 years ! '' `` this place is an institution ! ''	4125
1	overall , i am pretty satisfied with this place . it really is by far the least expensive place to get things cleaned that i have found in town . they do a really decent job , i have only been unhappy with 2 suits i had cleaned . i use dry cleaners alot due to my work , and my husbands work . he is always happy with how they clean his shirts . do n't forget to bring cash . they do not take credit cards . on the few times i do n't go with my cash , there is an atm right there ... but that costs you too !	4125
1	i like how honest this place is . i took my $ 400 dress that had some beading around the neckline . they told me there was a chance that the beads would melt with their process and recommend a place down the street . i 'm so glad they at least gave me an option instead of ruining my dress . they did a great job on my pendleton blanket too . they only take cash but they do have an atm and only charge $ 3 a garment	4125
1	as good as it gets ! i 've tried dry cleaners for the last 15 years and finally found the one that is professional , friendly and accommodating . they 're open 7am until 7pm monday through saturday so i can drop off on my way to work and pick up the same day ( in before 9am cutoff ) on my way home . the staff is friendly and very helpful and my clothes are the cleanest they have ever been .	4125
1	i ca n't say enough good things about this dry cleaners . you have to have cash to pay in advance . if you forget , they have a atm . the prices are fantastic and they have done a fantastic job dry cleaning my clothes . the young ladies who work at the counter at very nice , too the point and get you in and out with out any problems . the parking can be challenging but i 've ben able to work with it .	4125
1	this is my go to `` everyday '' cleaners . it 's convenient and low cost for my work shirts . they do a decent job on cashmere sweaters too , remind them to fold and not hang them though .	4125
1	i am surprised at myself for not writing a review before now . i thought i had . so sorry to regals . this place has been great since day one . everything they clean here is fantastic . they do an excellant job and the price is right . they staff is always pleasent . i do not think i have ever had a bad time here . shows you someone knows how to do business . cash or check for all work and you pre pay , closed on sunday .	4125
0	cash only . lame ! , it was for work with a credit card . i guess they just losses out on $ 100.00 in business	4125
0	it 's 2015 . only taking cash/check is ridiculous . i do n't care if they sing to each one of my garments as they clean and press them , it 's a total inconvenience to their customers to not take debit/credit as a payment . there are so many options for businesses , even those that do n't want to pay high rates to credit card companies .	4125
0	it 's 2015 , what legit business only takes cash or checks ? who carries that with them anymore ? i 'll take my business elsewhere .	4125
0	i went this place and trust them to dry clean my nice brand shirt and when i pick it up they are still dirty around the nickline and all wet and wrinkled and this place only take cash they will not take credit card , is not everybody carry cash anymore ! to the owner this place wake and pay a credit card machine like everybody !	4125
0	they are the worst . they have ruined several black pants by using irons that are too hot . this week they ruined a white shirt & white jacket . both items now have unexplained yellow staining that they will not accept responsibility for . the 2.75 is misleading since it costs a lot more to replace ruined items . avoid this place !	4125
0	i been coming to this cleaner twice a month and for 3 months that six visit they never get the job done right , clothes is wet , collar is still dirty , wrinkled , i think i give them a lot of chance to get the job done ! but it never happen ! there is lots of dry cleaner out there to try and who can get the job done right , wont come back here again !	4125
0	walked in 10 minutes ago . refused to do same day cleaning . have been coming here for at least five years . never again .	4125
0	yes ... the cash only thing really sucks but the prices are low . it 's also very busy and often you have to wait in line and no matter how many times i go there they never remember the name . or is it they pretend to not know your name ? i get that a lot ! and if you 're pro-nwo this is the place to go !	4125
0	my first time here , i got 2 skirts and two dresses dry-cleaned . one dress came back with a hole in it , which it did not have before , and the other dress not only came back with a stain still on it , but the armpits are shredded ! the fabric around the armholes are all torn . do not go here . extremely careless and are now not picking up their phone .	4125
1	staff was friendly , food was good , restaraunt was clean and beautiful ! ! simple place , you could tell they care for it their . i came on a solo-date ( treat yoself ? ? ) and had a good time , their thai tea tastes kind of funky but that 's about the only complain i have . it was n't bad just 'off '	4126
1	this is the best chinese restaurant in summerlin . the dim sum is made fresh on demand . however the menu has all of the traditional chinese dishes . you must go and try the dim sum , shrimp fried rice , mongolian beef , eggplant , vegetable egg rolls , etc great service and outstanding fresh ingredients = a great dining experience i have to add to this review . everything is fresh and delicious . you can carry out or eat in . you must try this restaurant	4126

1	although we did take-out this time , service was still good . there 's plenty of parking and it 's very accessible , food was tasty , tried the egg drop soup and the hot and sour soup , a couple of appetizers shrimp har -gow , chicken lo main chicken shop suey walnut glazed shrimp .. the only thing i was n't thrilled about was the bbq pork rice noodles ( but it was still ok ) definitely will be back if craving chinese food	4126
1	i must admit that i was not impressed the first time , but i love dim sum and the location is near my office , so i gave it a second chance and it was much better , i would go again , it is more expensive than the restaurants in chinatown but if you do n't want the hassle of driving and waiting , this restaurant is a good choice .	4126
1	we came on a friday around noon and the place was not busy . we were seated promptly and greeted by our server . she was friendly and full of energy . we ordered our usual favorites ; however , she convinced us to upgrade from chinese ( $ 4.50 ) to the snow pea greens ( $ 11.95 ) . that turned out to be the best dish ... .fresh , tender and delicious ! we liked everything except for the bean curd skin rolls which were on the dry and salty side . we will be back to try their other dishes when our dim-sum cravings strike again .	4126
1	very fresh food . i wish i can come here all the time rather than just when i visit vegas . give it a try if you are not sure . i bet you will like it .	4126
1	love this place ! we had fried chow mein , baked sweet cream bun , pork shumai , salt and pepper shrimp , steamed beef tendon , pot stickers , bbq pork rice noodles , steamed pork dumplings ... and they were all good yummaaay !	4126
1	this is a very clean and friendly place to visit if you are in summerlin . the prices are reasonable and the food is pretty good . if you have n't had dim sum before it is a great food to eat with friends .	4126
1	i order a simple pad thai i would not say the best i had but was tasty and not heavy at all plus like the service	4126
1	i loved it . first off it was the cleanest dim sum place i 've ever been to . the staff was kind and had perfect timing . it 's new , so it was n't crowded . they were also great with kids . a plus when you want to enjoy a meal out as a family .	4126
1	great hidden gem ! not the usual 'car't service ' but they do cook the dim sum real time , so it 's always warm and fresh . they have great deals and prices are perfect ! nice , clean restaurant . food was awesome . they took care of me any my family and guests of 13 for my bday last week and we all had a great time and were very full when we left . the chinese food is also good , including sesame chicken and pan fried noodles . we will definitely be back .	4126
1	this was a great find ! the food is delicious & reasonably priced . the staff is very attentive & friendly . the establishment is very clean and my friend said the restroom is spotless ! we ordered 6 different dishes & 2 of which they recommended . everything tasted fresh and flavorful & we only paid $ 30 for everything ! by far better than some of the places in chinatown & way closer to us !	4126
1	we 've eaten here a few times and it 's always great . the dim sum are delicious and the price is great . the inside is clean and quiet . we will keep coming back .	4126
1	good selection of dim sum plus other chinese food items to order - all off menu rather than from carts . personally i love arts and the fun of choosing items off them , but ordering off menu means you can get what you want and it is really made . a it of dealt to get waited on initially , but then we had good service .	4126
1	having a quickie lunch with my better half . did n't care for this dim sum place but we know what was good and not good from our first visit . so we ordered chinese brocolli , beef tendons x2 , fried taro , and salt and pepper shrimp . that hit the spot and literally ate everything . again , nice staff , very attentive . happy eats !	4126
1	great place to have good dim sum ! located in summerlin area , no need to go all the way to chinatown.. fresh made to order.. very flavorful and delicious.. clean and good customer service also ! my new go to spot for chinese and dim sum !	4126
1	this place is so convenient ! they do delivery , that 's the best thing ever ! deliver dim sum to your home and enjoy at home ! food taste delicious as well , authentic dim sum for sure !	4126
1	really enjoyed the food and friendly service . i am a huge dim sum fan , and would travel miles to get a decent meal . not the hugest menu , but lots of standard favorites . had a first time dim sum taster with us and she really enjoyed it as well . yummy !	4126
1	good services , food is make to order . hot out of kitchen to our table . no carts , but same as taiwan , they bring order to our table . will def return .	4126
1	tried this restaurant since my go to dim sum place was closed . very pleasantly surprised . the restaurant was not crowded and not noisy . the food was very good and the prices were par for chinese restaurants . dim sum was ordered off the menu which was a little different than from hailing the carts as they pass by . my favorites were the shrimp balls , shu mi , crab claws , pork dumplings and of course the sticky rice in lotus leaf ... oh everything was just so good ! i will definitely return .	4126
1	good dim sum . reasonable pricing . problem is you eat too many dimsums and they do add up . overall , food was good . the service was fast . only bad thing is its really far from china town thus less busy .	4126
1	i am not usually a fan of chinese food but i gave this place a try . i 'm so glad i did , this is the best one around its not greasy , it 's flavorful , no msg and very fresh . it has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat .	4126
1	clean , reasonable price , nice staffs but not close to the strip . will try again when in town .	4126
1	it 's exciting to have a dim sum restaurant close to my neighborhood . now i do n't have to drive to chinatown . i ordered several traditional dim sum dishes to go and it was very good ! ! it was made to order and the food was fresh and tasty with no msg ! ! the price is reasonable like other dim sum places ; and they also have lunch specials and dinner menus . i will definitely go back to dim sum cafe .	4126
1	dim sum was really good . shrimp & beef crepe rolls were smooth and meat was cooked perfectly . pineapple custard bun was very delicious , the crust was crunchy yet , bread was fresh and soft . turnip pan fried cake was by far the best . the service was great as well . thumbs up ! this place is definitely our go-to for dim sum !	4126
1	pretty good service overall . we ordered cream cheese wontons and steamed pork dumplings for an appetizer , they were amazing ! we then ordered mongolian beef ( which was n't spicy even though it said it was but no biggy ) , beef with broccoli , and combination fried rice , everything was very delicious and very fresh tasting . i would love to come back !	4126
1	for some reason , everything tasted ten times better today than it did the previous visit . everything was at perfect , warm temperature ... made to perfection ! the workers were a lot more friendlier , especially carly , and the manager even came by to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything . we ordered the pork shumai , shrimp shumai , pan fried chive dumplings , and pork steamed bun . so so delicious and definitely sufficed my dim sum craving ! happy friday the 13 !	4126
1	my new spot for dim sum we had such a great experience very clean and friendly staff ! barbecue pork buns and the steamed buns are to die for ! ! !	4126
1	clean , fast , great price & i forget the name of them but it 's the dough ( round bread ) stuffed with barbecued pork etc are the bomb !	4126
1	me and my husband decided to check dim sum cafe out since it is right by our house and its great ! the restaurant is open with a lot of seating and the staff is very friendly . when we went we did not see a dim sum cart probably because it was later in the night and not many customers were in and actually im not too sure if they even have one haha . over all the dim sum is great , everything is tasty and we enjoyed the whole experience .	4126
1	excellent service and very tasty food . so glad this is on the west side of town and do n't have to go to china town and deal with traffic , congestion , and parking issues .	4126
1	always friendly ! excellent neighborhood little place for a quick bite ! fresh ingredients with reasonable price . been going there for really long time never disappointed . clean environment , easy parking , great food . definitely recommend to everyone !	4126
1	it 's was delicious , everything was up to par . the customer service was excellent . will come here ever time i 'm here	4126
1	consistently amazing ! great service and dependable delivery ! they always remember my preferences and strive to exceed expectations every time .	4126
1	finally found a closer dim sum place to our house ! even though they do n't serve theirs in a rolling cart , all we ordered are fresh and tasty ! we 've gotten back here several times for lunch & dinner and every time we were pleased with our order .	4126
1	great food . good price . always clean and service is good . dim sum not served on carts . makes for less than a `` dim sum '' experience but food is fresh .	4126
1	i 've been looking for good chinese food so i figured i 'd try dim sum cafe . extra bonus i live across the street ! i ordered the shrimp fried rice and vegetable egg rolls . the rice is delicious . the egg rolls are spring rolls so i need to check to see if the have cantonese style egg rolls . but all in all i will return .	4126
1	ok place to eat . hard selling some of dishes very spacious and not too long of wait . food can be better	4126
1	great dim sum , fast delivery , my go to when i wo n't cook	4126
1	great chinese food ( dim sum and regular entree type dishes ) . great prices . good service too ! what more can you ask for ? ! ?	4126
1	one word describes it all : delicious ! it 's been a while since my family has a good and authentic dim sum . wish our city has a dim sum cafe soon ! !	4126
0	just ok. not a fun true busy dim sum place and i 'm so sure they do n't make their own food . wo n't be back soon .	4126
0	the food was ok , service was terrible , they took forever to take our order ( 10 min for water ) , they never stop on the table if we wanted something else . the completely forgot about us . we have to walk to the front counter to ask for the check . we will diffinetly not come back and not recommend this place to anyone !	4126
0	i was very disappointed with there dim sun . it tasted like it was frozen not fresh & left over from the day before . in other words terrible .	4126
0	pros : not crowded , wide variety , clean , near the freeway , everything is made to order ( no carts ) cons : food is not fresh tasting ( seafood tasted previously frozen/pre-packaged , slow service , somewhat expensive for quality of food , opens late , service is ok. we will likely not return , but it is not a bad place .	4126
0	this place is clean , the service was great , the price was ok but the food was average .	4126
0	the food there was horrible . some of the dim sum had no flavor , while the other were too salty and oily . the service there was bad . the server pushed us to order from the more expensive dishes and dessert . i can understand that up selling is good for this company , but the way she went about it let us felt very comfortable . sadly we will not be coming back here again .	4126
0	i stopped for lunch . had the shrimp . it tasted raw . hoping i would n't be sick . did n't happen . maybe their dim sum is better . ok service . wo n't go again .	4126
0	nice to have a dim sum place on the west side of town . however thats the only good thing . food was bland and not impressive . just take a few extra minutes and head towards the center of town for actual dim sum made right .	4126
0	i thought i would give this a try since it is in my neighborhood . i also wanted it to be so good . not so much . went on a sunday . not too busy a time . good service . food , not so great . ordered a variety of food . all of it a same tasteless taste . went home to cook myself dinner .	4126
0	this was the worst meal i 've ever had in vegas the menu was totally weird : a small selection of dim sum , a full breakfast menu , and deli food ? we ordered some of the dim sum , all of it was terrible . do not eat here	4126
0	bland . unfortunately . the service was great but the food was one noted and mushy . granted it was our first time trying dim sum , but we are adventurous eaters who love almost everything we try .	4126
0	was happy to try this place cause it 's so close to my house . but was highly disappointed . mediocre at best . everyone who ate it agreed .	4126
0	bland . dim sum leaves much to be desired & i 'm always satisfied after happy dim sum . bad dim sum ? really ? believe me , a true disappointment . i was so excited this place opened near my house & could n't wait to go . some of the dim sum looks a bit unusual , like frozen or generic . i believe they do hand make some of the dishes but the classics are not up to par . totally missing that fresh steamed dim sum flavor . the chive dumplings are good . service is good . restaurant is spacious & eclectic . i 'll be driving to chinatown or ping pang pong for real dim sum .	4126
0	please trust yelpers when they say a place is not great . i was craving for dim sum , and it was close by , so why not ? i was ignored the moment i stepped into the restaurant , despite the fact that they were not busy . i ordered har gow , shrimp noodle , chicken feet , beef tendon and shark 's fin . my shrimp noodle was bland . the har gow was tough . my beef tendon lacked a lot of flavor . chicken feet and shark 's fin are the ones i enjoyed . their food is not the best , but it 's somewhat edible . wont be back !	4126
0	unfortunately this is the only dim sum place in the summerlin area so we had to go here , rather than driving down to chinatown . for a weekday , it was a steady stream of customers but not busy . everything is ordered ala carte and not with those dim sum cart . anyhow long story short , their pork shumai was not steamed enough and both my husband and i took a bite into raw meat . they took it back apologetically and gave us a fully cooked one . but the damage was done and both of us felt sick after that meal . next time we 'll just drive to chinatown .	4126
0	service was good but the pork dimsum we had had an after taste to it . we did n't try other dimsum so we ca n't tell if they 're all the same . otherwise , i guess this place would be an acquired taste for some but unfortunately not for us .	4126
0	my mom and i were excited to go to a dim sum place near the summerlin area only to find out it was a huge disappointment . today my mom ordered a baked bbq pork pie and when she took it home and tried it , the center of the pork was yellow and black and smelled horrific . the food is obviously not fresh if they have to serve expired pork . would not come back .	4126
0	very unhappy with this place sadly . the potstickers were soggy , the egg rolls bland and not chripsy , the lo mein had no flavor and smelled gross , even the rice was n't good . the one thing i was excited about , miso soup , was gross ! i 've never had bad miso till now . the seaweed was clumped and weird colored , the soup itself had no flavor ! how is that possible ? ! so we will not be going back to this place again . better luck for others .	4126
0	ok dim sum - had the shrimp har gow , shrimp shumai , pork shumai , black bean pork spare ribs , chinese brocolli and baked char sui buns . all was ok , but seemed the shrimp shumai was probably frozen , as was possibly some of the other dishes .	4126
0	horrible service . got stink eye and pretty much yelled at while asking for some hot sauce . the older lady just stood there while the older man gave such attitude . from what i read on the other reviews , service seems to be the problem here . i 've been here multiple times within a short two week span when i moved here and this is how a repeat customer got treated . i guess they do n't know the rule of 80/20.. shame ...	4126
0	one word . yuck . this place is the most flavorless dim sum place i 've ever eaten at . i love dim sum and was excited to try this place , but everything had no flavor . even the chili oil had no flavor . the service was fast and the waitresses were nice . the area was clean , but the food was just flavorless .	4126
0	i came here today thursday 1/22/15 with my mom who lives nearby . it was 4:15 pm . we were the only ones in there and the person at the desk was less than friendly . the same person came and got our drink order of hot tea . when he returned i ordered some har gow , pork shiu mai , chive dumplings , and goyzas and or potstickers . in a very rude tone asked me what language i was speaking and left and gave me a dirty look . i left $ 5 dollars on the table and left . so sad .	4126
0	dimsum is typical..service is the worst ! ! ! only 2 tables in this whole place and server is very inattentive . had to walk up behind the wall to ask for soy sauce and water refill bc he has not checked on us aside from dropping off the food . not coming back	4126
0	disappointed ... the service was very slow . it 's ordered a la carte . one dim sum dish with the tofu skin was dry and hard , baked tofu was mediocre and my favorite fried taro was greasy tasty . the only decent one was the pork siu mai . will not go again .	4126
0	no no and no . rice cake and steamed gailan . maybe it was me but never here again . the place looks cluttered and dirtyz . although the guy up front was okay , i just would n't come back .	4126
0	looking for a place not in chinatown for some good dim sum , it tasted like rubber . i also tasted the chinese food for my kids and it also terrible . how can you mess up chinese food ? no taste !	4126
0	had come from northside all the way from aliante to try and see if it 's better than orchid garden . the place was empty aside from two men eating that was almost done . it was alright and cooked good but i love tripe and their tripe was chewy even after i asked them to steam it longer . it 's nice that it 's made to order , but waiting with an empty table did n't seem normal . my husband saw a dead cockroach on the floor , server was nice but forgot to put in one of our order . they took the tripe of our bill . wo n't be back .	4126
0	we sat down before another party and they got their order taken before ours . we did n't even get acknowledged to see if we were ready to order . i 'm still waiting for someone to take my order as i enter this	4126
0	dined in for dim sum . ordered the shrimp har gow , pork shumai , steamed chicken buns & sweet rice cake . the only thing i liked was the shrimp har gow . the pork shumai was very rubbery . the sweet rice cake was cold , dry , & thin . the steamed chicken buns were nasty !	4126
0	i would give this place below 1 if i could . the food had awful smell . seemed like all the food were old and reheated . we ordered chowmein which was all rubbery and smelled disgusting .	4126
0	i kept seeing this place , and since i love dim sum , i just had to try it . my wife and i went there around dinner . not a good idea . we were the only ones in the place during dinner time . not a good sign . food was almost mediocre quality . i have to agree with andrea s. pass on this place . drive down to orchid garden on sahara . you will get fresh dim sum , made all day , and served in the traditional way , not fresh out of the freezer , into the micro wave oven .	4126
0	this place would n't deliver to my home 5 mins down the road guy was rude beyond belief over the phone and had zero respect	4126
0	worst dim sum ever ... open at 11 but no baked buns till noon . fishy shrimp har gow ... . the list goes on . get me outa here now !	4126
0	do yourself a favor and do not come here for dimsum . i rely heavily on yelp and it 's reviews for good quality eats and i 'm usually not a big fan of leaving negative reviews unless it 's completely warranted . my husband and i were so extremely dissatisfied with the food here that we just paid our bill and left with most of the food untouched . if you are looking for a good dimsum place check out the one inside the rio hotel . promise you wo n't regret it . save your money , do n't go here . you 're welcome	4126
0	i 'll give it a two star because of the server . he was good and very helpful . we ordered , steamed bbq buns , siu mai , beef tendon , sticky rice , rolled shrimp , rolled noodles in xo sauce which was super oily , fried rice , mongolia beef and hot and sour soup . some dishes were not good and some were . so for me the main dishes are ok , dim sum not so much . probably not coming back here .	4126
0	( sigh ) ... disappointed . i was happy to find a dim sum place close to summerlin , but the food is no where near the quality of the other dim sum restaurants in chinatown . steamed beef tendon and baked bbq pork pie are the worst that i 've ever eaten . ca n't believe i 'm going to say this : panda express is better than this . i feel sorry for the nice staff working here .	4126
0	read quite a few positive yelp reviews and decided to give it a try . not impressed and will not recommend .	4126
0	did not enjoy this restaurants ' dim sum . everything we had tasted like they had just pulled it from the freezer section at a grocery store . in all honesty , you would be better served to stop at a chinese grocery and steam your own dim sum than coming here .	4126
0	i came here for a family outing . we were trying to avoid the casinos due to the kids . it 's not your typical food cart dim sum place . you order what you 'd like and they bring it out . the benefit is that your food is hot ! service was friendly but the food just did n't do it for me . some items were bland and others were salty . it did n't exactly satisfy my craving for dim sum . i might give it another try but no rush .	4126
0	this place is so frustrating . became our close by dim sum joint - really dig you order what you want instead of tracking down cart at tradition dim sum . sat down sunday with my 2 boys - water and tea delivered and we were literally abandoned - no order taken - no follow-up - nothing . tried to flag down servers and they just kept scurrying by . they then started bussing tables and it was tome to leave . walked out and no one even said a word . we shot over to orchids garden ( i think the owners are the same ) and all was well - just frustrating .	4126
0	worst chasu bau i 've had ( baked pork bun ) , the bun was dry and the meat to bun ratio way off . shrimp har gaw and pork shu mai tasted like they were reheated from earlier . lotus leaf and snow pea flowers were decent	4126
0	i found a dead cockroach in my egg roll ! ! i just could n't believe my eyes when i saw it ... ... ..after ccomplaining to the manager he was very apologetic but at that point i was so traumatized that i just stormed out of the the restaurant . avoid at all costs ! !	4126
1	delicious mexican restaurant in lachine , right by the water ! very good food and authentic atmosphere . we were strolling around the area and decided to go in to try , was not disappointed ! the sangria was great , the food too ! will come back more times !	4127
1	great service , every staff comes with big smiles . decor in warm colors that gives you a home-y feel . pretty popular spot in an otherwise tranquil area . 4 star because both food and drinks we had that day were slightly too salty/sweet .	4127
1	order the seafood platter it was delicious the presentation was superb atmosphere great . it seems amazing that you can get such good value again with quebec high standards of cuisine with such a great view i would highly recommend this place	4127
0	en un mot , décevant . plats quelconques , service approximatif , ambiance inexistante . à éviter .	4127
0	apparently the other reviewers have never had `` mexican '' food outside of quebec . otherwise they would know that nothing they serve at this place is even close to being considered mexican food . service was good , so that 's what got them a full two stars instead of one . if you just want some random concoctions of food with sweet sauces , then this is your place .	4127
0	well things did n't start off that well when we arrived with a reservation for 2 , saw an empty table that stayed empty for 10 minutes while we stood waiting . so i 'm well aware the montreal is far from the best place to get mexican , and as such am rating this place in that context . i did like the decor and beer selection , but the food was not great . i ordered the fajitas and my friend ordered the chicken tacos . the chicken was quite tender , but it just lacked taste . my friend did like his tacos . i doubt i 'll be back here . there are several other mexican joints i would prefer to try .	4127
1	i came here for a fill and a gel pedicure . this used to be my go to place years ago when i got my nails done all the time . it is completely different now than it was back then.. my nails always looked amazing.. i even had them do my nails for my wedding back in 2012 . they still do a good job and i love that they are right next to dunkin donuts .	4128
1	why would i go anywhere else when i to go to the best ? awesome selection of gel nails and colors , for me this is a regular stop every month	4128
1	hellen did my nails . she is so sweet and does an awesome . first place i 've been in vegas ( i 've been here almost 4 years ) that they are actually nice and do an awesome job . i 'll be back	4128
1	defiantly recommend making a appointment before going in because they are always super busy but efficient . everyone is always friendly . i 'll continue to go back .	4128
1	have been here many times and never really disappointed . just wish they would rub the feet and calfs longer .	4128
0	terrible service . they messed up my nails and overcharged me . i was quoted one price and over charged . the wait took forever and when someone finally got to me it was such a disappointment . i will never return here . i am having to dispute the charge because they refused to return my money . they were incredibly rude about it as tho i had done something wrong when it was their mess up . if i could give no stars i would . i will post pictures to show the horrible work done .	4128
0	i literally went in to get a broken nails fixed the owner or whoever he is michael did a horrible job different color nail they could n't even match it correctly this place is crap they font even have there licenses up it lumpy i hate my nails help	4128
0	this place is absolute garbage . i came in for a fill and pedicure , the pedicure was standard however the fill was rushed and the polish slapped on . of course the polish bubbled and when i asked for it to be redone i was chastised saying that it was my fault that the polish bubbled . the gentleman continued to accuse me of doing something wrong , so i got up and left with only one hand polished , after they charged me full price , of course ! avoid this nail salon at all costs. ! ! !	4128
0	literally left this place with a headache because this nail tech would not stop talking ! basically paid 50 $ for gel pedicure the guy could not do a simple french tip i do n't recommend this place to anyone	4128
0	she was really nice but she did n't scrub my feet or file my nails or get the nail polish from around the nails . it literally looks like i just did it . not going back	4128
1	good service i 've been a member of the credit union for a very long time . so far , it 's been going very well . i have a checking , savings , and ira account so i go to the credit union fairly often . the staff are always helpful and friendly . the facilities are quite nice . overall , i would recommend this credit union , over big banks . i feel like the people here really have my best interest in mind . i 've never had any problems .	4129
1	if your tired of being treated as an account number at your bank , you 'll love arizona federal credit union . the employees are friendly and helpful , and the president is responsive .	4129
1	while visiting arizona a week ago for my daughters wedding , i found myself in need of a large amount of fast cash . i found myself at the afcu on s. 48th . walking through the doors i was immediately greeted by two employees offering assistance . once i explained my situation , they graciously helped me with my transaction . i was in & out with my cash without any issues . i will ( & have ) recommended afcu to the family & friends we have in arizona .	4129
1	i was visiting my parents in arizona over christmas and received a few checks i wanted to deposit . i bank with a credit union up in washington and a search told me this was a credit union service center and would accept my deposits . i came here probably 2-3 times in a two week period to deposit checks . the tellers were always very friendly ( i used the same one twice ) and knew exactly how to do the transaction . my only issue was one time i came there was a huge line to see a teller . the line was out of their line-up area thing and it took probably 20 minutes of waiting .	4129
1	when my husband and i got married 9 years ago he had this account . i was not sure about it because i have always used banks . my experience has been nothing but good . they loaned us money for a car at a much lower interest rate . the i retest on our savings is better than the bank . i have only good things to report about this branch .	4129
0	they are still the worst probably in the whole us . will never return or recommend , terrible service . somehow they manage to stay ahead of the poor innocent people of . ss or ssi . do your research before you step into this unprofessional and unethical place . everything they get away with is wrong .	4129
0	get to the counter at 5:31 and wo n't help up because the department closes at 5:30 . you really wont help because of a few seconds ? ridiculous . trying to open an account and ca n't because of seconds . looks like we 'll be going else where . this branch is terrible .	4129
0	join another credit union ... the member service here sucks.. i have spent 3 days and over 7 hours on the phone over a $ 35 charge that they refuse to reverse despite the fact that they screwed up my bill pay account and i 'm still out $ 500 waiting for the `` re-sent '' payments to post to my visa account at another credit union , where the service is outstanding i 've had banks treat me better than this	4129
0	if i could give them a 0 stars i would do so . so annoyed with this credit union ; i was hoping to open a savings account here but i was told you must open a checking account also . when i told the front desk lady she said that i could n't because `` it 's not worth it '' to have a savings account . yes it is if you are trying to save money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no wonder they only have 2 stars ! ! ! bye- going elsewhere with my money ... .	4129
0	bianka is a bad employee for az federal . i closed my account today because she thinks it 's funny that the bank charges us $ 35 when i do n't thinks it 's funny . i will never do business again with them .	4129
1	angelo and his crew are the best accountants in town ! ! ! i 've referred so many people and we are all very happy , repeat customers . my family has been using him for over 10 years now ! i ca n't strongly recommend them enough ! try them , you will be pleased with your results !	4131
1	i have been with mike for a number of years now and he does a fantastic job with my business and helping me with day to day accounting . this guy knows what he is doing and is always there to help out . thank mike . kepp up the great work . use this guy for you tax needs !	4131
0	i received terrible customer service from mike after messing up on my taxes . accidents happen but getting him to try and fix the issue was like pulling teeth . and after the damage was done he ignored me . totally unprofessional . that 's why i decided to leave this review , nobody else should have to go through the terrible stressful situation i went through .	4131
0	horrible . angelo is no longer there . last year , when i called to make an appoint , they told me angelo was not available . found out weeks later that he was no longer there . gave my info to mike . took several weeks to get my taxes done and then he `` neglected '' to file them . finally had to find someone else and my taxes were filed late . he would never return my calls . if i could give zero stars i would .	4131
1	i love this chuck e. cheese ! it 's not too crowded , its clean , well maintained that the machines look brand new : ) & the best part is if you dont do so well on a game it still gives you more than 1-3 tickets ! where a kid can be a kid : )	4132
1	went in to ask about party information , the managers name is nicki and she answered all my questions , was super nice , even told me about coupons online and explain the whole process in detail . i was planning on using a different location but she change my mind and we will be using this location for my daughter 's second birthday ! she was very pleasant to speak to and i left content .	4132
1	the grandkids and i had a great time . the staff on shift were friendly and professional . almost all of the games worked and we 're stocked with tickets . the chuck e cheese mascot gave away lots of free tickets . our food was good . thanks keecia , priscilla , roberto , and `` chuck e '' , and crew .	4132
1	here for a party for aron and it started at 3 ... but no hostess or anyone till 3:45.. at first it was really upsetting.. we come here all the time and it sucks to get bad service ... the management was very sorry and really made us happy with how they treated us after !	4132
0	this is the worst . i took my two year old son today . we got the all you can eat pizza buffet for 5.99 . they did n't have it fresh pizza or fresh salad . i lost so many tokens in the little ride ons and the games . they have the worst prizes the `` prizes '' are so little anbar not worth the 10,20 tickes they want . ill never take him back to that place	4132
0	it 's sad that i have to say this but this place i went on 7/28/17 was a disaster . there were kids that been stealing my games which is when i 'm playing something they just come out of nowhere and ruin it . the place was a mess full of pizza and salad on the tables and floors . the manager was really nice i give him that . but the place was a huge mess . next time i come i want to see better than what happened today .	4132
0	i am so disgusted . i 'm here at a birthday party . you have adults fighting . staff member arguing with the parent . unprofessional and disorganized.i would never come here again .	4132
0	i went on saturday afternoon it was packed . the pizza was good . the floor by the soda machine was all sticky . the carpet was tacky ! it was gross . under the salad bar was all kinds of food all over the floor . the parents did n't watch their kids . we played some games and came back to our table and a little boy had our left over pizza in his hands ! i told his dad he could have the pizza , i was n't going to take it.. also a lot of the game were down without a sign on them !	4132
1	i had to do what i thought was the impossible . shop for bedding , pillows & area rugs . the girl that helped me was awesome and got me thru it . i wish i would have gotten her name but tyvm ! ! !	4133
1	the associates at this store are very friendly and helpful . from the moment i walked in at the door to when i checked out i was greeted and it was a speedy check out.when i had questions i got an answer right away . they have great customer service . they had all the items that i needed . i will return to this location .	4133
0	zamara is horrible rude and i ca n't believe they have people like that as management . she could n't correct a wrong price gave attitude and was mocking me when i was calling cc company	4133
0	this place is gross and ghetto . the staff is awful , the selection sucks , and the store is filthy .	4133
1	the staff was phenomenally kind . i really enjoy walking into a place where everyone seems happy to be working there . everyone was smiling , greeting customers , being extremely helpful and just overall pleasant ! there is nothing worse than a place where the staff seems bummed out so i commend this place on whatever they do to train and keep their employees .	4134
1	the second best movie theater in cleveland . the first is owned by the same people . i like it a lot because it has all the good movies and not only the big budget movies . it has a nice feel to it . the halls are very small and mostly full regardless of the movie .	4134
1	love the monday specials that include a popcorn and drink for a low price as well has money off of movie tickets . nice quiet atmosphere , i love the architecture of the building , the popcorn is delicious and the movie seats are comfortable . the restrooms could use a little tlc when it comes to the odor department , there 's a big smell you get as to go down the stairs by the men 's restroom . other then that great customer service and employees	4134
0	i am a veteran with a 3 week old infant . my wife and i wanted to go see the patriotic movie '13 hours ' and was told we were not a loud in with our child even though there was hardly anyone at the 1pm showing . he was asleep and we would have obviously taken him out of he got upset . i 'll never go to this theater again or recommend it to anyone . go see movies at a place that shows a little more respect for veterans .	4134
0	this is a cute theater on shaker square . if you are looking for something a little quaint and different from a modern mega-plex , this is a fine place . it 's probably a great place for a small cedar-lee type movie , but it is starting to show its age for more modern films . i saw avatar 3d here after seeing it in a more modern theater a week earlier , and the experience was not nearly as good . sound was subpar . the screen was small , off center to the seats , and was not evenly colored . still , for the charm i would give this place 3 stars , but the popcorn was cold .	4134
0	super slow service at ticket booth and concession stand . give yourself an extra 20 minutes to get tickets and popcorn .	4134
1	dr. mike boyle and his wonderful staff provide excellent care for my menagerie of pets . at village animal clinic , you and your pet will be given individual treatment and not just hurried through the appointment .	4135
1	dr. mike is an amazing vet ! as a house hold with 3 dogs he had been nothing but wonderful and a guiding wealth of knowledge from puppyhood to senior dog care .	4135
0	these people lied to me repeatedly . telling me it was state law that the give my dog a complete physical . would n't return my phone calls at all after i called them out on their lie . sent a snarky letter asking me not to bring my dog there after i made it very clear i would n't make that mistake a second time . i was hopeful that we could have a decent vet in my town but i will be going back to greener pastures in monticello .	4135
0	misdiagnosed our dog resulting in her death that same evening and then did n't want to discuss it with us unless we paid her to talk to us .	4135
1	this is a great store ! it was some good quality clothing from adults to kids . if you are ever inside the excalibur hotel check out this store . lots of cool things in here . the staff members are very friendly in my opinion .	4136
1	the best souvenir store that we visited in vegas . nothing fancy , but decent crap ( come on , all souvenirs are crap ... this is just better than most of the crap at other stores ) and at good prices .	4136
0	store it 's really nice but the workers are really rude had the worst experience ever and the manager is even worst really bad customer service rude people working there	4136
0	i do n't recommend this store `` magnet max `` in miracle mile shops . they might have good deals but the people that work there especially that blonde girl & the manager `` jaar '' they 're both so rude . i work in a retail store too & we do n't treat our customer the way they treated me . i can see from the previous surveys , i 'm not the first one that complained about them .	4136
1	i 've been coming here for over 10 years and currently for the 4 plus years my favourite masseuse is oliver . he is a master and can always tell what is happening in the body . amazing every time	4137
1	went today for 20 minute back massage . literally all i can think about is when i can go back . boris did the massage and he was fantastic !	4137
0	do n't go here . especially not for a full hour table massage . i 've never tried the chair massages so i ca n't speak to those , but the table massage was not a great experience . i 'll spare the details , but i definitely do n't recommend this place .	4137
0	terrible technique . ignored requests . waste of time and money . receptionist oblivious of her surroundings and could n't care less about clients .	4137
1	always enjoy the breakfast special . staff have always been magnificent . food tastes great . i enjoy the diner and the atmosphere here . only ever had breakfast here . several times and never disappointed .	4138
1	love this place ! its great for breakfast or lunch , food comes super fast ... and has always been awesome !	4138
0	food is rough ! even my kids passed on it . we went for the buffet breakfast . still had to pay full price even though my 5 yr old only eat half a sausage and my other soon had nothing ! i filled up on the eggs as the rest looked like something i would feed a dog : ( wo n't be back . staff were friendly so that helps !	4138
0	go here if you have tons of time and want mediocre food . 8 mins wait at door before anyone cared to seat us . only 5 tables already seated and served , took 25 mins to get 2 breakfast items . poached soft eggs mean dried out yolks . did not send back took too long first time ariund . no coffee refills , dont expect any service until its bill and tip time . i have a tummy ache now .	4138
1	good food . great service . ask for waitress aimee ~ she was friendly and professional .	4139
1	food is amazing ! some prices are a little steep depending on what you order . restaurant is always clean and orderly and servers are very attentive .	4139
1	alex the server/to go person was awesome ! very nice and took our order with ease . food was great especially the southwestern egg rolls ! : - )	4139
1	i 've come here about 3 times so far since i moved to madison in august of 2017 . usually when i come here , i elect to get the $ 35 deal , which includes 2 presidente margaritas , an appetizer , two entrees , and a dessert . the presidente margaritas are generous servings of tequila by american standards . the servers are the bar are the best . i would highly recommend coming here to take advantage of the $ 35 deal . also , chili 's supports veterans for veteran 's day with a free entree .	4139
1	always fresh ! service is great ! have never been disappointed ! reasonably priced and a good variety .	4139
1	we like it because we know what we 're going to get . we always get a booth for two in the bar since it is less likely families will seek it out & we feel the servers work harder for you because often customers do n't consider eating in the bar when they arrive . another pro tip -- lunch menu available anytime making it possible for the two of us to get in & out for under $ 20 . like anywhere we 've had our service hiccups over the years but when we 're hungry this is always a reliable fall back .	4139
1	food is good . service is fast and servers are attentive and friendly . have been going there for years with no complaints . they have many healthy choices to choose from . today we had the fajitas trio which we split and it was excellent ! the prices are reasonable .	4139
0	slow service ! ! since my last review chili 's has gone backwards . we were seated and then it took more than 10minutes before anyone even spoke with us , so we placed both the drink and food order to speeds things up . with hardly anyone in the restaurant it then took over 40 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered it . at least the food tasted decent .	4139
0	after a long day of flying i decided to get chilis to go . huge mistake . it started with them not being able to find my order because they had my name wrong & it went downhill from there . when i got home i found my soup was not in the bag . i opened the box for my entree & the pictures listed was what i found . never again . very expensive & the food is terrible .	4139
0	there was more than 1/2 hour wait for a simple salad and soup order plus a child 's menu pizza . the `` bottomless '' salad never had an offer of a refill . the server was nice but it was a disappointing meal .	4139
0	ordered a cup of the chili and the steak fajitas . the quality was consistent with other chili 's i 've eaten at in the past . nothing spectacular but then nothing terrible either . the atmosphere is typical of the chain , and kept clean enough . the only downside was the waiter . he messed up the drink order by bringing a corona instead of the blue moon and included the up sell beans and rice , which i had told him i did n't want at time of order . both mistakes seemed to be intended to get the ticket price up to increase his tip .	4139
0	extremely poor service ... we waited about 5 minutes after being seated for a server to come to our table . while eating , we found a wrapper of some sort in one of our bowls of soup . called the server to our table , who in turn called over the manager ... although they provided a new bowl of soup , we never received an apology from the manager nor a discount to our bill . we will not return to this chili 's location .	4139
0	it was a disappointment ! there was only one server in the dining room . we came about 4:30 pm just before the dinner rush . the poor girl must have been brand new . she did n't know much about the food and the service was at a snail 's pace . there are better mexican restaurants , which we 'll be going to . wo n't waste my breath coming here again .	4139
0	waited over about 85minutes for delivery steak was tough and overcooked ( beyond well done - asked for a medium ) overpriced and expensive for what it was about $ 35- $ 40 including tip for 10oz steak , baked potato and blackbeans black beans are better out of a tin asked for refund heard no response	4139
1	delores is the best , great beer on tap , food and atmosphere ! get to know the staff and you will have a great time day or night .	4140
1	i do n't go here to watch games or drink even though that 's what there more or so for but i do go the burgers and chips . i love the food . all the flavors and the staff are friendly as hell . would recommend for anyone to just try once .	4140
1	great burgers and beer definitely worth the stop ! found this on yelp , i 'm from out of town and it 's delish got the regular cheeseburger and blue moon	4140
1	during a recent trip to the verona/madison area , i had the chance to visit this place multiple times . the burgers were excellent as were the cheese curds , homemade chips and fries . there are multiple burger/sandwich options on the menu . the kentucky bourbon burger was my favorite and went nicely with the many brew options on the beer menu . staff members were very nice and service was fast .	4140
1	seriously yummy burgers ! great beer selection on tap . friendly !	4140
0	so bad . we 've given this place 2 tries . first was junction rd . the service was horrible and the food was mediocre . we did not like that we could n't order our burgers to the temp of our liking . tried the one in verona . again , horrible service and food was dry and disgusting . dairy queen has better burgers and quicker service ! we will never be back unless it 's for a beer .	4140
0	any `` burger joint '' that wo n't let you order a burger to the temp of your liking is failing on purpose . good beer selection . rude servers .	4140
0	burgers are good . the march madness deal does not exist as every miller lite we had was charged at full price . kind of a shock to pay $ 50 for one meal and 9 beers for two people . will not be going back .	4140
0	under staffed , lacked attention or care , plus the manager just told me we are busy deal wth it . high five customer service .	4140
0	horrible burgers ! dry and flavorless . not bad enough to send back because i doubt they could improve upon it . no place that cooks meat only to medium well should be allowed to call itself a burger joint .	4140
1	one of the few that has fish on the menu . tilapia cooked fresh and added to any burrito or taco . great place for a quick mexican fix .	4141
1	my pollo ( chicken ) bowl was really yummy and filling . i would definitely come to this location again for more in the future . the service was fast and efficient , there were plenty of tables to seat and it was clean . the food was delicious ! !	4141
1	this place kicks ass . they make ten times the burrito you 'll get anywhere else , and best of all they make it fast . whole wheat option , brown rice option , and be sure to try the tilapia - takes a couple extra minutes to grill up fresh , but it 's great . do n't buy the chipotle hype , do n't waste 15 minutes of your life at burrito boys , just go here and enjoy a consistently excellent burrito . ( trust me , i 've had at least a couple hundred of them by now . )	4141
1	great place to grab a quick meal . food is great quality for a reasonable price . i eat here pretty often and i 've never been disappointed with the large portions . service is also amazing , you get what you want and more . recommend the tacos !	4141
1	one of the better burritos joints in toronto . too many of these places are the same , but i like the selection if ingredients here , for the most part anyway .	4141
1	probably as good as it gets for burritos ! i walked into this place while looking for food and it was packed ( for good reason too ) . the lady guided me on how to order , very sweet . this location is very generous on the stuffings/toppings , food was fresh and hot ! go try it at least once ! i know it 's a bit pricey but you wo n't regret it as a once in awhile treat !	4141
0	alright , but definitely not the best burrito in the neighbourhood . ingredients were meh , and if you want guacamole , it costs extra .	4141
0	mucho apathy ! staff appeared to be spaced out and despondent : one star service . they were n't even remotely busy and charged extra for guac , did n't include it on the tray . ( slow clap ) communication with customers in any kind of meaningful way seemed either pained or impossible . for the same price or less , just go across the street and get chipotle who can do this kind of meal properly . the food deserves the 1 star rating , too . bland and overpriced , not an ideal combination even for fast food .	4141
0	had two chicken tacos with cheese , lettuce , guac , and the mild salsa . tacos are good but nothing special . typical fast food . walk a little further west to wilbur mexicana on king street past spadina if you want much better mexican that is fast and reasonably priced .	4141
0	significantly less portion than other mucho burrito 's . also asked for tortilla on the side , they dont even warm it up . they fold it and put it directly in the bowl . what 's up with that bro . would not recommend out of 10	4141
0	absolutely rude service especially from that pale white girl christina she is just rude when she speaks to you as if she wants you to hurry up and order . the beer and wine choices are pretty good but overall the staff here are rude the one asian girl who always looks like she 's confused she tends to slur her words maybe they drink or get `` you know what '' at work burritos here are tasteless it 's like eating cardboard	4141
0	kudos to this location for having beer and wine ! but if i 'm down this end of queen there are far better choices for dinner/lunch and a drink . while the food is mostly ok , itends up being very expensive for a fast food chain . the amount of food is fine , but the quality for the price is just not there . *points for playing awesome mexican music that makes me wiggle around on my bike seat in an attempt to dance when i cycle by .	4141
1	karen , the manager of the florist department , was so helpful and efficient this morning ! i was in a rush and she helped me get a dozen balloons and was very kind in the process . thank you !	4142
1	it 's a safeway ! nothing too crazy about this place . has all your standard staff . i will mention that it is however usually short on cashiers . it has a redbox and a decent flower selection .	4142
1	located in my neighborhood , it 's my 'go to ' spot when i buy regular groceries . besides groceries , i like to come here for : + banking - there 's a wells fargo located on premises . + buy lottery tickets - powerball & scratch offs + rent movies using redbox . + buy flowers on special occasions . the staff here is friendly and the lines are short most of the time . return factor - 95 %	4142
1	i love this safeway . it 's right down the street from our house and they always have a great selection of produce and products that we enjoy . they recently started carrying the soy yogurt i love which is a plus and rochelle is probably the best cashier around .	4142
1	clean store , helpful staff	4142
1	best safeway i 've been to . when the staff sees there is a long wait to checkout , they always jump in to help . they seriously take my time into consideration . everything is so clean , and well layed out . its a great store all around ! !	4142
1	close to work for me , clean , great selection , well organized . stop in here probably twice a week and i am always in and out without an issue .	4142
1	my favorite safeway there is . always clean and the staff is always helpful . great selection of gourmet cheeses and wines . i love the olive bar and the wide variety of nuts they have . the vegetables are usually fresh , unlike other grocery stores i have been to in the valley .	4142
1	this is the only place i grocery shop . friendly staff . the deli dept makes the best sandwitches . it 's also very clean . fair prices , especially water .	4142
1	i love this safeway because it is so close to my apartment that i can walk there and grab something quick if i need to . it 's great if i just need a few quick things for dinner or lunch . the club card sometimes has some great deals . i recently moved here from just outside of chicago and this beats a lot of prices that i 'm used to paying . although cheese is more expensive - weird .	4142
1	i shop there frequently ... the staff there are all super friendly and helpful . the store manager ' s name is ryan . he runs a great grocery store indeed . always clean , and a very `` neighborhood-like atmosphere .	4142
1	believe it or not , this safeway is a decent spot for breakfast . there 's a breakfast sandwich with eggs , ( yellow or white ) your choice of cheeses and ham , bacon or sausage for only $ 1.99 . this combines with their small , in-store starbuck 's will get you a great breakfast for under $ 5 there 's even reasonable seating !	4142
1	got ta love the staff here.they are helpful , pleasant , knowledgeable and will go the extra mile to help . i think they must like their jobs ! the floral department is well stocked and well kept .	4142
1	the deli has delish sandwiches- especially the california dreamin ' . aaaand ... it is the same price as subway but 10x better . it 's my hidden spot , so do n't come here . i do n't want to start waiting in line . i bought birthday flowers here for one of my friends . little roses from the refrigerator case . those things lasted forever . over 2 weeks ! i love the store . it 's very scottsdale ( the flooring , lighting , massive wine & cheese department ) .	4142
1	clean & has a starbucks inside . coming from mn , i never shopped at a store with a loyalty card , and i must say i do save a lot with my safeway card . i also downloaded the app on my phone to add coupons to my card - very cool !	4142
1	this safeway has the most amazing flower section ! thank you for being my one stop shop !	4142
1	beautiful store but their staff is n't as friendly as the safeway employee at the via linda store i go out of my way to shop at via linda store for that exact reason .	4142
1	i 've been to this location several times . i like how it 's open late . have dropped by around 11:30 pm and it 's still open ... .bonus as things shut down in scottsdale very early . for a grocery store , there 's a really good selection of ipa 's here . http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ntvcx9uewfvhsxqj06xq0g ? select=ydukhzavsuxwyleznc_6ca http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ntvcx9uewfvhsxqj06xq0g ? select=nwhhnwx62cdlhj0bkjvpjw and the wine cellar is above average . http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ntvcx9uewfvhsxqj06xq0g ? select=5b6bhbkijxzsajmw8gxn-g the store is kept clean and the employees are always helpful and friendly . a nice overall shopping experience . return factor - 90 %	4142
1	really great store ! staff is always more than friendly and prices on most things are reasonable . bakery is always yummy and fresh ! good selection on a lot of items and variety . most recently , i got a birthday cake for my son 's birthday party . 2 layer , custard filled , thomas the train theme with whipped cream frosting ... $ 28 ! and it served 30 people . everyone raved about it , it was so good !	4142
1	it is clean and have the nicest employees . they have plenty of selections on just about everything . love all the ice cream selection ...	4142
1	i love that this safeway is right across the street from my work . i like to walk here for a bit of exercise to get lunch . the deli is awesome . they have a sandwich bar that has these really great gourmet ingredients they will make a sandwich for you . for 5.49 it 's not too bad and if you use your safeway card you buy 7 get the 8th sandwich free . they also have premade salads and a hot bar as well . very friendly , alan who has made my sandwiches the last couple weeks is very friendly and does a good job . bonus points the starbucks is right next to it !	4142
0	went shopping with my mother and she likes to buy the bread you warm up to eat , so they have them all staged by the unused brick oven , which i was told is always on but never used . and would n't you know it most of the bread was moldy and i mean gross green mold . i told the deli clerk and he said corporate wants them there and wants the oven on because it looks good . we are in arizona not alaska . it 's to hot to put bread there which gets condensation in the bags that turn into moldy bread and rolls . please have some common sense and move them instead of throwing food out .	4142
0	i have stopped shopping at this safeway because of the deli workers . they do n't seem to be trained in their jobs , nor do they know the products they sell . i asked for a simple request ( oven roasted turkey ) , and the man behind the counter looked like his head was about to explode . he stammered and could n't start to complete the order . on another occasion , the woman working there put my order directly on the scale without any paper . i do n't know what was on the scale , and when it was last cleaned . i would rather drive farther to another store than deal with the poorly trained staff at this store .	4142
0	i have recently lost a lot of weight by eating healthy and fresh fruits and vegetables . as well as cutting calories and watching portions sizes . that being said i eat a lot of fruits and veggies . this safeway has some of the worst produce i have seen in scottsdale . if you want fresher fruits and vegetables go elsewhere . twice i bought mini cucumbers and they were rotten when i opened them up at home !	4142
0	this safeway seems to have staffed up recently to accommodate the customers displaced from the nearby albertsons . so yes , they have improved in terms of line waits .	4142
0	the staff is nice and knowledgeable , the store is pretty well maintained and the parking lot is covered ! that 's it with the positive . buyer beware at the prices ... the prices on the shelves and the sale prices do not transfer on your receipt ... you must ask for them ? ! 1sy time i thought it was a mistake , but this happens just about every purchase . the sale only posts at the end after the whole merchandise was scanned , by then you only see the total savings and total . the each sale is gone . write down the sales	4142
0	awful lady there at the cash register was having a miserable day she straight up lied about them not accepting apple pay and then later rephrase her statement saying it was down . people like her do n't move the world forward they only suppress progress .	4142
0	about 3 out of every 5 times i find that i have been overcharged for something . check your receipts carefully ! but do n't be surprised if the manager fights with you about correcting the price errors . i 've even had a manager go take the signs off the shelf so i could n't prove the price was incorrect . now i take a picture of the tag or go with the manager when they 're doing the `` price check '' to make sure they do n't cheat me out of the shelf price !	4142
0	they have signs hanging in the store saying `` friendliest staff '' ! must be a marketing effort to change customer perception because in the 3 years i 've been coming here , friendly is not how i 'd describe any of the staff i 've interacted with . today , was no exception . the cashier slammed my change in my hand as if it were an imposition to have to count it . oh by the way , he did n't count it . just slammed it in my hand . as i was walking away shaking my head , he blurts the amount to me . please bring back self checkout so i do n't have to deal with your sour attitude employees .	4142
0	horrible service at this store . deli staff seemed more concerned about chatting and laughing than getting request correct on all three orders , meat department was unfriendly and cashiers were rude to people ahead of me and took no care with my groceries - meat containers broken , etc . completely unnecessary . back to frys even if it is further away .	4142
0	lines are always long and slow here and it is even worse since the closing of albertsons . do n't look for half gallons of milk . they never have any . super bowl sunday and there are 5-7 people deep in each line . too bad this is the closest store to my home . as per another review it is quicker to drive farther to albertsons at via linda or fry 's at 90th and shea than it is to shop here .	4142
0	the main problem with this store is the lack of commitment to customer service . usually only two or three checkout lanes open , and long lines . sometimes , it will dawn on them to open another lane , but a person with only one or two items may spend a lot of time in line . they have done away with the self-service checkouts , which i think is a bad idea .	4142
0	this is probably the slowest safeway in scottsdale after 7pm . if you want to get in and get out quick after 7 pm then go to the grocery store across the street . this safeway used to be a lot more reliable after dark but something happened and they have really gone downhill a bit unfortunately	4142
0	i frequent the starbucks inside this location and like to sit outside and drink my coffee on the benches directly outside of the safeway . on numerous occasions safeway employees sit on a bench right next to me and start smoking . also , this location always seems to be out of shredded lettuce .	4142
0	management is absent , work a clerk shift and speak to staff . they will tell you what they tell your customers . checkout is way too long and makes customers go elsewhere .	4142
0	this safeway location is ok at best , just a typical grocery store with nothing really standing out about it . service is n't great and is n't terrible except that one time they messed up my order in the deli . i did fill in my survey about the experience and was never contacted - so i just presume customer service is n't a big thing for them . produce is hit and miss here , and the items they carry are your typical safeway offerings .	4142
0	want to buy one item ... each line 6 full carts deep not moving ... no more self-checkout ... that 's the story of this safeway and the others like it . 3 's a crowd ? they seemed to of given up on saying that over the loudspeaker because every line always has at least 3 people waiting in it . so instead of buying the item i decided to just leave . i miss self-checkout .	4142
0	pharmacist berkowitz , tall guy with mustache is a jerk . condescending , talks down and rude . stay clear of this clown , been there for 15 years too	4142
0	update on how terrible this delivery service is : safeway gave me a $ 75 credit to make up for the fact that i got my last grocery delivery 42 hours late . i used it to place another grocery delivery and , amazingly , i 've been waiting an additional 45 minutes for it outside of my 2-hour delivery window and it still has n't arrived and customer service ca n't find my driver . nice work , safeway .	4142
0	the worst store now that self check out has been removed . i stand in lines that are long and there is never enough staff . my neighborhood store is awful now . i now have to drive somewhere else .	4142
0	no self checkouts , and strangely surly employees , consistently . think about your favorite , efficient , friendly shopping and checkout experience , including pharmacy ... this is the opposite .	4142
0	once again let down by safeway . stood waiting for someone , paged for the department , still nobody shows . the people that paged them are standing and looking at me and did n't bother to page again . sorry they closed the albertsons near us as they were 110 % better with customer service .	4142
1	canadian tire on 130th has all the house , toys and auto needs you need . aisle are wider than say a walmart and selection is huge at this store . staff very friendly and pricing is always competitive . the toy aisles are little less than walmart but selection is very good . half store is dedicated to automative and that is what ct is known for . overall great location and store is clean and well layout .	4143
1	went in yesterday to fix a nail in my rear tire and the auto service attendant denis was not only super professional and timely , but also very kind and approachable . i did not feel like a nuisance as a girl that did n't know much about vehicles and i was so impressed with how welcoming they were . he gave me a time and price quote which were both accurate . very impressed !	4143
0	just a tip if you go there and you know what you want , get the item number from the online shop , otherwise these moliacks start to burn your life away , it 's a mission to make them check stuff on the online store to figure out what you talking about . today i went and tried to buy engine oil that is on sale , they recommended other stuff i did n't want instead of checking the online store , after 15min giving them sh*t i finally had my stuff and instead of $ 55 for 5.5 liters i paid 30.99 , what a mission ... .	4143
0	i went in to get a vehicle inspection done for a buyer of my car . the buyer agreed he would pay for the inspection . before i was informed the inspections was done . the buyer of the car that ask for the report got a copy before me . decide he did not want the car and left with out paying for the report . and i was stuck with the bill . because canadian tire . gives out report to any person with out asking or with out payment . i know my civil right of privacy . was disregarded at this location . they deserve a negative -5 star .	4143
1	great little cafe ! the food is amazing and they have some unique dishes on their breakfast menu . the lox scramble is my favorite ! the staff is very friendly and down to earth and norm is such a genuine guy ! i stop in for lunch every now and then when i feel like i need some comfort food . there is something on the menu for everyone . i definitely recommend to anyone looking for great food at good prices !	4144
1	been coming here for about 2 years . they always give me great service , and the food here is delicious ! ! ! lumberjack is the go to food when i come here . it consists of biscuits sausage egg bacon and gravy with a side of fruit or potatoes ! everyone is friendly here , i love the atmosphere . it 's not too crazy . kid friendly spot .	4144
1	my fiance ' and i were sat quickly even though it was a busy morning . we have passed this place countless times and finally decided to try it . breakfast was good , i had huevos rancheros and my fiance ' had the chicken fried steak ; i wish i had ordered that instead , it was really good . the portion sizes are good too . we will try it again for sure .	4144
1	went here twice for breakfast while i was in town for iron maiden - the food is good , the prices are reasonable , and the service is incredibly friendly . it is n't perfect ( the food comes out a little slow even when the place is n't packed ) , but it 's a decent breakfast stop .	4144
1	love this place . i 've been looking for eggs benedict here for a while ( i always end up at timbers for breakfast ! ) and this place has it ! not only do they have the og benedict , they have specialty ones ( crab cake benedict ? ! on the list to try ! ) breakfast is my favorite meal of the day , and i will be back to this place again ! it 's small , diner-y , friendly service and good food .	4144
1	i was bit nervous to read the bad reviews at this place and go having a breakfast with my wife . finally we made our moves and it well worth it . service is great and really fast like the inside brightness and make you eat more . food is above the average from other breakfast places and benedict was right on the money . we had the great food and the best service made our day ... great place and great fiid ! ! ! !	4144
1	surprising good ... the machaca burrito was good my wife had i believe country steak and eggs ... do n't remember exactly ... but what do remember was the ricotta lemon pancake ... but not in a good way sorry that was the only thing not crazy for ... the raider waitress was awesome ! ! ! not just because she is raider family but she was on point with the service ... the only thing i would add ... put some hash browns in the breakfast burrito	4144
1	i 've been going to norm 's since he first opened . the food is fairly priced and very good for filling breakfast food . lunch is good too . the cafe is a perfect mom and pop shop where you 're recognized when you come in and norm ( the owner ) is pretty much always there . working next door i like that i can wander over for a cup of hot chicken noodle soup or orange juice when i 'm sick or to get a quick , healthier bite instead of mcdonald 's down the street .	4144
1	love this little breakfast spot . good food , huge portions and staff is really friendly : ) if you want a good nap after breakfast , i recommend the lumberjack !	4144
1	my go to breakfast joint ! they have seating outside , which is nice when you have a dog with you . they are also dog friendly , offering water for my pup . great if you just came from the park ! love the staff , always friendly and attentive . the food not only taste great but serves in a big portion too . we will be coming here for a while : )	4144
1	came for the $ 5 breakfast , but there was n't any . food was still good . i ordered something simple ; eggs , potatoes , bacon and toast . my boyfriend ordered the huevos rancheros and i wish i would 've ordered that instead . it was filled with flavor . our waitress kept checking up on us . i would recommend this place .	4144
1	food is always great and service is always friendly . i love the steak oh la la . food is pretty fast . place is small and very clean .	4144
1	the best breakfast hands down , and the price makes it even better , this gentleman is incredible , norm is there almost every day working with his great team . they r fast the food is hot and made to order . btw try the french toast . good job norm keep up the good work will see u next week .	4144
1	the best eggs benedict i 've had in a long time . the service is really good and the waitresses super friendly . i thought i would give this place a try and i was very impressed .	4144
1	my go to place for breakfast and lunch ! love their hamburgers and fries ! their wraps are delicious and of course , ca n't go wrong with the pancakes , potatoes , and eggs ! hands down , my favorite place !	4144
0	if i could i would this place 1/2 a star , is was disgusting . i ordered the vegetable hash , i asked for no eggplant and egg whites , my whole plate was nothing but eggplant , and everything was wet . when the server came to clear the table he reached over me while i was eating and almost stuck his hand in my mouth . every person that ordered food with us was disappointed . never will i eat here again .	4144
0	decided to check out the best benedict claiming place out . not really . i 've had much better benedict and service elsewhere . never had my coffee refilled and everything took forever . wo n't be going back .	4144
0	came here for breakfast for first time with my son . service was good . food was 7 out of 10 at best . my reason for two stars was that my 6 year-old ordered milk with his breakfast . it was filled about 3/4 of the way full in a small kids cup . when i asked for refills , the waitress said no refills on milk but had no problem charging us $ 2.25 for that measly amount . pathetic , considering i was planning to purchase a $ 40 gift certificate before i left . after that experience , doubt we will even be back .	4144
0	i have been eyeballing this place for a while , having had some decent hopes for a nice quaint breakfast spot . unfortunately - the best two parts of this `` experience '' was quick available counter seating and the colored hair of each waitress who scrambled around dazed and confused . we ordered simplistic items that were made incorrectly and stared at dishwashers coming out from their station , driving their used water cups into the ice bin . it saddens me to give this place such a little boost but even my two stars is a probably overly charitable . i would n't recommend this spot to any close foodies of mine .	4144
0	sat for 10 minutes while other tables the came in after us got served . finally just walked out . 3 slow ass waitresses never even asled if we wanted water . it was like we were invisible . never again	4144
0	good food but horrible service . we saw a server to take our order , someone ran our food , and that 's it . nobody checked in , no refills . lousy time we had . cmon norm , you can do better .	4144
0	we had brunch at norms . it was busy on a sunday . we decided to get breakfast . we got the super breakfast combo for $ 9.95 . 3 eggs choice of ham sausage or bacon , pancakes and choice of either fruit or potatoes . the food was nothing special . my eggs a little runny . ok place . reminds me of a coffee shop . not somewhere id rush to go to but a restaurant i 'd completely avoid .	4144
0	bad all the way around . service sucked . steak was raw . biscuit and gravy was so bad i would not have gave it to my dog . the eggs sucked . everything was shitty . this place should close down asap .	4144
0	i noticed this place has a banner for the best eggs benedict , so i decided to stop by and try it . ordered a cup of coffee and a spinach and tomato benedict . half way through my coffee and over an hour past the time they open i find out norm ca n't make the sauce , the waitress asks if i would like something else . no tell norm to get in the kitchen and do his damn job . needless to say i 'll never be back .	4144
0	i ordered food for take out for my husband and i to eat at his work and by the time i got to norms to pick up the food the girl at the counter looked at me like i had 4 noses or something ... the other girl at the counter took over and was very nice paid for food and left , sit down to eat at husbands place and the food was tasteless had no flavoring at all it was chicken fried steak it should of at least had pepper in it , the gravy was like paste and flavorless just like the steak was ... i 'll try it again but so far not that impressed .	4144
0	walked in on a saturday morning . .we expected to be busy.waited 10 minutes to be seated , waited 30 mins at table ... no one in restaurant acknowledged us ... never got our order taken..so we walked out ! let 2 servers know and they said okay ! great way to run a buisness !	4144
0	had a young man named charlie washing dishes 6mos.thought better to let someone walk in off the street to give a job this kid charlie should of got maybe good food but norms work ethic sucks would not recommend	4144
0	the worst . the service was bad , the coffee was terrible . the `` fresh fruit '' was still frozen . eggs were cold and runny and they even found a way to ruin the bacon . the only thing they got right was the bill . i never write yelp reviews . ever . this place made me feel it was necessary . sorry norm .	4144
0	we had breakfast there today . my husband ordered an english muffin with his breakfast . never received it . his bacon was pre cooked and greasy . i had the chicken fried steak . as others have noted , it was horrible . had some kind of egg batter on it . it was obviously pre made and reheated . the worst part was that it tasted like it was old and starting to spoil . it tasted terrible ! the gravy was gooey and tasteless . we will never go back . the cook did not have a hat on as required by health code !	4144
0	service was ok but not inviting . the country fried steak was terrible . we also has the blt sandwich which was good . the fries and hash browns were plain . they have a cheap lunch menu but i will not return to try it .	4144
1	love this place great dive bar , deep rooted glendale hang out , my mother n sister used to party here in the 80 's ... .still a good glendale hangout id recommend this place to anyone wanting to unwind with good people great mix of music n a back patio to put high class places to shame ( as far as fun down home activities go ) ... , n glendales oldest titty bar across the street great fun for all ... ...	4145
1	really fun awesome place ! i love the cheap drinks and awesome atmosphere ! and there is so much to do ! i mean come on they have tether ball and a full size volleyball court ! who would n't love this place . a bit dirty and grimy but all good dive bars are !	4145
1	we go here several times a month and love this bar . bartenders are friendly and the place is clean . we play volleyball and hangout outside or play darts most of the time . we have never had a problem here . i am giving it 5stars but do wish they had more food other than nachos and basic tacos ( the tacos are pretty decent after a few drinks ) . i seriously look forward to nights spent at this bar .	4145
1	the customer service is great . the drinks are just right . the outdoor setting is amazing . the crowds are a mixture of everyone . the military fly boys hang there . the owner personally greets you , and if you 're nice they might buy you a drink . this place is all about our military and their families . i absolutely love this place . they got it just right .	4145
1	great place to have a beer and some bar food . occasionally has live music out back . non pretentious hangout .	4145
1	i had a blast here . there is so much going on everyone in your group will be happy . indoor & outdoor bar . pool , darts , volleyball , tetherball , horseshoes , basketball . live band outside , dj inside . i 'm sure i 'm forgetting plenty . but the drinks were great . people were laid back . i will for sure be back .	4145
1	great dive bar vibe with great staff and drinks ! biker crowd but never witnessed any drama . very relaxed air and feels more homelike then other bars around the area	4145
1	awesome place just to kick back and have a good time . friendly staff and plenty of entertainment . always my go to and by far my favorite dive bar around here . good cheap drinks and always something going on .	4145
1	i love this place ! they have an outdoor band and inside dj ! for a night out of dancing this is where we go with our friends !	4145
0	bearded bar staff sucks . cant smile . new owners i think . whole staff is about raking your money . the old faithful ( large ) crowd has left . the food sucks now . they used to cook steaks on a grill outside . surely losing money and soon to change owners . go at your own risk .	4145
0	pretty fun bar but not happy with my pitchers of beer not being priced consistently correct . instead , i pay $ 14.00 for a pitcher and than ask for another and than it 's $ 17.00 and than it 's $ 18.00 . who knows what 's going on but obviously i 'm being shafted . that sucks	4145
0	i 've been coming here for years , and my drink prices for the same pitcher , are always changing every weekend , $ 20 for one pitcher is a joke , but then again am i paying for lucile 's birthday ? ? ! ? screw this place ! !	4145
0	my sister was roofied here ! the owner refused to check the surveillance cameras ! go at your own risk ! never leave your drinks unattended .	4145
0	and in case anyone wonders . the drink was in her hand . someone `` accidentally `` bumped into her .	4145
0	this place is owned by unprofessionals they hire a band and then they go to get paid and they do n't pay them ? i wo n't go back and it 's too bad not a bad place ... no more !	4145
0	horrible service , dingy , dj 's suck . saw her kick people out that were being harassed by what looked like the owners friends . not good service .	4145
0	came for fun but karaoke guy , andrian , screwed up all the time ! ! ! ! ! sooooo loud feedback that everyone 's ears hurt ! ! ! ! ! omg ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! not ever back if he is around ! ! ! ! ! ! ! by bartender and all other staff are good	4145
0	this place is a dive . the food , well never order bar food ! ! lol ! ! the service sucks . these people are smug & .nasty . it 's like a club there , if you 're not a fat tattooed biker male or female lol ! you do n't belong there . and it 's as if they ca n't afford to pay a decent bands . when i was there i could n't believe they called that crap music or those dirty looking band members musicians . to many choices to end up in the middle of no where on a weekend ! peace out !	4145
1	i borrowed a friends costco card with the sole purpose of purchasing the cackalacky cheerwine bbq sauce , little did i know i would walk out spending over $ 100 . i love costco just as much as i love sams . i am seriously considering getting my own membership to have both . while both sold the same type products , the options did vary at both . where i found a variation of 1 item at one that the other did have . after walking into costco i 'd felt i 'd been missing out on awesome deals .	4146
1	popular and busy place . we made a stop to fill up on gas . price was much better than what we pay in our home state .	4146
1	i buy all of my food here and most of my stuff - those who watch parks a rec will understand . and if your not full from the free samples at lunch time on saturday grab a dog and drink combo for $ 1.50 best deal in town . love this place !	4146
1	costco brings a lot of happiness to my life . great gas prices , great samples , awesome selection of food , etc etc . i try a lot of new foods here and end up with cases of it . service is always a+ here too . only negative is the states fault ... let costco sell alcohol so i can buy kirklands vodka ! grrrrr .	4146
1	we shop here at least once a month or more . i will never be able to buy produce from anywhere else the prices can not be beat . plus lunch for me and the hubs under $ 10 !	4146
1	love the location of this cosco , really clean , nice store , overall really good experience here compared to mine in ohio , downside , the lines are usually pretty long , especially when picking up contacts . they must have a busy optical department . workers are extremely friendly though !	4146
1	you seriously can not beat the kirkland brand . their coffee brand.. well ... know they work with that green lady ... ..lived in seattle for ten years , not only is the quality excellent , meat the best.. but they always have copper river salmon when it 's in season ! it 's the best ! ! ( not farm raised artificially colored stuff ) . love our costco ! ! just wish nc allowed the liquor license too , so i highly love visiting family in kentucky for that ! this company treat employees reallllly well too . will always support that !	4146
1	discovered another something else amazing about costco today . my car battery died in the parking lot . i called aaa , but it was going to take them over an hour to get there . we went into the tire center to see if they could replace a battery . they do sell batteries , but they do n't install them . they will give you a battery with jumper cables to jump your car for free though ! we were able to jump the car and drive it somewhere to get a new battery . costco never ceases to impress me !	4146
0	unfortunately at checkout the cashier was more interested in talking to his friends rather than actually provide even minimal customer service . worst costco i have ever been in .	4146
0	very rude customer service at the food court this saturday evening . have used my master card multiple times in this same food court . apparently they started accepting only visa card . that itself is n't an issue . but when paying customers asked if they do n't accept any other cards , they were exceptionally rude asking me to get off the line . this simple does n't warrant such rude response from the woman at the counter . should have given half the star or no star , but there is no option in yelp .	4146
0	i love costco , but this location is the worst . it is a disorganized mess . they have so much stuff crammed into the store , and such poor planning , that it 's impossible to find anything . they constantly move certain products all over the store , so it 's like a game of hide-and-seek if you buy anything regularly . i am no longer going to this location ; i live halfway between starmount and independence ; i 'll be going to the independence location from now on .	4146
0	oh my gosh ! now they do n't even hide that much of the frozen yogurt you get at the snack bar is actually air , and the portion is much smaller . why would such a profitable company be so mean spirited at their snack bar ?	4146
0	drove 30 miles to purchase a membership for my mother-in-law . was supposed to be a christmas gift but was told we could n't buy one for someone else . really ? i guess sams club has all our future business .	4146
0	costco wireless department does a terrible job at switching customers from verizon to att . we switched over six month ago and are still waiting for the promised rebates to pay for the early termination fees . do n't recommend to use them .	4146
0	they barely honor their appointment . they promised it takes 1.5h at most to change all four tires , once they `` start to work on it '' . yet took me a total of 3 hours waiting there . if you ca n't pull my car in within 1.5hours of my appointment time , why making the appointment then ?	4146
0	why are the employees here so rude ? ! i 've had a hand full of bad experiences . today a woman walked away while helping me at the customer service desk . she did n't say if she was coming back or anything..no she just walked away and left me standing there until i got brave enough to ask someone else why she left . so rude ! and it was n't anything complicated & i was n't complaining , if anything i was very patient with her lack of knowledge with the computer . wish i had a closer option to my house .	4146
1	i have been a patient of this dental office since it has opened . dr. flores is by far the most gentle dentist i have ever dealt with . he is super efficient and they will never give you a run around in reference to what dental care you need . the staff is phenomenal and the office manager , ky , is always on point and always ready to answer any questions i may have about insurance .	4147
1	a coworker recommended dr. flores after my tooth broke the other day . i 'm pretty picky about dentists and avoid going unless it 's urgent . this was the case , and am happy i did . they were able to squeeze me in right away and finished extracting the tooth . even better - the pain was minimal . i 'm definitely going back for the rest of my dental needs . thank you dr. flores and your staff .	4147
1	very good dentist . i 've been to a few in this town and have had bad experiences . this place definitely exceeded my expectations and the dentist is gentle and kind .	4147
0	this place is the worst family dental office ever . they do n't care about your child 's opinion . they send them away without treating them for pain . they offered to do a three day follow-up while our child sits on the couch and cries . we made an appointment for her to go before school and she could n't even take her final because of all her pain . i called back and asked why . the dentist was snide and said she did n't need it after i told her she would not be returning . complete abuse of authority .	4147
0	sent me home in pain with infection only gave me antibiotics after i asked , no pain pills he said i 'd be ok , ended up in urgent care where a gpmd gave me correct antibiotic , and ibu and narco , still had faith so i tried to reschedule waited week and half for him to get home from vacation now he refuses to see me , horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible , avoid at all cost ,	4147
0	i had a bad experience at this dentist . their scheduling is rediculous . and some of their staff is rude . unless you want to wait months for treatment i 'd suggest going elsewhere . i 'd go into more detail but i 'd rather not tarnish dr flores reputation . the only advice i can give you , is to always seek a second opinion when the treatment involves permanently altering your teeth .	4147
1	a great church to attend sunday service . a church that 's filled with talented , passionate , and wonder followers . people are so down to earth , and the teaching sticks to the bible . there are all kinds of ministries to explore , so everyone can find a good fit to volunteer or just to simply connect with others .	4148
1	my husband and i were visiting toronto and my mother-in-law who lives in nearby wanted to visit pastor price 's church . so incredibly glad that we did . this is a non-denomination christina church and it was a refreshing sunday morning in the word with pastor price and his congregation . = )	4148
0	i asked this church for help because i was alone and did n't know anyone that could help me in toronto . i got absolutely no help from anyone in this church . not even a friendly hello . in fact the leaders of this church were quite patronizing , and full of themselves . i tried to contact the senior pastor charles price about 10 times , but he never got back to me . my calls were being blocked by his personal secretary . the people that run this church are pretty nasty .	4148
0	any church that speaks of suicide stats , gender wars and so so on is not a house of the lord . i do not feel inspired going to this place .	4148
1	very good spot . the wings are the best you can find in medina for sure ! have n't tried the burgers yet , because the wings are too good to pass up on	4149
1	great burgers ! service is always top notch . pretty cool atmosphere . nothing really to complain about . it 's kinda weird that they only have milkshakes when they 're `` in season '' , whatever the hell that means lol , but oh well .	4149
1	good food but limited menu and the service varies depending on who 's working . i recommend the mac n cheese sandwich ... daddy mac maybe it 's called ?	4149
1	i give this place 5 stars for their burgers and atmosphere ! where else can you chow on a delicious monster burger while you sit in a really old bank vault ! ! do n't hesitate to check it out ! !	4149
1	picked up a longmire to go and it was really good . the burger was well cooked and came with fresh cut fries .	4149
1	we love this place . the food is very good , and they make the best , freshest burgers i have ever had . their other food is equally as good , and the service is very good . it is kid friendly , but it still has a really nice , authentic pub style . its a real gem in medina ! highly recommend it to anyone .	4149
1	all i had was a burger & onion rings , but that was enough to satisfy my hungry belly . i travel all over trying out different burgers & have to say the buckeye buck burger has instantly shot into my top 3 . simple & delicious . i was full but could have eaten a second . very impressed . ca n't wait to try a different variant	4149
1	great place to watch the game ! beer selection and buckeye buck burger were exceptional . service was very friendly , bartender morgan was really helpful ( and patient ) with beer selection . will return for sure !	4149
1	looking for a good burger for my night out with my teen son . we found it at pj marley 's . we decided to try this place after all the photos on yelp . very accurate . i had traditional cheeseburger . my son enjoyed the cowboy burger ( i think that 's what it was called ) it had chili on it . he scrapped most of the chili off and made his own chili fries . great prices , great portions . only negative comment ... cnn was on the tv . no one wants to watch the news , trying to enjoy a night out .	4149
1	had dinner here tonight . the hubby and i both got burgers and sat in the vault . we had reservations to sit in the vault , it was cool but the front door kept blowing in and it was chilly out , plus people are gawking at it while your trying to eat . burgers were pretty good , prices decent . i think we will go back and i 'll try the chicken sandwich .	4149
1	our favorite restaurant hands down . we get the same order every time we 're there because we look so forward to it ( mac daddy and safecracker ... mac and cheese and bacon , on a bun ? ? ! ? yes please ! ) . we try to make it there every friday night to grab a beer and snack on some pickle chips . greg , the bartender who 's there on fridays , is awesome ! bonus : they always have the games on so its just another reason to make it up there to enjoy some stellar burgers and fries .	4149
1	stopped by for dinner on a road trip . it 's a neat atmosphere - they 've updated an old time ' y bank to a gastro pub . you can even sit in the old vault ( fits up to 8 people ) . the service was good and the food good too . i had the pj taco salad and my family had burgers . beet sliders were a treat and the onion rings well made . we liked the free parking behind the building too .	4149
1	great service from liam and good food ! a nice place for some good food and live entertainment . liam took special care to avoid my onion allergy .	4149
0	recent trip to medina on late saturday afternoon . service was fast and friendly - no complaints there . unique decor and atmosphere . we went for the burgers b/c of the rave reviews but all four adults left not happy with their burgers ! we all ordered a different specialty burger and fries ( the fries are outstanding btw ) but none of us cared for the texture of the burger . just a very weird color , texture and mouth feel . they also use a seasoning mix on the burgers that we did not like either .	4149
0	went here for father 's day , our son took us there and was here the previous weekend and said it was good . not so today ... service was poor..almost one hour to get our food with the waitress only coming around once to refill coffee . the eggs were over cooked , the bacon undercooked , toast cold but the one good thing on the plate were the hash browns . the place was not even full so there was no excuse . not sure i will ever give this place another go round ! ! one star for the hash browns .	4149
0	i enjoy the food here - they do have some of the best onion rings i 've ever had . the service , however , is terrible -- ridiculously ( almost hilariously ) slow .	4149
0	i want to like this place . i 've been here 3 times and it 's is ridiculously slow . zero service .	4149
0	was so excited to try this place unfortunately it 's just taking up space in the square . their menu has like 10 items , no liquor , and their wine selection is very small . i ordered the longmire burger because it sounded delicious . the burger had zero flavor and was very dry . also our table was literally right in front of the restroom doors . overall ... ..not good . wo n't be back .	4149
0	stopped in here based on the rating/reviews . the service was great and they have vernor 's ginger ale ( the best ) in their soda fountain , but unfortunately the wings and burger my friends and i ordered were so greasy they could n't be eaten . our female server was great about comping the wings .	4149
0	after waiting 45 minutes to get a table we waited another 45 minutes to get our food . 2 salads and a burger took way too long . we asked for grilled onions instead of raw and got raw anyway . chicken on the salad was tough ( over microwaved ? ) we were told the kitchen is `` really `` busy . terrible excuse for bad service . they did take $ 2 off the burger but does n't make up for the experience .	4149
0	pj marley 's is n't the worst restaurant i 've been to , but it also just has n't been very impressive to me . i 've been several times with friends and family and each time i left just feeling there were better choices out there . the food to me has always been bland and if you have something with a dressing or topping its slathered on . i also have yet to get french fries that were not burnt to a crisp , even after asking for a new batch . service is acceptable , not bad , not good . beer selection is alright as long as what you order is still in stock .	4149
0	who closes because of a county fair and does n't post it on their website ? we traveled 35 minutes and while we looked for a new restaurant three other groups showed up ( one traveling 45 minutes ) to find restaurant closed .	4149
0	beautiful restaurant . unfortunately , we waited 30 minutes for appetizers , that we ended up returning , because they were n't very good . our server took our order , and we had to actually get up , and search for her to return our food and get our check . terrible service , below average food . will not return .	4149
0	made an effort to get there for a quick bite and a glass of wine . looked good on the website . was n't sure which wine to pick and asked if i could taste the house cabernet and was told they do n't allow tasting of wine as per their policy . i ordered a glass of red anyways since we were already there and regretted not liking it and it was a total waste of our time , effort and money . would never reommend this place . thx dr md	4149
0	forgotten by the waitress and a extremely well done burger ( ordered medium ) made for a disappointing lunch	4149
0	this was our 1st visit on a lenten friday looking forward to a fish fry . we ordered the pollack which was the only deep fried fish what we got was 3 pieces of grocery store frozen fish ! ! ! ! the `` french fries appetizer '' with cheese sauce and bacon pieces was mush ! the cole slaw was horrible with big chunks of cabbage ( not precooked ) and big chunks of onions . we opted out of dessert honestly i 've had better giant eagle frozen fish . the only reason this place gets 2 stars is the flavored hard cider ( mckensies ) ) was really good . i had 2 ! will not return	4149
1	i always had a great experienced every time i come here . mia , did a great job as always . job was excellent with my teeth cleaning . she 's friendly and caring . dr. khorshid and his assistant martina , thank you for the amazing service . keep it up .	4150
1	my experience with abc dental is simply awesome . dr kevin and martina are the best tandem i 've ever come across . if you 're looking for excellent service , great staff and a pleasant atmosphere , then abc dental is the place for you .	4150
1	i just had my dental filling today..thank you so much to dr. khorshid and martina for the service and experience , it was my first dental filling and i had a great experience . thank you abc dental for the great service !	4150
0	this office has the worst customer service i have ever experienced before . i came in for a deep cleaning . i was experiencing pain which is why i called to follow-up with the doctor . he never called me back . the front desk is terrible including the office manger evelyn ! the doctor never calls you back if your experiencing pain . worst dental practice ever ! ! ! never go in and visit them . run if you can from this practice	4150
0	he is a con artist and does not know how to do implants , i spent thousands and had to go to another dentist to fix his work . his license should be revoked ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4150
0	let me start by saying the staff is friendly however that 's about all that 's good here . long wait time past the appointment time and this is the only dentist i 've been to where cleaning is n't part of your regular check up . waste of time .	4150
1	i really do n't understand why fairmont bagel gets the buzz - st-viateur is where it 's at if you want a great bagel , lots of choice in preparations ( i had the plateau - yummy ) , and a cup of coffee . they have nice open air seating with the large windows facing the street . the service was snappy and friendly , and the prices were fine . cup of coffee , $ 2 . not bad . tourists - this is your place for an authentic montreal bagel with delicious fixings ! note - cash or debit only .	4151
1	looooooooooooove it ! ! ! ! the bagels are amazing ! i 've never actually sat down and had a meal at this place but the dishes that were going out to tables as i was ordering my bagels looked delish !	4151
1	so good ! it 's been more than a month since my last visit to st. viateur and i still dream about these bagel sandwiches and the delicious [ imitation ] crab salad . why must you be so far , montreal ? tip 1 : split the lox because one entire order of it may get a little bleh . ( between the three of us , we shared the lox and the turkey club , which was out of this world ! ) tip 2 : the all-dressed bagel is the absolute best .	4151
1	i went to the location on avenue mont royal est . this is a great , lively place to come for lunch while in the plateau district . there are n't many tables , so you may find yourself waiting for 10 to 20 minutes . once you order food , it comes pretty fast . the fake crab salad is awesome . `` salad de goberge '' in québécois .. a lot of food businesses and cafes in this area pride themselves on offering st-viateur bagels .	4151
1	food was great . service was good , though it took them a while to take our orders . waiting line was considerable .	4151
1	i loveeeee their bagels ! every time we go to montreal , we have to get their bagel ! ! i wish they were in toronto too !	4151
1	so cool watching the bagels being cooked in the giant open oven . ordered bagels to go , including cinn-raisin and rosemary/sea salt . employees were super friendly and patient with our futile attempt at speaking french .	4151
1	this is a great brunch place . right in the heart of the monkland village , it 's a reasonably priced option that has good food and good service . i highly recommend the pavarotti omelette , cheese , sausage and pesto ... ... delicious combo . the bagels are made fresh on the spot . there 's usually a wait but that should be expected for a weekend brunch .	4151
1	cool pour manger des bagels frais et chauds . must montréalais dans un quartier branché et a voir	4151
1	you ca n't go wrong with this bagel place . i come here to grab a bag a bagels and go ! many different bagels to choose from . you ca n't go wrong !	4151
1	loved the bagels . hand rolled and baked in a brick oven . do they sway this old brooklyn boys heart from the ones i used to enjoy in the deli 's on division in brooklyn ? ? ? naw ! forget about it ! but they are the best i have tasted since my brooklyn days . they are so good you can just eat them with no filling or cream cheese or anything . i am looking forward to ordering some from there and having them shipped to me and get some from brooklyn and compare . yes folks it will be a bagel-off !	4151
1	i love their bagels so much . actually the size was small but it was so fresh and delicious ! ! i could n't stop eating . i prefer sesame bagel . this bagel is totally different one in the us because they use a special oven , not electronic one . also it was good to see how they make bagels in the kitchen .	4151
1	les meilleurs bagels de montréal . on assiste en direct à la fabrication et les objets de notre convoitise passent encore tout chauds du four à notre bouche . un délice .	4151
1	not quite what i expected from a bagel store as i am visiting from the us . there are no places to sit and you basically order to go . they do n't add any spreads for you so you will have to purchase them separately and do it yourself . the bagel is more dense then the bagels i get in us and it is worth a try .	4151
1	ordered an everything bagel with smoked salmon cream cheese and ohhh my goodness ... delicious . i 've never had such a delicious smoked salmon cream cheese . it 's almost as if they purée it into the cream cheese . will be back !	4151
1	friendly service and tasty bagels . they give you plenty of cream cheese for all ( 5 ) bagel quarter slices that they give you .	4151
1	really great bagels . did not disappoint . had to wait in line , and it is cash only , but still worth it to try these classic bagels . i recomend `` the traditional '' with smoked salmon , etc .	4151
1	c'est un vrai régal de manger les bagels de st-viateur , surtout quand ils sont encore tout chaud . on peut manger sur place ou emporter et préparer les bagels les soi . un des meilleurs endroits pour les bagels et en plus , les prix sont très corrects .	4151
1	your bagel is dressed up to perfection . especially when still warm right out of the oven . great brunch place .	4151
1	came here in july for our trip to montreal . fell in love with montreal bagels . ordered a bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese and capers for takeout as there was no available seating . it was very good . expensive , about $ 10 .	4151
1	definitely different than a new york style bagel , but i enjoyed ! picked up bagels and got a few different options , went for the regular sesame which was my favorite as it was being churned out fresh ( literally they picked my bagel up off the pile that had just come out of the oven ) . also got an everything bagel which was very good and the rosemary and salt , which did n't taste very fresh ... .probably would n't get again . very inexpensive , definitely worth the trip when in montreal !	4151
1	great little bagel spot ! there were n't any tables available when we got there , but within about 5 minutes we had a spot to sit . candace had a sandwich of some sort and i had an everything bagel and a sangria . all the food was great and service was pretty good as well . they only take canadian debit cards , just fyi .	4151
0	not as good as fairmount bagel , but got a place to sit . nothing more than american bagels , kind of disappointed . slow service , long line , a bit annoying waiter . not recommended	4151
0	when i heard that montreal was in the business of making good bagels , i was excited to try it out and see if they could give new york a run for their money . well they do n't ... not even close . the dough is sweet , texture is fine , but the taste is `` meh '' i have had a better bagel from a grocery store . also the topping options were just weird . i stuck to the standard lox option but my friend ordered something with eggplant on it and she basically did n't eat any of it .	4151
0	there is a long line at l'aveneue so we come here instead . it turns out a bad choice . bad service and we are not into the food . wo n't come back again .	4151
0	the bagel is way over rated honestly . it 's good but you have to know that the place is tiny and the line is huge eating inside means you will wait and your order will take a while plus the waiters take only cash if you want to pay by debit you have to line up for the cashier , it 's crazy too many lines you made me wana vomit the bagel if you are hygiene ocd do n't go there ! the waitress touched your sweaty arms and they took the orange slice and put it in my orange juice cup and the kitchen server touched my partner plate with her bare hands and took out the tomato	4151
0	it 's ok. pretending to be the real st-viateur . but the bagels are n't as good . i 'd give it a 2.5 if they would let me .	4151
0	i was really looking forward to trying a montréal bagel , especially after getting a taste of wood-fired bagels in ottawa at kettleman 's . st. viateur was disappointing - i got a multi-grain bagel with regular cream cheese . the bagel had that great wood-fired crunch , but the texture was dry and the flavor was extremely bland , like the bagel was no-salt-added . the location and shop itself were great . we had a nice time , but i would n't go back for a bagel .	4151
0	cash or debit cards only , no credit cards . not great for international visitors . fair enough , but there 's not much signage about this until you get to the counter to pay , and this is a brick and mortar establishment . most food trucks these days will take credit . the bagels are decent , a bit on the small side , side of fruit is a nice touch . service is okay .	4151
0	looked forward to trying their bagels . bagels were good but the grouchiest , most rude staff experience ever ! one particular waitress made it her mission to keep us waiting because we must 've offended her by looking at an open table on our own . she looked like she hated customers . i 'd grab the bagels and go .	4151
0	their cream cheeses are very good but bagels are nothing special . after my family paid for our meal the waitress chases after me asking for more tip . i did n't know what happened but asked for more money because her tip was n't `` enough '' . i gave her extra not knowing the entire situation until learning later she was already given tip . seriously you get what you get based on how the payee feels about your service . w-o-w !	4151
0	visiting with 3 other guys we were hoping to try a bagel from a mom and pop shop but unfortunately turned down because we were american . the person greeted us with 'canada is better ' type remark , and then when i asked what kind of bagels she had she told us to get out and go next door because they serve people like you . so if you 're visiting from the states i recommend faking an accent or go somewhere else .	4151
0	their cream cheeses are very good but bagels are nothing special . after my family paid for our meal the waitress chases after me asking for more tip . i did n't know what happened but asked for more money because her tip was n't `` enough '' . i gave her extra not knowing the entire situation until learning later she was already given tip . seriously you get what you get based on how the payee feels about your service . w-o-w !	4151
0	pas mal déçu . la bouffe était correcte ( le bagel était bon et la soupe `` moyenne '' était plutôt grande ) mais le service n'était pas à la hauteur . l'ambiance est un peu trop froide et `` néon '' à mon goût , ce n'était pas très propre . félicitations au serveur pour nous avoir apporté un couteau à beurre plutôt qu'une cuillère à soupe .	4151
0	we walked a very long time to get here . the line up was also long ( which tells me this place must be good ) . however the server was very rude and unhelpful ... wow ! i 'd say this place is a bit pricy for what you 're served and especially given the low level of service . even asking for a refill of how water put fear in me ... the look i got was unreal , for hot water ? i had a tea for goodness sakes ...	4151
0	very disappointed . visited to get a bagel to go ( after buying their bagels ever since i moved to montreal this was a no brainer ) . unfortunately , after waiting at least 5 minutes trying to get an employees attention ( at least 15 people working ) once i asked an employee to get a bagel to go they responded by yelling `` tabernack ! '' to my face 3 times . left immediately . never going back .	4151
0	was just trying to decide what we wanted via window browsing . the person manning the shop tapped the window with her knife and `` shooed '' us away . although i heard this place was good , i will not be going here simply from the rude and potentially discriminatory customer service .	4151
0	just left sv bagel and cafe . bagels taste very bland and kind of hard , not crispy . the rosemary was a good flavor but the bagel itself is very underwhelming . not sure if it 's because we came an hour before close but i was not impressed at all !	4151
0	the place is nice , atmosphere is dark and cozy . the blazing hot brick oven at centre stage was goin the whole time as they were trudging out sesame bagel after sesame bagel . kinda cool to see how they do they 're thing . pricey for sure and ultimately we both feel like montreal bagels were definitely more hype than anything else . we 'll take our toronto bagels just fine thanks . not worth the trip really ...	4151
0	we arrived early and were seated right away . then we were promptly ignored . the waitress took orders and brought drinks for people who had arrived after us . i tried to flag someone else down and they turned towards their coworker and chatted . the food did arrive quickly . $ 12.50 for lox bagel ( good amount of toppings ) and soup or salad . added another bagel for $ 1.50 . soup not available in the mornings so if you do n't want the soup or salad take off $ 3.00 . bottomless coffee is $ 2.50 . there is another location . i will go to that one instead . or any other bagel place in montreal .	4151
0	good salads and bagels . not friendly staff and no internet . i do n't recommend the chai latté nor the biscuits .	4151
0	what 's the big deal ? ! these bagels did n't have that much of a different flavor . it was also crazy expensive to sit and eat . $ 5 for a chai ! ! ! ? ? ? the bagels were cold-ish and the service was ok . i would n't make a special trip here for bagels . did n't see the hoopla .	4151
0	traveller warning ! ! ! ! ! if you pay cash , the waiter will have the chance to stolen your money . they just put your changes on the disk and leave away without stop . i have been stolen 10 cad .i ask them to check the ccav of the cashier , they told me no problem at all . of course , the cashier have a computer for caculation and have no chance to stolen any money . wait , the most interesting part is : she still ask me to let the tip and the told me the tip should over 15 % ... what a scam ! !	4151
0	the bagel is good , but the sandwiches and salads are disappointing . the prices are high for the low quality of food , some of which seemed straight out of a jar . the lack of good service was also disappointing . i would come here only to get the bagels , and not bother with waiting for a table for mediocre sandwiches/salads and bad service .	4151
1	just an overall good place to go for whatever kind of time you 're trying to have . it 's a much more lively atmosphere than that of most gaming bars in town . the staff there is amazing , joey , brian and chris are all phenomenal bartenders and will always take great care of you . the food is always consistent which means something too .	4152
1	not only was the food great..our waitress shannon was the best waitress we have ever had ! ..very personable and friendly..we will definitely come back..mainly because of her ! !	4152
1	i just started coming here for lunch and i love it . the bartenders are amazing and very enthusiastic . the food is incredible . i am trying something new everyday and i have yet to be disappointed . if you need suggestions on what to get , you can always ask the bartenders . and they will go into very details on what is on the menu . the prices are very reasonable here as well . since i will be coming here for lunch everyday . i want something that is well priced . and this place is jst that . tldr ; great price , great food , great service	4152
1	this is by far my favorite place to come on my day off . if i 'm a little strapped i can always still get something great and if i am blessed to splurge i can get something awesome haha rice and beans here are the best and out due any other type here in vegas , wahoos is a must try	4152
1	great place to grab drink with friends . we could hang out here all night . the bartenders and really nice too . they have cheap food and it pretty good , definitely gon na come here more .	4152
1	the food is really good and is reasonably priced . i 've come to this location a couple of times and the staff has always been nice and very friendly . i had a couple of instances where there was a delay in getting my phone order food on time . however , one of the representatives there named matt took care of these concerns in a very professional manner ; i 'll definitely continue coming here in the future .	4152
1	their food selection is decent , beer selection is spectacular . i have to be in the mood for their meals , but the bar atmosphere is what gives them 4 stars for me .	4152
1	flavorful and healthy food served by a nice wait staff . great lunch fare . no sleeping at your desk a few hours later from the sugar drop .	4152
1	have to say that after our treatment at a competitors bar we are happy to be here . after a long week it was nice to have great service . chris was respectable and on top of it . drink never empty and he made sure we were comfortable and well served . food was great and beer was cold . they have earned our business and is our go to spot on our friday 's . thank you wahoos for taking care of ems and first responders . one thing i wish is that they had breakfast food , but that 's how it goes . treated well and good fish tacos hard to beat .	4152
1	very fresh food . the tacos , beans , and rice , are all fresh and delicious ( most importantly not fried ! ! ) . comparable to the california locations .	4152
1	make sure to come hangout on the late shift chris he 's a cool bartender always nice and helpful like to come get some good food and drink	4152
1	food was great . great service and staff was friendly . robert the cook was a cool dude	4152
1	2nd time shrimp tacos , black beans and rice , wow those were so good . beyond good . i will get some pics of the bar etc .	4152
1	great food and service by owner shelly and her crew ! clean and oh so tasty . just like being home in costa mesa ! !	4152
1	food is excellent with a lot of good flavors & service is friendly . the bartender , shannon , was so fun & made some excellent food recommendations . their new kale salad is amazing ! for the price , you ca n't go wrong .	4152
1	always down for fish tacos ! ! their fish tacos are not the best in the world but they are good , i enjoyed their combo with rice and beans . for a fast food type of restaurant it was n't bad . i thought the menu was a little confusing , but the lady at the front explained it to me . cool deco , you get a california beachy feeling when your in the restaurant . plus i got a free fish taco coupon expiring in a year , so will definitely come back .	4152
1	another wonderful experience at wahoo 's ! shannon recommended i try something new and i 'm glad she did ! street tacos were great , though blackened fish tacos with citrus slaw are still my favorite ! ! ! ! i will definitely be back for more ! ! ! !	4152
1	fish tacos were the bomb and the wahoo fries killer must have the service was outstanding and th e food was brought out fast and ready to eat .	4152
1	i just love this restaurant . i go so much the staff know exactly how i like my burrito . they will make it special order just how i like it . the staff is very good and courteous . i have all my business lunches there . the green sauce is to die for .	4152
1	love this place in ca and now in vegas ! they are so nice & helpful with great healthy food options and a laid back atmosphere . huge bar area with video poker/blackjack and lots of dining space . the only thing they need is mobile ordering !	4152
1	food was great ... .the green sauce is a must ! ! ! i recommend the shrimp burrito .	4152
1	i like this place a lot . it 's extremely reasonably priced and all of the ingredients taste healthy and fresh . it 's almost a fast food price but with proper restaurant type food . the atmosphere is also enjoyable . i like the interior design of the place very surfer type vibe . i also like the bar there as well . great price for great food	4152
1	if you 're coming for lunch you need to be here between 11-1130 or you 'll be waiting in line . every time i 've come here i try something different and every time i leave satisfied and happy . great portions and my bills have all been under $ 10 . the owner is always walking around and chatting it up . good business practice . food= good service= great price= awesome the sauces are really great too !	4152
1	this is my favorite place to come after work on a friday . shout out to bob , tammy and jen . best bartenders ever ! it can get busy on fridays , yet this team is always positive , professional and friendly . maui onion rings are to die for . shrimp bowl is fabulous . shrimp is never over cooked . seasoning is always perfectly balanced and true to the southwestern/so cal style and the rice is cooked to just the right tenderness and separation . want friendly , attentive service and good food at a great price . come to this wahoos !	4152
1	was really impressed with the service & food . definitely better tasting than rubios . bigger portions , more options & less expensive too ! !	4152
1	update : i 'm pleased to say the bar door is closed as the default . it really smells much better and i sat purposely close to the door just to see how good or bad it was .	4152
1	as a gal originally from southern california i was in the mood for some wahoo 's . thank god some have been sprouting up in las vegas ! when i first started coming ro this wahoo 's my car or the girl of my girlfriend was one of only a few in the lot . now the lot is always packed . the service is super speedy and they remeber our orders now . they have an awesome happy hour . i wish it was n't so far out in the boonies .	4152
1	i always enjoy stopping at wahoo 's when i 'm in socal or in vegas . always have the best fish tacos of anywhere . i wish we had one up in wa state . clean , simple , fresh and tasty food . the staff at this location was awesome . service was better than some fine dining places i 've eaten at .	4152
1	so yummy !	4152
1	i had no idea this place was even here ! a friend suggested it . i ordered fish tacos , spicy with slaw . it was really tasty ! no beans or rice . just a simple 3 taco plate , and some chips on the side . only $ 10 bucks ! - not bad , right ? the service was really friendly and funny . the dining room was busy but definitely not crowded . i would go back for sure !	4152
1	best fish taco i have found in vegas yet ! the kale salad is also super on point . i am impressed that they have a unique beer selection on tap from a craft brewery and the prices are incredibly cheap for the quality and service . hands down coming back as much as i can .	4152
1	i will say i have never dined in , i always get it delivered via uber eats , but i seriously love the food . and i can get it 24/7 . prices are great , and i can live off the tortilla soup , beans and rice . i can tell it 's fresh and i value that a lot . a lot of great vegetarian options ! love love love	4152
1	incredible experience . everyone was super friendly , helpful and inviting . the food was delicious and the restaurant was very well kept . it felt like being at home . would definitely recommend to anyone for a great experience !	4152
1	came here to grab some quick dinner on the way home . being a first time customer was n't sure what to expect . i was very impressed full bar and restaurant . friendly staff ben was great and had great recommendations for food . food tasted great i will deffinetly be back .	4152
0	i recently went to this location and ordered the chicken rice bowl . later that night i started to feel not so good . this was the only thing i had eaten that day so i know food poisoning when it happens . i spoke to a friend of mine who had chicken tacos and he also told he had gotten food poisoning also . i would say stay clear from the chicken ! !	4152
0	thought i would try something different and ordered the son of a classic burrito . i am pretty sure it is not supposed to be cold , but i wo n't send food back . the results are often worse . this place never ceases to leave me bewildered .	4152
0	u should call this place robertos . and that would be an insult to mr. roberto himself . i had the fish tacos of course and wow were they plain . just think of middle school lunch fish in a bland torilla . flavorless . u would think with a name `` wahoo 's fish tacos '' their tacos would be good . this is really a bar . the bar is good and it has gaming so go here to drink and gamble not eat .	4152
0	fish tacos were lackluster at best ... baja rolls were eh..	4152
0	i had a cajun fish taco , white rice , and cajun beans . this was the most bland fish taco i have ever had . stick to rubio 's .	4152
0	talk about shitty service . they would have to get better to be consider bad . talking to the bartender was like talking to a brick wall , it wo n't talk back and it does n't understand . i for sure wo n't be going back the food was over priced , the service was awful , the atmosphere sucked , and getting a root canal would be more enjoyable . p.s. , this really needs a thumbs down button . save your money and go elsewhere !	4152
0	if you hate flavor ... give wahoo 's a try . i 'm not sure how so many permutations of burrito ingredients can taste equally as bland , canned , and salt-laden .	4152
0	i love me some wahoos but this specific one is weak . took over old poker bar so no windows in the joint which kinda defies wahoos principles in general and feels too much like a bunker . food is wahoo 's so you know it 's good but service struggles if your not a regular . if it is crowded your screwed . staff a minimal crew . much better vibe in sumnerlin and new henderson one has amazing views of vegas .	4152
0	ridiculously long wait ( around 35-40 minutes ) when they were not even that busy . they did n't tell us there would be such a long wait and they served people that came in after us before us . chicken was cold and food was mediocre at best . my first and last time here .	4152
0	first timer ! ! im gon na say after all the hype i thought it was gon na be alot better ... . the fish tacos were so dry ... . they need to put alot more dressing on and less cabbage ! ! i would go back but deff gon na try something new ... ..	4152
0	was a little disappointed by the quality of the food here . it was recommended by a friend who has been to other locations . i just felt like the quality was mediocre and would be able to cook it myself . i ordered the carne asada tacos . the tortillas were pretty dry and the rice seemed like it was just a place holder to make the plate look fuller .	4152
0	was not really into it at all ... i was really disappointed . i ordered the shrimp tacos and an order of nachos ... the shrimp was bleh ! and the nachos even more bleh ! wont be coming here again .	4152
0	food was ok , not impressed ... . weird to order then have food delivered to table . is it a fast food joint or a restaurant . i ordered carne asada taco ( original ) it was more like a salad on top of corn tortillas , guacamole was good , salsa was not too many other options to return here	4152
0	small portions for the price . 2 tacos for $ 9.00 . the hostess did n't even greet us and then proceeded to greet people behind us . over priced and bad service	4152
0	what the hell ? wahoo 's famous fish taco is really a dry , flavorless lump of crusty fishfunk . i would have gotten more satisfaction staying home and eating nasty mincemeat fish sticks ! if you want a real fish taco , go to rubio 's ! edit : the manager of this location , victor , sent me a private message asking me to return and give this location another shot . i have added a star because i appreciate managers who are communicative . maybe , just maybe , i 'd give this place another shot if i happened to be in the area ( which is far from home ) . however , my review stands as written for the time being .	4152
0	meh . the fish taquitos were n't very tasty and the rice and beans were ok . the food was n't very tasty but the restaurant was very clean and the staff was superb .	4152
0	food a huge disappointment nasty ! the only thing i loved was the decor if only they knew about food as much as they do with decorations i soo wanted to love this place ... ... .bummed !	4152
0	do n't know how anyone who has encountered chris thinks he a good bartender . i know several people who will not go on his shift . very condescending & rude . i heard the manager has a thing for him . so i guess his behavior is acceptable .	4152
0	my mom goes do dialysis next door to this place three times a week . i have only ordered food once but what i got was n't even close to what i ordered . i do go in to grab a soda every now and then . almost 3 bucks seems a bit high but whatever . i wish they would let me at least grab a free refill or something but the rule is `` once you go outside you have to pay for more drink '' . rules are rules i guess . the girl at the counter could have been nicer about it .	4152
0	i was excited to hear a wahoo 's had opened . in las vegas ! i ordered a combo plate with chicken enchilada , fish taco , brown rice and black beans . the enchilada would have been good , had it been hot , but the cheese was barely melted . the taco was nothing but a big lump of fish . it was not seasoned and bland . i would have liked it to have been cut in small pieces with seasoning . best part was the black beans.. i will possibly try it one more time , but will skip wahoo 's if it is not better .	4152
0	i really like the food here but the very first thing that greets you when you walk through the front door is a wafting stench of cigarette smell coming from the bar ! ! ! i ca n't stand that smell and it 's doubly frustrating because there 's a door they can close to keep that smell contained . if they had a drive thru it would be the way i would use wahoos . 4.5 star food but the smell knocks overall rating to 2star review . i wish mgt would do something to fix this issue .	4152
0	i 've been to wahoos off rainbow and sunset many of times and have played games and i got my bill from bob the manager and it was for $ 75 and nothing was comped . also they charge $ 8.00 a beer on draft whether you gamble or not . i asked to talk to the owner but bob said i was n't allowed to talk to paul the owner . bob is a horrible manager and i do n't recommend going there because the service is horrible .	4152
0	place is not friendly . we felt like outsiders and they did not comp us hardly anything after playing 300 plus in the machines .	4152
0	was not impressed with the food . i ordered 2 grilled fish tacos . the taco shell was cold . quantity of fish was small . a lot of cabbage filler . i was disappointed because i had heard good things . probably will not go back .	4152
0	5 min after i wrote previous review : screwed up my wife 's and my order , so i removed a star . it 's the staff , or the tools they are given . to their credit - they got it right after we sent it back . wahoo manager is trying to make things right . appreciated !	4152
0	will never go back . and i love wahoos food ! went in at 11:30am on july 26th . we sat in the lobby and waited for to-go food ( 2 burritos ) . there were literally 4 people in the restaurant . the cashier was very nice and kept apologizing for it taking so long . but 45 minutes later- still no food . that 's how long for take out ? .. awful . will never go back . i go to the wahoos in boca park all the time and they are great ! this location needs serious help .	4152
0	fish tacos used to be really good but last couple of times , not so much . too fishy and no pop of flavor . just did n't taste fresh if you know what i mean . maybe they changed chefs but wo n't be going back .	4152
0	i do n't think this location can handle a lunch crowd . it took 25 mins ( on my 1 hr lunch ) to get my food . service is very slow .	4152
0	honestly beyond pissed about this place . ordered one thing and something completely different . i guess people that work grave must be boozing with the regulars cuz being in this town and working in the restaurant industry is and insult . not like you 're banging busy at 3am . even when you tell and order and repeat it and get an ok i understand your order and still get screwed on what you 're paying for . honestly worst service ever puts all wahoos down in y book no matter where it is or what state .	4152
0	i like to food but is very expensive for lunch it 's about 9 bucks of food but when you add on the annoying table service taking your before you but the fork down to that is a bit much trying to relax now i have to relaxing lunch instead i am annoyed by the annoying wait staff one is for having warm food two stars food is right one deducted star expensive one deducted star annoying wait staff soup bowl one deducted star annoying wait staff main dish while the fork was still in my hand	4152
0	never really had any issues here until today . came in for lunch & decided to try their highly promoted surf & turf burrito . decided on steak & shrimp . arrived & looked great but contained neither steak nor shrimp- only fish . was returned & remade ( correctly ) but had a pre-made `` oldness '' taste . was told made to order but we determined most likely with older tortillas . moving back to the fish tacos . we still love those !	4152
0	bartenders ignore you and since they changed all the staff its really not inviting and we 've had at wait almost 20 minutes just to be greeted . then when the food came out it was wrong and the bartender who was there dayshift was extremely rude about it and actually made offensive comments to one of the other customers about us because we sent it back . the arrogance of the staff at the bar is astounding . yes money rules all but you do n't treat people with disrespect just because you 're not playing . you never know who you 're talking to .	4152
0	the food is over priced , not great & the portion sizes are small . i will not go back & do n't recommend it .	4152
0	i really want to like this place . the open doorwalls , so we can get some fresh air while enjoying our food , beverages and sports is nice . but the prices are outrageous . even the happy hour prices are barely tolerable .	4152
1	ditto jen z but one problem , the new location has serious wifi problems	4153
1	ditto jen z but one problem , the new location has serious wifi problems update 03/2014 : they seemed to have finally fix it	4153
1	starbucks is my favourite because they actually have soy milk for all the lactose intolerant people out there : ) very friendly staff and service is great . the drive thru helps when you are in a rush and need to pick up and go .	4153
0	starbucks is usually similar despite the location . this one somehow happens to have service which is time and again on par with the likes of a mcdonald 's in a bad neighborhood .	4153
0	this is the worst starbucks i 've been to . one star is too much but it 's a sympathy star . they got our entire order of food and coffee wrong and looked at us as if we had a problem . my only problem is the rudeness and their inability to apologize . usually after mistakes baristas give out credits and they did nothing except roll their eyes & take their sweet time to rectify their mistakes . very disappointing .	4153
0	by far the worst starbucks i 've ever been to . the employees were sour and the restaurant itself was over crowded , with such limited seating for the size of the building . never in my life have i had to ask someone to move their belongings so i could simply sit down and drink my coffee . it needs way more seating and more friendly employees . the drinks we received were made right , thankfully .	4153
1	i really like the artistic designs by the nail techs . my daughter wanted a spider on her nails for halloween . and she got a spider , web and cool sparkling eyes . the salon is clean and service is prompt as well as priced reasonably !	4154
1	very friendly and trusting . touc did a great job on my nails and the young lady did a great job on my eye brows . all are very nice . i will be back . thank you !	4154
0	i have n't got my nails done here but i did get my eye brows waxed twice by two different girls and in my opinion it was horrible i told her i wanted it thinner and she goes oh u look fine i wo n't go back they do n't seem like they know what they are doing	4154
0	i went in at 345 ( they do n't close until 5 ) so i thought i had plenty of time for a pedicure . i had to wait 25 minutes for someone to start on me to just rush through the whole pedicure because they were about to close . everything about the pedicure was awful did n't even trim my toe nails . massage was terrible . i had to wait longer than what the pedicure lasted . will never be returning .	4154
1	petit bijou de quartier ! je fus agréablement surprise de constater qu'ils ont beaucoup de sélections de produits ainsi que des fruits et légumes à un très bon prix ! le service et le personnel est toujours agréable en plus d'être très bien situé ( proche de la station de l'église ) .	4155
1	definitely better since the change in management . many intresting products that you would not find at a regular chain grocery store . also the produce is ( as much as possible ) local , and affordable . love the huge ethnic selection .	4155
0	for a `` fruiterie '' , they do n't actually have a lot of different fruit to choose from , and most of it does n't look very fresh . you 're really better off going to a supermarket . most of the space is actually taken up by tea , spices , and other dry goods . likewise , not a particularly interesting selection of them . it 's cheap , at least .	4155
0	the cashier was extremely rude to me so i never want to shop there again.also their products are overpriced .	4155
1	fresh pressed juice in the airport ? ? ? vegan snacks ? ? ? after flying from newark and having possibly the worst mexican food on the planet i 'm loving the options here .	4156
1	booster juice near f57-61 terminal 1 is a really good deal . i did n't realize that their juice is so filling so i ordered a combo with steak panini . i thought the panini will not be a tasty choice but it turns out to be the opposite ! it 's fairly good warm panini given the limited choice in the airport . love it ! recommend tropical kale , and i saw strawberry ones and orange ones are also people 's favorite .	4156
1	good quality smoothies at a decent price . seems like a high turn over in employees though so had a wide range of quality of smoothies with them from some watery ones to others too frozen to drink .	4156
0	this place considers an açaí energy bowl a dark green liquid with the smallest sprinkle of cheap granola and strawberries , instead of the advertised bananas , on top . disappointing to say the least , i taste absolutely no açaí whatsoever and they forgot my order for 15 minutes , then took a good 10 minutes to prepare it . really would not recommend their açaí energy bowl at all	4156
0	they do n't list all their ingredients that they put into the smoothie and a majority of their smoothies are just filler : apple or pineapple juice .	4156
0	quality here is not consistent with other booster juice locations . my mango hurricane was not as sweet as it usually is supposed to be and it literally took them 20 minutes to prepare my smoothie . i nearly missed my flight ...	4156
1	it was my first time here and i was definitely impressed . the groomers work and etiquette was lovely . i usually need the works when it comes to my little schweenie mix . ; ) i 'm glad i went to her and will most definitely be back !	4157
1	love the family that owns this lovely little business ! we have been coming to them for all of our fur babies for over four years and we have never been disappointed . the price is really decent and they take good care of our oldest pup who has hip issues . our dogs are smaller and do n't like to listen to strangers . so glad we found them when we first moved to vegas ! if you are looking for a reasonably priced groomer who loves your fur babies like you do check them out !	4157
0	i am so upset with how my dog came out . after reading all the great reviews i expected much more . my husband took my pomeranian over with simple instructions for his basic trim . when i arrived home my dog 's coat is chopped and a mess . it appears they do not know what a basic pomeranian cut is supposed to look like !	4157
0	worst groomers ive ever been to.was told one price over the phone.arrived and told them exactly what i wanted for my chihuahua never did the price change upon picking up my dog then the priced changed by more then double.i began to dispute the charges the gentleman that was working there started to pull the dog out of my daugters hands . instead of putting my children threw that i paid . when contacting them i was threatened and told to come down there to fight one of the worker 's .	4157
1	i stopped in to the sprint store yesterday to activate my new iphone which i bought online . adam leber was so helpful and professional ! he made it a wonderful experience and made the activation so simple , taking care of all ! i will return with my husband next to see only adam to activate his new iphone asap . thank you adam for such great service !	4158
1	i had a good experience at this store . i was helped by a sales rep and the store manager and both were very helpful and polite . they listened to my situation involving a cracked phone screen and the high cost to fix/replace with my old carrier and helped turn a negative into a positive . very well done . thank you !	4158
1	i had a phone issue , bought another phone and that one would not activate . the whole staff was amazing , i had great customer service . there technician derek was very professional as well as knowledgeable on what needed to be done . thanks derek , go team sprint .	4158
1	the tech chris is extremely helpful . he is the main reason why i come back to the store . he is very knowledgeable and takes time to explain issues . wish there were more helpful people like chris	4158
1	waited a few minutes a very busy corp sprint but worth it . raoul helped us and took care of a problem we had at a third party sprint store in calif. raoul handled the phone calls to get the devices returned for us and assured us not to worry it would be handled . the manager came over to ask us for help got us some water . everyone was very helpful . raoul was so patient and helpful , i will be back there : ) thank you	4158
1	full disclosure : i went to this store to cancel my contract and return my phone . rather than bullying me about why i was leaving the service ( like so many cell phone store reps do ) , raoul simply asked why i was leaving and what he could do to help . he was incredibly helpful , professional and efficient . if sprint 's cell service was anything like raoul 's customer service , i 'd still use sprint .	4158
1	raoul maldonado is great at his job ! needed two iphone activated and he did while provided excellent customer service . left the place with a smile !	4158
1	we love dallas . he is thorough and we did not feel like he was rushing to get us out . he really wanted to make sure we got everything fixed and all our stupid questions were answered .	4158
0	complete nightmare run ! ! ! ! ! if your not there to buy something call sprints 1800 number they can help you . save yourself several hours of frustration .	4158
0	the manager did n't want to help me cause i was returning a lease so i had to wait literally an hour while 2 people were being helped and the manager and 3 other employees walked around doing nothing . luckily i 'm not in contract . `` it 's over sprint ! '' - commercial reference . lol	4158
0	significantly under-staffed . went into this particular store today with the intention of adding another line and potentially purchasing two new phones . after waiting over a half hour to even be recognized or acknowledged , we left and took our business elsewhere .	4158
0	every time i come into this location i seriously consider changing carriers . they never have phones in stock , the wait is always insanely long even with minimal customers waiting , and the employees seem to have no clue what they 're doing . i 'm always told conflicting stories about charges and the terms of my plan , and the manager seems to choose favorites for who he wants to make exceptions for . very unprofessional .	4158
0	been with sprint for 7 years . it used to be a good provider but recently turned into bowl shit . i have insurance on my phone , but they wo n't cover almost anything . they forced me to pay them $ 200 for a broken screen . i paid for it and realized they are not even giving me the phone same day . i have to wait 8 hours for identification , and then they will send me the phone by mail . what the fuck ?	4158
0	thanks for the heads up on sprint . i was thinking of getting another iphone with them . i already have one with verizon and can not even make a call outside the mayo clinic hospital . wtf is wrong with cell service in north scottsdale ?	4158
0	awful experience . they have different employees now . they are totally nasty . we have been a loyal customer for over20 some years . they are very rude . i am a minority , and the guy made fun of my accent . he purposely pronounced word loud and slowly to degrade me . very racist !	4158
0	liars . horrible customer service . guy tells me how he would have fixed my problem had i came in to see him , i did a week ago and no help them or now .	4158
1	excellent ice cream . my favorite is the strawberry banana rendezvous , soooo good . we are alwayz looking for good places to get ice cream and this one never let us down . thank you guys ! !	4159
1	this is the first cold stone location to open up , ever ! with such a famous location , the ice cream here and service ca n't be beat . i 've always been greeted here with a smile , to indulge in rich , smooth ice cream mixed with various toppings .	4159
1	i like it , i do n't love it and i do n't have to have it but once in a while its nice to please my sweet tooth . there are so many different combos of cream you can mix and match .	4159
1	i have n't been here for awhile . they still offer the great creamy ice cream that i remember . the portions are pretty big so plan ahead with a empty stomach . their waffle bowls are delicious . i am very old school so vanilla is my flavor but they offer many other flavors . plus you can add in your side . oh yeah ! ! ! this location now offers shaved ice ! ! ! yes ! ! ! ! do not forget to check out their ready made ice cream cakes , and cupcakes . you can also pick your own flavor and design if you choose .	4159
1	natebob served some of the best ice cream ice ever had . he was enthusiastic about helping me choose a good ice cream and he delivered ! ! ! thanks natebob : )	4159
0	so disappointed . i know that as a company cold stone discontinued cookie dough a couple months back , and today i went to get some ice cream . the only reason i go here is cake batter and cookie dough combination . i saw a sign saying that cookie dough was back , so of course i ordered that . this is completely different cookie dough though , so i did n't want that as my topping . i only went to cold stone for their cookie dough , because it was n't the cheap , gross small pieces . it was real cookie dough . i will not be back and will only be going to baskin robbins who has better ice cream anyway .	4159
0	make sure you do n't order a milkshake you will be met with much attitude . was just in there tonight and ordered a chocolate milkshake with oreos mixed and received a nice rolling of the eyes from the girl who had to make it . she also looked at her coworker and gave her a long sigh like i had just asked for 30 of them . and to make it even better after i had already left i realized it was a vanilla shake . it was a solid waste of 6 $ . so fairs warning expect great anger if you ask for a shake .	4159
0	this place is ok , not as pleasant as the one we used to go to in phoenix . there 's one girl who is really short and we know so much about her because she is always talking about herself to her co-workers and will not focus on her job . she 's messed up on orders a few times and it even looks like her co-workers want her to shut up . the ones who make up for the service are the older ones who usually do not mess up on orders .	4159
0	went to cold stone yesterday for my birthday ice cream . never again . my family got french vanilla ice cream and we all got food poisoning . been going to the bathroom non stop . my 3 year old son has it coming out both ends the poor kid . he was excited to have ice cream but is paying the price now . if you love your family do n't go to cold stone . getting sick is no fun .	4159
0	upon entrance 15 minutes before closing , a male employee threw a towel with force to express his frustration of us coming in at a late time . i usually do n't leave reviews , but this was an uncomfortable situation to say the least , especially when he was talking us out of items of the menu that would take longer for him to prepare .	4159
1	two days ago at my annual `` lady doctor '' visit , a cyst was found on my thyroid . had some bloodwork done , then was sent next door to az tech radiology to have a thyroid ultrasound . let 's see . . . it was easy to schedule an appointment , and the front desk staff was very personable , unlike most places i 've been to . tammy the tech was friendly enough . i 'm not sure about any of the other locations , but i had a good experience here .	4160
1	a little bit of a long wait in the waiting room but once i was called back they could see me lickety split . i know other people have complained about long wait times and i was here mid morning on a week day so that probably did cut down on waiting . either way it 's nice to have options close to home .	4160
1	the receptionist was caring , informative and very welcoming the nurses were friendly and able to answer questions there was a complete explanation of each step that would occur the doctor was caring , friendly and had a great personality . he made the whole experience good . i was taken minutes after i arrived , no waiting .	4160
0	do not use this provider . go to any other imaging provider . location on dobson gave me the wrong preparation instructions before my procedure which skewed my results . i had to go to a different imaging provider for more extensive additional testing . 5 months later , i get a huge bill from azt . they pretended i could dispute it and show how they did n't prep me right , but after two months of not being called back , they just kept sending me the billing to pay .	4160
0	terrible customer service from people who should probably be only working for mcdonalds . went to pay a copay including my bill and credit card and was told to sit and wait for the 15 customers waiting to be called for their scans completing their paperwork . after 15 minutes i left the building never to return and instead will give smil all my business . i probably would have had about 45 minutes to wait just to pay a bill . no thanks .	4160
0	they scheduled another appointment at another location but failed to find out their lunch schedule . so we got to sit and wait until everyone got back from lunch . great management ! not ! next appt was for ct scan . first appt cancelled . tech at dobson/frye location did n't check the dye connection and it sprayed all over during ct scan . had to redo it , the room was filthy ! disgusting !	4160
1	$ 5 tuesdays . the best deal around ! nice new cineplex in the area . they offer all of the first run showings . prices are reasonable compared to other movie places .	4161
1	love this movie theatre ... always very clean , staff is always friendly , and the sound quality is great . they have half price movie days on tuesdays and also dollar days for children ... its pretty pricey but most theatres are , but its usually well worth your money !	4161
0	usually a great experience , the night crew has ruined that for me . the rudest group of young adults i have ever encountered . i will never go to this theater again .	4161
0	horrible theater . kicked me out with my newborn because it was after six pm . do n't plan on returning anytime soon . do n't come to this place for a date night if you have an infant because they 'll kick you out . sucks , sucks , sucks .	4161
1	was last here on sat/14 sep and sun/15 sep to pick-up $ 5 footlongs ( meatball marinara ) for dinner . - i 've always been satisfied with the service and the food here . - shop is always clean . - even during the occasional lunches i go there , if there is a line it moves at a brisk pace since the employees are fast . - since it 's next door to smith 's supermarket i can do my grocery shopping ( but then i 'm too lazy to cook ) and then walk over to subway to get a sub .	4162
1	this subway i went to recently was n't bad . i ordered a footlong black forest ham with sides and got my order correct . the service was alright , long line though , but they need to hire more employees . when i ate the sandwich , it was very delicious and was very happy . would definitely come back to try other subs .	4162
0	only 2 people working during the 5pm hour . line kept growing as i was waiting . both employees were slooow . after watching one employee open the fridge door wearing his gloves , go into a different room still wearing gloves , and then start making a sandwich for a customer without changing his gloves , i had to leave . during my time waiting the health code violations just kept adding up . as a chef i just could n't stand it .	4162
0	the saler was very rud , she said the bathroom its only for people that buy something , i ever see something like that before , i dont recomend any body , cuatomer service its the most important maybe i think in buy something but that because she ask that i said not , you should training your personal	4162
1	i gave it a 5 star because i have nothing bad to say about it.. food is fresh & very tasty . all fresh ingredients . i really love the bamboo & teriyaki twist bowls.. love love love	4163
1	if you 're in a rush and want something tasty , affordable , and healthy , freshii is a great option . their service is always good , very friendly and fast . i often order through ritual . most recently had the teriyaki chicken bowl - very filling and nice presentation !	4163
1	enjoyed the tex mex burrito w/steak .	4163
1	i ordered the banana nut crunch smoothie based on a review here , it was perfect consistency so i think it was the difference of employee skills . the tex mex burrito with falafel was also very satisfying . although the the place is vegetarian you can add steak , chicken and tuna to any order . i will definitely be back !	4163
1	i love this place for all of the healty options on the menu . it is as good as fast food gets . all of the disposable containers used for food are biodegradable . this contributes to the green philosohphy of the restaurant , the tart froyo is a treat . it contains probiotic yogurt and tastes great . you 're allowed to choose two toppings . i come to this place often .	4163
1	love how you can modify your own salad ( there 's other options beside salads too ) . i really enjoyed their vinegrette dressing . will definitely come back again ,	4163
1	i had a pangoa bowl and a green smoothie and omg i fell in love with it ! i love the service in this location better . the staff were very friendly , fast , and accommodating to my preferences . this is a good place to have a quick bite for those on the go ! fast , fresh and healthy ! my new go to place for lunch !	4163
1	i enjoyed it so much ! i got the southwest burrito and it was sooo tasty , even without the cheese ( i 'm a vegan ) . they were quick and friendly , and i felt great after eating my meal .	4163
1	love the food at freshii - so many fantastic options , i have yet to be disappointed ! ! i have found this location slow at times , however when we have placed an order for my workplace it has always been on time .	4163
1	i eat here quite often for lunch . the owner is really nice and always says hello . the selection of toppings for your salad is pretty large . one complaint is that they do n't really give you enough chicken for the price you pay . they also need a better selection of salad dressing , especially in the low fat category .	4163
0	i e-mailed head office months ago about a lousy experience at their yonge & college street location and never received a response . was never a huge fan to begin with but that confirmed things for me . oh , and the cobb salad does n't have chicken in it anymore ... what a rip off !	4163
0	wanted to grab a quick and healthy lunch to bring back to work so i stopped in at freshii on college and was surprised to see it mostly empty . thankfully , as this was my first time there , i did n't have to get in any confusing line to order but i could see how it could be frustrating when it is busy . i got the tex mex burrito with chicken and it was just meh . my hunger was satiated but the taste was very bland , the ingredients were not super fresh tasting and the price for a standard burrito was much too high for the other burrito options in the area .	4163
0	freshii needs to take a trip to nyc to see how a real salad is made . sweetgreen , chopt , just salad , fresh , hale and hearty , are some good examples . the quality of lettuce , meat and veggies is extremely low at freshii . their bowls that include rice are loaded in with this cheap filler and extras cost a fortune . i rarely give bad reviews but this chain needs to make some improvements and i do n't know why torontonians are so obsessed with it .	4163
0	i 've been to a few nice freshii locations ( by rosedale station and eglinton station ) so i went into this one . horrible idea . the restaurant was dirty and run down and the food hidden behind a big wall so you ca n't see what they 're doing . i also got half the food that i got in the other restaurants for the same bowl ... for the same ridiculous price of course . disappointing .	4163
0	tried their coffee today . they have this huge sign outside that says $ 1 coffee . but when you think coffee you automatically assume there will be milk to add to it . well the server there did n't think it was normal for me to ask for 2 % milk ! instead she pointed me to almost empty container of almond milk and said this is all we have ! coffee was half decent , experience was n't ! !	4163
0	why are they closed on a tuesday at 430 pm ? ? ? ? ? pissed . how can i trust this location again to travel to if they 're not open when they should be .	4163
0	this location is the worst i have been to . they do not put enough dressing and toppings on the bowls . it 's just a big bowl of bland brown rice . not sure if this is to save on costs but all other locations seem to have abundant toppings and flavour .	4163
0	wanted to have something healthy , then i stopped here . i had a rice bowl with teriyaki tofu . there is no other sauce except on tofu , so after i finished that small amount of tofu , i only had vegetables , beans on rice . i saw some hot sauce on table , so i added a little bit . omg ! then my bowl became so spicy , that i even ca n't finish it .	4163
0	this place bothers me . it 's expensive and not worth it . healthy food can taste good - it does n't have to taste bland . the menu is unnecessarily complex , and the soups and salads are just not worth it . plus you can get frozen yoghurt here for like $ 8 for a large if you want . yes please ! ! ! bend me over and empty my wallet . p.s the whole green seller is a sham . they are so not environmentally friendly in actuality . just watch them mix up your stuff in plastic bags and serve you in take out containers that are yes biodegradable - but do not bio degrade in landfills . whats the point ?	4163
0	very bland tasting food , expensive , and they charge for hot sauce . lame	4163
1	this panda express in campus is awesome . the employees are nice and quick . the prices are okay but i understand considering it 's on campus .	4164
1	this panda express location is good . i decided to eat something new since i kept eating the same thing over and over . i decided to try panda express at unlv . the food here is good and the service was good also . the one thing i hate is that the food/entrees needs more flavor but still good . will come back .	4164
1	i love this panda express location . their food is always great quality and great tasting . they have he best customer service . all their employees are always smiling and so professional and attentive to their customers . i 'm always coming here and have never been disappointed .	4164
1	anna k was our cashier and was so pleasant and kind . she made sure to offer ways for us to save money like sharing and really cared for us . i hope when we return tomorrow she will be there so we can say hi to her . you have a great employee there .	4164
1	i love going to the panda express very good food staff very nice . i want to say there is a cashier that when he is working is always very nice and happy and makes the costumers feel welcome his name is cesar very nice guy	4164
0	outstanding food with fresh vegetables at a great price . it is a shame that the staff is rude and condescending while people order . i do not understand why they perform one task and stop while you wait for someone else to help you instead of helping the one guest from start to finish .	4164
0	this panda express is bad . the only advantage this horrible panda express has is that it is on campus . students just have no other choice . line is freaking long and slow . some certain foods always need 10-15 mins to be ready . should call it sloth express . i wo n't choose panda express at all out of campus . bad bad bad .	4164
0	i sit , at the student union , writing this with a plate , still full of food , from panda express , beside me . eff me for thinking that despite the fact i hate panda express , that it could be good this time . after having a severe hankering for kim chi , and no kim chi anywhere near this campus , i was relegated to panda for food . my stomach is severely cramping and i feel like i 'm going to vomit . i 'm counting down the hours until i can finally get the heck out of here . any food that makes you nauseous automatically gets no higher marks than 2 stars .	4164
0	just ordered a beef broccoli bowl and it was n't that good . broccoli was so tough because they did n't blanch them before stir frying and you only about 5 pieces of beef . fried rice was room temperature .	4164
0	it 's on campus , and convenient . it is n't as good as other panda express i 've been to , in the recipes they use are a little different than other pandas as well . one thing i do n't like is that they charge for refills of soda pop . this is the first hand i 've ever been to the charges for refills . the food comes in a to-go box and not on a plate which i am ambivalent about but the menu selection is very limited compared to other panda express . i 've eaten here when the items in the hot table really look old and quite nasty , other times the food actually looks fresh-ish .	4164
1	awesome food and cheap prices . such great quality . one of the only and best authentic japanese restaurants in az .	4165
1	great no frills sushi place with friendly staff .	4165
1	sushi ken is not fancy but it takes you to any-town japan with good food that is very affordable . the menu is highly diverse with tasty items like shumai , ramen and squid snacks that you do n't normally find in us-based japanese places . the dishes are high quality and the cost performance is excellent . oishii ! highly recommended .	4165
1	high quality sushi at great prices ! the sushi always seems fresh , and they have great lunch specials . we brought our japanese friend here when she visited , and she was very impressed with the quality of the sushi . i wish i could eat here 5 days a week .	4165
1	my favorite sushi spot in ahwatukee . good atmosphere with great service . love the chicken curry .	4165
1	my favorite sushi place ! ! i 'm very picky about my japanese food due to the fact that i 'm half japanese . i love their mini spicy chirashi because it 's only $ 12.95 and it big enough to share with my husband . when i first saw it i was skeptical and thought that the bowl was just full of rice with a little bit of fish on top . nope it 's the other way around ! full of fish with a little bit of rice on the bottom . we 've had a couple of rolls as well and they have also been delicious . next time i will be trying their ramen !	4165
1	we have been going to this restaurant since it opened . over the years , we 've had both good and bad service , mostly good meals , and generally found it a friendly local place for japanese food at a decent value . over the months , prices have increased on many items , but the specials are still competitive , and usually tasty . restaurant cleanliness could use some improvement . service can be spotty , but is generally good . my recommendation is to be patient if they 're busy .	4165
1	for affordable , no-frills sushi , we always choose sushi ken . my husband works for a japanese company and when the japanese come to town , that 's where they go for lunch ; they say it 's the most authentic for them . now i know all you hipster foodies on this site ( especially those who have expense accounts and do n't mind paying $ 100 a person for `` trendy sushi '' ) will look down on the lack of ambience and menus with photos ( `` the horror '' ; so kitsch ! ) but i 'm saying the shashimi combo ( lunch or dinner ) hits the spot every time .	4165
1	it 's a fantastic place , i do n't get it why the rating star is so poor , everyone should try it .	4165
1	food is the best authentic japanese cuisine here in the valley . the service is a bit slow and i heard about the extra fee charged for splitting checks , so we put the tab on my friend 's card and i paid her back .	4165
1	i love sushi ken ! the staff are all so friendly and welcoming , and the food is delicious . it 's always bustling at dinner time , but that 's just proof of how good it is . i 'd recommend the chicken curry ( my favorite ) and the rice bowls !	4165
1	i love this cute little place ! very unassuming in the little strip mall . but wow they have really good and pretty authentic ( compared to the high price fake stuff in scottsdale ) sushi ! the staff are very friendly and attentive to your needs . 2 people can eat her for about 20 $ which is not bad compared to most sushi places in the valley . it 's a shame there 's not more places like this one in the phoenix area . worth the drive from north scottsdale for sure !	4165
1	this place is owned by a japanese family . they have great sushi and a friendly atmosphere .	4165
1	visited phoenix , az on a business trip w/ my boss . we just had to have the gyu don ( beef bowl ) . we went on may 30th for lunch but , was closed to construction . had to eat the gyu don before our return on may 31st . after a fun day of golf , before our trip back to phoenix airport , we stopped by and has the gyu don and cold udon combination set . awesome ! this satisfied our palate . now we were able to return back to lax .	4165
1	amazing ! ! ! ! great quality ! ! ! the sushi and also the kitchen good are both wonderful . service is good they are short staffed it seems , but the servers work hard and do their best . although the service may be slow it 's totally worth it for the food ! ! !	4165
1	they have a very large menu . everything from soup to sushi . everything we have tried there has been made with absolute top quality ingredients . presentation is good to very good depending on how busy they are . but no matter what it looks like it always tastes perfect .	4165
1	today was our first visit to sushi ken and we really enjoyed our experience ! from the moment we walked in to the very end of our meal the staff was very attentive and friendly . we noticed right away how clean the restaurant was ! service was prompt and food and drinks were delivered quickly . this was our first time here and we were n't too hungry so we just ordered a few rolls . caterpillar roll was very good with fresh avocado ! we also really enjoyed the spicy salmon , spicy tuna and the yellowtail roll . the sake bombs were a great price for happy hour . we ca n't wait to come back !	4165
1	my must go sushi place in phoenix . i have to go there at least once everytime i visit phoenix . very polite servers , fresh sushi , great katsu curry , and great deal ! even offer drinks , yet to try though .	4165
1	the sushi was perfect ! fresh , delicious and plenty of it . $ 5 happy hour rolls were a nice surprise ! would highly recommend ken 's if your into good eats in an unpretentious atmosphere .	4165
1	authentic japanese type of restaurant . i recommend this place for good japanese comfort food @ a great price !	4165
1	pros : - lots of variety of authentic japanese dishes - quick and friendly service - ramen is okay , not the best i ever had - price is reasonable cons : - tucked away , kind of hard to find when driving down chandler blvd . - open at certain hours for lunch and then dinner , if you wanted to stop by in between lunch , and dinner when you are home early , then you got to wait until it opens will i keep coming back ? sure , its close by the house and the ramen is pretty decent . staff is very friendly and the service is quick . it is a very casual clean place .	4165
1	dear ken , i love your restaurant because the cooked food is just as good as your reasonably priced sushi so that non sushi eaters ( read-wife ) still want to take me there for my raw fish fix . but why , oh why is the service so slow and maddening ? could it be you do n't have enough servers to help your sweet , overworked staff ? and why wo n't you listen to me and open a branch closer to my house in south chandler ? but i digress , love you like family , keep up the good work and see you saturday .	4165
1	back at sushi ken for dinner last night . first time i 've been there since they redecorated/ or possibly got new owners , but i was really impressed . the food tasted amazing as always , and the service was faster than usual . the way they changed the layout of the restaurant makes it seem bigger and also gives the customers a little bit more privacy . we got the tempura entree and the spicy miso ramen , both were amazing and fresh ! very impressed with the noodle texture and depth of flavor in the broth , though it was a tad bit salty . will definitely be back soon !	4165
1	awesome taste , great sushi , slow service due to business .	4165
1	the sushi is so fresh and reasonably priced , sushi ken is a great spot in ahwatukee . the portions are large and the staff is attentive . i tried the ramen also and it was delicious- i had leftovers for 2 days . my friend had the poke bowl and it looked great . i 'm shocked that it 's not jam packed every night of the week !	4165
1	the food is good , the sushi is fresh , and the udon is hot . also , i 've always found the service friendly though when they get busy it slows down a bit to accommodate the influx . for people who like a sushi restaurant that 's polished and modern , may not be for you . for those of us who do n't care about the trend factor and dig the japanese diner feel , well , more yummy food for us !	4165
1	there are not very many great japanese restaurants in the phoenix area . so far i think sushi ken is my favorite . i hate those upscale hipster rave sushi places . that is not the kind of atmosphere sushi ken provides . this is a traditional looking family sushi house and has great service . the menu is very large and the food is not overpriced . i like to get the combo that has ramen soup ( several broth choices to choose from ) and sashimi . wow the kids bento is huge ! this place is a great little ahwatukee gem !	4165
1	the menu here reminds me a bit of hanaya yohei in japan - i love these kinds of places ! it had an authentic family resu feel - and a # of japanese natives frequent this restaurant . the menu is awesome - beautiful menu displaying every item in clear pictures - and an amazing selection - loads of everything : tempura , yakitori , sushi , donburi , soups , shumai , cooked fish , etc ! they really should update the pictures on yelp just to show the menu . the tempura and tempura sauce were excellent yakitori was excellent sushi was very good shumai was good service was excellent .	4165
1	ordered a combo with miso ramen and spicy tuna rice bowl for dinner . love it ! the tuna was tender and they have fresh uni or sea urchins . but the rolls was so-so and they did n't have fresh wasabi . would come back sometime	4165
1	this was a wonderful place to go for sushi -- - sat at the bar , good stuff kept coming . the yellowtail was butter ( and a huge piece ) -- - atmosphere was super -- - nice without being fancy . best sushi that i have had so far in phoenix . it does get crowded on weekend	4165
1	ok , let me just start by saying , i 've been to tokyo , lived in honolulu and i think this is one of the better , more authentic japanese restaurants in the valley . if i lived/worked closer i would be at sushi ken weekly . in the summer , nothing compares to their cold ramen . it is so hard to find decent ramen in phoenix ! for lunch , you do n't get more bang for your buck then their bento and lunch specials .	4165
1	tried sushi ken for more than 10 times , i love their sushi ( rainbow roll , dragon roll ) and ramen ! great family restaurant , i have to say this is a slam dunk 5 stars . japanese owner run this business , absolutely authentic japanese sushi.green-tea tempera ice cream is the best , make sure you order that for your desert . tip : always crowed friday & saturday night , better to get your table is call them for a reservation .	4165
1	the sushi is amazing . and the other dishes are really good , especially the ramen , udon , beef sukiyaki , and the salmon collar . service is really friendly , and it 's a good place to take kids .	4165
1	sushi ken easily has the best ramen in the valley . wildly generous portions served with a side of sushi , and it all comes for a very fair price .	4165
1	i have been here multiple times although mostly for takeout . the rolls are awesome . never have to wait long for my order . i like that they have gluten free soy sauce but the price per packet seems a little high . good quality food and portions .	4165
1	i gave this place 5 stars for the best chirashi i have ever eaten . a simple raw fish and rice became this extraordinary meal . every thing about this dish was amazing . the fish was generously sliced and fresh , a light sprinkle of seaweed on rice , topped with salmon roe and another type of fish egg . my waiter was polite and nice . i would drive out of my way to come eat here again . i hope this dish does n't ever change . delish !	4165
1	awesome place . best japanese food ive had in a while ! good for its price too ! however , do n't go when there 's a lot of people because you will never get any attention from the waiters and the wait time will be forever .	4165
1	number one ! the best ! sushi ken was formerly the great sushi ten of tucson . it 's the best dollar for dollar sushi joint in the country , if not the whole world ! their chirashi rules ! note : sushi ten remains in tucson , but in name only . this is the real sushi ten !	4165
1	i love this place ! this feels to me like the closest thing i imagine an `` authentic '' japanese place would be . i highly recommend the salmon tataki - most places do tuna tataki , and sushi ken does as well , but the salmon is out of this world ... it is my favorite sushi dish anywhere .	4165
1	went in for a quick lunch and soon became a fan . this will become my new favorite go to sushi place . friendly , clean , and amazing sushi .	4165
0	the place was busy the night we went and the service was terrible . they broke my cardinal rule of service and served others behind us in line first , plus the food was average .	4165
0	they include the tips in the final price on the receipt , but did not even tell the customers about that . so it is highly possible that most people double tipped them . however , their service is not good at all .	4165
0	ugh ca n't get the wet dog smell out of my head . really ? have to nuke a piece of nearly paper thin chicken to reheat ? and thinking about it the miso was watery as was the thin , strangely colored teriyaki sauce ! $ 32 lunch ... what a waste !	4165
0	horrible service ! we waited over an hour for our food to come out after our order was taken . there was never any explanation or apology for our order running late until i got up to cancel it . sushi is just ok. not worth an hour 's wait . we wo n't be back . sayonara sushi ken .	4165
0	came here again they added 20 % grat since we did 3 separate checks with only 5 people . or order was n't even big and checks were hand written so it 's not like there was extra work .	4165
0	waitress did n't smile once or check in on us . forgot soy sauce bowls and waters more than once . food came out at different times . sushi haphazardly rolled and falling apart . rice to sashimi ratio was n't good . no water refills . i found a hair in my food . one of the worst dining experiences i 've had . i actually started drafting this review over a year ago and i 'm finishing it now . guess what -- i still remember how bad of an experience we had .	4165
0	i brought my family here after i heard great things about this place ... .the reviews were dead wrong . the waitress took forever to take our order . we got to the restaurant at 7pm ... we did n't get any water until 7:45pm . after requesting for water on three separate occasions , we still did not get them . we had to ask another waiter to get us some water . our assigned waitress also forgot to put in our order at first and then managed to put in the wrong order . i usually do n't leave negative reviews , but this place takes the cake for horrible service . although , the service was lacking the food was decent . maybe ?	4165
0	well , ordered a dynamite dinner to go on 4/28/18 , and the potion its extremely small , not so sure if i has to do with change of ownership .	4165
0	my mom & friend raved about this place : great food reasonable prices . yes , the prices were decent , but the food a bit lacking . i ordered the teriyaki chicken & tempura lunch plate . tempura was hot , but not crispy . teriyaki chicken had an odd taste-chicken was thinly battered , why i have no idea & the sauce was very thin and bland . the sashimi was fresh tasting but the knife skills of the sushi chef could have been better-it looked like my 7 year old niece had hacked at it . service is decent . place had an odd smell to it , i think it was from the carpet . sorry , i wo n't be returning .	4165
0	worst sushi ever ! please stay ways from this place . had to put tons of wasabi and ginger to be able to finish what we ordered . good sushi should need neither . had to go to another place and also get a hard drink to get over the bad taste it left in our mouths	4165
0	i hate to say this , but we stopped going to sushi ken many many months ago after many failed visits , after many years of it being a family tradition . sad but true . this all broke my heart - we loved sushi ken and will continue to be hopeful that things will get turned around eventually .	4165
0	always a favorite and i come when i 'm around this area , which is often . today we had to send back some yellowtail and the white tuna nigiri was lacking that fresh taste . it 's hit or miss here ... .but certainly good for a quick lunch . my favorite is the chunky spicy tuna roll .	4165
0	came in one hour prior to close on a sunday to find the place completely locked up . very unhappy as i 've come here several times all around the same time without a problem .	4165
0	very slow service . food is just ok . they also charge 18 % gratuity for parties of 5 or more .	4165
0	today was my first time to sushi ken after the change in management a year ago . i 've been avoiding this place after hearing so many negative reviews and experiences . i thought i would give it a try thinking a great place could n't be bad just because a change in management and i was dead wrong . over priced food , bad quality and bad service . the previous owners set a new place called sushi sen in south scottsdale and ill be willing to drive there to get the sushi i once loved . i will not be coming back here ever again .	4165
0	customer service very bad . food very very slow . 40 minutes to get one out of 12 food to come out . another 30 minutes before most of what we ordered came . asking for the check took 15 minutes . friend ordered beer and they forgot about it . waiters need to retake training and kitchen staff needs to chop chop . food was good and thats it . if you need good service dont cone here . tl ; dr horrible horrible service . only reason i gave 2 stars is because the food was good .	4165
0	the food is always good , but the service is always very bad . everytime we come here we have to wait for long time , and the attitude of the waitress always very bad , hope they can hire and train them more professional	4165
0	they always have the best sushi n price in town . but they have the worst customer service ever . waited for 20+ mins to get our order and refill . added 18 % tips for a party of 2 while they do not deserve it . very disappointed ...	4165
0	food was good but service was horrible . waiters keep forgetting our orders . kitchen was really slow took about 40minutes to get a spicy shio ramen ... .another 30min to get all other food out . once food came orders were not accurate . hopefully they can train their waiters and kitchen staff to improve on effeciency . i can see they 're slowly losing their customer .	4165
0	i would not necessarily recommend eating sushi here . there was way too much fish and it made us uncomfortable for the price . i like high-quality sushi and when eating raw fish , i do n't think this is negotiable . this is not high-quality . it 's high-quantity . i was pretty disappointed . service and ambiance also left much to be desired . also , the menu was very confusing . the descriptions have no prices . the prices are only on the sushi order sheet which was hiding for the first 30 minutes .	4165
0	not going back , the sever was very nice . apparently the owner whom everyone loved sold and this place has gone down hill fast . we sent back our sushi as it was mushy , sloppy piles of rolls that i would n't feed my dog . our saki had a strange taste and our ramen was mediocre to say the least . we barely ate and i have been feeling nauseous all afternoon . we have been told the owner opened sushi sen in scottsdale which we will take the ride and try . do n't waste a perfectly good afternoon or evening eating here .	4165
0	the service is very bad . and recently they changed their chef . the food quality and quantity went way down . and with these situation they actually drove up their price ! ! ! hugh disappointment .	4165
0	i stopped going after i found out they are under new chef and new management now . the food taste old and it is important to serve fresh food for a japanese restaurant .	4165
0	i 'm updating my review the last three times i ate at this place , it was pretty poor . the sashimi was chewy , fishy , and just all around gross . i got teriyaki chicken and the chicken appeared to have been microwaved ... i 'm disappointed since this place is soooo close to my house . alas , i must find another place . booo !	4165
0	it used to be my family 's favorite place for many years , but under the new manager the quality of the food has been definitely dropped for last one year . the tuna and octopus in chirashi were not edible . the octopus was so chewy that my husband had to spit out . the ramen is not japanese style anymore . they changed the broth and now even added zucchini in it which is a typical sign of non japanese . well , the only good thing about this place is not crowded anymore so that we can always find table even on friday nights .	4165
0	sushi ken is totally not recommended . my family and i went for lunch . the food was just so-so ( though gy-don was good ) . and the service provided was the worst i have ever had in my life . the waitress had no smile at all . when asking for the detail about a food on menu , she acted like you should know what it is . when delivering the food , she threw the food to table . my kid was scared because of the sound . i will never ever go to this restaurant again , even just a step .	4165
0	worst experience ever ! ! ! the server literally yelled at us when we tried to talk to them about letting our food sit at the sushi bar for 15+ mins and taking 30 mins to bring us check . not to mention how terrible their dishes were ! a simple , quick dinner turned out to be 2 hour waiting hopelessly . he never apologized . very disappointed	4165
0	worst sushi ever ! please stay ways from this place . had to put tons of wasabi and ginger to be able to finish what we ordered . good sushi should need neither . had to go to another place and also get a hard drink to get over the bad taste it left in our mouths	4165
0	really not a great place to go . their food is ok , the service is horrible . they never come to refill any drinks without asking , then if we ask , they are not happy to do so . they make us feel like we are n't welcomed to be there . food is ok and price is ok too , but this is not a restaurant i 'd recommend to anybody .	4165
0	this place was horrible honestly . the sushi was very much so sub par . the fish was not fresh . also , the wonton soup tasted like regular top ramen . the wontons inside had horrible meat inside them . would never come back . i never write reviews but feel like i had to with this place . if you 're considering going to this place ... do n't .	4165
0	well , i 've had good dining experiences at this location before , but unfortunately i embarrassed myself by recommending it to a friend who attempted to dine there last night . i say `` attempted , '' because she was ignored by the rude wait staff , and ended up leaving after 50 minutes without any service . this is completely unacceptable , sushi ken was busy at the time , the level of staffing was supposedly adequate , but apparently it was asians-only night because those were the only people the staff were serving . now sushi ken will be deprived of not only my friends business , but mine and that of my entire family as well .	4165
0	inexpensive sushi . i 've only ordered it for pick-up . but the restaurant itself is quite bare , too bright . sushi i 've had and reordered : the baked dynomite , the mexican , las vegas , alaska , and the rainbow roll .	4165
0	i 've been here a few times . my girlfriend is a big fan because it 's inexpensive and good . the last 3 times we 've gone the service has been beyond bad , long wait for food , no refills , moody waiters . they just do n't care about the customers or good service . i 'm sorry to see what used to be a good place lower their service like this	4165
0	so disappointed by the service and quality of the food at this establishment . the servers were too busy having conversations on their phones that we had to yell to get their attention to ask for the check . some of the fish in our food were dry . do n't recommend this restaurant unless you enjoy being treated poorly and eating overpriced food .	4165
0	worst service ever ! ! ! will never go back ! ! ! food was just okay . such a waste of money and time . the restaurant was not the cleanest as well .	4165
0	let me say that i do like the atmosphere of sushi ken 's . it 's friendly , casual , and feels like what i think a sushi place should feel like . that said , we ordered some tuna sashimi in order to get a feel for what the quality was like before ordering anything else , and i 'm pretty sure that what we were served was shipped in frozen . it was not good . we ate it out of respect , and left .	4165
0	food is good . service is terrible . they say it is because it is busy . but i think they are just disorganized and unhappy . i sure hope they get some competition in the area . until then , i will probably have to put up with this place if i want japanese food .	4165
0	we came here on a recommendation , as this is a good spot for sushi . our party of 8 had no problems getting a table on a weekend . we ordered many sushi rolls , ramen , and bento boxes . the sushi rolls will fill you up so be sure not to order too much . overall the quality is less than what you 'll find in any major city . it 's hard for me to compare this to other phoenix sushi restaurants , but i 've had much better sushi in ca , ny , philly , and denver . we wo n't be coming back here . = (	4165
0	ordered shrimp fried rice paid $ 14 definitely not worth it shrimp was over cooked not enough rice , very rude waitress definitely not going back very unhappy with my lunch	4165
0	avoid this restaurant , please ... after siting for 11 minutes , i flagged a waitress down just to be told rudely , we were not the only customers there and there are other people who are waiting for service also ... ... and , ... .all i was asking for was water for the kids ... . ! ! ! ! promptly we left and had a pleasant thai dinner across the street from those idiots with great service and courteous waitresses who welcomed us with big smiles ... please avoid `` sushi ken '' for their rude waitresses & lousy , slow service.. ! any others out there who 's first visit was their last to these clowns ... . ? ?	4165
1	stopped there today and got a cod fish dinner to go . slaw and fries were included . fish was very good enjoyed the slaw , fries were just ok. will definitely return again .	4166
1	i really like their food , generally . and the staff are great . but , their cheesecake oreo mixer was n't good -- i think the cheesecake might have been lemon ? now i love a good cheesecake , but this did not go together , and threw away 95 % of what i ordered . very disappointing !	4166
1	love this place , super friendly service and awesome food/desserts ! their custard is worth the trip by itself but try the culvers deluxe burger for sure .	4166
1	i love culvers burgers . they are worth the extra few bucks , because i can tell their quality of beef , etc is better than ( most ) . service was very professional and friendly - this staff is good at what they do . previous reviewer whom gave them only 3 stars because of cheese ? seriously ? go eat a salad or something lady ! this is good eats and worth the coin ! i only give them 4 stars because of the prices ... adding a soda to your order is $ , and i think their pricing could be lowered a bit on the extras which do n't cost them much of anything anyway .	4166
1	my family and i have enjoyed heading out to this culver 's for a couple of years now . love the courteous staff , timely service , and of course the frozen custard , and cheese curds . they even say bye as you leave . satisfactory experience every time !	4166
1	i am changing my review . when we went to culver 's is was there opening week and they had some issues . they are on track now .	4166
1	casual atmosphere , order at the counter and they bring it to you . burgers are fresh and hot . order the cheese curds , it is an extra $ 1 with your basket , but they are like mini cheese sticks ! the custard ( ice cream ! ) is smooth and made on site . great as shakes too .	4166
1	pretty darn good food , if you 're after a fresh burger , fries , cheese , and the like . the concrete mixers ( think blizzard with custard ) are to die for . this place puts dq or any other fast food place to shame . i love going here for my 'cheat meal ' once a week ... or sometimes twice : )	4166
1	i just recently discovered culvers ( i 'm probably behind on this one ) . i 've only been to the greenfield location but i absolutely love this place . i usually get a single deluxe with bacon , and a small ice cream treat instead of a drink . i usually eat health but this place is my `` go-to '' for my cheat meal . the prices here are a little higher than comparable burger places , but it 's quality food and you get what you pay for . the dinning room is nice , it gives you the feel of a sit down restaurant without being too formal . last thing , the staff is so nice . love this place	4166
1	we love this place ! staff are well trained ! food is excellent ! ! very highly recommend this culvers ! !	4166
1	decent fast food option . lots of choices plus a variety of sides that you do n't find at most fast food restaurants ... coleslaw , mashed potatoes , etc . tables are kept clean . ice cream treats are yummy . kid meals are kinda pricey but it does come with a nice dish of ice cream with one add-in .	4166
1	update - first trip was a fluke , bad sandwich . i would say steer clear of the patty melt . we have eaten here a few times since and it has been stellar . the custard is out of this world , the kids meals come with a free custard which is a nice touch . i still like the burgers at in n out better , but i have definitely eaten here quite a bit more than i have there in the past couple of months so that may change .	4166
1	ca n't go wrong with the chicken tenders ! by far my favorite of all their options . plus , they have the good root beer and custard ! nom nom . the peanut butter + reese 's cups concrete mixer is the best ! 10/10	4166
1	having a snickers mini cement ice cream , very good , busy store so everyone is out enjoying dinner tonight . just ice cream for us tonight	4166
1	this place is great . they have great service and the frozen custard is very tasty . the only thing they need is a delivery service .	4166
1	sounds like many of the other reviewers have never been to a culver 's and were expecting a different restaurant . this place is great ! the butter burgers are very flavorful and i would definitely recommend a double burger . do n't forget the cheese curds ! also join their email club for a 2 for 1 value meal . highly recommend .	4166
1	we love culvers ! great food , great environment ! the honey mustard and root beer are amazing ! !	4166
1	not bad . clean , friendly service . but the overuse of `` um '' among the wait staff is annoying . teenagers , you know .	4166
1	great for fast food ! ! ! i love that they have a gluten free bun option for the burgers . that is a huge plus for me and i will keep coming back . plus not to many places give out free desert with the kids meals , got to love that if you have a family .	4166
1	wow ! a custard lovers paradise . in the cold case they even had butter brickle flavored custard ! my all-time favorite flavor and rarer than hens teeth . i know this because i always search for this flavor whenever i 'm near ice cream or custard . culvers delivers too on the creamy , smooth , flavor in their chocolate yogurt and the price wo n't break the bank . i will definitely be returning .	4166
1	if you have not tried the cheese curds or custard here then you are missing out . i 'm not a huge fan of the burgers , but they are good . they taste very fresh . it 's worth a visit to try the cheese curds and custard . life changing .	4166
0	i have been to this location twice , they have screwed up my order twice ! the food is awful & the prices ridiculous ! ! fish & chips missus the chips since they neglected to put them in the order , i ordered the cheese dip that was also missing , butter burger & chili for twenty dollars ! i will not return !	4166
0	finally tried culver 's . never again . so disgusting . the concrete taste exactly like mcdonalds . so gross . even the ketchup was nasty . how do you screw up ketchup ?	4166
0	this location used to be good ... just went tonight to get the flavor of the day which they advertised as `` salted double carmel pecan '' , but instead was served `` double marshmallow oreo '' disgusted with this place on how they deceived us ... will not be going back to this location !	4166
0	just once i would love to get what you see on tv . the culver 's fish sandwich ads i was really looking forward to a great sandwich . i would have sworn that the fillets were almost an inch thick with a good sized bed of lettuce - sauce , but that 's not what i got on either the walleye or cod sandwich . you would think that someone in culver 's management would be responsible enough to at least show in the ad what the sandwich is really going to look like . does n't anyone do `` truth in advertising '' any more ?	4166
0	terrible service . was given the complete wrong order and it also had a giant hair in it . girl did not give me a receipt so they did not give me a refund , even though it was a food safety and sanitary issue . never again ! you suck culvers !	4166
0	i will never ever return back here again . over charged me and i almost puked when they brought out my soggy greasy sourdough bread burger out . plus soda machines were out and still got charged for my disgusting drink ! ! ! i honestly can not believe i did n't just get my money back and walk out . if you love burgers , hit up fat burger 3 miles down the road .	4166
0	i love culvers but this location is horrible ! not once have i gone and my order was correct or the fries were n't greasy or burned . it 's sad , i drive out of my way to go to another location all because they hire people who do n't care to do their job right .	4166
0	they flat out forgot our order . we sat in the driveway at the drive-thru while car after car got their order and left . you would assume , someone would have the observation and intelligence to come and check to see if we got our order . apparently the help there is not only incompetent , but they lack any true customer service and critical thinking skills . when i went into to complain , and get my money back , the kitchen was full of little teenagers standing around chatting no one actually working to service customers . the best bet is to not go to this restaurant until they fix their customer service issues .	4166
0	do you open at 10 or 1030 ? your doors say 10 , , but your online profile says 1030 ... . please correct the discrepancy since a customer was standing outside your restaurant at 10 waiting to be served ... .	4166
0	i wanted to like this place . they play oldies inside and i think that 's cute . i dunno though- my meal was all fried and grease . chicken strips and those cheese balls . maybe if id ordered something else : -/ no urge to try it out again .	4166
0	so disappointed in this culvers . we love culvers and go several times a month . but this culvers would n't even let us pay for extra toppings on our custard . did n't make any sense as we wanted to pay but they just refused to even give them to us . i can see why this culvers has lower reviews than any other culvers in the area . the management is not interested in making the customer happy . i still love culvers but i recommend a different location ! !	4166
0	burger was cold by the time we got home . drive through had 5 of us waiting . we were the waiting the longest but all 5 of us got our food at the same time . nice to know my food is cold b/c it was sitting on the counter longest .	4166
0	it 's really great food but every time i come here it 's packed with snow birdsi ca n't stand the snowbirds get the heck out of there	4166
0	2.5 stars the food was blah nothing special but the ice cream was good . definitely a dessert only place	4166
0	i if you would like a lack luster meal then order the shrimp basket . we only eat here because my husband likes their burgers but i doubt we 're going to anymore .	4166
0	we ate here last night and my husband and son have been so sick since ! they were throwing up all night ! i called and spoke to the manager and pretty much all he said was thanks for bringing it to his attention ... .if you feel like hugging a toilet all night then definitely check this place out ! sloppy undercooked food !	4166
0	my butter burger was very dry and tasteless . my order was wrong but they did nicely remake it . my hubby said his food was just ok . this is the 2nd time i have eaten at this culver 's and both times the food has n't been great . wo n't go back .	4166
0	no the place to go for a decent burger . it was worse than `` freddy 's steakburger '' in that it was cold , plastic and lacked a upscale burger feel . for the price , i would go to red robin first .	4166
0	i 've been here several times , my latest visit was my worst experience . mid-october 2014 , tuesday 6pm . the place was very busy . i ordered two double patty burgers with deluxe toppings to go . when i got home what i saw really disappointed me . the patties were like always , there was one tomato slice a few shreds of lettuce and a few small rings of red onion . what a total rip-off ! once again i find myself heading to five guys or fudds for a decent burger . at least at fudds if the toppings are messed-up i know who 's to blame .	4166
0	i tried culver 's for the first time today . i ordered the battered cod dinner to take home . the fries were overcooked , the batter on the fish fell off when i picked it up , the lemon wedge had no juice in it whatsoever - totally dry ! the good thing is the coleslaw is one of the best i have had , but this meal was not worth $ 10.00 . return business is doubtful right now .	4166
0	wow ... i 've heard great stuff about this place and have been dying to give it a try . well , i stopped by the drive-tru for my first time today and got the standard culver 's double cheeseburger meal . i was soooo disappointed ! the fires were just like grocery store frozen fries and the burger is without a doubt the greasiest one i 've ever eaten by a long shot ! i ca n't believe it is so busy with wendy 's and carl 's jr. right across the street . stick with carl 's jr. for sure .	4166
1	best starbucks ever ! great , fun staff that are extremely knowledgeable . they often hand out samples for both food and drinks . the music is usually top 40 or something catchy . a lot of seating inside , however , very limited parking outside and it 's always full .	4167
1	been here a few times . like the size of it and love that it 's a drive thru . also it 's open till 11 . not 10 as posted . i just walked passed	4167
1	amazing service . due to being a population location , a lot of customer drinks can take time to make , however they make every moment right with amazing service from the great staff . amazing cafe but can be crowded sometimes . one of my favourite starbucks locations . asked barista for suggestion of cool drinks and they always hit the spot . love the workers there !	4167
0	as much as i like this new location , it is ridiculous that it took me 15 minutes to get a coffee on a wednesday night . the guy in front of me left ... 5 people are working and only one person is dealing with customers . hopefully this will improve ... ?	4167
0	meh . way better locations in the area . the parking lot is a disaster , drive thru is slow , and they often run out of things ( eg . almond milk ) .	4167
0	bad cappuccino made ! ! the store atmosphere is good . but the parking space is insufficient .	4167
1	great food ( & quick ) . staff is very friendly ! ! always greeted with a `` hello '' . great fries too	4168
1	clean location ! very friendly staff , ask for sean ! had the steak sub , fresh-cut fries and a tea . they came out and checked to see how everything was .	4168
1	super friendly staff , delicious subs , and very clean bathrooms ! will definitely be back .	4168
0	everything was great until i got a super long black hair cooked into my sandwich as i already ate more than half highly upset ! i called to let them know the lady just says oh ok we will just remake it no apologies the best thing going was the nice girl who took my order she has great customer service skills . also there was a guy working there who came from a brake outside and just use a squirt of hand sanitizer and began cooking food eeewww gross his hands should have been washed with soap and water who knows what he was doing outside . as much as i love penn station this one gets thumbs down i will not be returning .	4168
0	disgusting ! if it were possible to give this location a negative star rating , i would ! avoid at all costs ! i went in to pick up an order and no one greeted me for over five minutes while i waited at the register , when i finally was greeted , the cashier had the nerve to get an attitude and act as though i was disturbing her . to top it all off , not only did they completely screw up my order , there was a hair in my food !	4168
0	the sand which i got was `` extra meat '' parts of the sand which did n't even have meat on it . i 've been to a dozen other penn stations and never had this issue . it was so bad i had to ask , to my face they insisted they did n't make a mistake . you be the judge .	4168
1	have it your way at burger king now ! ! that jingle can numb your soul ... especially when your teeth sinks into a freshly made whopper with cheese . they say you first eat with your eyes first and i saw that burger with fries , onion rings and ice cold diet coke , it said hurry the hell up and eat me already ! the food was awesome ( 5/5 ) and the workers were very friendly and actually smiled ( 5/5 ) . restuarant itself was clean and each table had a nice rose on it ( 5/5 ) . great instance of the chain ! !	4169
1	stopped here a few times for a late dinner . always satisfied with the service and food .	4169
0	this particular location is 24 hrs ... i ended leaving bc service took more than 20 mins . this is n't the first time either . will never go back ! horrible ! bk do n't stay open 24 hrs if you ca n't staff the place properly .	4169
0	this location is dirty ! the parking lot is dirty and unkept with trash , homeless people hang out all around the building and leave trash and cigs everywhere , and food handled by the workers is not sanitary . at night i would n't even attempt to go here because the area completely changes and does n't feel safe . this location was held up at gunpoint a couple of weeks ago . if you have the option , choose a different location .	4169
1	this place will not leave you with regrets , not only did they do a great job on my manicure , oanh did an amazing job on my lashes ! new customer that will be returning for their service .	4170
1	i love my nails , tiger is awesome . i live too far away , i stopped by while in phoenix treat my husband to a pedicure . i got one also and a polish change.tiger reshaped my nails and made them look pretty again , it 's so difficult to find a nail tech that knows how to do nails as the customer wishes or has the passion the tiger has . thank you tiger maybe one day my nails will see you again . i think ming did my toes , she 's awesome too ! ! ! happy customer	4170
0	pedicure was not so good for it being super basic it was painful my nails are n't even painted all the way and my toes are scratched however the tech that did my manicure cut my nail way too short and hurt me , he took blood out on my cuticles and my nails where long and he cut them so short my nails are super sensitive now and all uneven and jagged . would n't come here again but i guess it 's average way too over priced for mediocre services	4170
0	nothing like the nail tech rushing through making you feel like you are imposing on her by being there . even though we made an appointment . my girlfriend made an appointment for both of us to get sns ... my nails were bare there was no need to rush . she also did n't like the color i chose . i had to talk her into the color i chose . my nails were crooked and fat and crusty . my girl friends nails took 45 min . mine took 15 . do you see the problem , i urge you to zoom in on my pictures there are finger prints all over my nails . terrible .	4170
1	yummy ! ! this place was so good ! i ordered a shrimp platter and everything was so tasty ! best shrimp i have ever had ! great menu and service was excellent also ! i will be back !	4171
1	had dinner here recently with 3 other adults . service was quick , attentive . good menu selection . good drinks selection as well . we had the carmalized pear burger and the lamb chops . both were very good . we declined dessert offers , but there were good selections . would definitely eat here again . ''	4171
1	good food . good service . tasty sangria . for a chain restaurant i was happily surprised with the food here . the lettuce wraps and the jambalaya are my favorites . i like to try different restaurants ... .but if i ever run out ... .i 'll be back .	4171
1	visited the elephant bar while in glendale for a work trip . we enjoyed the dinner ! ordered the potstickers and ahi tuna as apps . both ok - nothing too special but worked great for our large table of picky eaters . as an entree i ordered the kung pao chicken and shrimp and was very impressed . spicy and delicious ! not in the mood for a drink so i ca n't speak for the bar menu or happy hour but everything else hit the spot and they accommodated a large crowd with no reservations . i would compare this place to a bj 's type chain - which is a compliment !	4171
1	if i could give them more than 5 stars i would ! their food and service never disappoint ! my husband and i went on a date night to the elephant bar tonight and our waitress , michelle , was by far amazing ! though they changed their menu , she gave a few suggestions on some new dishes and drinks they had to offer . wow ! i 'm so glad we listened to her and tried some of her favorites . delish ! they may not have some of their older dishes/drinks on the menu , but they still offer them which made our hearts happy !	4171
1	this place is right across the street from the peoria sports complex ... .we were there to watch some mariners spring training games . the yelp map puts this place in the wrong place on the map ... . great food and they have very reasonable prices as well , how weird ! when does that happen ? i loved the bar , but they really need to get some flat screens in there that are better ( easier to see and watch ) ... we were trying to watch the final four first and second round but we finally left to get a better view at another sports bar nearby ... .	4171
1	nice place , variety of food . excellent service . the menu is a little long and several pages . it was nice to see the managers making sure the food was going out correctly before the customer received it .	4171
1	i really liked this restaurant ! the atmosphere is safari themed but not tacky . the waitress was good and friendly . i sampled dishes from other family members ' plates so i had a little taste of everything . overall i liked everything . it has a lot of light yet tasty choices and many unique flavor combinations . will be sure to go again ! loved the rum colada : - )	4171
1	nothing wrong with this philly cheesesteak . overall everything good at this outpost of the chain . the appetizers had some potential with a decent version of coconut shrimp and potstickers . the spinach dip could use some help though . the sandwich was packed with ribeye steak , onions , peppers and provolone cheese . it came ( for 99 cents extra ) with a loaded baked potato and that too had a good amount of cheese and bacon . food is usually reliable at this chain .	4171
1	if you can give red lobster a 4 , i can give elephant a 10 ! but seriously , for a chain restaurant , this is almost as good as it gets . i like their ahi tuna ... .had their mongolian beef today which was good ( notice i did not say very ) and jo had the parmesan chicken which she thought was very moist and good . wait staff is almost always very attentive . happy hour prices are good , and the bar menu is very good . if i was comparing this to a locally owned , great restaurant , this would be a 3.5 . - but on yelp , as a chain , i do n't mind stretching .	4171
1	we went last night as a family . i have never been before . we started with the mozzarella with pita and parmesean green beans . for dinner , i ordered the lemon garlic chicken with brown rice . everything was wonderful . i wish i could remember our waitress 's name because she was wonderful . everything was pleasant . especially the wonton sundae desserts ! will defiantly return .	4171
1	being from salt lake , we had never heard of the elephant bar . we were visiting friends in phoenix and they suggested the restaurant , only one of the two friends had been to the bar before . the atmosphere was lively and fun . the menu items looked delicious ; it was hard to choose . the four of us placed our orders : build your own burger , island tilapia , rib-eye and jumbo shrimp , and shrimp adventure . everyone raved about their food . it was delicious . the service is the only reason i gave the restaurant four stars instead of five . the waitress had to be reminded a few times about drinks , condiments , etc .	4171
1	much better the second time around . food was better . got the macadamia nut crusted chicken with rice , tropical salsa , and wasabi sauce . service was good cuz i showed up around 5 , so the place was pretty empty . i 'll go back . not first choice , but a good choice .	4171
1	i love their happy hour and their e burger & other elections . but being a little older , i do n't like the bass drum of the overhead music . most of the people there for happy hour are 55 & older . we do n't like hearing the bass and feeling it too . how about something more pleasing and we would come more often .	4171
1	what a cool place ! my husband and i were really impressed with our entire experience . the atmosphere is so different and unique . we had the calamari appetizer and loved it . my hubby got a smoked burger and i had their teriyaki chicken which was outstanding ! i highly recommend this place because of the variety in food and good service . i 'll be back .	4171
1	i 've been to this restaurant since 2007 , and it was wonderful . now with the new menus which are 2 feet long are very obnoxious . they 've reduced the menu here and there , but it seems there 's room for improvement . the service will always be impeccable and always fulfilled my expectations .	4171
1	love this place . great food-service- environment . great happy hour specials ... can get a little crowded during spring training ... but that 's only a few weeks a year .	4171
1	everything was delicious ! my friend and i had originally been sat in the dining room , but it was a nice day out and we wanted to go to the patio , and they accommodated us quickly and they were very friendly about it . our server ashley a. took great care of us , she was on top of our every need without being overbearing . her timing with everything was perfect . overall it was a great experience and i will continue to come here .	4171
1	service was pretty good and our food was awesome . if you order lamb shanks , get just one as they are huge ! the mediterranean tri tip is amazing . the seared ahi tuna , want as good as i 've had in the past , but still ok .	4171
0	ok really bad service.. walked in.. no one greeted us.. so we walked to the bar and still nothing.. we ended up walking out .. i yelled out thanks ! never coming here again !	4171
0	the food was very good but the service left something to be desired . for the most part everything tasted good and was well prepared . my wifes mongolian beef had some tough peppers but you usually do not eat them anyway . this is the first restaurant i have ever been to where they bring your salad , after they bring you your entrée . before we finished our meal we were asked if we would like dessert . this made us feel a bit rushed and like they were in a hurry to get us checked out . we ordered dessert and our bill was brought to us before our dessert . maybe we wanted to order more ... .	4171
0	not great really . portion size was small . food had some flavor , but overall not something worth waiting for . we called ahead and still had to wait 30+ minutes . i had the lamb shanks and there was little to no sauce and the menu said it had mash potatoes . there was probably two tablespoons . atmosphere is cool , but not even close to one of the best restaurants in peoria .	4171
0	have gone there regularly for several years , but the last time they had a new - and higher priced - menu . a couple of us ordered salads for $ 14-16 each and were so disappointed that they were mostly greens with just a small amount of whatever were the toppings . way way too expensive for the little bit of stuff that was in it . another friend 's fries were cold , but they did replace them . not likely to be going back there any time soon .	4171
0	limited menu . if you are watching your salt intake . this is not the place to go	4171
0	the four of us all ordered either salads with grilled chicken or chicken sandwiches . everyone 's chicken was completely dried out and super thin . it was like a three day old piece of pounded out chicken breast . pretty gross . we went for dinner on a saturday night and it was totally dead . when we got there a few tables in the bar were seated with couples over 70 . by the time we were done the dining room was about half full with only people over 70 . i guess it 's because of the area ? i will never go back to this place . it was disgusting and the worst meal i have had in a long time .	4171
0	new menu now . all side items ala cart . very expensive for what you get . doubt we will ever be back . the day we went for lunch at noon time the place was dead . service was below standards . prediction is this unit will close at this rate . wound up ordering soup and salad . salad was about the worst dinner salad ever .	4171
0	the sirloin steak sandwich now come with fresh fruit vs the grilled tomatoes . looks like an afterthought and does n't seem to go with the dish . seared ahi tuna salad overcooked with tons of onions . waitress uninterested and brought us the desert menu with our check . i guess just in case ; ( . not enjoyable and will not return	4171
0	traumatizing experience - beware : we went here for dinner and ordered the dinner wok-fired specialty entree : crispy honey shrimp and mongolian beef . appetizer : warm and spicy artichoke dips . food is overly expensive , too salty , too fried , and felt very unhealthy , making us ill afterwards with intense stomach pain . i feet like i swallowed a large lump of coal . i 'm thankful for advil . on a happier note , our server is very nice and accommodating ; food came rather quickly . regardless , there are definitely better restaurants on bell blvd .	4171
0	went here for valentines day . we ordered the potato skin appetizzer which was actually awesome.. the entrees were just sad.. i got some country chicken and my man got a ribeye.. he liked his steak but my meal was inedible . the manager gave us a free dessert and took my meal off the bill , which was respectable . would i come back-never , recommend- never . should have just waited in the mile long line for the cheesecake factory .	4171
0	decided to give the elephant bar a try despite the reviews . it started out with promise as the zesty artichoke dip was actually really good and the chips were not overly salty like a lot of other places . i ordered the blackened mahi mahi with mango salsa . the mahi was slightly over cooked , not enough to make it inedible but enough to notice and the mango salsa was terrible but the mango butter made up for the salsa . my husband got the cajun chicken and it tasted like unseasoned microwaved meat . it was really thin chicken breasts and the creamed spinach it came with was terrible . we wo n't be going back .	4171
0	extremely noisey , undercooked rice , chicken very salty and dry , just not a good experience ! plus , we had 7 adults and a 1 yr old and they squeezed us all in a booth ! unbelievable ! on a positive note , the ice water was very good !	4171
0	this was a favorite of ours last year . joined their members club etc . called them today to see if patio was open for seating..yes . over we went ... greeter pointed us to patio door 'any seating is fine ' we were told . 15 minutes later ... no server , no menu , no acknowledgement that we were there . no more ... no chance..good luck !	4171
0	food was mediocre at best . service was slow . i do n't think i 'll return . just unremarkable ...	4171
0	get the asian food . every time we go , my wife gets the seared ahi or some other asian dish . i try it and it is wonderful . but every other type of food that i have had there is mediocre at best . usually it is flavorless and made with low quality ingredients . on the upside , the service has always been great . the atmosphere is wonderful . just remember , get the asian food .	4171
0	went for third anniversary . got lettuce wraps , orange chicken , and soba noodles . wraps were bland and cilantro sauce that came with it was very strange ... not in a good way . had a guy at booth next to us literally screaming at others tables , three times , and never saw management intervene . not the place we expected . next time will just go to pa change next door .	4171
0	eh , okay but not great . humongous menu and food seemed pretty hit and miss . my lamb was not very good ( i lost my appetite about half way through ) but the chicken teriyaki someone else ordered was okay ( do n't worry , that someone else was at my table , i did n't pick off the next table 's leftovers , though i was tempted ) . it just seemed like a cheesecake factory ripoff , huge menu catering to everyone but not as good food .	4171
0	looking for some good food , we went to the elephant bar hoping it had less of a chain feel than , say , pf changs . disappointed . the waitress ( who was really nice ) suggested the calamari as an app because it 's her favorite . we went for it.. and were deeply disappointed . if we were back in new york , i would have sent that crap back . entrees were decent , i guess , but still tasted like chain fare . nice to look at . drinks were ok. food , eh . we wo n't be back .	4171
0	i 've been to many elephant bars but this one has to have the worst service of all of them . if they would have given me a survey i would have certainly let them know	4171
1	great place to watch games and the food is out of this world . i 'd say best wings in ne ohio . sauces are all awesome .	4172
1	this might be the classiest establishment on lost nation rd.. very hot bartenders on friday evenings . ( danny b not included ) ask for my alix or yas .	4172
0	you ca n't expect greatness from a business ran by an alcoholic i guess . using your own product i suppose . very shallow place ... .i mean the name says it all does n't it ? if you do n't want to feel like you are in high school and all pathetic-like and are n't into high-fives and ass slaps , maybe go somewhere else .	4172
0	great place if you like reheated frozen crab . slow service under and over cooked foods .	4172
1	the plantains are really good . i got the chicken stew and loved it . stay away from the mashed plantain dishes..	4173
1	i have been buying this food since they open . they have a good menu and is very traditional caribbean food . they always treat you with respect .	4173
1	very good food , and customer service . saturdays are even better . been going for years now . best dominican food in charlotte .	4173
1	wow the food was amazing and the service was good . i will be back and would suggest you try the mofongo !	4173
0	came here with my family on a saturday night , the place was dark for a restaurant . extremely loud music . i did n't like that when my drink order was taken they bought out a can of diet coke , when there was visibly a soda machine with free refills . so had to send the can back . also the food was overpriced for your typical dominican restaurant . the food was ok in taste . would n't really go back to this place rather go to saona or abuelitas and they are very close by for better food and ambience .	4173
0	the owner has stop serving dominican food and now is a three amigos serving mexican dishes .	4173
0	this used to be one of my favorite places in charlotte ( i was even the mayor on foursquare ) and one of the only places in the city with authentic dominican food and atmosphere ... but then they changed ownership . they completely remodeled the restaurant which is nice but they increased prices , took some favorites off of the menu , and no longer give out plantain chips . i 'm sad i may have to start cooking again .	4173
0	came in at 11:45am for lunch . its 12:47 and we have not received our food . we walked out . im not paying for my order and never coming back . sucks because the food is great !	4173
1	these guys rock ! ! very professional and easy to deal with . if anything ever went wrong they immediately told me and fixed the issue . dave , ron & phil were great to work with and i will definitely use these guys in the future for other roofing needs . thank you all for your hard work and efforts ! chad mclean regional manager reliable carriers	4174
1	i have a red tile roof home in scottsdale . their salesman phil was very knowledgable and could answer any question i threw at him . they got the job done on time and did a great job cleaning up afterwards ( one of my pet peeves ) . i would highly recommend them . i 've had friends use storm chasers and these guys typically do a half ass job or take your deposit and never come back . kyko is local and they are awesome .	4174
1	kyko did a great job with my roof repair . they were prompt , courteous , and professional . they were done with a pretty big job in one day and after they cleaned up you wouldnt even know they were there . i would definitly reccomend them to anyone needing roof service in az .	4174
1	got a quote from ky-ko for tile roof repairs . they were one of the most reasonable and showed up on time and got the job done . we had been going round and round with several other companies just to get estimates . they did a great job and the roof has held up well with the heavy rains of 2014 .	4174
1	repaired leaking 2nd floor decking . were quick to arrive and provide an estimate . estimator took time to educate me on the process . workers arrived and explained their plan . they did the work , cleaned up and left without leaving a trace . the new deck looks a 1000 times better than the one our original builder did . would gladly use ky-ko again and would recommend them .	4174
1	for many years , and in several different circumstances , i 've had opportunities to work with ky-ko roofing . my most recent experience started with joe who worked with me in the planning stages of repairs to my roof that was originally surfaced over ten years ago . thereafter , the scheduling was handled professionally with notifications along the way and easy access to office personnel who were able to answer my questions . so pleased they continue to do business in the valley .	4174
0	average at best . one of two rotating air vents after workers reinstalled and painted it was installed crooked and neither rotated as they did prior . they fixed the crooked vent . but superintendent did n't seem to give a crap they were n't rotating . did not offer to repair or replace until i complained a 2nd time . since they do spin when wind over 20mph i decided to leave as is . no mess was left behind . office staff a pleasure to deal with .	4174
0	we have foam roof done by kyko and the company is not backing up their warranty with excuses . the foam is visible outside , coats have been peeled off from multiple places . there are multiple blisters on the roof . customer service is not being quite responsive . i do n't like to work with them in future or would not recommend anybody to do so , when a company is not backing up their own warranty and hesitate fixing so many issues with excuses .	4174
0	very difficult to contact . poor communication . took several attempts to contact them , and when appointments were scheduled , it was iffy if they would even show up . the work is average .	4174
0	very disappointed with this company . i had kyko install foam on my flat roof about 2 years ago . they cut 3 feet up on my shingle roof and foamed underneath the shingles . instead of correctly installing the shingles they just pushed the same shingles and cut underlining paper up without fixing to the roof . low and behold my ac service tech let me know about the issue . i have no clue how long it 's been like this or what damage it has caused in my attic . beware of this procedure ! very poor workmanship ! i tried posting this with no stars but it made me pick at least one .	4174
0	very bad customer service , communication with customers , and quality control . all in all it took them 2 months to replace our old roof , and the entire process was riddled with miscommunication , delays , and part of the roof having to be redone due to a mismatched color being installed . all said and done the work they did seems to be good , but the whole process was one long , drawn out headache . i do not recommend working with these guys .	4174
0	sad to say with all the roofing companies in the valley that there would be a trend of trying to get customers . i called and scheduled an appointment and no one showed up or bothered to call to say they were not coming . guess they did n't think we were worth the effort . time to move on .	4174
1	amazing ! i would go back here again , the food was amazing and large portion sizes . i really liked the privacy booths with curtain , i feel like the decor is great but can be better and the restaurant has alot of potential to be just that much more better !	4175
1	went there last week , what an awesome experience ! ! first of all great customer service they provided us at our table , the dishes we ordered , came within 15 minutes not even late . everything we order was very tasteful and excellent such chicken manchurian , hakka noodles , chicken fried rice , lollipop chicken , and chicken corn soup dishes were excellent . everyone shoul and muct try this place . thumbsup .	4175
1	great fresh food , with great prices ! not too oily , no too spicy ( can be if requested ) and such a great lunch deal ! enough parking , big enough place to not feel cramped up like most hakka places . and the taste is outstanding ! fresh ingredients , with freshly cooked food and great service . area is n't the prettiest , but the food is fantastic ! highly recommended and will be a loyal client . i 've been to many other hakka places and this one tops them all . btw - pakora 's are red .	4175
1	great food . decent service . i always come here because the portion sizes are rather large . i highly recommend this hakka establishment over others due to the fact that they offer larger portions for the same price as opposed to other hakka places . the bombay chicken would have to be my personal favorite but there are lots of other good dishes such as crispy ginger beef , hakka noodles , chicken pakora . i also love their deep fried banana served with ice cream .	4175
1	this place has a cottage feel to it with glittery curtains available at some booths . the service isnt the best tbh . communication is n't clear but they make up for it with the exceptional food portions and quality of food which is amazing i had their manchurian chicken w gravy and manchurian fried rice w chicken . came to $ 20 for me and my friend but i went home with enough food to feed two more ! really do get bang for your buck here	4175
1	this place was a surprise .. i was craving indo chinese food and found this place after a quick yelp search . portion size - huge , fried rice can easily feed 3 adults , quality is great nothing fancy , flavor- awesome it was bang on in terms of indo chinese flavor , price - super affordable . huge selection ! ! will definitely visit again !	4175
1	i 've been going to super hakka since they open and there food has always been delicious and consistent . huge portions . one plate can easily be shared between 2-3 people . i have n't tried there thai food but hakka chinese is on point . my recommendation is the bombay shrimp . spicy and delicious ! make sure you order that when you go there : )	4175
1	i like their menu they have everything there . best food for cheap price ! i always order before i go there and take everything ready . they never make mistakes good customer service .	4175
1	excellent service ! competitive prices great food i would definitely recommend this restaurant	4175
1	the food is good and joining the long list of great hakka restaurants in scarborough . if you are interested in hakka food and looking for a first time experience , this is the place . if you know hakka food and have never been to this restaurant , i would recommend as i have already dined at super hakka several times and the experience is the charm of a family run business . the comforts of chili chicken and any pakoras is done right at this restaurant .	4175
1	portion size is huge . but that does not bring down the quality . recommend the yeung chow fried rice , chicken pakora and manchurian chicken . halal too . would definitely recommend	4175
1	this place is the best embodiment of the fusion culture it represents and services the needs of this south asian clientele perfectly . the dishes could easily be on the menu anywhere in pakistan and india . and are prepared with that community in mind . with manchurian on sizzler and bombay chicken with fried rice , this place has all the hakka essentials . there are booths for privacy and the decor is 'understated family restaurant ' . the price are extremely affordable as you would expect with a family restaurant in scarborough . this place is great value , it serves it 's purpose well and is worth the drive . a near perfect restaurant .	4175
0	the food is decent , i had the yung chow fried rice , which was passable- lots of ingredients and a huge serving , but lacked flavour . my partner had the bombay fish which was flavourful but a bit too oily . price was great , after tax and tip it came to $ 24 combined . the service was very slow and disorganized . while going to the bathroom they removed our water . when we returned we had to ask for it again . then they only brought the jug and no glasses . my rice came quickly but i had to inquire about my partner 's fish , which in the end came 30 minutes later .	4175
0	we ordered cauliflower manchurian . the cauliflower florets were rotten . did n't want to argue . made our stomach upset the very night .	4175
0	a really bad service and the waitresses have a lot of attitude while talking to costumers . they keep asking for bill before you finish eating like they think you stealing or something .	4175
0	i was utterly disappointed with my order- got the shrimp with lobster sauce and can not believe they consider that food . first off , the shrimps were those cheap ones with shit still in the backs- the broth looked and tasted like puke and the customer service was horrible- never again- sticking to spicy dragon if i want hakka !	4175
0	superb service , fresh ingredients ... but oh the msg . holy buddha the msg . china cottage , lin garden , or good luck chinese are all nearby and manage to make better food without it .	4175
0	this place is realllyyy bad..the worst service ever ! ! ! we had hair in our food..the server just took the food and instantly replaced another like nothing happened..no apologies no explanations.. and she brought it out so quick . would have suspected it 's the same dish if were n't holding the first one . the food is definitely not fresh.. we also had to ask for plates and spoons ! ! ! and lastly the food..no taste or quality.. would have given negative if possible ... never returning	4175
0	very cheap and huge portions ! but it was n't what i expected as the food was n't too tasty and it was just extremely greasy chinese food in my opinion . service was meh , had to wait quite a bit for someone to take my order but i was n't expecting much . would make great drunk food if i was around the area again .	4175
0	i call for delivery but the dont do that . can you please correct that . not accurate information .	4175
0	we had a family dinner last week . the waiting staff was good . but the chili chicken was not great at all , compared to other restaurants . when we requested tea , it took about 10 -15 minutes before they showed up , and we had to call and remind them . i would n't recommend the restaurant . parking is very little , and crowded . side of the restaurant . but i would say the portions are big enough for 3 . very oily , it seeps . my view of the restaurant is clean though . but i would't go again .	4175
0	this was my favourite restaurant for hakka chinese until today . the lady/owner/order taker talks way too fast , does n't understand english properly and took a wrong order . we brought the food home without checking and trusting them to give us the right food . when we called them after getting home , another order taker asked me to bring the food down and they will replace it for us . minutes after the lady calling me back and starting arguing that i ordered wrong food and rather understanding she started laughing at me over the phone and said she will not take it back . worst customer service ! ! !	4175
0	we have had super hakka reliever in the past . however , we called in and they told us that they do not deliver and did not offer any reason . i am unsure if they chose not to do so anymore or they chose to not do it tonight . i am very disappointed in their level of service and will not be ordering from them again . also , they still say that super hakka delivers on yelp .	4175
0	cold food . ordered bombay chicken , chilli chicken and manchurian beef . hot and sour soup is the worst.. non friendly servers . restaurant interior is good . but food definitely needs to be improved . not satisfied . wont come here again	4175
1	`` que ling '' , or as it used to be called , `` boston restaurant '' was a good old-fashioned hk cafe with good brunches and value meals . even now that they 've swapped over to vietnamese cuisine , i still head there mostly for their hk food . the secret to the place is to not order the vietnamese food - that 's not what their chefs or original owners ran the restaurant as . go for the lunches and order their baked food , it 's much better than ordering their vietnamese food and more authentic as well . ( also as with most hk cafes , do n't go for dinner - same portions , upped price )	4176
1	randomly came here with the family . the place is what you expect it to be , a typical viet/chinese restaurant . they do serve authentic vietnamese food , and the prices are actually good for the quality/portion you get . we had ordered the portuguese chicken with spaghetti , highly recommend . tasty and enough for three people really . service was great too , they gave us enough lemons and sauces ( we just love to have excess ) . most likely will come back here , for a cheap lunch on a weekend ! !	4176
1	this place gets bonus points for its price point and also vietnamese authenticity . however , it is quantity over quality . it used to be the boston steakhouse but has changed into more of a vietnamese/hk style fast food restaurant . it is usually not too busy , but the portions are quite big . i had the spring roll which was very tasty and authentic with the right kind of crispiness for skin . i also had the pho , and that was a big portion , some meat . you are definitely looking at quantity of food for a very low price at this location . it also came with a hk milk tea which i thoroughly enjoyed to end of a meal .	4176
1	pretty decent . combination of vietnamese and hk style food . we ordered portuguese chicken with spaghetti and the meat rice rolls . prices for the food were quite good and the food was pretty tasty . would go again . recommend going here if you 're looking for a fast place to eat with good service .	4176
0	seriously not great ... hubby got the portuguese chicken rice , it was dry and sauce was sparse . i got the lemongrass chicken rice and ... ugh . the only thing i ate most of was the pickled radish . the chicken was doused in this concoction of really strong herby and gingery seasoning . i could n't eat even half of it . too strong . milk tea was not good . cream of mushroom soup was salty and watery . really expensive compared to some of the better places . 11.99 for lunch ? ? not coming back .	4176
0	my pho noodle & soup was luke warm . asked them to make it hot and they did by throwing my noodle and soup in the pot . noodle came back soft and nasty . meat was over cooked . do n't think i 'll go back again .	4176
0	do n't ever come here for vietnamese food . not sure why they would even bother trying . its clearly an hk restaurant still . their hk food items are great but their viet options are quite horrible . pho broth tasted like the instant powder you get at the grocery store . and their spring rolls were drenched in oil . disgusting .	4176
0	this is definitely one of the worst restaurant and i have ever been ! i ordered a vegetarian pho , chicken pho and an order of the rice roll . first of all , the rice roll is spoilt ! which i returned it right away without hesitation . the vegetarian pho , worst ever ! tasteless ! the veggies tasted bitter ! and i believe they were using no-so-fresh ingredients to make their food . well , if you are reading this before heading this restaurant , please reconsider and go somewhere else~	4176
1	i 've used perla 's appliance sales & service for appliance repair a few times over the past several years and i will never go anywhere else . they have always been honest , conscientious and easy to work with . their technicians have been prompt and reliable and excellent at repair . they have always taken the time to explain what is wrong with my refrigerator or microwave and their attempts at repair have always been successful . i highly recommend this professional business . they deserve the 5 start review i 'm giving them here .	4177
1	we called about a washer making strange motor noises and leaving oil on the floor . they came and diagnosed a bad motor , said it would be $ 300 to fix and it would be better to order a new machine . went to the store , found a floor model at a very good price . new machine install went flawlessly ; their install people were great . i will never go to a big box store again for appliances .	4177
0	rude , unprofessional , unreliable service . they do not show up for appointments , then reschedule and do n't show up again ... then they want to cancel service because you complained . save yourself the aggravation and use company with a good reputation . this is a joke !	4177
0	horrible , discourteous owner and inept service people . no way would i ever recommend this place .	4177
1	stopped by on a monday night and enjoyed half price wine and a great meal with friendly service . gyros were fresh and excellent , served with superb french fries . the eggplant hummus was an interesting twist and very rich and tasty .	4178
1	had dinner here tonight and it was fantastic . the spanakopita was the best i 've ever had , and the chocolate mousse was amazing . we will definitely be back .	4178
0	i went here for a gyro a few months ago and ordered it to go . when i got home i discovered a little black hair in my gyro sticking out like a sore thumb in the tzaziki sauce . i called them to complain , and the rude lady i spoke with told me that the cooks are bald . it was a little curly black hair and i can only guess where it might have come from . the rude girl told me she that the next gyro i order will be free . right ... free is still a bad price for a pube sandwich . never again .	4178
0	more like take five gallons of fluid out of my butt . worst food poisoning i ever received .	4178
1	jammmmmm ! new addition to my little `` hood '' marda loop . marda loop is getting so trendy and legit and with this new addition i was so excited to be one of the first peeps to stop by . to my excitement they also serve cold and enticing village brewery beer on tap so that added a star to my rating right away . the pizza has a great crust made with 00 flour with very fresh and plentiful ingredients . one of the sweetest things here is the price point . it 's so nice to have a pint of beer and a well made pizza without a serious gouging to go along with it . bellisimo !	4179
1	new favourite place in marda loop - get the dolce e piccante pizza	4179
0	the pizza is just ok and it 's definitely not fast like they claim to be . currently waiting on my pizza for 30 minutes , and counting ...	4179
0	not impressed at all . we dined in , restaurant was cold and messy . food took over 45 minutes and ended up being burnt on the rim of the pizza and soggy in the middle . i could n't even finish my pizza , it just did n't taste good . we wo n't be back	4179
1	at one point in late 2009 , i was going to this location at least twice a week for a month . it was not good for my wallet or my health , but my taste buds were not complaining . this taco bell has great customer service . the employees work really hard to get your food out to you in a timely manner . i get out of here so quick via drive-thru that i do n't even remember paying sometimes . i always order off of their value menu . the frutista freeze slushies taste really , really good . this location is awesome !	4180
1	this is by far the cleanest taco bell i have ever been to . i love taco bell and come here like twice a week . all the employees are very friendly . my only complaint is that their mountain dew baja blast freeze machine never works and that is my favorite drink . also , there is an employee ( named jose ) that always tells people to have a blessed day . it 's ok for him to be religious but he does n't have to implement it onto other people . overall this taco bell is great .	4180
1	i had the best customer service today by a girl named taylor . she was so pleasant and cheerful . i went through the drive thru and ordered . when i drove up she handed me my order and said have a great day and please come back and see us . i 've been coming here for years and never got acknowledged like that before . she was great .	4180
1	by far cleanest taco bell i 've ever been to ( which is probably like 100 taco bell 's ) and very friendly staff . food was great quality .	4180
1	we have been to this taco bell at least a dozen times over the past few months and it 's the cleanest outlet i have seen . the people behind the counter have always been polite and helpful and the food has always been hot and tasty . one time the dr. pepper tasted like water , but when i mentioned it , the server re-filled the machine , then brought me a super-large cup filled with soda . that was really nice of her . we love this taco bell ! one suggestion : this store really needs a remodel , as it really feels dated , faded and old ... but the quality of food and service , still outweighs that issue .	4180
1	great food . i have been to many taco bell 's . this one by far has the best service i have had at any fast food restaurant . i ate inside the restaurant which was very clean . the employees that i saw were very pleasant and smiling .	4180
1	i decided to write a review about the service only because i think all who eats at taco bell ... well , it is what it is . just wanted to write something about the cashier dylan who helped us . he was super friendly and had the biggest smile on his face . we dined in tonight and we heard him greet everyone who walked in with a friendly demeanor . unfortunately , this is not my typical experience at a fast food establishment . i 've been here one other time and he happen to be the one who helped us . he stood out then too . he 's definitely a model employee . nice job dylan ! you 'll go far !	4180
0	this location has very poor customer service . they rarely get orders correct , so double check before you drive away . also , although their drive thru menu clearly states they serve regular menu at 9:00 am they say they do not serve it until 11:00 am . do not question this ! if you do you will be treated rudely by the person taking orders ! ! just back away slowly and do n't make eye contact .	4180
0	this place needs to close . i ordered a taco salad with chili . when he gave me the bag i saw no chili . he said it was in a cup under the top level . when i got home there was a small cup of pico de gallo not chili . additionally the black beans were nothing but paste . furthermore , they never answer the phone number provided by google search . you are worthless . do us a favor and close .	4180
0	got food poisoning literally hours ago . avoid anything that has beef today . luckily i got my sister the steak chalupa and i was able to catch her before she ate the taco with beef in it . i had 2 bites of the beef chalupa and had to throw it away cause i was feeling real sick . i	4180

0	we walk in and there is a woman inside with a non service dog , just gross . dogs do not belong in restaurants , im tired of people thinking they are above rules and laws . manager is staring right at the dog , but says nothing , ridiculous !	4180
0	ordered two tacos and a chalupa meal . idk what girl was doing or who she was talking to , but was not paying attention at all to what was going on . hands me my pepsi , with the lid not on all the way , pepsi leaking down the side . i got home , instead of my chalupa meal for my husband , i got some kind of burrito that is now dog food . i think it 's a joke that people were protesting that fast food workers should get $ 15/hr . do you think that person deserves that kind of pay ? bottom of the gene pool working there .	4180
0	i dont do taco bell very often , but when i do , it is a craving . so i got a dozen soft tacos ... .6 meat and cheese and all with no beans or sour cream . i ordered a mexican pizza ... .havent head for over a year ... again , without refried beans and sour cream . i was asked `` no sour cream or beans '' and i agreed . the menu was correct . i got my order , drove home only to find beans on my pizza ... .ahhhhh , never again . as a teacher , i dont have money to throw out the window , however , i literally did at taco bell ! !	4180
1	i 'm a fan of spicy food , so this place was exactly what the doctor ordered . and as someone that has worked in the hospitality industry for years , the service can make or break an experience for me , particularly on a first visit . the service alone will bring me back for another visit .	4181
1	amazing authentic desi taste . kheer shooters are must haves . will definitely come again .	4181
1	i went onthelast saturday for dinnerw ith my family i was told by my freinds its a good resturant and tey were 80 % correct food was better than most of the indian resturants not the best people here are complaining abt service but my server anish was av gentlemen he was quick and courteous and gave us good input for the best dishes we tried lamb chops which were amazing we tried chili prawns which were good but the choice of jhalfrezi was not as good idea as it din tasted as i thought to be	4181
0	nice decor and good ambience , but a pretentious indian restaurant . good choice of mains and starters . very small portions , not great tasting , spicy and $ $ $ too . the special lamb chops was good though .	4181
0	i ordered the palak paneer poutine , the samosa spring rolls and the chicken briyani . overall i think they have some interesting twists on indian food ... but is it worth it ? the ppp was n't as good as a poutine and not as good as a palak paneer dish . same goes for the other fusion i ordered . and the chicken briyani was n't really one of the better ones i 've had . very plain and lacking flavor . they did however give me to side dishes , no idea what they are , but were decent .	4181
0	very poor customer service . waited long did n't got the food , came back , restaurant was too noisy with the tv sound . it seems no one was interested in the business	4181
1	i would like to send my sincerest gratitude the entire staff of davis for the way my mothers service was handled . it was the most beautiful service . the attention to detail was above and beyond . i would especially like to recognize char and rosemary for going the extra mile to make sure my entire family was comfortable and taken care of . as we were walking away from the grave we all agreed that was the kind of service we want .	4182
1	my family had an unexpected passing and it was devastating . on top of being emotionally overwhelmed we were financially overwhelmed , we had to get my loved one transported to the state we lived in , davis funeral home offered a service that to my surprise not every funeral home has , and that was to finance our funeral bill . instead of having to pay thousands of dollars upfront we were given the financing option through a company they work with and it gave us time to sort out the affairs . thank you from the bottom of our hearts to all the staff for your kindness and compassion .	4182
1	davis handled the interment of my father-in-law . our interactions were very positive . we worked with char . she was very professional and responsive . the facilities were well-maintained and peaceful . nellis air force base provided military honors , which were incredibly moving and well-done . davis worked well with everything we wanted . it was a beautiful ceremony .	4182
1	we recently used davis funeral home when a relative passed away . unlike the previous reviewer , i found the staff to be kind , respectful , helpful , and accommodating . we worked with brian and he was very organized and helped us go through the planning process step by step . because of the nature of the situation i find it hard to say the experience was pleasant , i can say that the staff did everything they could to make a very difficult time easier . thank you !	4182
0	every time i go to visit my mom 's grave i notice people in the workshop area smoking marijuana , why do these people still have jobs ?	4182
0	review is for davis on eastern . place is horrible my dad passed last feb. grass never grew . they just redid it and this is how it looks . they actually called and asked how it lookedhow about you look ? do you think dead straw sod looks ok ? obviously cheap and do n't know you need to water sod a lot . also took 6 months to get the wording on the tombstone correct .	4182
0	very busy i went there simply to take photos of headstones for www.findagrave.com just to do a good deed . i guess do n't walk in during a funeral and expect to be helped with a smile . they came through for me , they were very busy ... ... it was just okay not sure if i 'll ever go back , hopefully not lol anytime soon anyways	4182
0	no respect , no compassion , no concern , no dignity . failed to notify my family that our mother 's remains were ready for pick up . they just left her on a shelf somewhere . it was n't until after family kept asking , that it was admitted she had been ready for pick up for 2 weeks ! ! shameful !	4182
1	definitely one of the hipper and affordable places to go out in montreal . the place has a really cool dj and atmosphere . the building itself use to be an old pharmacy , hence the name baldwin barmacie . the cliental is fashionable , so dress to impress here . one of the cooler features of this bar is the option to buy 8 and 16 ounce bottles of hard alcohol ( as oppose to the standard 26 ) which makes it much more affordable and cool . when you buy one of these bottles , you get all the mixers you want for free . try it out !	4183
1	i would n't call this a restaurant . its a bar that serves grilled cheese and mac and cheese ... anyways the drinks are great . try the apple martini- best i 've had . the tom collins was also great . its a very hip place and really chill on quiet nights . i really recommend this if you are looking for a swanky cocktail bar with good drinks . be prepared to spend a good $ 12 plus tip per cocktail .	4183
1	really trendy , cool place . a great late night scene .	4183
0	yo this place is for yuppies . if your a real punk go drink at casa del popolo or l'esco . the ambiance sucks and the menu is stupid . you go to pharmacies to feel better and bars can make you pass out blotto on the sidewalk in your own puke ! would a real pharmacy cause you that much misery ? no . so this place is , in fact , a logical fallacy ( or phallacy for you pervs , boinggg ! )	4183
0	commercial wanna-be sophistication . status quo bah humbug culture . not for the discerning .	4183
0	saturday night brings all the 18 year olds to the bar . later and later the crowd turned pre-puberty . i 'm not an ageist , it was just ransacked with uni kids . which explains the sweetness of the cocktails . almost too sweet apart from the dark & stormy was really good . the mojito would make mexico disown the mojito . the bourbon punch makes you want to punch yourself for making a horrible decision . the space itself is cool and super nice for a weekday date . hot tip .	4183
1	good hotel , great service even if it was full ... . breakfast included in our deal . a lot of choices , smoked salmon , a lot of fresh fruits , croissants and all kind of danishes , french toasts etc ... i would go back .	4184
1	pour un congres avec la compagnie 2 nuits dans une chambre très confortable avec un lit d'excellente qualité . très propre , bonne odeur de fraîcheur . le buffet déjeuner était très bien pour les deux matins les salles de réunion et banquet etait également parfaite quoi que difficile à contrôlé du côté température . le bar et la salle à manger de l'hôtel ont été rénovés et sont très modernes et élégantes .	4184
1	un peu comme chez moi ... oups ! ! vraiment un bel établissement ; - )	4184
0	absolutely rude service and only half the hotel is renovated ! worst stay ever ! ! ! !	4184
0	the hotel try 's very hard to make it look 4 star . however the service is extremely substandard .	4184
0	we were shocked by rude behavior . when calling to confirm reservation as one always should when booking online , my husband was meet with a very rude response from reception , she refused to take confirmation number or allow my husband to speak with manager . very bad first impression if this is the way they treat guests not sure we want to stay here . have never been treated so badly and we travel a lot .	4184
1	this location deserves five stars ! i dined in tonight for the first time and it was very apparent that they have a team effort going here . they were all enjoying each other and providing great customer service . i believe the store manager was there and he was very nice also . the food quality over the years has gotten better with mcdonalds and there presentation definitely showed that . this location was very clean and picked up . i enjoyed eating my dinner and watching the news on the tv . we will continue to come to this location !	4185
1	teenagers stepping up to fish combo ... oh the days if the simple cheese burger and nuggets ... \ nice work kiddo	4185
1	is it me or has corporate management implemented something that has improved the service at mcdonald 's on the whole ? my brief drive-thru visit was quick and efficient and i was met at the window by a young man who seemed sincerely happy to be doing his job . good for him and good for mcdonald 's . keep up the good work !	4185
1	comfortable and modern . my son and i stumbled upon this mcdonald 's when we were driving around and got a little peckish . the decor was clean and spacious , and it had a nice cafe feel to it . service was pleasant , and we enjoyed a couple of spicy mcchicken sandwiches , fries and a mccafe drink . we enjoyed our little visit .	4185
1	after my gym workout i come to this location . they are very busy at lunchtime ( have n't come at dinner ) . service is very good , taking the crowds into consideration . place is clean . one of the nicer mcd 's .	4185
0	absolutely horrible service and extremely dirty . do not eat here . there are better options .	4185
0	i went to mcdonalds about 12:30 p.m . i ordered a quarter pounder with cheese no pickles no onions . what i received was a hard crusty bun dried out cheese . when i removed the bun i could see where the pickles had been on my burger where the onions had been before they scraped it off . i threw the meal in the trash it was disgusting i would n't feed that to a enemy . my god mcdonalds please train your people or get people who care about the quality of the products they put out .	4185
0	this is two times that i 've come to this location and my bbq bacon signature burger was made with far less than quality ingredients . one small hard piece of bacon , hardly any onions at all and no cheese . do yourselves and your customers a favor and train your staff on providing good customer service and to portray your company professionally . i witnessed one of the managers belittle the fry cook for not helping the cashier enter in a coupon for a customer because he had to walk from the back up to the counter . he then went back to goofing off with the guys behind the grill .	4185
0	i went to this location the other day , and there was a homeless man standing at the counter waiting for his food . the man had no shoes on , and was bleeding from his hands on to the counter . once this customer left , no employees , or the manager , wiped off the counter . this is a huge huge violation , and i highly suggest you consider this before you go here . they did not wipe the blood off the counter , until i told them . this is a huge health risk . i highly suggest you consider this .	4185
0	this mcdonald 's needs some serious help from customer service . the manager melody should not be a manager but in the back peeling potatoes . they continuously get the order wrong and make customers wait 25-30 min for a redo . go thru it yourself and see what i 'm talking about . melody 's body language suggests she is burned out and does not hold the mcdonald 's core values .	4185
1	great breakfast food ! travelled from chicago to try guy fieri recommendation of kelly o 's . turns out our waitress is from our hometown , from a chicagoland suburb . waitstaff vey friendly and attentive to our needs .	4186
1	best diner in town . i 've only been here for breakfast but i 've gone to both locations , strip district and north hills . there 's a waitress at the strip district that is really awesome . they use good quality ingredients . i 'd recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice , fresh fruit cup , any of the eggs benedict ( it 's done perfectly ) and they even have fried mush !	4186
1	not the fastest or friendliest service this morning , but certainly good enough . the fresh fruit served with my cheese steak omelette was exceptionally ripe and tasty ... the raspberries , blueberries and melons were all perfectly ripened . omelette was very good as well . nicely done kellyo 's .	4186
1	good food and everyone i spoke to was pleasant . fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome ! !	4186
1	awesome place to go , staff is totally approachable : ) very comfortable and welcoming place . well manners are greatly appreciated here : ) food was delicious . i recommend the turkey pot pie and the french toast . gregory scott 's favorite is now leo 's favorite : d thank you kelly , family and staff ! love two pleased new yorkers	4186
1	i have no idea why everybody does not give this diner five stars . excellent home cooking and generous portions with very reasonable price . highly recommend it !	4186
1	delicious food ... . waitress was patient and friendly . she took our orders perfectly ! definitely go back when we are back in steel city	4186
1	my siblings and i went there yesterday . we breakfast together every month . our first time at kelly o 's . but not our last ! ! one of the best breakfasts we have ever had . we sampled pancakes , delicious french toast , grits , belgian waffles , grilled cinnamon rolls , bacon . all excellent . as was the service . really tasty . reasonably priced . cool place . we can not wait to go back !	4186
1	omg ! i 'm so sad at how many low reviews kelly-o 's has ! : ( i visited here back in june 2009 so it was quite a long time ago but i can remember the service being great . their coffee being one of the best coffees i 've had in a long time . and the food being great too ! we decided to visit after they were featured on tv and we definitely do n't regret going ! it was great !	4186
1	i went for breakfast on sunday and sat at the counter and i was treated right away and everyone was so friendly . i ordered an omelette and it was delicious ! great food and the servers are awesome !	4186
1	we 've never had a bad experience at kelly 's other than the breakfast was too huge . man , do they give you a lot of food ! i recommend the haluski and the turkey pot pie soup . the breakfast is served with mancini 's bread toast , a mountain of fresh home fries and perfectly cooked eggs . fresh-squeezed oj to wash it all down , and i 'm gtg until dinner ! we 've always had great service . it 's a hole-in-the-wall but worth finding .	4186
1	wow , three star only . must be some extra picky breakfast diners . anyways , i normally get the breakfast original but i noticed the california omelette this morning . three eggs , scallions , avacado , pepper jack cheese and fresh pico with potatoes and dry wheat toast . great breakfast with multiple coffee refills equals a five star in my book ...	4186
1	second time i 've been here . just as good each time . great service , great prices . thanks kelly os staff !	4186
1	good diner food ! comfortable , cozy , friendly . coffee is steaming and filled up constantly . love the specials on the board ! eggs benedict , crabmeat omelets ... yum ! all the basics , too , served alongside mancini 's toast ... talk about pittsburgh classics ! fried mush has always been my fav . who knew it could be even better with just a touch of crumbled bacon ? ! just the right balance of salty and sweet . this is a great place to start your day off with smiles and kind words from all . yay kelly-o !	4186
1	such a cute little old fashion place . absolutely love the old fashion diner decor , and they have just about the best french fries and chicken strips around . i live about 15 minutes away , but whenever we go out for breakfast for mother 's day or a special holiday or just anything - it 's always here . so cute and good . a little on the over priced side though , but the food is worth it .	4186
1	they sure do love to advertise that they were on diners drivein 's and dives . it was written everywhere inside . the waitress was ok , not too friendly but she got our stuff without a big wait . i was really excited that they have bratwurst for breakfast and you must get the turkey pot pie , no matter what time of day .	4186
0	waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order . 20 minutes later drinks still did n't come . we got up and left and the waitress had no idea why we were upset . the place was n't even that busy . very disappointing .	4186
0	i was served cold corn beef hash , no 1 in my group was overly impressed . 1 visit was enough .	4186
0	kelly o 's is such a rip off it 's crap diner food that has every waitress smelling like stale bar cigarettes . you get nothing for the high price they charge you . i live right up the street literally and i wo n't step foot in there .	4186
0	the last two times we were in for breakfast there was a lot of yelling going on . i think it was the owner yelling at one of her waitresses about a messed up order . they were in the back , in the kitchen ... you could hear her yelling out in the dining room and what she was saying ... wow , lots of curse words were flying . the food has been good but we wo n't be going back . it gets quiet and uncomfortable while she 's yelling . the dining room gets a little quiet and it ruined our breakfast .	4186
0	the atmosphere is nice so i expected a good meal . i got my plate and everything was cold . food lacks flavor . have you ever eaten cold eggs , yuk . service not helpful . i have only been there once , but once was enough to turn me away . i think all they need to do is heat the plates before plating the food along with delivering the meals quickly and they would be able to fix the heat problems , but not sure how to fix the flavor issue . it 's like they intend to dissapoint .	4186
0	the food was a okay , typical diner food . my issue was our waitress . it was labor day and kelly os was one of the few places open , i understand they 're busy and trying to turn over tables . however , that is literally no excuse for her condescending demeanor toward us . furthermore when we were literally still putting food in our mouths she asked at least three times if we wanted boxes and were ready to go . i will much rather wait in the line at deluca 's for an hour than have that customer experience again .	4186
0	do n't go within an hour of close ... horrible service horrible food . breakfast dishes did n't look too bad but burger was on torn bun , onion rings were from the onion skins and soaked with grease ... just not what you expect from someplace that was on ddd on food tv .	4186
0	disappointed with the last couple visits . have gone to this establishment since it opened . initially a great place , but it is now marginal . today , a simple breakfast is over easy eggs came out so over cooked , i could have made egg salad . get back to the basics and hire a few more cooks . wo n't go back .	4186
0	i always trust my man # guyfieri on great spots to eat , and am a loyal fan of # dinersdriveinsanddives . however this spot has either lost its flavor or just really made a great impression for the fame . food was tasteless , service was horrible and just rude . 1star for the cleanliness as well . an employee was wiping walls , seats , and tables with the same rag . # kellyomygross	4186
0	checked this place out because it was featured on diners , drive-ins and dives . what a disappointment . the food was no more special than any run of the mill diner . in fact i might say it was worse than the average diner . i ordered eggs with corned beef hash and the corned beef hash was almost certainly canned . it came out cold and the eggs were overdone . the coffee was watery . it was really shocking to me that this place was featured on the show .	4186
0	i came here for a late breakfast and ordered the chicken and bacon club sandwich with fries . i did n't mind waiting slightly longer than average for the food to arrive , but the service was quite slow . when the food arrived , it was alright but certainly nothing special . flavors were bland , and my orange juice was watery . after we had finished , the bill never actually came , nor did our waitress . after waiting for quite a long time , we had to ask . perhaps worst of all , the meal itself was way ( way ) overpriced for what we ordered .	4186
0	never ever eat here . i was having lunch with my children and a girl came in trying to talk to the owner kelly . the owner started screaming at her , swearing . i had my two children with me and i will never bring them to this place again . please keep your children out of this restaurant . she is an angry unappreciative woman . do not give her your money	4186
0	no words are sometimes the best only three people in there at 2 pm for lunch and i could n't get a prompt server or one that would take my payment	4186
0	this kelly o 's used to be our favorite , but the last two times have n't been that great . they messed up all three aspects of my wife 's breakfast . wrong toast , wrong eggs , and they forgot her side of fruit . they eventually corrected it , and then took her entire meal off the bill , but it 's still a disappointment . while the people who work there are nice , in the future we will stick the strip district location .	4186
0	the idea of what kelly o 's could have been was wonderful . a real `` mom & pop '' diner , two minutes from my house serving up tasty recipes . my wife and i envisioned making it part of our weekend routine . well , what kelly o 's is in reality is a real disappointment . bland , boring and way overpriced . trust me , you 'll find better quality , more variety and originality at one of the chains , of which there are quite a few in close proximity . kelly o 's is not worth the effort .	4186
0	do n't waste your money . reasonable service from wait staff , poor food quality and way over priced .	4186
1	i had a great run as a tenant there for a year , the staff and the management , was always helpful , i only moved because i bought a house.. very family friendly and never had any problems . all repairs were fixed promptly . thanks : )	4187
1	i like the property its kept up , traci assistant manager has great customer service , takes time to know tenants and their concerns , she does awesome job with accounting always on point , does n't make mistake . maintenance staff is friendly and they have done a good job when asked to get something fixed .	4187
0	please do n't be fooled . they will charge you extra for every year you continue to sign a lease . the management sucks ! they do n't help at all . their jobs are just collecting rent and being rude to you when it 's late . they 're only nice when you 're signing a lease . also there are hidden fees that you may not know about that will present itself when you live there . so watch out ! if you live on the bottom floor you will hear everything that the person is doing upstairs . bad quality housing . i wo n't be signing another lease again . las vegas apartments are horrible !	4187
0	keep all documents and take pictures before and after your lease . they make faulty charges and staff are very unhelpful . my brother 's scooter was also stolen here and when we reported to the police the officers said there has been a lot of reported incidents in this apartment just like that . take your business elsewhere .	4187
1	my neighbourhood bar . i love the staff and often drink with them . til the wee hours . great daily food and drink specials . cheap pool and darts . good atmosphere for sports games on one of them many televisions .	4188
1	daily beer specials . friendly staff . cheap pool ( $ 2 ) . patio . eats .	4188
0	big playoff night so very busy . staff excellent . food atrocious . even the soup of the day .. chicken noodle.. slimy macaroni , chicken in a beef broth . burger worse than fast food . go for sports but not for food . everything seemed deep fried & frozen . good selection of beer .	4188
0	terrible food . flat beer . bad service . uncomfortable atmosphere . gross .	4188
1	great place to bring your car for an oil change , car wash , or detail ! i 've been coming here for probably over a year now at least , and they 've always done a great job at all three for me and my vehicles .	4189
1	came here on a friday midday . my tahoe had major water-spots on it from my sprinklers . i told the guy i had 1:30 . he put 3 people to work on my vehicle and got the full detail completed within time . these guys are good .	4189
1	i wash my truck once a week there , they do a great job . i hope you all can go there and get a good wash .	4189
1	great service ! ! these guys are awesome ! really good deal for a full service wash too !	4189
1	absolutely a great place.. i have been coming here for a while to get my car cleaned . today i woke up to find someone scratched the hell out of my car , i took it in , and they were able to wet sand it and buff it out to almost perfect . they were amazing and i was a basket case because the car is brand new and the entire passenger side hood was beat . did a great job . bottom line is that i will continue to use this place for years to come	4189
1	super friendly staff , and fair prices for car wash in the area . they take their time cleaning the cars unlike other places they want high turnover so they finish your car quickly . overall i 'm very satisfied and will definitely come back .	4189
1	francis & sons bought the car wash where arizona auto wash used to be , and i 've been impressed by the improvements ever since . as a residential realtor , i drive a lot , which means i need car washes more regularly , too . the quality of the wash at francis & sons seems to be better than most , and i think the service is friendlier , too . i would definitely check them out if you 're in the area .	4189
1	very professional and fast service . worth taking your vehicle to them . price may be a little more , but they are very thorough !	4189
1	my car has n't been this clean in a long time . the services provided for the amount of money paid was great . vacuum , automatic car wash , and hand finish both inside and out . they washed the interior windows ( got the dog nose prints off ) , the rearview mirror , and cleaned all the interior surfaces . all of this for only $ 20 ! i got the ultimate wash because hey , it was $ 5 off and why not right ? i will go back every time my car needs a wash. great value	4189
1	the service is great here . i love the fact that you can sit inside in the ac or outside in the shade . staff is very friendly . i do not care for the guys upon entering trying to locate chips or nicks in your windshield . i understand that 's their job but last time they tried to tel me i had a new one , when it had actually been there and filled over a year ago .	4189
1	this place is literally not as bad as everyone frames it to be . they do a decent job , as best as anyone can wash a car after washing plenty all day long . people were friendly and did their job well .	4189
0	i had my jeep washed here twice , the first time they did their detailing job which was overpriced at 89.00 , the treatments they put on the exterior washed off in the rain two days later leaving streaks all over the place . this last time i made the mistake of leaving a set of bose earphones worth $ 145.00 on the console and an audio cable worth $ 10.00 on the dashboard , and the attendant doing the cleaning obviously figured they needed them more than i did . in short do n't trust this operation . mesa location !	4189
0	absolutely piss poor job . the vip wash was anything but ... water spots on my mirrors , dirt and dust all over the inside like it was never touched . for 15+ bucks you should be ashamed of your business and your staff , who is in too much of a hurry to get off the clock that they ca n't even do their job right .	4189
0	do n't come to this location ! bad customer service i specifically asked for a hand wash then they ran it through the machine !	4189
0	never come here . car wash and vacuum job is mediocre at best . paid for a full detail and wax , wax was still on outside of car when it was done and they saturated the door panel sp much my window control does not work anymore . the gm agnacio or however you spell it is a piece of **** and does not deserve his position . no customer service . you all will be hearing from a lawyer . sad you did n't want to fix a 65 $ part your yelp status as it is stands is mediocre so legal action is the only thing left for me .	4189
0	i bought the ultimate car wash today expecting to get back in my car happy with the finished product . wrong ! it looks like they shook out my mats , not vacuumed them . the wipe down job was splotchy . and my windows have water marks all over them . the $ 6 car wash with me vacuuming does a better job than the $ 30 i just paid . not happy with this service .	4189
0	very poor job . the interior of my car looked like they did n't even try to clean it and were too lazy to put my mats back in place . i came in around 10am and it was n't busy at all , so there 's no excuse for such a sloppy job . would n't recommend !	4189
0	i just took my sentra in there i got the vip wash and i 'll tell you not worth it they berly touched my carpet did n't even touch my rear carpet did n't touch my seats and only cleaned my dash , also did n't even put armor all or anything on there : / probably not bringing my car back here again .	4189
0	wtf waste of money 15 bucks for what windshield cleaning ? - go to the 3 dollar car wash and save - got in and out in 5 minutes lol which is not a good at a car wash - why is there still debris from before the car wash hanging off my car	4189
0	you think i would learn my lesson . every time i go to one of the francis car washes , i have to teach them how to finish off the car . i 'm the customer that never comes back !	4189
0	do n't bother going to this car wash . i went in for the basic wash and the salesman immediately tried to upsell me on other services i did n't want . this guy would not give up and after being annoyed i went somewhere else . if you like being annoyed by salesman then this is the place for you .	4189
0	although i asked the service providers to redo several things , i became somewhat frustrated when what the did made things worse . wind shield wipers left on so when i started car windshield was dirty again . console and dash not clean . scuff marks on door and rocker panel . mats dirty . back not vacuumed . side windows still dirty . bugs on hood . olive in windshield wipers well and spots in well , obviously not lifted and dried . if i could give a zero stars i would . wo n't be back here and would never recommend this place to my worst enemy .	4189
1	pizza was excellent and made exactly to order , including special instructions . online ordering site is very easy to use .	4190
1	great pizza and a nice place to eat . i sat in and ate yummy pizza i have also had take out from here as well both great i have only had the pizza i will go back and try some other foods	4190
1	have been a customer since they have opened . their staff is friendly and never fails to recognize returning customers . pizza is fantastic and can be ordered anyway you want it . plethora of ingredients for toppings . all other items i have tried are great buffalo chips appetizer is money ! they are also very active in the community in helping the local schools . contrary to some reviewers , they have always been nice and friendly to my entire family . minutes from my house is a bonus , this place is great !	4190
1	for a chain type pizza place the food is pretty good . the best item we have had off the menu is the wings . the pizza is decent , but not great . the salads are good but not great . the garden salad is just iceberg lettuce , a couple tomatoes , a few slices cucumber and onion . could have used some olives or peppers , but the oil and vinegar dressing is great . overall a good solid pizza place , just not as good as some of the more authentic ny style pizzerias .	4190
1	lunch menu options are really good . i got the stromboli , which was almost too big , but it was delicious and perfectly cooked . close to work and great prices .	4190
1	lunch menu is on point ! you get 2 slices of pizza plus a drink for about 6 bucks . pizza is good ! tip is obviously not included ! service is good , place is nice , i will most definitely be back .	4190
1	was there last friday night . this place now serves the best pizza per my picky kids . personally it was very good . the staff provided prompt service , especially on my limited time schedule . definitely will return .	4190
1	i love johnny bruscos . great pizza , really yummy garlic knots , and good pasta too . prices are reasonable . they have good lunch specials . staff is friendly . i definitely recommend this place for some delicious pizza !	4190
1	good pizza and wings . this is definitely a place i will return . i will never eat pizza from pizza hut , papa john 's or dominos again !	4190
1	teriyaki wings are delicious and crispy ! bbq chicken pizza is the bomb ! lol check them out !	4190
1	if you live in highland creek or sky brook area . this pizza joint is a great addition to the other restaurants around our hood . you can order by the slice or pie . great place to have a quick beer and slice of pizza . beer specials during the week . new york style pizza with attitude . small bar area with plenty of free parking . i 'll give it 5 stars just because i like their ny attitude & close to home .	4190
1	convenient , clean and good wait staff . food is authentic and delicious .	4190
1	we 've been eating here for about a year and even though it 's a hike from our house , it 's worth it ! ! ! the best is eat-in because leftover is not as good as other pizzas . do n't know why that is , but there you have it . the garlic rolls are amazing , the sause is tdf ( to die for ) . wish there was one closer to our house ... ..no , take that back , we 'd all be heavier .	4190
1	great place to eat very friendly staff awesome owner came and introduced himself to us . food was excellent had a stromboli huge thing is huge at taste great . they also have beer great place to hang out with friends enjoy some great food .	4190
0	the food quality and quantity has declined in the past 5 months . we ordered chicken parmesan take out ... the first time was excellent , the second time the chicken was smaller and less sauce . the third time there was no sauce on the noodles ( literally no sauce ) the food was dry , the salad had spoiled cucumbers , brown lettuce and the lasagna dinner was dry too . so disappointed !	4190
0	while the service has never been an issue , our most recent visit this past tuesday left a lot to be desired . stopped in to take advantage of the $ 2.00 slices ... we ordered garlic bread while waiting . our slices arrived shortly after and all i am able to presume is that they were sent through the microwave ! the crust was `` sloppy '' ..no crispness at all . sent it back for what i hoped was to solidify the pieces a bit more in oven..upon return of slices it looked and tasted like nothing further was done . even my son who never complains about his pizza felt the same . very disappointing ... not sure if we 'll ever return	4190
0	usually get great food here but on our last trip my strombolli was undercooked and the wife 's stuffed shells were still frozen on the inside our waitress was wonderful at least	4190
0	decent pizza but not top notch as one of the other places in the area . the staff is ok but guess i am used to a certain caliber of pizza and this is not that high up there . a lot of the locals seem to like it though .	4190
0	food has gone way down hill , i used to eat here all the time but every time there is a change in management or ownership ( which is often ) the food quality gets worse . i went in two weeks ago for some takeout and ordered spaghetti and meatballs . once i received my food i got in the car to drive home . the food really smelled bad in the way home but i was so hungry when i got home that i tried to eat it anyway . needless to say it was awful . i 've had better out of a can . this place has got ta step up their game or they will fail .	4190
0	i 've been here a few times and the food is ok , but the service is terrible . my last and final visit we never got waited on . it 's a seat yourself place and we sat for nearly 10 minutes and watched server after server walk by us and never looked our way .	4190
0	nothing special , nothing awful either . i had a cheese steak that was just alright . i did n't care for the seasoning but , that may be a personal preference . my wife had a buffalo chicken sandwich that she said tasted like straight tabasco . so i guess that could be good or bad based on your level of love for tabasco . service was ok but , not great . i 'm sticking to my local non-chain places .	4190
0	i 've eaten here several times with no complaints but tonight i received disappointing food and service . the buffalo chicken wrap is supposed to have grilled chicken - mine had stringy canned chicken and a ridiculous amount of hot sauce . a runner brought our food . our waitress never came back to check to see if it was good and never refilled our drinks . i had to flag her down twice to get her attention . others at my table enjoyed their cheesesteak sandwiches . i wo n't be back .	4190
0	service has gone downhill . must be new poor management , because mostly the same staff . pizza came out basically raw , the dough was uncooked . we ate there frequently , i gave them benefit of the doubt and tried it out again . it was worse !	4190
0	the pizza was terrible and horrible ! the mariana sauce was spicy and sour ( which it should n't be ) , tasted exactly like a frozen pizza . they do n't have good cooks or something today as i expected decent food . even pizza hut would have been far better . there are many places that have cheaper prices which serve more authentic pizza with more portions . i suggest going somewhere else with your money .	4190
0	so disappointed . it 's misleading to advertise new york style pizza . the crust is incorrect . the cheese is incorrect . our fresh basil tomatoes pizza was sprinkled with 5 specks of basil and chopped tomatoes . need verification , but we think the tomatoes are canned chopped tomatoes . the pies were drowned with too much cheese ( cheap shredded mozzarella ) .	4190
0	if i could give them negative stars i would . we came here with a party that was booked for 35 people . our party was booked at for 6:30 and it 's now 8:10 and i was just informed that they forgot my order for my son and i . a manager never came over to say anything and they still charged me for my drinks after they forgot my order . i will never recommended this place to anyone .	4190
0	my husband and i had the stromboli and both were disappointed . both were very hard in the bottom and doughy on the inside . the bottom was burnt by i think something else in the oven . and the small lettuce sale was way over priced for the size . next time we will stick to pizza .	4190
0	wow just wow . my dad had brought this home for me for dinner , the first wing was delicious and everything was fine it was n't until i bit into the second wing and noticed that the meat was pink ! so i bit open all the other ones to see if there 's any other ones that were like this ... all of them except one was n't pink . this is disgusting .	4190
1	this is now one my favourite places for dimsum . good price , food is consistently delicious , and service is okay . if you can go before 11am , they offer early bird special .	4191
1	my friends and i are regulars . the restaurant manager is very accommodating and the service is great . one of the best chinese restaurants in toronto . the food is diligently made and so fine , unlike in other restaurants that seem too commercialized . my favourite would be the glutinous rice stuffed chicken ! this place is definitely worth going back !	4191
1	my family and i always come here for lunch and dinner . their dishes are delicious and with a reasonable price . this place is also really tidy and clean which i think it 's really important for a restaurant . i recommend their noodles lunch menu , you get to pick your booth , type of noodles and toppings , they come in large bowl so it 's totally worth it ! i do n't really have anything to recommend for dinner dish because all their dishes are great , baked pork with fried rice in a bread bowl is fantastic !	4191
1	great dim sum ! the variety and quality of dim sum here is probably some of the best around . they do it right with the standard items plus they have some unique items such as their fluffy bbq pork bun . this is n't just your standard bbq pork bun . it comes in one that has a very soft and light bun and filled with a large amount of pork . it is probably twice the size of your normal bbq pork bun . they egg custard bun is also amazing . runny sweet egg yolk filling . service is good and the atmosphere is nicer than most . highly recommend .	4191
1	one of our favorite places to go for dim sum . food was really good and the service is above-average . really impressed when asked for cold water they provided us with cold bottled water ! something did not expect at all . been there for dinner . portions could be a little bit more but overall food is very good . i would definitely recommend if you 're looking for a dim sum to go there !	4191
1	i was pleasantly surprised that they serve dimsum here after changing owners . and the dimsum was really good . i believe if you come for early bird special that all dishes are $ 2.99 . my favourite dimsum dish is siu mai and they were delicious here . really recommend checking them out !	4191
1	the parking here can be a nightmare on weekends . during the weekdays can always be a pain depending time of day . this place , you order dim sum through paper , no pushing carts . you wo n't get dim sum being pushed through carts . food tastes great ! my family and i ca n't stop coming back for more . their chicken feet is really good ; ) haha . they accept credit card .	4191
1	came for dimsum with a huge group . made reservations . great service . food came out piping hot . portions were bigger than other dimsum places . nice and clean inside .	4191
1	went to this restaurant last month for dim sum and was impressed . so i decided to try its dinner last night with family to celebrate a special event , even though gta was hit with ice storm . i was n't disappointed , the food was good , service was good , washroom was clean . only downside is portion is small , therefore i take away one star . hint , the entrance is actually located at the back of the building , even though the address is on hwy 7 east . but you can take a short cut by walking through the building lobby , if your park your car at the front of the restaurant .	4191
1	i 'm here again ! the half price deal is just too attractive : ) the red bean milk tea is highly recommended . red bean and milk tea are perfectly matched ! ! the milk tea is very rich and smooth . steam scallops with tofu in lotus leaf is yummmm . scallops are big and fresh . the minced garlic gives the scallops a special touch . this dish is a must try ! mango sago has been added with a few slices of mango . nice presentation . deserved one more star for an improvement just over a night ! love this dessert ! ! ****** grand opening on may 14 . 10 % discount ! ! ************	4191
1	first time here with couple friends and i like it . the seating is comfortable and the service is very good as well . the food is also very good especial the congee . there stuff chicken leg is excellent . i will come back ! ! !	4191
1	have been here several times now , mostly over lunch hours , and have never been disappointed . the lunch combos are a good deal and good portioned . i have noticed their lunch combos menu changes periodically . they usually have at least one baked pasta/rice dish and it 's a huge portion for $ 8.99 ! the milk tea is also pretty decent , maybe a bit on smaller side .	4191
1	i like this place as it always has suprises for me . the food is very authentic to south east asia , especially congee /soup . not a lot of hong kong style cafe in richomd hill could make the taste as such . price range is pretty decent .	4191
1	it 's authentic hong kong style food , yet what makes this place unique is its atmosphere . it 's clean and modern looking . even though my friend was not up for hong kong style food , he was impressed nonetheless . the service was good and the dishes served had instant appeal in the way it was presented . i had the brick toast with chicken and cream sauce , which was recommended to me by a friend who had tried my wonderful kitchen . i highly recommend this hong kong dish ! it 's a square piece of toast with the middle dug out and filled with fried rice , chicken and topped with your choice of sauce and melted cheese .	4191
1	peking duck was delicious , thinly sliced , crispy and not too fatty . the grouper fish we ordered was fresh . the steamed lobster was a bit undercooked at first , they re-steamed for a bit longer which is totally fine . almond paste dessert was yummy . not sure if they made it in house . my 2nd time here and i am still impressed . it 's on a pricey side but i think it 's worth it .	4191
1	great clean place for dim sum ! $ 3.20 per dish before 11am on weekdays , and the menu extends after 11 , as it gets pricey then ! there is always a crowd , even on weekdays , and after 11 , so be sure to get there early ! on the menu , they mark their specialty dishes by using purple ink ! notable specials include their mango mochi and their bbq pork bun with a crispy top ! there is free wifi , and the password is on every table , which is a really nice addition on top of their already good service and cleanliness !	4191
1	came here on a saturday night for dinner , place was packed , we were seated promptly.i sat there for a good 10 minutes before someone came over to see if i ordered tea.had to flag down someone to place our order , we ordered the set dinner for 6 , the 4 stars is for the food , we especially enjoyed the curry crab , the place is short staffed , for a higher end restaurant it needs to have better service to match .	4191
1	another dimsum place in the area that has stepped up their insta-worthy game . this place is my family 's go to for early morning dimsum . the early morning special is cheap and the lines are n't as crazy as dragon boat . they have a few unique items on the menu and have been adding a lot of visually appealing dishes . it 's sad that they removed weekend morning specials , but so did every other dimsum in the area so i ca n't blame them .	4191
1	came here for dim sum . the foods came pretty fast and it was ok . it pricey after 11am . but before the price for dim sum is kind a cheap . the foods quality taste is ok it could be better . would probably come back here on a special occasion .	4191
1	not sure why some ratings are so harsh on this place but it 's always packed whenever i go . their food is what you came here for ... hk style food . i liked their lobster though . it 's a big place so wait time is usually not too long .	4191
0	everything is well , good food , good service but they took my favorite dim sum off the menu . the only complaint i have is they tend to seat some customers or friends quietly right away behind the front desk while all others get a number outside to be called . this is more obvious during the early dim sum section before 11am when these `` special vips '' stand close to the tables to avoid attention while you are eating . i 'm not sure if this is an issue with the receptionist or all the staff . this makes waiting outside for a minimum of an hour absolutely meaningless and unfair . i hope the management will rectify it .	4191
0	note : this place has new management now ! ! just had an unhappy experience tonight : waiter delivered the wrong fish dish to our table ( there was a fish dish in the combo that we ordered ) and we had a bite . waiter came by , did n't take it back , and then at check out , an extra $ 20 was added to the bill for the fish that i did n't order ... we were not informed that it was $ 20 at all and did n't agree to it ! food portion was small for an $ 82 combo ... would not recommend .	4191
0	passed by many times and this is the first time to try . the dim sum is really average . the wrap for shrimp dumpling is too thick . taro dumpling is only warm inside . not impressive at all . the dining room itself is clean but very horrible in the washroom . full of toilet paper on the floor and wet . an old lady behind me could not tolerant the smell and has to leave ! it is totally not acceptable ! the price is very similar to other chinese restaurants in richmond hill . however , in terms of dim sum quality and washroom standard , i do n't think i will go back .	4191
0	this place was quite disappointing . service was bad and the food was overpriced , not to mention the quality was just meh . their brick toasts are nothing but a gimmick and are basically bread soaked in oily sauce .	4191
0	went there today when they just started the business . there was n't a lot of people and the manager was making sexual comments to a female staff , telling her what would be a good looking woman and how all men loves girls with something on the chest , told her to her to check the history book to see how true it is . the food is average but i would not go there anymore .	4191
0	ordered bbq takeout from the place . they no longer have it outside by the cashier , so it was prepared ( cut ) inside . my pound of bbq pork turned out more like half a pound when i opened it at home and my marinated duck had the roasted duck plum sauce included instead : (	4191
0	i just notice this place last night so i gave it a try . i ordered combo for two which included 1 ) fried egg with shrimp & noodle fish [ 白飯魚蝦仁炒疍 ] and 2 ) chicken with pumpkin in coconut sauce [ 椰汁南瓜雞 ] $ 24.99 the restaurant is very nice , and lot of space between tables ( which is uncommon for a chinese restaurant ) i like the fried egg but not the chicken . the sauce for the chicken is good , but there are hardly any meat there , mostly bone . this place is ok , but i probably wo n't go back as i do n't get the value for my food for the $ i paid .	4191
0	poor customer service ! long story short , the server got our order mixed up and the manager refused to change the bill . the difference was only $ 4 but the manager made it sounded like we are scaming them . will never go back again !	4191
0	i think they 're no longer under the same management as before . now you can expect lousy service and so so food . i am done with it . avoid .	4191
0	food is n't that good . service is terrible and prices are high for the food quality . the restaurant is huge , so you better pray you get seated somewhere the waitresses can see you or you 're never going to get your order in . the parking lot for this place is also a nightmare on the weekends .	4191
0	this is my second time here . suddenly i 'm very disappointed that this restaurant do not accept credit card ! ! !	4191
0	entrance to the restaurant was confusing . the service was poor and slow some servers lacking in communication since they only speak mandarin . the portions were small for stir fried noodles and was also small for the plate of vegetables . after going through a few dishes we ordered and finished eating , we were missing fried rice and seafood congee . the fried rice did n't come out until 15 mins after and the seafood congee never made it out at all so we cancelled . overall , not a good first time experience and food was mediocre .	4191
0	came in at 10:15pm , asked if it was too late to grab dessert . they said it was fine . the ice cream tower is just cheap no name neapolitan ice cream from a big tub and it was also freezer burnt . the wafer crisps in between were very stale and cheap tasting . around 10:30 , two servers were standing around our table after the last table just left and were wearing their winter jackets just waiting for us to leave . i know the service is rough in establishments such as this , but come on , do n't tell me it 's fine to come in and rush me out 15min after .	4191
0	worst place ever , the food in the picture did n't transform into anywhere alike in reality . the taste was off , and the appearance was okay , nothing special . the service was hard to get .	4191
0	pros : - nicely decorated . - lots of variety . - decently priced . - 10 % discount if you pay by cash . - fast service . cons : - it took an hour for us to get seated . they should really work on accommodations ... - the layout of the restaurant was a bit odd . there were booths along the hallway towards the actual restaurant . - we were ( unfortunately ) seated in one of those booths . since it was so cold when we came in , our food did n't stay hot for long and we were constantly cold . - the food itself was just average . not amazing , not terrible either . just unremarkable .	4191
0	do n't bother ! consider the location is richmond hill and there are tons of other choices for decent chinese food . prices here are relatively cheap , so-so food . location is quite good ( big and spacious , wait but only 1 person working on the floor , rest hiding somewhere ) we got a grumpy waitress- told us off for taking more than 1 menu ( there were 3 of us ) . not a good start . then the food never came ... had to follow up ... and when i asked if they had forgotten the order , she was very upset with us . yeah , seriously ...	4191
0	nothing gives me more grief than billing dispute , as it is usually a sign of dishonesty . unfortunately i experienced it during today 's visit to this restaurant . they have dim sum special of $ 2.99 per dish before 11am . the waitress forgot to enter 1 dish on initial order . after our food arrived , we realized one was missing and asked the staff to re-order it . but because the re-order took place after 11am , they treated it as a full price dish at $ 5.20 . in short , they charge their customer more even though it was their own fault and shortcoming that made it happen in the first place	4191
0	we went to this restaurant a couple of times after they change their chinese name to 'michelin ' . the first couple of time was good . however , this last time was very disappointing . our order was cold and it took a long time to come . worst of all , i found a cockroach under my shrimp dumpling . a total turn off . they apologized but only 10 % off was offered . this is supposed to be a high class restaurant . i will not go here ever again .	4191
0	i came quite a while ago , but never wrote a review . oops . the decor here is quite confused . it 's a sit down bubble tea esque place with semi circle booth tables which opens up into a more traditional chinese dining room with all the round tables . it 's also quite cramped . i ca n't remember much of what we ate , but i can remember that it was all pretty standard . i do remember it not being standard in price though . quite pricey for portions . i think i got some sort of durian dessert and it was quite lacking in durian . i think it was a sesame ball that was very very very thick .	4191
0	food is ok but waited over an hour with a reservation . seemed like they were only letting people through who complained .	4191
1	cool place . fish was amazing , i had all three ways and blackened is my favorite for sure . good luck getting in on weekends without reservations . i went on a friday at 2ish and it was already starting to get busy .	4192
1	i love zen 's . the food is always fresh and tasty . the staff is warm and professional . we go there often . if you do n't like to have breakfast you can get anything on the menu at anytime of the day . the owner is very personable .	4192
1	excellent wings -- -- especially at `` happy hour '' prices . also , coldest bottles of bud in the west valley .	4192
1	so i went to zen 's cafe for the friday fish fry , i have to say that i was very pleased with the meal.. not only is it all you can eat but you can get a different style on re-orders.. the service was good considering when i went in it was packed , we were seated promptly and did n't have to wait very long to get our food.. i will go back and try other menu items..	4192
1	i love this place . great breakfast deals and their fish sammich is killer . do yourself a favor and try their fish fry . they have no cover ufc fights and trivia teusdays . i come here all the time and i will keep coming back . sometimes the service can be a little slow but for the most part i ca n't complain .	4192
1	went to zen 's for the first time tonight for dinner and we were impressed . it 's a sit down restaurant , has a varied menu and the prices were right in line . they have a special every day and tonight it was - all you can eat fishfry with 2 sides for $ 9.99 . the fish was excellent . others had a turkey reuben sandwich and a turkey & soup combo , all were very good . we needed reservations as the place was packed when we got there . the wait staff were fast & efficient . we will go back here & would highly recommend it to you !	4192
1	the name might mislead you ... with a name like zen , you think asian , meditation ... not a sports bar . food is very good and reasonably priced . a 12oz prime rib dinner for about $ 13.00 . the crowd is a mix of younger bar , and older restaurant folks . if you 're sensitive to cigarette smoke , you 'll probably want to sit outside . very friendly staff .	4192
0	well ... another loser restaurant on the west side . this is absolutely the poorest excuse for a restaurant . slow , unprofessional service . greasy , soggy fried appetizers . dirty , dingy atmostphere . over priced . who uses canned green beans in a restaurant ? we will not return ever ... ... ... ..	4192
0	food usually over cooked and not great . went for trivia which was fun , but stopped going due to the unimpressive menu and service .	4192
0	dirty , i 'm afraid to say . they got a dirty dining report on the news too . i heard the food was good and it was the place to go . i do n't listen to those people any more . we walk in and you could see the place was dirty . food was n't that great either . like a denny 's . we had breakfast . wo n't be going back .	4192
0	the food is bland and service is suspect ( slow ) ... clientele is senior citizens which i personally do n't mind ... food is a little expensive given the mediocrity of taste . i have been there twice now , and was underwhelmed both times . probably wont go back , but if your 55+ you should check it out as you might see some of your buddies ... .	4192
0	the worst restaurant ! we were there for a friday night fish fry and waited 40 minutes until we had to ask our waitress where our food was . that was also after a party of 4 who arrived about 15 minutes after us , received their food . we ended up leaving and told the bus girl/hostess/waitress and she couldve cared less . will never go there again . if they keep the same waitstaff ... the restaurant will not last .	4192
0	we went today for a burger the place was empty except for bar patrons ! waitress said burgers were good ! she recommended chips for my husband i had fries , the fries were typical frozen crinkle cut which i do n't care for ! the chips were made in house with little to no seasoning in other words bland ! the burger was just ordinary with no seasoning ! not particularly impressed ! may try another time and try something else but never to have the burger ! ! !	4192
0	i have gone to this place a few times with the family . after today , i will not be going back . the food has also been just above average , but today it was just not right . the waitress was horrible and everything was just filthy . the ironic part is the place was empty . she was taking our plates before we were even finished . it also took forever just to try and get refills in our drinks too . i now know why this place is always empty and i will not be going back there again .	4192
1	wonderful customer service and work ! ! very honest - they will make sure you understand everything before any work is done . i love the `` upfront '' honesty . thank you - i will be back ! adam has great customer service skills ... .i 'm a very happy customer !	4193
1	need a repair shop that 's honest ? that has mechanics that really know what they 're doing ? you 've found it ! great work , fair prices , excellent mechanics . i would recommend this shop to everyone . in fact , i 'll start here !	4193
1	i have had my car and truck into ssc auto in the last two months and once again i can not say enough good things about this auto repair shop . from a simple oil change to a major repair they are truly the best . they are fair and honest . they do n't up sell or overcharge . the first auto repair place that i did n't feel like i was getting ripped off or some crappy service . the manager adam is so great to deal with and always helpful . you will not be disappointed	4193
1	you can truly trust these guys . they 're honest and they always deliver on their word . adam is very helpful and explains repairs so that you know exactly what your options are . i 've sent friends to him who were getting screwed by other mechanics and he took care of them at less than half the price . i highly recommend ssc auto repair .	4193
0	i needed help with my car , the repair would have taken 5 minuets and i was willing to pay $ 100 , but they just could n't get to it til tomorrow . i would understand if they were closing in say 15 min , thanks for nothing .	4193
0	i would never bring my car here again . they treat you like crap . i brought my 2004 camry in here to get a sway bar link tightened , then they tell me i need all of this stuff . i told them to tighten it and get my car off the lift . my car needed none of the things they said it did ... worst place in chandler .	4193
0	very dishonest ! i 'm so glad i got a second opinion ! ! they told me my front brakes and rotors were absolutely shot and that i probably needed a new transmission . not true at all ! my front brakes and rotors do n't need to be replaced at all and there is nothing wrong with my transmission . they also told me one price on paper and a completely different price over the phone . very dishonest . i will never use them again ! ! !	4193
0	if you can make it past the initial phone call and how big of an ass the guy is on the phone , you might get something accomplished . we know exactly what is needed with the vehicle and we were calling for a 2nd opinion and quote . he would n't do anything or quote anything without us paying $ 50 . not even a quote ! ! ! lots of good auto shops around . these guys do n't know how to earn the business .	4193
1	little piece of heaven , the best ice cream shop near champaign urbana . decent prices , superb taste ; what else do you need on a hot summer day ! this place is cash only , and sometimes you can smell cow dung . other than that , this place serves far better ice cream than neighboring ice cream parlors ( like jarlings ) of champaign-urbana .	4194
1	great little ice cream stand in sidney . delicious and inexpensive and excellent service from friendly staff ! i highly recommend a stop and you too will be hooked !	4194
0	ice cream is good but the service could be improved . i rarely get what i actually order . a peanut butter cup tornado with chocolate ice cream is n't that hard to understand or make . they just lack attention to detail . first they made me a m & m tornado with chocolate ice cream and when i told them it was supposed to be peanut butter cup , i got a peanut butter cup with vanilla ice cream . this did n't happen just once either . my order is wrong more times than it is right ! i 'll just start telling them to surprise me since i always am when i go here .	4194
0	the soft-serve is way too sweet and has a strange splenda-like aftertaste . the flavors tasted very artificial , and i ended up with a stomach ache when i got home ... i really do n't recommend this place , your simple baskin robbins is much better .	4194
1	really good quality cakes and pastries not high in sugar and they use good quality chocolate , but the store closes very early everyday .	4195
1	as i write this , visions of sicilian cannoli dance in my eyes . it 's the perfect treat , whether enjoyed solo or with a warm beverage . but i also need to wax poetic about the masterpiece that is their toasted almond apple tart , which i purchased for a dinner party at the ridiculously reasonable price of $ 18.99 . a thing of beauty to begin with . moreover , just . so . good . warmed up with some vanilla ice cream on the side . cant wait to return to try some of their other delectable offerings .	4195
1	your one stop shop ! has everything from a deli counter to cheeses , hot table , mini bakery and general italian groceries . the ice-cream in the summer is to die for ( i recommend the raspberry . ) the rice ball are a favourite as well as the iris . the interior is spectacular . highly recommended .	4195
1	the service has improved over the years ... i used to come to this place and be completely ignored by staff ( at times i even thought it was because i was not caucasian ) but the cannolis kept me coming back . now fast forward a few years the place has renovated and the service staff has changed . this place is amazing , the cakes are very good prices are high but you get what you pay for and it is worth it to treat yourself once in a while .	4195
1	amazing little bakery/hot table shop . their sweets have always been amazing and their food is delicious and sweet . on this visit , we rendered an eclair , which my better half ( a baker ) , said was one of the best , if not the best she 's ever had . we also ordered a box of cookies which our family loved . have n't tried their hot table yet but will do in the near future .	4195
1	hands down this bakery makes the best cannolis and i 've tried many . the shell is the best - fresh & crispy ! the come in small & large and if they 're sold out they will make you fresh ones . i would recommend this bakery to anyone !	4195
1	renovated in the last few years . fantastic arancini ( rice balls ) .. best in the city . . like home . they keep it traditional italian . . which being italian i love	4195
1	my friends and i had a decaff cappuccino which were very good ! our server was so nice and helpful . we had a lovely break and we our coffee and sweets ... ... today , it 's very disappointing ! the cappuccino tasted awful ; but i needed my caffeine and tolerated it . the worst part was the nutella stuffed donut . though it looked good , i think they were serving a few days old donut -- it was inedible ! the sugar donut was not much better-not at all fresh or tasty . i 'm dreading the taste of the other pastries i bought for my family . for the price ... i 'm not returning !	4195
0	went by for lunch had lasagna ( cold and small ) had to ask for sauce did n't bother with cheese too much of a hassle for person serving me . veal sangwich ( tasteless ) no sauce very dry one piece of veal . very expensive $ 18 with a coke wo n't be going back . lamanna 's excellent hot food and you get a lot more for less .	4195
0	they have great gelato ! the desserts are alright , but i was very disappointed when i purchased a red velvet cupcake , only to find out that it had a moulded strawberry on the top . i was very disappointed at the fact that they have n't disposed of it earlier , but even more disappointed that they saw it , and gave it to me .	4195
0	first time trying this place out , and i definitely wo n't be returning . staff were rude , miserable , cranky and seemed to be so bothered . they definitely lacked customer service skills . i even got huffed and puffed at , and had eyes rolled at me !	4195
0	i got there almost at 6:30 pm , , they gon na be close at7:00 , but they were so unpainted and i did n't even had time to visit view all the cakes there , finally i ordered 2 pieces of cakes , but when i paid for it , they only packed one of them and forgot the other one , so	4195
0	so disappointing ! no customer care ! went to get some treat for my staff and i 've get my attention to a `` panettone pudding cake '' very similar to a pastiera ( easter pie ) so i asked more about this panettone cake asking who created and if is italian . the answer was `` it does n't matter '' it 's really good.. well i was intrigued to buy and i asked to taste first . the answer ? we sampled already this morning ! i only left the place . i was shocked and speechless . as italian ashamed . dot	4195
0	i called their number to ask what time they closed on a saturday ... .after maybe 5-6 rings it went to voice mail which said `` all our servers are busy and can not take your call '' ... ... how 's that for an attitude ? i hung up the phone and visited this site for store hours and guess what ! it 's not here either . they not only lost a customer but over the next few months quite a few because news travel fast in scarborough !	4195
0	recently the owner has decided they are too busy to bake their own baguettes . once a staple upon which this bakery built its reputation , it is now outsourced and of far lesser quality . a shame , that the bakery believes its success can be sustained by reducing the quality of their product on account of being too busy . they 're pastries and catering must really be taking off ... that or the profit margins are greater and they do n't mind losing a few loyal bread buying customers . i am now reluctantly looking for a new bakery in the area : - (	4195
0	i was too lazy to go to agincourt bakery . so i stopped by francesa bakery to pick up some meatballs to go with my spaghetti for dinner . i got there went in the line and waited . the lady with glasses served people who were just walking through the door instead of serving us in the line . i noticed flies in the display/food case . i bought the meat balls that looked like flattened meatballs . the taste was n't as good as most other places and too many gristle pieces . i will not be returning .	4195
1	i love hookah bookah ! the atmosphere is very calm and relaxed . it 's a fun place to go on any night and just chill with friends . lights are dimmed , there is two couches or a bunch of mini circular tables with chairs to suit either 1 , 2 , or 4 people at a table . it can get pretty crowded , but there 's always people leaving once you come , i 've never had to wait for a table . the staff is very friendly and they will just walk around with new coal to put on your hookah . you can sit for a few hours smoking good hookah with good friends .	4196
1	love this place , i know a lot of people rate it low because its not like other lounges in `` big '' cities , but for the location and price , its a really good place to hang out with friends . me and 3 friends come here and chill for hours for just 17 $ , cant really beat that . staff is really friendly and they have a nice selection of flavors .	4196
1	the best hookah in pittsburgh ... .. they are so friendly and the atmosphere over their amazing ... ...	4196
1	great place to sit , relax and smoke . owners are very nice and friendly . decor is great , and all the furniture is very contemporary , from ikea : ) there 's games like dominoes , and chess that you can play while smoking or if you prefer , just watch lebanese songs on the tv .	4196
1	premier hookah lounge . friendly staff . best shisha in pittsburgh . nawa will see to your every need .	4196
0	came here after being spoiled by hookah lounges - def not a classy joint . it really caters to the underage college kid . i actually wish there was something like this for us in college , but now..def not my scene . i think we were the oldest people there . i dont see myself going back ever . i 'll wait for pittsburgh to come up with a nicer hookah place .	4196
0	great hookah . great staff . but they started bringing this stupid dj on the weekends like it 's a club instead of a relaxing lounge . i do n't even come anymore because of that .	4196
0	you go to smoke hookah and you look for a relaxing time - this just was n't . it feels like a coffee shop that happens to have hookahs , filled with college freshmen who are *loud* .	4196
0	this is my third time here , and unfortunately i have to give it a bad review . the guy who served us was rude and unprofessional , i do n't know his name but he had a septum ring . we waited for out coals for a good 35 minutes and the place was unbearably hot . i only give it two stars because it was great the first two times we came . we saw people that already had coals get replacements before we even got ours . overall disappointing , probably wo n't be returning .	4196
0	this place was super boring .. i would n't go back ... u ca n't smoke weed lol but super boring here	4196
1	this is one of the best places for quick bite in the area . phill 's has a pretty big menu and a friendly staff .	4197
1	one of the best burger i 've had in a while . met the owner while i was there and he seemed to really take pride in his food . he even offered everyone in line free fries and gravy . the gravy tasted great and the fries were reminiscent of a classic chip truck . fat phill 's is a must try if you 're in the yonge and davisville area .	4197
0	what a disaster . twenty minutes to get an order of onion rings the owner is so drunk he can barely stand up and keeps forgetting everyone 's order . it 's 11:30 in the morning , by the way . two customers have demanded refunds and sent back their food in the short time i 've been here . gravy is good though .	4197
0	marlee ave fat phil 's is the worst for it 's food , serves and cleanliness charges more money them the other locations , burgers are horrible and dry and will charge u $ 0.50 extra for tomatoes and a few times the lady putting the food together would put it in her pocket , there was garbage all over the tables and none of the staff had hats or hair nets on ... . disgusting place on marlee ave , toronto	4197
1	friendly staff . clean store . great products you have come to expect . can be a little slower than normal when busy . easy to get stuck in the drive through and not be able to get out if it 's taking too long . have been late to work more than once because of this . but all in all a good location .	4198
1	very nice staff . relaxed atmosphere . nice addition to the south mountain area . speedy service .	4198
1	this place is amazing . i always get phenomenal service , i do n't know what all the negative reviews are about . i 've been coming to this location for about 2 years now and i have never had a bad experience . do not listen to the bad reviews this place is really underestimated .	4198
1	i am an avid starbucks drinker and i 've got to say , this is my favorite location ! ! the baristas are always friendly and are fairly fast . this location does get busy at times but they get the drinks out as quickly as possible : )	4198
1	this starbucks has some of the friendliest people of any starbucks i 've ever been to . they are incredibly nice and they always make my drink perfectly . love it !	4198
1	service was polite and efficient , ambiance was sleepy and calm ( not bad things ) .. nothing to complain about here .	4198
1	this is one my favorite starbucks to come to ! the people here are so welcoming and friendly , eddie is the person to go to if you 're looking for great cup of coffee ( :	4198
1	i love this starbucks because it 's close to my casa & they have great service . i can get in & out or hang . yeah it 's starbucks not local but nothing is close to me .	4198
1	very friendly baristas ! speedy service , always eager to please and convenience their customer ! worth the trip to this store ! they even had the pumpkin spice latte which made my day !	4198
1	got ta like the buck , triple venti soy carmel macchito is the drink of choice . though the price is $ 6.66 ; telling ? ? ?	4198
1	if you have time to wait in drive thru line in the mornings , go for it . i have not had a bad experiences with customer service or orders : a win-win . this location is located in a little strip with wi-fi available , merchandise on shelves and floor and plenty of seating . inside note : phoenix pd frequents place in mornings , go figure : - )	4198
1	i love this location , it as a drive through.. which is awesome . the staff is super friendly . this location is super busy and even with being busy not once have they mess up an order . this is a great location .	4198
1	been here many times . thought i 'd write . the location is n't really near any other starbucks , so it 's usually really full . unfortunately they are usually slow as well . today , we arrived at 12:30 pm on a saturday and there were 6-7 cars in line , usually about a 30 minute wait , so we headed inside . there were 8 eating and drinking and only one in line . the person in front of us ordered three drinks , so i groaned to myself . to my surprise , our two drinks were called within four minutes . thank you for fixing that starbucks !	4198
0	i go to starbucks almost every day this is second time i have encountered rude staff and i will definitely never come back at this location . someone should probably look into this ...	4198
0	i try to avoid this starbucks , but it 's the only one on the way to my moms . not only are wait lines insane ... your wait time is even long when you 're the only one in there ! ! ! every time i order they mess up the order ... today ... they got the wrong drink ... then the wrong food ... not even an apology . it 's time to visit your local coffee shop ... looks like starbucks could care less about customer service ... # toobigtocare	4198
0	this is the closest starbucks to my work and unfortunately , the slowest starbucks i 've been too . they are consistently out of bagels and very slow . i hope they can do some training to help the team .	4198
0	this location constantly gets my order incorrect . i asked for my grande iced coffee to be in a venti cup with extra ice . what i got was a side cup of ice . and a half filled cup of coffee . if im paying for grande cup of coffee why would you fill it half way ? i didnt pay for half a cup of coffee . would n't recommend this location	4198
0	wrong order ... again ! tried to go up to get it fixed and was met with a rude response . just ended up leaving without it and wo n't be returning . very diappointed .	4198
0	ordered an iced tea . stood by the counter for 10 minutes while other people were served that ordered after me . i was never acknowledged by any of the staff , and there were at least six of them working . i left , they have my money but i will never be back . what a joke .	4198
0	wo n't be back here . was told in the drive thru they were out of blueberry scones . then told they found one . when i got to work i discovered i received a half eaten scone . disgusting and what a joke . of this is the best this store can do i wo n't be back . so sad starbucks has fallen to such a low level . maybe their focus should be on food and service and leas on politics .	4198
0	so they must grow the beans when you order them . waited in drive thru line for 30+ mins . also , no option to leave the line so once you decide you are committed . at least give me he chance to leave .	4198
0	20 min wait for cold brew coffee just to be told they 're out ? then they butcher my iced coffee and use whole milk not coconut milk . should have taken my 2 dollar tip back . words ca n't describe how unsatisfied i am	4198
0	trapped in drive thru line not moving at all ! curb traps you in ... thinking of not even ordering when i finally get a chance . poor service does n't deserve my money ! seriously . hubby is having a nice nap !	4198
0	worst service ever . they 'll mess up your order and then tell you it 's your fault and then call you a liar . drive thru takes forever as well as going inside .	4198
0	i 'm here now , i got my drink but there are 9 people waiting and they 're obviously not happy ! i 'd hate to be them . the team needs leadership ! i do n't hear them talking to each other ... . is communication their issue ? i would re-evaluate what they 're doing here .	4198
0	i used to live on this side of town and would stop in this starbucks because it was conveniently located near my house . the staff were always very friendly and personable , but i must agree with the other yelpers when they comment on the slowness of the store . they are terribly slow for some reason , inside and drive-thru . i would n't recommend stopping at this one before work , or anywhere you need to be on time for that matter . it 's more a `` weekend , i-have-nothing-better-to-do '' kind of starbucks , with no sense of real urgency .	4198
1	we got the healthy pizza with whole grain crust and the buffalo chicken wings . everything was delicious ! ! great `` healthy '' option for take-out , which we 've been looking for for a long time . my only complaint is that we ordered boneless wings but they still sent bone-in , no big deal though .	4199
1	pepperoni and tomato pizza on whole wheat crust was excellent ! i didnt have to wait long either . i will be back to try something else . i hope u will be opening more stores soon !	4199
1	the tuscan chicken pizza is amazing ! we ordered for lunch at work , i brought the leftovers home . i have not heard my husband so impressed in a long time . unfortunately i will no longer be working in the city . i hope one opens east of the city !	4199
1	order delivery to our hotel during our stay in pittsburgh ... . the fries were good but it was n't buffalo fries with cheese and bacon ... . it was cheese fries with ham. , was n't what we ordered but was good tasting . the cheesteak ordered was good , the hot buffalo wings were flavored nicely , pizza boat was very good and the crab rangoon was good just like chinese place makes them . but pasta with olive oil and garlic was bland not much flavored but overall the food was pretty good for just winging it after a long day to get rest and being hungry	4199
1	i order delivery from this place on the reg , and they 're always on-time or early ; i 've never had an instance where they 've been late . they seem to be open all day , every day , and even until 3am on saturday , which is unusual for a place that i actually enjoy their food . they have the best gluten-free pizzas i 've ever had ! they also have a huge selection of everything that you could possibly imagine , and i 've never been disappointed with anything that i 've ordered from this place . highly recommended .	4199
1	i ordered a buffalo chicken salad and the fried zucchini and both were great ! the chicken salad was really spicy ( i like hot ! ) and it had really good flavor . the zucchini was really good but the dipping sauce was ketchup which i thought was weird instead of marinara ... but i did n't need a dipping sauce they were good anyways ! i ordered around 6 and scheduled for an 8 o clock delivery and they were right on time ! delivery man was super friendly too . will definitely order again !	4199
0	do not eat the gf crust if you have celiac ! ! ! it 's definitely not gf . i usually can deal with a little bit of unavoidable contamination but by my reaction their crust does actually contain gluten . be careful . it 's also very pricey given the quality of the actual pizza . definitely a big no-no .	4199
0	horrible pizza . we got the margarita pizza we could n't even eat it and that has never happened before . the sauce is way too sweet and under seasoned . we each ate a piece threw our $ 19 pizza in the garbage .	4199
0	the pizza was okay ... it reminded me of like a slightly better little caesars . hey it was cheap why am i really complaining . well ... . i dined at noon on a weekday in the summer . the building was empty- no biggie- except i was stared at almost the entire time i was eating . the most awkward note to eat ever . service here is terrible , paired with the `` ehh '' food i do not recommend ! sign on the front said grand opening so maybe new owners because the previous results were so great !	4199
0	massive disappointment . tiny and not satisfying especially for the 15.99 price for a `` medium . '' which was tiny . dry crust , chewy cheese , skimpy toppings . i was n't greeted for several minutes . just about walked out . just do n't go , there are much better options in town .	4199
0	i ordered via grubhub this evening : 1 tiramisu and i received cheesecake- no fruit topping and not note why they sent cheesecake 1 traditional white crust pizza [ 10 '' small pizza , tomato sauce , [ fresh mozzarella cheese , mushrooms , baby spinach ] ] and i received a dry bland pizza crust with mushroom , spinach and melted cheese- no tomato sauce , is this really pizza ? 1 broccoli puffs- these were a bit tough & chewey , but the filling was good . needless to day if you ca n't get 2 of the 3 menu items correct there is an issue .	4199
0	did n't even order from this place . all i know is they 're open late night and they offer duquesne university specials which is awesome ; but every time i call this place the people are extremely rude . the customer service is awful . i can not express in words how bad it is . the first time i called the guy rushed me off the phone , and the second time i called after i finished ordering the guy hung up on me ! beware !	4199
1	asia tea house is fast and simple . you order and then give you your food within ten minutes . it 's ideally located and the food is delicious . the best part is that it 's cheap ! i had a combo with chicken and green beans , white rice and steamed vegetables for $ 6 . there was enough food for two meals ( which is great if you 're a college student ) . i highly recommend this restaurant .	4200
1	i was walking around the park and chose to stop at asia tea house . they looked like they had a really great menu . there were a lot of people that had food from their restaurant . i was only looking for a snack , so i got a chicken egg roll and an iced green tea ( i think the green tea was a special for the day ) . the egg roll was the perfect snack i needed . the tea was mellow and refreshing . the staff i interacted with was super friendly . and service was very quick . next time i am in schenley park i will get a real meal here !	4200
1	this is the best bubble tea in pittsburgh . i usually get the matcha . the reason this bubble tea is the best is the authentic tea- unsweetened , and frothy and the tapioca bubbles are separate , not squished together like some bubble tea places . i live outside the city , but stop here whenever i am in oakland .	4200
1	tasty , healthy , and fresh food at inexpensive price ! food is not salty as most chinese food in us i had , actually the flavor is close to my back home ! highly recommand it !	4200
1	decent quick chinese food in between classes . price is cheap , have n't had a bad meal yet .	4200
1	very friendly and quick service ! always fresh food ! plus close to the library . been going here for years !	4200
1	good bubble tea . i got the mango bubble tea . it was definitely unique since it used mango juice rather than just mango green tea . i liked it a lot . a lot of funky juice bubble teas are sold there although if you 're expecting a traditional one , do n't go here .	4200
1	my favorite place in oakland to get chinese food takeout . i love their teriyaki chicken with fried rice ! the chicken is cooked well and covered in their sweet teriyaki sauce . there is also a lot of rice . the steamed broccoli is pretty standard . i drizzle some sriracha on it and then take it to the library across the street . this meal will for sure keep you full for a while . i also have had their spicy bourbon chicken and lo mein which is pretty good too . reminds me of classic chinese food in the mall .	4200
1	asia tea house is super conveniently located- i 'd come here all the time , even if the food was n't good . the spring rolls and vegetarian tofu is always top notch . the veggies are cooked well and the portions are huge . i love trying all the different bubble teas here . the only word of caution i have is that the general tso 's tofu here just flat out is n't general tso 's . it 's honestly just watery nonsense , so if you 're going for tofu , get the vegetarian tofu instead .	4200
1	asia tea house definitely has the best location in oakland . right in the heart of schenley plaza you can order and sit in the park . asia tea house is one of the few places in oakland that provides authentic asian food for a good price . the menu is offered is extensive and ranges from sushi to general tso 's . combination meals of meat and two sides seems to be a very popular choice . for an extra dollar , they offer double meat .	4200
1	could n't imagine asking more out of an outdoor food kiosk . good pink rose bubble tea and the bourbon chicken was surprisingly fresh . i 'm used to chinese chicken tasting so overcooked that it becomes a mushy rubber , but this still was recognizable as chicken and was stringy when pulled apart .	4200
0	hit or miss for me . the most popular american chinese foods , like sesame chicken or general tso 's chicken are usually prepped in advanced , so the quality is diminished . these chicken dishes have a ton of breading on them also , and are way too submerged in sauce . i tried the lo mein too , and it was extremely salty on its own , so i was disappointed . the bubble tea is also really watery . however , the service is pretty fast . if you 're really craving american chinese food , and want to enjoy schenley plaza , go for it , but it 's not that special .	4200
0	the shrimp teriyaki here = 70 % hard rice that 's going to cause you indigestion + 15 % sad-looking broccoli + 5 % shrimps with freshness that 's questionable + 10 % sauce that does n't even taste like teriyaki .	4200
0	i had to visit yelp to see if i could have been forewarned how the bubble tea is not good . granted it was my first time here and i only ordered one thing , totally ruined the mood for laying out in the sun , sipping on a cold bubble tea while reading a book . i ordered the pink rose tea - if ur a bubble tea fanatic ( i 'm from la ) definitely not what i was expecting . i ca n't really put into words what is this hot pink neon drink with only eight tapioca balls in it : ( i 'm too disappointed with this one to see if the green tea or taro tea would be any better ...	4200
0	the taro bubble tea had nice flavor but there were chunks of ice in it . i feel like it probably is frozen somewhere ahead of time and not made fresh there which is disappointing .	4200
0	they serve the typical american chinese food here . it 's not bad ; each entree comes with fried or white rice and sides . there is a wait , but it 's not bad . i also ordered a mango bubble tea . unfortunately , it was loaded with sugar and not that good . this is n't the place to get bubble tea ( i prefer rose tea cafe ) . there are tables and chairs nearby , which are great when the weather 's nice .	4200
0	you fail . i ca n't even review your bubble tea bc we never received it ! you said it would take about 5 minutes to get your fake bubble tea to us ( which is to long ) , but what is five minutes . 5 minutes turned to thirty minutes which turned to us telling you to give our money back . cute comment you made that you meant chinese 5 minutes . i will take my money and write this post .	4200
0	the food is just okay , but there are much better options for chinese food . the bubble tea is not vey good , i 've had much better in pittsburgh . the location is great , it 's right in the schenley plaza , so you can eat on the lawn or under the tent . but the food is just filling , nothing very special at all .	4200
0	asia tea house sucks . you 're better off at oishii bento . food is absolutely inedible -- disgusting . i ordered sesame chicken and fried rice . the chicken is dark meat and becomes chewy in your mouth . it 's very unnappetizing and you end up having to spit it out . bubble tea is fine . this place is a waste of money and time . schenley park tourist trap .	4200
0	kind of bland for chinese food.. i will go here if i have to when i am visiting pittsburgh but only if i 'm in a rush !	4200
0	i had the thai tea bubble tea . i never knew bubble tea could be this bad until i tried it here . i usually get from fuku tea and in comparison there was no flavor and it was obvious they did n't use fresh tea/milk , or fresh tapioca . yuck .	4200
0	they have a menu item described as vegetarian in big bold letters on sign ... but i was told all the food is made with oyster sauce . i asked if they could update sign . he said no all chinese food is not vegetarian . what ? lots of places in town ... . and in china make vegan/vegetarian food .	4200
1	awesome customer service , very helpful . nice trucks dependable and clean . comparable price to other rental places with better equipment , i will be back .	4201
1	great customer service and good pricing for commercial vehicle rentals . very pleased !	4201
0	do n't rent from here ! ! ! they charged me for damage i did n't cause and there is no way to dispute them . i returned my rental truck on a sunday when the office was closed , but they have a place to drop the keys . the van was in the exact same condition as i rented it . then on monday they called and told me the truck was damaged and i had to pay for it . i told them the truck was probably damaged when it was in there lot on sunday and they said it 's still my responsibility .	4201
0	please do yourself a favor and never rent from this establishment . they unfairly accused us of causing damage to the van we rented , and we know we never caused the damage . the van was sitting in the lot overnight it could 've happened at any point in time , but now they are filing a claim with our insurance and are continuously charging us . the customer service at this establishment was the worst i 've ever experienced in my life . they were rude and accusatory and would not listen to anything that we had to say . if i had the ability to give zero stars i would ! never rent from enterprise .	4201
1	great homestyle cooking with fantastic pie .	4202
1	friday night all you can eat fish fry ... .ask for it grilled if you prefer ! be sure to leave room for the homemade pies . chicken pot pie is a must try as well !	4202
1	incredibly fresh and tasty pie . great lunch and a friendly staff . real homemade cooking . independently owned and operated . we are moving into the neighborhood and ca n't wait to try the sunday brunch .	4202
1	linda 's wo n't win any awards for the decor , but the food is so very tasty . i visited a few sundays ago for breakfast and had the best biscuits and gravy . my companions were happy with their breakfast choices as well . this is an inexpensive , friendly little place . everything is homemade , and worth a try .	4202
1	best pork tenderloin sandwich this side of the midwest ! man , this lady can cook ! the place is small and quaint but the best places usally are . the food is really good and homestyle but better . i usally get my food to go and will comonly park next to mercedes ' , lexus ' , cop cars and even a ferrari or bentley every now and then . so you know it s a great place . you ca n't get this great port tenderloin sandwich anywhere else and be satisfied unless your back in indiana .	4202
0	in the mood for comfort food ... i was disappointed . the grilled cheese was flimsy , and i could n't eat the soup . i forget why . i thought it was way over-priced for what it was . i wo n't be going back there ever again .	4202
0	came here several times over the last 18 months . it was nice to have a little hole in the wall close by for home cooking . tried and liked many things including their chicken fried steak and liver & onions , as well as their pies . alas , while the food was good , the space was definitely not . ditto on some of their regulars . after the last time we came here , it became painfully obvious that the value has shrunken past the point where we could find the not-so-good things tolerable .	4202
0	mediocre food . mediocre service . sometimes you can , indeed , judge a book by its cover , and this place proves it . i was going to write a long , detailed discussion of everything that sucked about my lunch there today , but i 'll let the fact that this is my first one-star review ( and i 've reviewed some real dives ) speak for itself .	4202
0	so we finally ate here . the decor has not been updated since about 1967 , and we were surrounded by overweight senior citizens reeking of cigarette smoke . the food was reminiscent of middle school cafeteria fare . the waitresses were very friendly , and the prices were not bad . we were obviously not the target demographic , though . wo n't be back . too bad , because we can walk there ...	4202
0	we have tried twice to eat here , and twice it has been closed . yet every time i drive by it , the parking lot is packed . what restaurant does n't serve dinner on saturdays ?	4202
1	absolutely the best italian meal i 've had in a very long time . the antipasto platter was a great share the table first course , the mortadella was melt in your mouth delicious as was the eggplant tapenade . i got the gnocchi with marinara and meatballs , with chianti . finished with lemon gelato would come again in a heartbeat and probably do the blind tasting !	4204
1	nice , quiet and probably the friendliest family i have ever encountered in a family owned place . rolled in looking for a hangover fix ( nothing like lovin from the pizza oven ) , and was n't disappointed . met 4 generations of the family that afternnon , had some fun , and some great food . great pasta , nice sauces and the homemade bread was just to die for . i 'm a sucker for good italian , and i know i will be back !	4204
0	it took more than 20 minutes for anyone to even offer us a beverage . the calamari was really overdone . my husband had a `` specialty '' pizza that had no flavor at all . it was the worst service we have ever experienced at any restaurant .	4204
0	pros : i did n't get sick or anything like that . cons : very small ... .not in an positive intimate kinda way though , rather in a way where you can smell the neighboring tables deodorant choices kinda way . the food was barely ok and very expensive . the chicken was not real chicken but mechanically processed bloop like at mcdonald 's ... .that in itself should be enough to make any foody irate ... i think their bread is fantastic and their pizza most likely echoes that , but otherwise , the food was overpriced and lazy .	4204
1	they took me in as soon as i came in , had a good amount of staff , all very friendly . i got a pedicure from geric who did an amazing job , very nice , very thorough , very neat . definitely recommend	4205
1	i absolutely this nail salon ! ! ! best one i 've been to since i 've moved to charlotte . they do an amazing job . they are super detail oriented ! i 'm super picky about how my nails and toes are done and they never fail to amaze me with their work ! ! !	4205
0	overpriced rush job ! the lady cut me while doing my nails pedicure was well below average ! only 1 person actually knows what they are doing and he is in high demand so rushed as well . i could 've done a better job myself and will start to do the dipped nails myself !	4205
0	i had the worst experience here . we came in to get a manicure and pedicure , and they were extremely rude . i waited 30 minutes to get my feet in the water , and after an hour and freezing feet , no one saw me . they did n't even look at me . i took a towel , dried my feet , and still no one looked at me or said anything to me . i paid for my mother , left a generous tip and left . still there was no apology or expression of care .	4205
1	i like to go to valu-mart when i 'm looking for those items that the other grocery stores do n't have most of the time , like vernors ginger ale . it 's smaller , and much less busy so you do n't have to wait 15 mins . just to get through the checkout line .	4206
1	great little supermarket in the middle of my neighborhood . it has fresh products and the prices are not so bad .	4206
0	fair selection of president 's choice products but generally pricey . $ 6.99/lb for white flesh peaches ? are they gold plated ?	4206
0	this used to be a quality store with true customer service where staff smiled and acknowledged the customer . in the last 4-5 years , the quality of staff has declined noticeably . it is no longer worth paying more because you will be treated well at this store . also , the quality is scary . i have pics of a long hair under the price label of a ready-made salad . tired of the defensive front customer service , `` what , oh , sorry ... '' please , this is against food health and safety by-laws .	4206
1	pizza made in the store and then you take it home to cook ! affordable and lots of toppings ! i like it and they do n't scrimp on the ingredients ! only takes about 15 minutes to cook up and enjoy at home .	4207
1	this is the best location ! they always change their gloves and use a new spatula for my gluten free pizza !	4207
1	i love getting my pizza here and taking it home to cook the way i like it ( not crisp ) . i like watching the pizzas being made . tonight dominique and cheyenne ( please forgive me if i misspelled your names ) made my pizza . they greeted me as i came in . asked which pizza i wanted and made it as if it were for their own family . they didnt slap it together but took time on each pizza they made . excellent example of great costumer service . very clean work area . they really take pride in their jobs ! great job ladies ! you rock !	4207
1	went to this location for the first time . great service , quick and clean food prep , will be back !	4207
0	why is that the aliante store just up and decided to close early on a saturday night ? 10 minutes before the posted time ! you just lost customers over 10 measly minutes . how sad .	4207
0	we ordered a couple of pizzas last night for dinner . the hawaiian pizza was terrible , tasteless . not sure what happened , the sauce tasted horrible , we paid for extra jalepenos that had maybe 10 peppers on a large pizza ? ? they really skimped on the toppings , very little cheese , not enough pineapple and ham . inedible , had to throw out . not worth the money we paid ! !	4207
0	not even a one star ... . i ordered a pizza i get it unbaked ... for a first timer it will be my last ... i hate u papa murphy 's ... what kind of service is this ... u should leave a note on ur site to tell people like me who order food cause i do n't want to cook that i need to cook it ... . u guys r just the worst	4207
0	maybe this is the east coast pizza snob in me , but i 'm not understanding the concept of being handed an uncooked pizza . we did n't feel like cooking tonight , and woke up from a nap really hungry.. so we figured let 's run out for take out . i ordered a pizza , was handed it in 30 seconds ... raw . i had to take it home and cook it . makes no sense . i 'm told this is a really big chain on the west , and `` consistently voted # 1 pizza chain in the country '' , so maybe it 's just me talking.. but umm.. there 's no place like ny	4207
1	fresher noodles you may not find in this town , i tried the steamed vegetable dumplings and the chicken noodle soup - loved it ! but careful the portions are big but the staff box it nicely and it still that 's great next day : ) also the mango bubble tea was tasty .	4208
1	everday noodles is a godsend . the food is fantastic and unlike anything i 've ever had before . i had the sesame cold noodles for my entree , which were refreshing on a summer day and were delicious . all of the buns were bizarre but flavorful from the pork belly ones to the two kinds we had for dessert ( the 'crispy creamy ' and the 'sweet egg yolk ' ) . the server we had was cool and so were the interiors . oh , i forgot to mention the soup dumplings . i 'd never had them before , and i 'm in love . ours were filled with pork and crab . awesome . go .	4208
1	good but i wish they had more vegetarian options . what is there is great , just wish there were more choices . also pretty expensive considering the type of place it is and the nature of the food . but glad they 're around .	4208
1	i love this place . i 'm a chinese-american , and it feels so authentic and homey whenever i go . i 've gotten multiple noodle dishes , and they 're all great . of course , the soup dumplings are a must ! i think you could order anything from this menu and it 'd be top quality .	4208
1	modern , clean facilities with a great view of chefs creating hand made noodles and dumplings . we ordered various potstickers and steamed dumplings , all of which were excellent and delicious . staff was kind and attentive . we will likely be back , and with friends .	4208
1	the dumplings are to die for ! i 've gone twice now and the food has been fantastic each time . the restaurant itself is a small , cute space . that being said , you 're always within a food of another table . private conversations are probably not best had here . my only complaint was the last time i went , every 30 seconds a chef making dough would slam it onto the counter . it sounded like a gun shot . it made the meal really unappetizing when you 're jumping every 30 seconds .	4208
1	the shanghai dumplings at everyday noodles rival those in la , sf and shanghai itself . pittsburgh is lucky to have it . you know the noodles are fresh because they 're literally making them all day in front of the kitchen . my asian friends all love this place and return often .	4208
1	i found about this restaurant from the internet a couple of days ago and decided to give it a shot for all the reviews were good . not so surprisingly , all my family found the dishes we ordered very tasty and well served . the staff met our needs and were kind . we especially liked the oxtail noodle soup and would love to go again !	4208
1	came here on vacation with family , this place has lovely seating , very unique . you can watch the chefs making your noodles ! i have n't had beef brisket noodle since i was a kid and it 's one of my favorite meals , was lucky they serve them here . we also had the bubble tea with pudding crab and regular dumplings and some pancakes rolls . hand made noodles taste the best~ will come back again for more gourmet soon~	4208
1	wonderful ! nothing like the usual americanized chinese restaurants . soups are incredible and vegetables are fresh . i will definitely return !	4208
1	arrived at 2pm on a sunday afternoon and were seated right away at the only empty table . food arrived very quickly ! we got the pork soup dumplings , pork belly slider , and thin noodles with minced pork sauce . dumplings were as good as any i 've had in nyc . the gua bao was huge , but that was the only thing impressive about it . noodles were freshly made and tasted great ! i 'd want to try the wider noodle next time . we also got a green milk tea , which was much creamier ( and tastier ) than across the street . would definitely come by if we 're in the area again !	4208
1	upon several recommendations i gave this place a try , and it is ( almost ) as good as everyone says it is . i ordered soup and a fried tofu appetizer , and was very impressed with the soup , but not so much with the app . a bit bland . but overall i was pleased and definitely would return . also , watching the noodles being made added to the experience , and is something i have n't seen elsewhere .	4208
1	just got back from taiwan and went to din tai fung ( where soup dumplings began and alleged best dumplings in the world ) . din tai fung is delicious , everyday noodles is extremely close ! i love them ! !	4208
1	i love this place . i eat there once a month at least . they 're always nice , efficient and the food is so good !	4208
1	a favorite go too especially for their noodle soups and especially got the soup dumplings . fun to watch them making the noodles . i 've never anything less than fresh , tasty food . often , i do take out- always arrives well packaged and hot	4208
1	this is such a fun eating experience . i love to take friends here so they can enjoy watching the chefs make noodles behind the window ; it truly is fascinating ! and the food is wonderful too ! the food is so fresh and the timing is fast !	4208
1	i had the chicken noodle soup consomme and the pork soup dumplings and they were both amazing . our food was quick to come out after a short wait to be seated . the staff was friendly and welcoming and they politely answered any questions we had about the food . if you find yourself in the pittsburgh area this is a place you must go .	4208
1	all i can say is great food ! ! pork soup dumplings are the best thing ever ... the pork belly slider tasted fantastic and the thai tea is amazing . we have been 4 times is 2 weeks , truly my new favorite	4208
1	review by a vegetarian family with two young kids . several reviews have lamented the small number of vegetarian options on the menu and , while it is true that there are far more options for meat eaters and there is unfortunately no vegetarian noodle soup option , once you get over these 2 facts this is an excellent place for vegetarians .	4208
1	the taste is very good . recommend：小笼包，台湾担担面，抄手燃面！ there are still lots of dishes i have n't tried yet . but i would definitely go there again and again . really good place ! i have been there twice . you have to wait to be seated . the taste is so good that so many people is waiting in line in the lunch or dinner time . so bring your friends and come early to have a taste . you wo n't regret !	4208
1	my first time here was an amazing experience . each dish was full of flavor . service was fast and attentive . the taiwanese style pork belly slider almost had me in tears at getting to experience . amazing flavor with the food showing up fast .	4208
1	unbelievable . simply perfect . if i 'm ever on death row , my last meal will be these pork soup dumplings !	4208
1	out of site food ! i could seriously eat myself silly on there soup dumplings ! i would eat there every week if i were closer ! love it !	4208
1	i always love coming here and seeing the freshly made noodles and dumplings . the soup dumplings are to die for , as well as the beef onion pancake . definitely always a favorite !	4208
1	authentic taiwanese chefs making soup dumplings and noodles- there is nothing like this in pittsburgh my friends ! every time we go , we get stacks of pork soup dumplings with a pork slider and noodle soup on the side . servers are nice . the owner is hilarious .	4208
1	i come here all the time . it 's my go to comfort food that does n't make me ill -- many chinese restaurants do n't sit so well with my stomach . my only complaint is once the waitress told me the dishes incorrectly which led to someone with dietary restrictions eating something they should n't have definitely get the pork soup dumplings !	4208
1	everyday noodles is known for making homemade noodles in front of all the customers ... and they do not disappoint ! the pork and vegetable soup dumplings were the best dumplings i 've ever had , and the pork belly slider was also incredible . for my entree , i split the beef noodle soup , and there was even enough for us both to have leftovers ! i ca n't say enough good things about my meal . i would definitely recommend coming here and getting something with noodles . i 'm already looking forward to coming back !	4208
1	absolutely delicious . the pork buns were divine . it was really cool to see our noodles and dumplings being made while we were eating . a little on the expensive side for lunch but absolutely worth it .	4208
1	be prepared to wait a few minutes . this is a small location with limited space . there is also very limited space to wait . the soup dumplings , jellyfish salad and tofu appetizers were good . everything else we got was fine . it was fun to watch them hand make the items though the window . other than to get soup dumplings i do n't think i 'd return .	4208
1	second time eating here and it was as great as the first . i tried the beef tendon with my soup and i highly recommend it . service was also great both times and i again took home food for later because the bowls of soup are massive..	4208
1	we 're here saturday at 7:30pm - no wait and service was super fast . the beef noodles and soup dumplings are amazing . if we lived in the area i 'd definitely come back !	4208
1	just go and eat the dumplings please ! ! i will be back if i ever swing through pittsburgh again . amazing ! !	4208
0	the latest inspection from the allegheny county health department ( achd ) turned up some food safety problems . the inspection in april 2015 turned up violations in several areas : cross-contamination prevention cleaning and sanitization handwashing facilities pest management toxic items contamination prevention - food , utensils and equipment walls & ceilings read the inspection reports on everyday noodles at http : //webapps.achd.net/restaurant/restaurantdetail.aspx ? id=201302080011	4208
0	menu is a scam . mediocre taste . next time i 'd visit ramen bar right across the street .	4208
0	very unprofessional treatment today . called at 2:00 to make sure they delivered to our address and the person who answered said yes . called at 5:00 and was told that they do not deliver to me despite the fact that i was told they do earlier and that their website advertises a 3 mile delivery radius and i live less than 3 miles away . additionally the girl who put me on hold simply put the phone down on the counter so i could hear her saying disparaging things about me while i waited for her to get back to me . i 'd recommend finding another place that values their customers . there are lots of them here in the burgh !	4208
0	overpriced and mediocre soup dumplings and noodles . hyped place and disappointing food , nothing special . not even really worth my time to write too much more about it . does n't even compare to the real deal you can get for a fraction of the price in nyc 's chinatown . skip , unless you are a hipster with no taste or just desperate for something that kinda resembles soup dumplings for lack of anything better in the area ; )	4208
0	if you are noise sensitive , this is not the place for you . the men making the noodles slap the dough against the counter as hard as possible , and so there was a constant , extremely loud pounding noise throughout dinner . i started to cringe from this intense pounding noise and left with a headache . ( see other comment from guest who said they `` jumped '' a few times due to the intensity of the noise made from the pounding/slapping of the dough against the counter ) . my dinner companion asked a host or waiter if there was any way to lessen the intensity of the noise , and the host/waiter laughed and said no . .	4208
0	i used to enjoy everyday noodles until a recent mortifying experience . i ordered take out - soup dumplings & chicken noodle soup . the dumplings were fine , the soup was inedible ( filled with lots of small bugs ) . everyday noodles used to be a go to , but after this i will not be going back . if you eat here , proceed with caution .	4208
0	the noodle soups here are quite bleh . i ordered the chicken noodle , hoping for delicious chunks of chicken and ramen or maybe udon-style noodles . what i got was an unappetizing bowl of flat , flavorless noodles with three boiled chicken drumettes and three pieces of bok choy floating around . maybe their non-soup dishes are better , but i would go to ramen bar across the street instead if you want a noodle soup .	4208
0	i had high hopes for this place but it was all really disastrous . the service is not that bad , but the food is just awful ( sorry guys ) some just do n't seem right and this was one of those places , could not enjoy ourselves . will not be going back .	4208
0	i like their soup dumplings , but their noodle soup is so so . the noodles are ok but the broth does n't have much depth and their braised beef is n't very flavorful . their chili oil is little too cooked for my taste . i will still go here for dumplings but not for noodle soups .	4208
0	i had heard good things about this place and found that almost none of them are true . i ordered the top three most popular things on the menu : pork soup dumplings , pork belly bun , braised beef noodles . the pork soup dumplings were okay . the pork belly buns were awful , like tasted like a mish-mash of gross shite . and the beef was ok , but the noodles tasted overwhelmingly like dough ; totally overpowered the broth and tasted like i was eating raw spaghetti . bleh ...	4208
0	we ordered their dan dan noodle and it was n't authentic at all . the flavor profile was completely off ; supposed to be spicy + a bit sweet over minced meat sauce and peanut but it was overpowered with fake peanut sauce . that was disappointing . also tried their soupy dumplings and it was quite dry . the best soupy dumplings are supposed be transparent in looks with clear , juicy soup ... overall , nice try of everyday noodle but it 's just not quite there yet . authentic chinese food scene in pittsburgh need sos ! !	4208
0	i stopped in here especially to try their soup dumplings that i heard so much about . when i walked in what kind of threw me off was the smell , it smelled like mold or mildew . i ordered the pork dumplings and scallion pancake , both were served hot . i did like them but i must say its not really authentic . probably wo n't be returning .	4208
0	price is right , food comes out quickly , perfect for a quick bite -- not a place to go for a great meal . i was disappointed that they did not have many warm chicken or shrimp meals ! ! so , i ordered the szechuan noodles* because i love spicy -- they were mildly spicy and broth was really tasty . hubby had a beef and rice dish . he was disappointed because the rice was dry ( i gave him some of my sauce ) . we also ordered a side of broccoli with pork sauce , tasty but not remarkable . *noodles were velvety -- that was the best part of the meal .	4208
0	maybe it was just what we ordered but the noodles and broth were bland and the broccoli was over cooked and oddly seasoned .	4208
0	everyday noodles has a lot going for it : fast , friendly service , attractive decorations , impeccably clean just renovated interior , reasonable prices and convenient location . they only have one issue , bland , plain food . the textures and temperatures were right , but between us , my dinner party tried about a dozen appetizers and entrees and the flavors were consistently very simple and tame . plenty of people do n't like intense flavors , and this would be perfect for them . when they go , they 'll only spot me at everyday noodles if i 'm walking by it , on my way to how lee or the raman bar across the street for more flavorful , adventurous fair .	4208
0	definitely awful place . i do n't understand how its star earned . the noodle tastes so bad . i do n't understand their attitudes . we came first but they offered seats to others . is that because we have less group ? but i do n't think this is the reason we should be treated like this . this is my first time and also last time to eat here . believe me , this is not a place you will get a great experience . nobody is going out for having a bad taste and treat .	4208
0	it was one of my favorite restaurants but they really disappointed me ; i will never go back . the beef of the noodle soup was hard as a rock ! i complained about it and they brought me the same dish with the same inedible beef . not even my dog would have eaten it .	4208
0	harsh attitude to my boy of a waitress looking manly , not a wee bit of nice and patience！ the food is good	4208
0	we came to pittsburgh on getaway again because we love the culinary scene of this city . a big part of the trip was to repeat a wonderful experience we had at en . unfortunately this time the experience was totally opposite of wonderful . the food tasted much worth , the server was so out of providing a nice and timely service that we had an impression that we are a bother for her . she was mostly ignorant towards us or absentminded to a degree that she would n't remember to give us a check and if we would n't remind her she 'd let us leave without payment for a meal . it was all together a very bad experience .	4208
0	does anybody know which soup dumplings are the best ? i used to order the good ones , but lately they changed recipes and the new ones suuuucccck , too salty , super small , she said they ones for takeout are different than the ones for in dining room , weird wtf !	4208
0	my delivery finally arrived after more than two hours . it was cold , and they got the order size wrong .	4208
0	i took someone out here based off good reviews and was a nightmare . the food was horrible . either not cooked right and/or too many spices and salt used that way overpowered anything else . also while not super pricey , it is a lot more pricey than other places with similar cuisine in the area with much better food . do n't go here unless you want horrible food at a steep price .	4208
0	i was excited to try this place out , but it was okay ... . food was not memorable and it 's a little overpriced . beware of what you order , because it sure adds up ! for a group of 3 , we nearly paid $ 60 . however , i wouldnt mind paying $ 60 if the food was actually good and flavorful . the soup and dumplings were tasteless . it simply doesn ` t have that `` oomph '' factor . please improve and i will consider coming back ! ! or at least release a groupon or livingsocial deal , so more people can afford eating here ! !	4208
0	seriously ? jellyfish dish no jellyfish , there is only cabbage and carrot . noodles tastes not that good as before .	4208
0	not good for vegetarians . the vegetarian noodles ( labeled as such ) on the daily specials board was actually cooked in a meat broth . this place gets points for having good and courteous waiters who pointed it out when we were ordering . we were able to leave and go somewhere more vegetarian friendly .	4208
0	not impressed by this place at all . the flavors were lacking on everything we tried and there 's really no good vegetarian options here . there also nothing for kids . i 'd never go back .	4208
0	just got to the place @ 1:50 pm on a sat . the place is packed . greeted by the hostess and was told that they only do take out cuz it closed @ 2:30 pm . really ? on a sat when it takes like 1/2 hr to find parking around the area .	4208
0	really bad service and arrogant waitress . wo n't come again . your service really ruin my mood .	4208
0	almost no options at all for vegetarians , and practically everything has pork in it . this would n't be a big issue except that they refuse to make any alterations to accommodate their customers , regardless of the reason . they wo n't add anything or take anything out , which makes no sense at all . i 'm not a vegetarian , but i absolutely detest pork , and it is way overused here . most expensive waste of an experience in a very long time .	4208
0	very unhappy with the wonton soup . way too much fat in the broth . we ordered the wonton soup and beef noodle soup , both came with the same broth which left us dissapointed . hard to eat due to all the grease in it .	4208
0	very bad attitude if you order delivery ! the first time i called , they hung up before i gave them my address . so i called again , they ask me my credit card information and hung up ! still did n't ask my address ! i do n't want to call them the third time but they made me to ! that is a terrible experience and i 'm 100 % sure i wo n't choose everyday noodles anymore !	4208
0	i just had incredibly mediocre soup dumplings at everyday noodles.there was almost no soup within the dumplings , the crab meat was virtually non-existent ( there was some pork ) , the dumplings were quite small and the dough envelope quite thick.this is not the place in pittsburgh to go for soup dumplings ! i 'll keep looking though until i find soup dumpling paradise !	4208
1	i love shopping here . they have a good selection and i always have some sort of coupon that they send me by email . the store is clean and well stocked . returns are easily done . they only downside is that sometimes they do n't have enough cashiers and there is a bit of a wait in line to check out . this is on my list of regular places to shop .	4209
1	i just came in to do a little christmas shopping today and had a customer service her name was joannie d very nice woman very kind and very helpful .	4209
1	i absolutely love kohl 's . exceptional customer service , hassle free returns , kohl 's cash perks , and coupons offering additional savings such as 20 % off . i visit this location as well as do quite a bit of online shopping . hassle free returns are great . if i 'm not satisfied with my purchase , and this includes online buys , i return it and i have never had a problem . i have had a positive experience with every associate that i have interacted with at the store . this includes during the crazy holiday shopping times .	4209
1	diane our cashier at kohl 's in the galleria mall was more than extremely helpful with our entire purchase . kudos to kohl 's for hiring such wonderful people !	4209
0	betty is a very rude employee bitching behind my back ? because i i wanted another employee to ring me up she was to slow she needs to keep up the pace and quit having attitudes towards customers what policy is that ? if you want betty bitching behind your back come to this kohl 's .	4209
0	first , i love kohl 's , but this one is the worst . went to return a shirt yesterday and stood in line for 45 min because they had one person working that area and were letting people do regular check out . also , jd , who looked like a manager , would continue to go behind the counter , but never help anyone even though the line was more than 10 deep .	4209
0	kohl 's is suppose to be a cheaper version of a department store , yet i do not find their prices to be any better than anywhere else in the mall . on top of that , the merchandise tends to not be as nice either . i walked in , did a round , and was ready to leave within ten minutes . on a positive note , their kitchen and dining area is the highlight of the store . they carry a nice selection of tasting sets from food network .	4209
0	no chairs to sit on while our daughter try 's on school clothes and so super , super unorganized . the kohl 's on valle verde is our usual go to ... big bummer .	4209
1	my fiance and i really liked this place . huge step up from stonepepper grill . our server was very attentive and the food was quick and on point . tried the bruschetta , chicken parm and cajun salmon . every dish was good and the chicken parm was better than many spots in the area . the one negative was the hostesses attitudes . they seemed stressed and frustrated that they were busy at 7pm in a friday night which should make them happy , right ?	4210
1	we loved our experience here tonight . kim was our waitress and she was great . our children have an allergenic disease and are very limited in what they can eat . i also have celiac 's disease , so no gluten for me . our meals came out just right , they made special accommodations for the kids and even had gluten free breadsticks they could eat . you have now become one of our new favorite restaurants .	4210
1	great food ! thoroughly impressed with bolognese , manicotti , and veal . meatballs were soft and plenty of flavor . sauce was a little too sweet for my liking , but still good . service needs tightened up , but they 're still new .	4210
1	so glad pazzo is back . now my family has a place to go where we can get delicious gluten free options for some of us and incredible pizza for others . every time we 've eaten here since they reopened we have been treated like family . our biggest issue is we now have to wait just a minute to be seated because they 're busy but even so the food arrives fresh and hot from the kitchen without waiting .	4210
1	friendly , quiet , and the italian food is quite good . suggested : meatball pizza , fiery mule , stuffed banana pepper soup . small places like this can use help from the community and the reviews can be misleading . try it .	4210
1	i do n't understand the 2 star reviews . lunch today was very good , especially the thin crust pizza and the wedding soup was superb .	4210
1	we had a great experience for dinner a few days ago ! the service was wonderful and our server was very knowlegeable about the menu . i am gluten free and my daughter is egg and dairy free and she was able to guide us to the best choices . the kitchen appears to be careful about food allergies and cross contaimination . from our zucchini appitizer , family style salad , entrees and wine , everything was beautifully presented and tasted great . the courses were well paced and we had plenty of time to enjoy the warm , remodeled space with tables with white tableclothes . we will be back !	4210
0	the parking lot is always empty which is n't a good sign . but still wanted to give it a try . no hostess . waited a few minutes before the bartender came out to seat us . my menu was dirty . my silverware was dirty . glasses spotty . come on guys . if you 're slow and still ca n't keep things clean ... .. ? food was ok , but definately did n't live up to the prices . i am in the business and it makes me sad when a new restaurant does n't do well . these little details could easily be fixed .	4210
0	the perfect word for this place is : bland . i had the eggplant parmesan , which had too much breading & was bland . another person in our group had the greek pizza , which was thin & crispy & bland . on the bright side ( i guess ) , the kids liked their chicken fingers because , hey , kids like their food bland !	4210
0	the food is very good . but ... ... bartender charged for a double . should have been 6.50 but they charged 13.00 . when we mentioned we did n't order a double , she said it was a computer glitch , but made no effort to reduce it . asked for a manager , he offered to take off 4.00 . buyer beware ! ! they are sneaky and when they get caught , they are unapologetic .	4210
0	just walked out of this place . went in looked through the menu picked what we wanted and not once did anyone ask to seat us or even acknowledge that we were there . there was no hostess and a staff member out front on her phone & smoking that watched us walk in . there loss for shitty service . never going there again .	4210
0	my husband and i went to pazzo 's for dinner during restaurant week . we were both disappointed with our entrees . we ordered off the restaurant week menu . we both loved the lobster bisque . my husband 's crab ravioli was not warm . my veal romano was hard and difficult to cut and eat . my vegetable , carrots , were also not soft enough to chew . we enjoyed the ice cream for dessert . the waitress was very friendly and attentive . we may try pazzo ' s for lunch , but we wish we would have chosen a different restaurant for dinner .	4210
0	the wedding soup was so good ! after eating that i was hopeful that the reviews on here were n't accurate ... i 'm sorry to say that they are true ! i would come back for the soup but would n't eat dinner here again . we came for restaurant week and the menu looked amazing but the actual food was pretty poor .	4210
0	i completely agree with kimberly said . bland city ! ! ! hopefully my dogs will like the leftovers . but i doubt it .	4210
1	great local company ! everyone was super friendly and answered all of the questions we had . they came out and installed it the same day . we love the alarm.com app , as well as the home automation features ! would recommend clear protection to everyone !	4211
1	clearprotection has provided me excellent customer service , knowledge and top of the line equipment for my family , and i could n't be happier and have more of a piece of mind knowing that our home is protected and that i can monitor everything from my smartphone with all the automation we had put in . highly recommend this company . 10 stars in my book !	4211
1	great customer service and prices ! excited to have protection with a reputable company . richie is very personable and knowledgable . as a new home owner with kids we are very excited to feel safe and taken care of . who would n't want to be part of a company that takes care of their clients .	4211
1	richie saved us some money on our tv service and added some upgrades to our alarm system . also included some additional perks . we are happy with clear protection .	4211
1	this company has been very good to me and my family . great people and great company . thank you for keeping my family safe	4211
1	got to meet richard and payson this evening and hear what the have to offer . great guys with a great service to offer .	4211
0	stay away ! ! ! met the company at the home show i simply asked if they would provide a quote for the same equipment i was considering with a different reputable alarm company they took done my phone number and address on the new home i was purchasing . they proceeded with a hard credit inquiry without my knowledge or permission caused my credit score to dip 5 points overnight and cost me a higher interest rate . be careful	4211
0	your sales rep interrupted our evening at our home close to 9p and refused to leave to try and sell us a system which i made clear i had no interest in and repeatedly told him we were in the middle of a movie . what type of people are you hiring to represent your company and try to force them into something by not leaving ones property ? if he comes to again i 'm calling the local police . i will also be warning our neighborhood of this person on nextdoors forums . this was very rude and inconsiderate - he was misleading and said there was something serious to get be to keep speaking with him .	4211
0	thought this was a slam dunk as far as a great security system and service . not even ... worst ever . a month and a half in and i do n't have all the equipment and they 're charging me for equipment i 'm not evening using as well as two months worth of service . clear protection says it 's monitronics responsibility for the account handling and monitronics says it 's clear protections responsibility for the account handling . right hand does n't know what the left hand is doing . i do not suggest this company . if you hear this name run the other way as fast as you can ! ! !	4211
0	update : since my review clear protection has reached out to rectify the situtation . they 're customer service lead noelle was very professional and her level of customer service is that which everyone in the company should strive to possess and what i would have liked to have received from the beginning . they worked to have the issue resolved with monitronics as well and stated they are working so it does n't happen to any other customers . ultimately i decided to not stay with the company and they have had a technichian come out and take the equipment that i did have back . the technichian aaron was professional and very understanding of the situation .	4211
0	do n't do it ! poor customer service , equipment does n't work ! ca n't get ahold of anyone in office or out ! been waiting for a technician since 9:30 am it is now 4 ! not enough workers or techs ! going back to adt asap !	4211
0	we signed up in may have had nothing but issues with the system since then , finally got the door sensor 's replaced ( they tried to charge us saying it was our fault it did n't work ) still being charged monthly and the door bell still is n't working . we called now they say call moni we call them they say it 's clear protection 's fault . do your self a favor read all the reviews on moni you will see how bad this alarm system is .	4211
1	we take our two dogs to the happy dog inn and they love it ! they get to run and play and have the time of their lives while we are on holiday . it is a luxurious place for pets . tom and maria look after them as if they were their own dogs . we would not contemplate taking them anywhere else as we trust their care so completely at the happy dog inn . thanks tom and maria ! !	4212
1	i ca n't tell you how thankful i am that i found the happy dog inn . i have been taking my dog to them for the past 9 years and i am always impressed by this wonderful boarding facility . the design of the facility lets the dogs have a lot of space both in the kennel areas and outside and the yards for exercise time are big and pristine . i know that tom & maria truly care about our pets and i can tell because my girl is always happy to see them and go what i call doggy camp . the happy dog inn let 's me go on vacation with absolute peace of mind .	4212
0	called to see if they had any availability since i 'll be in scottsdale for thanksgiving . i spoke with tom . tom told me they 've been sold out for months . i completely understand since i waited a few weeks before thanksgiving to make a reservation . so i asked him if he had any recommendations . he told me this - `` the only place i recommend is sold out . you 'll have to take your dog to some disgusting facility . '' i 'll never do business with the happy dog inn . that was inappropriate and not helpful .	4212
0	while my dog was happy , i found the human interaction aggravating . my reservation was not recorded and maria spent 10 minutes lecturing me on their policies . it was their mistake . policies are too restrictive and not flexible at all . not at all worth the premium price and stress they caused me .	4212
1	i send a lot of color print jobs to this location since it 's close to my store . i 'm super happy to have contacted them for a banner print . i was trying to get the cheapest paper option available for a last minute event . i spoke to kate who gave me suggestions on alternate materials and styles available for almost the same price . so now i have a killer vinyl banner to use over and over again . it was done very quickly and saved day ! i would highly recommend using them	4213
1	i 've never shipped through fedex , and i called them the other day to figure out all of their rules and the lady was completely helpful and did n't make me seem like i was dumb for not knowing any of it : ) hahaha . i had to packaging tape to finish taping my box and the guy behind the counter took the box & taped it for me and also taped the shipping label . i had a great and fast experience there and it 's super close to me so i 'm stoked to keep shipping through fedex !	4213
1	had a great experience here with the gabe . sent groups of students to have full color posters printed using our account . the process was very smooth and gabe was very accommodating . we made all arrangement through phone so i did n't even have to leave the office which is a big plus in my book . he saved me tons of time . i could n't ask for more more professional courteous service . the posters were beautiful and nicely packaged so they would not get damaged . when we discovered an error on the invoice , it was quickly rectified . will i use them again ? absolutely !	4213
1	customer service is on point ! helped me fix problems that were my fault and always friendly and fast .	4213
1	most fedex places do n't receive great reviews for their customer service , but i had such a great experience with their service i just had to leave a 5 star review . i was having trouble with the printer and without me having to ask nancy came up and offered to help me . thank you ! i came to use their laminator , printer , and fax machine . they also have plenty of pens , glue stick , rubber bands , post it 's , scotch tape , stapler remover , staplers , and three hole punchers . work stations are to the left of the room , full service printing , and shipping services .	4213
1	ordered everything on the app . it was super convenient , all i had to do was pick up my box and go ! there was a long line of mildly clueless people , so i wish there had been a line specifically for online orders ( hence 4 stars rather than 5 ) but jeremy , the team member that helped me out was extremely fast and helped each person quickly and fully . he ensured everything in my order was correct and made my experience great .	4213
1	we went here last night at 9:00pm to get invitation cards for my daughter 's birthday party printed up . service was courteous , fast , and we got exactly what we asked for . this is one of those cases where i really ca n't write an elaborate review . what i can say is that we needed a facility that could print a professional quality job for us off of a flash drive late at night . they came through and neither my wife nor i have any complaints . they did us right , and pretty much guaranteed that we will return for a similar job in the future .	4213
1	i really needed quick help with a document today and needed it printed and cut into half sheets . the staff here did an excellent job of assisting me and taking payment from my emloyer over the phone . one person in particular , jason , helped me out so much . very professional , went over and above my expectations . thank you .	4213
1	was expecting to drop off my binding job and come back but he did it right away . great service !	4213
1	great service , they even told me a way to save money on the poster i needed for my class . came to them kind of last minute and they took my order . friendly and knowledgeable staff . definitely the best kinkos i 've been to in arizona ( utah is better ) . still expensive , which is why it 's not 5 stars . however , i was in dire need because all the other print shops i searched around tempe closed at 5:30 or 6 pm . this place is open till 11 on weekdays ! great stuff	4213
1	jeremy rocks ! normally my fedex experiences ' are kinda unpleasant . customer service is kinda low ... because i feel like they are understaffed buttt my experience two days in a row was awesome ! thank you for making my 60+ hour work week more stressful then it already is . i appreciate it more then you will know .	4213
1	my company in new york cory needed overnight printing and collating of a series of similar-looking research documents that easily could be confused visually . they were to be used in phoenix and time was tight . the folks at this fedex location were extremely smart , helpful , patient and willing to take on the job . i received clarifying phone calls wherein the fedex printing technician clarified important details pertaining to the complicated printing and was really on top of it . everything turned out perfect the next day and we were extremely pleased . this fedex is excellent !	4213
0	if you need anything printed do not go here . i have never encountered such an unmotivated group of individuals in my entire life . even the smallest print job is a paramount effort for them , and they are sure to let you know . this review based off of several unpleasant experiences not just one . if you need anything printed , the fedex office downtown , alphagraphics , or thomas print works will gladly help you .	4213
0	wow i have never had worse service ! they could n't find my location because i did n't have an apartment number on the shipping label . i live in a condo and do n't have an apartment number . they were too lazy to search harder for my house so it was sent back and now i wo n't recieve it today . absolutely ridiculous . use a gps .	4213
0	this is a wonderful location if you love the lack of customer service and attention by personnel . the staff made me create a line at the copy center when no one was even at the desk . ( not the self-service copy center to be clear ) what type of professionalism is that ? after 20 minutes of waiting and poor service i left and went to staples instead .	4213
0	the employees are very rude . i mistakenly brought ups packages into the store and got it rudely pointed out to me by mr. beavis looking ass . these dudes are assholes . there 's a ups location right down the street that you should just go to instead . they 're way nicer , it 's probably cheaper , and they taped up all of my packages for me for free like 3 minutes before they closed and told me multiple times that it was like no problem .	4213
0	go here if you want keith to berate you like a disappointed father for selecting the wrong packaging . i offered to go get the correct packaging and he snapped `` just forget it '' `` why bother now '' while huffing and slamming things on the counter . i was polite and even thanked him but it was probably the worst experience i 've had at a retail store ever .	4213
0	they do n't sell stamps and only ship instead of mail for you which cost you more . do n't try to make any simple mailing orders here .	4213
0	bad customer service . 4 people working and only 1 helped customers while we stood in long lines	4213
0	i tried to get some stuff printed here and the woman who was supposed to help was pretty much the opposite of helpful . she just told me to go figure it out- but was super helpful with the next person who approached her . so the good pat is is that if you 're old and white you 'll likely get some a+ service here , way to play to the demographic sweetheart , bravo .	4213
0	rudest employees i have ever experienced . i walk in to pick up a printed binder of notes i ordered online and am greeted with ; '' what do you want '' '' my book '' '' well who are you '' '' name '' '' k bye '' it was printed wrong too so their equipment must be crap as every ten pages or so it is n't double sided like i wanted but has print on the front side of one page , then the back side of the next which is annoying as hell . 0/10 will not return . ups is lyfe .	4213
0	this is the worst fedex in america ! out of supplies most of the time and every so often i try it again as it close to my house but will have to drive a few more miles to find one w/ decent service !	4213
0	i 've never waited somewhere for so long . this place is pathetic and they only have one pathetic worker here . horrible experience	4213
0	fed ex has never been known to deliver a package to the right place . they are the least reliable shipping company . if you ship with this company expect to never get your package . i 've shopped with the so many time through shipping and it 's ridiculous , they hire felons and do not care about there customers .	4213
1	tried the bee legendary . i have to say this maybe the best nut milk that i 've tried but man , it 's quite expensive . service was good . good location as well .	4214
1	the staff is friendly and although their products lean on to the pricey side we ought to remember the spot 's location . also , their products in fact have very good quality . the sandwiches ( open face ) are on the small side and the price is about $ 10 for each . i tried their bee grateful juice and surprisingly the flavor was great . both yummy and good for you .	4214
1	on a seminar weekend , i had to walk a ways from the rio to get here , but it was worth it . the pb & j was perfect . just what i wanted . it was smooth , with kale , and some protein powder .	4214
1	look for the giant chandelier , go upstairs , this on the second floor of cosmopolitan hotel immediately when you get off the escalator . excellent fresh juice with clean crisp taste . lots of different varieties from juice to smoothies . i know it 's the vegas strip , but c'mon $ 12 for a glass of juice is insane ! it 's veggies & fruit !	4214
1	this is the place to go if you need to recharge your energy after being on the vegas strip for a few days . lol yummy ! drinks are a little on the pricey side , but it 's going to be that way for all fresh produce drinks . i went with the `` lipofunction '' smoothie and i was feeling much better afterwards . taste was great and knowing all the healthy ingredients used made me feel better about myself . they let you sample as well , so you do n't end up with something you do n't like . next time i 'll have to try one of the juices . it 's located on the second floor of the cosmopolitan hotel .	4214
1	ivory and i had a great conversation and he was super friendly and accommodating . he 's a great guy and definitely the type of person that makes people want to keep coming back .	4214
1	located at the top of escalator ( look for the big red stiletto heel ) in the cosmopolitan . we walked from the mirage to the cosmopolitan for their bulletproof coffee . while not the same as we make at home it served the purpose . they used sports research brand mct ( we use that at home ) however the juice stop uses cashew cream which is something we were n't used to . it has a gritty texture when drinking and leaves something at the bottom of the cup . they also have you choose between ghee or butter . they used the kerrygold irish grass-fed unsalted brand ( we use that at home too ) . not the best but not bad either .	4214
1	we wanted a cocktail while waiting for our dinner to be ready . looked at the cocktail menu at this place and decided to give them a try . josiah made great drink recommendations followed by making a great cocktail , queen for a day w/ hennessey for me & sex panther with tequila for him ! glad we tried this instead of a drink we can get at any bar ! cocktails made with pressed juice is healthy right ? ! ? lol thank you josiah & karina !	4214
1	they have a really great list of juice options and i really wanted an iced coffee with nut milk . i had to ask for an extra shot to even taste the coffee in the drink which is annoying but the nut milk is delicious . plus any place that offers you alcohol in your green juice is great .	4214
1	great juices and better service ! ivory is the best ! ! ! ! ! everyone was very informative and helpful	4214
1	recently stayed at the cosmo during my trip to vegas and loved that they had a juice bar in the hotel ! ! went here every morning and got the green and good smoothie .	4214
1	wow , the wellness shot . cayenne and black pepper along with whatever . my eyes were watering after that . the bee energized is excellent . do n't get turned off by beets . they give it a nice taste . knowledgeable staff . had a couple of samples before deciding on the bee energized . good luck . hope you succeed and are able to expand .	4214
0	this is the second time i have come here . the first time , i ordered avocado toast and they were out of avocados , i asked for sprouts instead but they were out of that too . i got a smoothie that was disgusting . this time i ordered avocado toast and they were out of bread . do n't bother coming here .	4214
0	we do n't mind paying the pricey prices but the service was horrible . an employee with green hair was talking tattoos with someone else for so long . i finally asked if someone could take my order , she looked up with a ca n't you see i 'm talking look and did n't even acknowledge us . i would have walked but my wife wanted the juice . next time , i will pay a taxi to take me elsewhere	4214
0	cool folks behind the counter so service is pretty good . this was just not what i had in mind as a juice bar for i asked for something fruity and they gave me something with ginger in it which was nasty as hell . this place is for them health nuts that drink wheat grass . i like my juices with mango and they do n't have anything close so this place is not for me .	4214
0	bought the bee grateful and there 's wayyyyy too much ginger in it . overpriced for juices but hey it 's the cosmo !	4214
0	had some douchey 20-something brunette guy skip me entirely to greet and tend to the guy in line behind me . thankfully , the customer was chivalrous and fair enough to ask me if i 'd ordered yet to understand why i was being skipped ... ordered two cold pressed juices , bee cosmopolitan and bee grateful , at $ 12 a bottle . you can imagine the hike in the prices ( compared to off-strip juice bars that average $ 7 ) being attributed to its prime real estate location inside the posh cosmo hotel , right next door to tourist-ravished breakfast eatery eggslut . the juices were delicious and refreshing but not at all worth it after the cashier 's shitty service .	4214
0	came here on a thursday morning . there was no line and the store was n't too busy . i paid $ 14 for an acai smoothie . the acai was melted . it was hard to eat it off a cup..but who am i to tell them how to serve acai + fruits + nuts and stuff anyway . that 's up to their executives . i really do n't mind paying $ 14 in a vegas strip joint , especially in cosmopolitan..but i expect better quality from a place like this . service was friendly .	4214
0	this place is a joke people here are so slow . paid $ 17 for one slice of avocado on toast and coffee and waited over 15 mins . it was not even busy . no line . everyone is just standing around talking and my order was sitting around . the guy taking orders with tattoos on his arm was just chatting everyone and did not even look and follow up on what was happening . do n't recommend .	4214
0	meh . stopped by for something quick at 7:30am . some woman ahead of us went with avocado toast and that threw everything off . had to wait 20 mins for a smoothie that was kinda bland and very gritty . for $ 12 just expected more .	4214
0	ugh my wallet and i cried after going to the juice standard but i was just reaally craving a smoothie when i woke up from a night of excessive drinking and clubbing . i was n't surprised by how expensive the smoothie was ( ~ $ 11 ) given that it 's in vegas at the cosmo , but i was expecting the quality to be a little better . i ordered the berry antioxidizing which was cashews , acai , blueberries , bananas , flax , goji berries , agave , and alkaline water . it was suuper icy/watery and did n't have a lot of fruit flavor . sad . should 've just gone over to milkbar next to it and got ice cream ...	4214
0	was not impressed ... .i bought a libido booster and bff yesterday . it took quite awhile to get our drinks . there was one person in front of me so i thought well maybe they are taking so long because they are so fresh . wrong ! ! ! worst smoothie i have ever had and they were $ 13 each . it tasted like powder mixed with ice . tried stirring it and it just got worse . reminded me of a slim fast drink from the 90 's . i had to throw it out after 3 sips . there was no stomaching it . gave them 2 stars because the service was good at least .	4214
0	stick to the fort apache location . the juices are great , they 're always great , but the service is mediocre . you know all about juice standard if you 've been to another location . visit one , you 've visited them all . but this one 's sorely lacking in friendliness . avoid if you can .	4214
0	wildly overpriced . but they have a friendly staff , great juice combinations and it 's all fresh . after a workout , i was feeling like freshness was what i was craving before i hit the pool side in a bikini . i over paid for a juice i can and often make at home in a glass container- also did n't love that but whatev . since i did n't hit the jackpot , i only visited once . probably would n't go back unless my pocket had too much money in it .	4214
1	this place is the best . my friends and i get takeout from here all the time , and it 's great because i can exercise my total indecision right up to choosing food , because they have sooooooo many choices . thai ? vietnamese ? chinese ? sushi ? tottie 's has it all , and it is all delicious . sugar cane chicken ? pho ? pad thai ? what are you in the mood for ! ? the prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are decent , not overwhelming , but everything is flavorful and distinctive .	4215
1	good flavors , good entrees . sometimes it 's not entirely clear which style a dish is going to be in , which can lead to interesting mishmashes . friendly service . 9/10 ... given what it is .	4215
1	when we go in to eat its like seeing an old family member . tottie and her staff always makes you feel welcome . bun tom is one of my favorites -- charbroiled pork , shrimp and tottie rolls with fresh lettuce , fresh mint , peanuts and rice vermicelli . pho tai is great . spring rolls are awesome . depending on time of year she makes the most incredible avocado ice cream . trust me , its perfection .	4215
1	we live in gilbert . this restaurant is always worth the drive . delicious , never disappointed ! !	4215
1	great place ! the chirashi was awesome , as was all the sushi we tried ( 5 stars for actually having chirashi on the menu ) . definitely one of the best sushi joints in town .	4215
1	the egg drop soup is the best i have ever had . the tottie rolls are also amazing . i am never disappointed when we eat here .	4215
1	the waitress i had at lunch time today was very customer service oriented . she knew the menu and was refilling drinks fast . the food came out fresh , hot , and tasted amazing . i would recommend this place to anyone and will bring my friends . thank you for a great experience .	4215
1	this is by far one of my top favorite restaurants in the city ! i love love this place ! the food is so good , the atmosphere is relaxing and inviting . i could literally eat here everyday . they also have s really decent sake selection and the plum wine is so yummy !	4215
1	do n't judge a book by it 's cover . the outside does n't look so great , but you go inside and it 's gorgeous . the food is some of the best food i 've ever eaten . their sugar cane chicken appetizer is fantastic ! ! the pad thai , chiang mai noodles , pad kra po , pad lard na , etc . this place is so flavorful with fresh veggies and fresh herbs . and do n't get me started on their fried honey banana dessert . the best dessert i 've ever had ! check this place out you will not be disappointed .	4215
1	a family dinner tradition ! my family is from san francisco but when they come into town i always take them to tottie 's because its always delicious and authentic . we usually get the spring rolls , a curry , and avocado ice cream . always good service , i 've gotten take out a couple times and once i ordered wrong and they corrected my mistake without charging me : ) definitely go .	4215
1	best place ! ! ! ! been coming here for quite a long time and it is my go-to for hot and sour soup . try the tottie rolls , yum ! ! ! !	4215
1	great appetizers great food super friendly staff for our first time here was amazing def recommend it	4215
1	my family ate at totties saturday evening . we ordered 4 entrees and 2 appetizers . food was fresh , well prepared and delicious . service was highly attentive . waiter was knowledgeable , providing info to ensure we would enjoy our meals . atmosphere was cool , clean , tranquil and most enjoyable .	4215
1	beautiful environment , clean , polite & efficient service , delicious food , aweskme crystal dragon . tom yum on point	4215
1	solid . had the thai stir-fry , and requested fresh ginger , met exact expectations	4215
1	this is probably the most diverse restaurant that i 've been to , with a wide variety of cuisines . ranging from chinese to japanese , you wo n't be disappointed with this restaurant . good serving sizes and nice service .	4215
1	this place is one of my new favorites ! i love their chicken larb . seriously great ! the place is beautiful , too . i recommend it to anyone who enjoys asian-style food .	4215
1	the perfect local spot for a great meal . the atmosphere is always welcoming and the service is always superb . the house lo mein is my all-time favorite dish , and the egg-drop soup is awesome ! love everything about the thomas location . i recommend this place to anyone ! 5-star !	4215
1	this restaurant is amazing . all the food we had was fresh and the flavors and sauces were scrumptious we ordered so much food ! my favorites so far are the spicy cucumber and shrimp spring roll appetizers as well as the pad thai and pho . if you are craving pho this is the place . plus the ambiance and service is on point . enjoy !	4215
1	best curry i 've had since i 've been in az . tottie rolls are awesome as well . i ordered my food togo while waiting in the restaurant , and the server was extremely knowledgable . my food was based on her recommendations ... . and i am extremely pleased . i will be back ! ! !	4215
1	was n't sure what to expect of a place in a strip mall near a 99 cent store ... we were so pleasantly surprised ! this place should be called tastie 's instead of tottie 's . food was delicious and our waitress ( kelly ) was awesome - attentive , informative and super nice . the inside has a nice ambience ; great authentic feel . definitely recommend the kang keo wan curry ( chicken ) and the thai fried rice ( chicken ) .	4215
1	we 've gone to tottie 's several times and always had a good experience . they have a lot to chose from . i 've always found the service to be great and the staff friendly . i 'll be back !	4215
1	large portions and tasty food ! bottomless mimosas on mother 's day with an entree , ca n't beat it !	4215
1	i ca n't get enough of the tangerine beef or the eggplant ! the beef has a nice crispness to the outside , it 's juicy inside , and the flavor is light and citrusy . tottie herself is very personable , happy , and talented .	4215
1	everything thomas said it was and more . i 'm not a food mixer . i was afraid to have mint touching my spring roll . but , i was guided on how to put the mint and cilantro together ( what a combination ! ) , i never knew spring rolls could be so delicious ! everything we ordered came out yummy , even the stuff we did n't order ( poor waitress , first day and she was completely lost ! ) ! i wanted someone to guide our waitress . but other than that food was yummy , conversations was funny , and i filled my tummy ! ! he he !	4215
1	there food is great of course , but i wanted to leave kudos for our server blake ! he was supper funny , and when i asked for a sierra nevada , and he accidentally brought me a sierra mist he made up for it by offering the next one for free and just had a great attitude . i hope his management team recognizes his potential and awesome customer service .	4215
1	very friendly , quick service , and great food . hands down one of my favorite places to go eat !	4215
1	five stars for those amazing tottie rolls ! i love coming by just for these .	4215
1	always a family favorite for us . such varied menu ! there is plenty of sushi , thai food , chinese dishes ... everyone can have their favorite asian cuisine at totties ! we will be back soon ... ah . great service as well .	4215
1	tottie the hottie . she is such a delight . i 'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves , garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce . but , meanwhile , i 'll use her thin , crisp , hot and fresh spring rolls . much of the staff appears to have been hired from puberty weekly . seriously . though very friendly , not very efficient . great dinner with amazing friends before my stand up show this past sunday .	4215
1	very good food and friendly attentive service . my husband and i were visiting scottsdale with our daughter and stopped here to eat . i enjoyed their thai iced tea very much and ordered the pad thai , which was delicious . they serve generous portions , we took the left overs back to the hotel and had them later for dinner .	4215
1	came here on a recommendation from a friend . close to home and i love trying new places . waitstaff was friendly . i had the pad kee mao and it was more than enough food . they know how to dial up the spice as well ! i like spicy food and this had me sweating a bit . i guess you get what you ask for . i 'll definitely be back to try other items .	4215
1	had to try this fusion as i have been looking for some good soup , and i was really surprised ! the pho was tasty , just had to add my siracha . the padang chicken was the really good part ! i got a 5 on a 1-10 scale . was n't spicy enough , so i will go up next time . glad i stopped to check it out .	4215
1	fusion ? i do n't think so . its a pan-asian - pacific rim place ... is it the best thai ? ... no but its good is it the best chinese ? ... no but its good is it the best vietnamese ? ... no but its ok is it the best sushi ? ... no but its ok it has nice decor , above average food , great selection , typical asian service standards . its good if your party ca n't decide on any specific type of asian cuisine	4215
1	always good tasty food ! great atmosphere and friendly staff . recommend the penang curry with sticky rice !	4215
1	i have been working in the east valley for about 14 years . it is hard to find good asian food . i have to say this is my first time at this restauarant and it is amazing . the food is tasteful , hot , and fresh . the portiins are amazing compared to the price , and i would recommend anyine coming by to try . i personally had the pad thai , and it was deliocious .	4215
0	their food is great but their front door staff & waiters suck . totties has forgotten the fact there are many other very good asian fusion cuisine spots in scottsdale & phoenix these days . they ca n't afford to continue to survive off the vapors of previous success . i predict they 'll be out of business within a year due to this horrible service . people wo n't stand for it .	4215
0	i get that they are `` asian fusion '' but i think they should specialize in one type , because i feel that the food is just okay . and i 'm paying to eat in south scottsdale .	4215
0	we enjoyed the spring rolls and sushi but the tom yum soup was too sweet and strangely tomato based .	4215
0	do not recommend . came here the other day on a lunch break & ordered the vegetable panang curry . fast forward 5 hours later i had terrible food poisoning . i would not recommend coming here .	4215
0	do n't get the pho here . it 's not very good and they wo n't allow you to get the beef raw on the side so it was incredibly over cooked and chewy . : /	4215
0	ugh ... the soup had no seasoning , and the chicken and beef were dry , dry , dry . i worked in a chinese restaurant years ago , and i have been to china . skip this place ! !	4215
0	ordered kung pao chicken with 6 spicy . it was nothing but sweet . it was good but i 'm a fan off spicy food . it was better drenched in chili paste .	4215
0	came here on a sunday and found out they do n't have the lunch combo . so i ordered one order of egg roll ( 4 pcs for close to $ 7 ! ) , and crispy chicken with thai basil . my friend ordered chicken with cashew . egg roll was good . freshly fried and crispy . there is no crispness to my chicken . could barely taste or see the basil . the plate is full with unnecessary crispy noodle . not completely convinced i will come back .	4215
0	not impressed . the pad thai tasted off and the panang curry with shrimp was completely devoid of flavor/spice . only the fried tofu and chicken satay were good and those are pretty impossible to mess up . the search for decent thai in the valley continues ... .	4215
0	oh boy ... not a fan at all . tottie 's is right by my house , so i checked the reviews and it appeared to be a good take out spot . i ordered a thai noodle dish with tofu and my bf ordered pad thai . i ordered both medium spice level . my bf picked it up and he said the place spelled rancid , not a good sign . both of our meals were terrible , had no sauce whatsoever and mine was so spicy it was inedible . i love spicy food , so it 's not that i ca n't tolerate the heat ... this was just bad . i threw out my meal and ate popcorn for dinner .	4215
0	do not waste your time and money coming here ! ! we came here at least a dozen time before . on this visit , their chicken and beef curry tasted very different then before . we told the oriental lady ( sorry i do n't remember her name ) and she was very rude . she said that their curry dishes are very good and it 's not true what we were saying . the curry sauce was water down and you can only taste the coconut milk in it . the sad part is she did n't even want to take it off our bill . do not come here . nasty service and now nasty food too .	4215
0	i used to really enjoy the food from totties as many local residents do but i 'm not sure what happened on sunday night but our take-out was somewhat disappointing . as usual i ordered the sizzling rice soup and as always it was very good , thus the 2 stars but it went downhill from there . the egg rolls were basically 4 empty crispy shells and the mongolian beef was spicier than i expected especially having ordered it before but the worst part was that the beef was tough and chewy where it usually is so tender . definitely not worth the price we paid .	4215
0	i '' m confused . i have repeatedly been told this was amazing thai food . i got the take out and thought it was mediocre . i got the thom kom gai ( ? ) - the traditional coconut soup and they did n't add my chicken . the broth was rich and delicous , but i wanted my chicken ! i also got the chicken panang and it was primarily loaded with bamboo shoots and very little chicken . i '' ll give it another shot because of the feedback i 've received from others though .	4215
0	great ambience , okay service , boring food . food was typical `` fusion , '' heavy on the pseudo-chinese influence , kind of like a thai-inspired pf chang 's . definitely not terrible but i wo n't go back .	4215
0	gorgeous restaurant , but the food was mediocre . i got the kung pow beef , which was quite bland . the egg drop soup tasted like the smell of chlorine and was very gelatinous , although not many places make it brothy ( like i like it ! ) . ehh . i really wanted to like this place . i may come back to try some sushi and look at the decor .	4215
0	the server was nice , but the chicken in both mine and my wife 's dishes ( both were different except for chicken ) tasted funny . we told the waiter and the cook . we did n't eat the meal but were charged full price . never again .	4215
0	we used to go here all the time . we loved this restaurant , although expensive , it was the best asian food close by . last night we got an order to go . food tasted terrible , food was n't cooked all the way , another meal was burnt , we hate to say this , but we did not like the new cook or the new menu .	4215
0	the food was not good at all . both my mother and i left most of our food on the plate . the waitress did not inquire whether we enjoyed food or if there were any problems . would never return .	4215
0	yuk ! i 've had lunch there but never dinner . tom kha gai was passable but if there was chicken in there it was in the broth . mongolian beef was a pile of mush . how does beef get mushy ? ? so little flavor i added soy sauce and a healthy dose of chili oil . the brown rice looked and tasted like white rice cooked in dirty water . do n't even think about the lemongrass stir fry . it was gritty and tasteless . save you money ... awful ! !	4215
0	i used to come here a lot , it was my favorite asian place in scottsdale . today was horrible the service was very very slow . we waited a long time to order food , then to receive our food then to get our check . i ordered my usually favorite which was the kung pao beef . the peanuts tasted spoiled and the beef was sour . just the whole experience was so disapointing .	4215
0	dryer than any other asian food i 've had in my life . had the chicken and broccoli and was god awful . took forever to chew 1 piece .	4215
0	i 've tried this place twice now and i 'm not impressed . the general tao 's chicken is dry and flavorless , despite having thick sauce all over it . the sweet & sour chicken was mostly just vegetables , very little chicken for an entree . the eggrolls were ok , but i had a couple bites that tasted like freezer burn . too bad because it 's so close to where we live . wo n't be back .	4215
0	the food and service was fantastic the first time we went . i went in last night and while waiting in line , i decided to go to the bathroom . it was beyond atrocious . you ca n't tell me that some employee there had n't seen it like this . i turned around and left . i will never , ever eat there again nor will i ever recommend it again . extremely unacceptable .	4215
0	the highlight of my meal was the lemongrass iced tea ... which was n't even that superb to being with . i understand what tottie is trying to do here , but the execution is just blah . my steamed pork egg roll was dry and more stuffed with lettuce than anything , the peanut sauce did n't even soften it up . the sushi was mediocre and honestly forgettable . the 2nd star is for ambience , since it was pretty strategically lit and set up . i dunno , i was n't really impressed and probably wo n't return again , but then again maybe tottie 's is n't my cup of tea .	4215
0	the receptionist was horribly rude . i came in to order take out and was treated just horribly . there are many other places i will bring my buisness to from now on and i will not recommend this restaurant to anyone . get some manners young lady !	4215
0	waited 20 min for a menu , there are a bunch of kids running this place . i asked for a menu 6 times . as i walked out i told the host i never got a menu , he said sorry have a good night . i wo n't be going back .	4215
0	used to be our favorite place to come but not anymore , the tom yum koong soup tasted horrible , also the lard-salad was very bad , very disappointed . the atmosphere is changing , totally slow for a saturday . i feel like there something change with the ownership or chef .	4215
0	this place is extremely hit or miss . my date and i went after always smelling the greatness on our way to volleyball , and were both disgusted by our meals . do not purchase the beef and zucchini or shrimp panang . both are not worth feeding to a rat . the crab rolls as an appetizer should just be thrown in the trash ... . so terrible and basically stuffing your face with mint and a skin-like wrapper . our friends even recommend certain dishes , but agree you can definitely go wrong at this place . i have been told to try the pad thai . be weary of everything else .	4215
0	the food is ok , but i have experienced better asian food . my sweet & sour was way to sweet , and my fried rice just seemed cold and stale . the edamame was greasy and did n't seem fresh at all . i doubt i 'll come back here again , except they are open on sundays and it 's hard to find a restaurant open on sundays .	4215
0	loved the atmosphere and great customer service , but the food was bland ( at best ) and the prices are too high .	4215
0	not a good experience . like going to the dmv for lunch . apparently it is called asian fusion because the food was a fusion of both tasteless and salty . the art was cool at least .	4215
0	i need to add another star to my review . after expressing my disappointment in the service at tottie 's , the owners replied to my email and acknowledged my issues . it is not often the owners take the time to read their yelp issues . i am guessing they do care and will try to address the service issues going forward . i understand it is impossible to be on your game 100 % of the time , but have created an environment where we are all food industry critics . let 's face it , it is expensive to go out to eat , so we expect a lot !	4215
0	ordered the red curry today . it was n't red . did n't taste the same , either . not too bad , but lots of undercooked veggies and not much overcooked chicken . it was soupy , not thick like curry . that 's a new thing . tom-ka-gai was excellent , though , as always . but it had a hair in it . that 's not too cool , but not such a big deal either . it 's boiling hot . and no need to floss !	4215
0	i was very disappointed with this place . the egg drop soup smelled like a wet dog and looked pretty gross too . i could n't even bring myself to try it . the egg rolls were ok , they could have been more crunchy . the fried rice was decent . i got the panang chicken curry and the flavor was pretty good . i wo n't be back here . there are way better places around for thai or asian food .	4215
0	i have gone to this place many times over the years and never had a bad experience until today . i always ask for `` no msg '' because i am highly allergic . today my waitress forgot to tell the kitchen about the msg and i got very ill after eating . i mean so ill that i almost had to call the ambulance ! very bad ! and the service was also very slow . i am done with tottie 's !	4215
0	great location , good egg rolls , bad service . we were asked how spicy on a scale of 7 and were told that 3 is mild . i got a 3 and my friend a 4 . both dishes were so hot and spicy , we could n't eat ! the waitress noticed and did n't offer anything until she brought our check and by then , we just wanted to leave . also , when waitress brought my friend her drink , the waitress commented , `` it 's good ! i know , i tried it ! '' guess that explains everything . she did seem a bit too `` happy '' . will not return .	4215
1	very accommodating staff and clean room . my room included a mini fridge and microwave , unlike some of the other reviewers . typical hampton inn perks ; delicious coffee round the clock , warm cookies at check in , comfy beds , and waffles in the morning . if you want coffee , i would advise going to the lobby , the in room maker seems a little angry and spurted hot coffee and water about a foot.. after entering my room , i found that the ac unit was very noisy , and possibly broken , when i told the front desk , i was given a new room immediately ! so thankful !	4217
1	clean , spacious room with an efficient layout . the breakfast is good and included western omelets when i was there . the check in staff were welcoming and helpful . there is a small gym by the lobby . the parking is plentiful surrounding the building . if you ca n't a spot near the entrance , i suggest checking in and then parking by one of the other entrances .	4217
1	great location clean fresh smelling rooms quiet awesome free breakfast i prefer staying here instead of hilton downtown	4217
0	not my best experience at hampton inn : noisy , noisy , noisy ... . you could hear every door on the floor open and close ... when you flushed the toilet , you would think a hurricane was whipping through the room and the pillows , well let 's just say they did n't offer much comfort . usually am pretty pleased with hampton 's but this one rates very low on the totem pole .	4217
0	disappointing as a hampton inn . i am loyal to hampton inns because you know what you are going to get , but not in this case . poor signage , weird location in a bit of a valley , and a bit shabby . my room had an ac unit that barely worked , bath towels you could practically see through , and the tv remote looked like it had been through many a rough party . nice staff , but simply not up to par for hampton inns and i have stayed at dozens across the country during my business travels . ok , but as i said disappointing for a hampton inn .	4217
0	service is good.facility is horrible.out of date.most stuff are very old and not comfortable.definitly wo n't choose this location hampton inn anymore.stayed in hampton inn for multiple location.this facility is very bad.if you are searching some comfortable hotel staying experience.this is not the one.if just a stay only , it might be ok.still customer service is great .	4217
1	it can be hard to find a good chinese restaurant , and after moving out to arizona from the other side of the country , i was a little afraid of trying out a new place to get my chinese food from , but this one was pretty awesome ! the food was delicious , and the restaurant was clean . the waitress was really nice and attentive . really on top of her game , offering refills when they were needed . i 'd highly recommend checking it out !	4218
1	thank you yelpers for getting us here ... my husband is not fond of take-out joints and presuming this place to be one of that kind we always drove past this ... one fine afternoon , my daughter insisted to eat fried rice and so we landed up here . i must say , a very small yet decent place . calming ambiance , great food , great price and good portion size . i would definitely recommend this place for dine-in and take-out .	4218
1	i/we eat in or get takeout at new asian kitchen at least once a month . have been going there for many years and have always had a great meal . the food ( in my opinion ) is fantastic ! very reasonably priced . whenever we go to the drive-in movies , we always stop at new asian kitchen and grab takeout to eat prior to the movie starting . lunch specials are tasty and great price ! love the food ! love the prices ! friendly people too !	4218
1	my new favorite chinese food place for lunch ! ! saw a picture of the pork lo mein on yelp so i decided to give my favorite chinese food dish a try and it was perfect here , i love the veggies they put into their lo mein like zucchini , carrots , white onions , green onions , mushrooms and of course cabbage . also want to mention the fact that their egg rolls are n't over powered with chinese 5 spice which gives them an almost cinnamon taste to it , these egg rolls are perfect !	4218
1	my family and i love this place ! we come here every time we want chinese take out . they have excellent customer service and their food tastes great . we usually get lo mein , orange chicken , white rice , fried rice and beef and broccoli . better than usually getting panda express .	4218
1	first trying this place .pretty dam good i must say food has lots of flavor definitely comeing back again . but it 's going to be awhile cause the portion where so big	4218
1	loved it ! food was great . service was decent . loved the twice cooked chicken and pot stickers . family friendly and prices were decent too !	4218
1	fantastic food , quick service and ridiculous portions . this place is absolutely fantastic and worth the drive up from tempe .	4218
1	great food , quick , friendly and clean ! been looking for a good chinese restaurant close to us and we feel we finally found it .	4218
1	was looking for a new chinese place to eat since the last place gave us food poisoning . this place was pretty good ! they 're egg rolls were really blan though : ( but the pineapple chicken , egg fried rice , chicken lo mein were great ! we also tried the dry sautéed beef chow fun ... it needed a little more flavor though . i walked in and did takeout , the place is very small and good luck on getting through on the phone ! lol when i was there they just kept letting the phone ring over and over . they took care of the people dining in and doing takeout first . also they have coupons on their website !	4218
1	only been there twice but i have been very satisfied both times i 've been there . the best eggdrop soup i 've ever had and the kung pao was amazing as well !	4218
1	love this place . we found this little gem online one night and ordered delivery . well a couple months later an we are still ordering from there . we like the dinner combos and have tried all of them ; they are all really good . the appetizers are good as well ( we like the egg rolls and crab puffs ) . have n't been to the actual location but delivery is great .	4218
0	not sure where these other reviewers have eaten chinese food before but the food here is mediocre at best asked for pot of tea and was brought a lot of tea with one lipton tea bag every or be place its `` oolong '' or green tea the fried rice was bland and no vegetables not coming back	4218
0	got to my house in less than a half an hour which was great ! i ordered general tso and sesame chicken . they had both tasted like a tv dinner .	4218
0	before tonight 's meal , i would 've easily given 4 stars . however , our meal ( while delicious ) , gave me horrible food poisoning . i had the lemon chicken , egg fried rice and a few crab puffs so not quite sure who the actual culprit is . i hate to leave a bad review , but i wo n't give it a chance again .	4218
0	warning , the food tasted rewarmed and old . the fried rice was brown , dry with no sign of egg or anything else that may have helped identify this as an authentic chinese food . if you want chinese food and this is the only place open , keep driving . that is honestly how all four of us felt after dining here .	4218
0	omg ! the worst chinese take out in town . i ordered sun devil chicken & chicken lo mien . well the chicken was chewy . icky.v in fact i gagged . its was liked rubber . my daughters also thought the chicken was nasty . never again . eww !	4218
0	first time here ; tonight for dinner . the service leaves little to be desired . our server was n't pleasant at all . he acted as though he was doing us a favor . the food was n't bad . i certainly would n't call it stellar but it was eatable . i think we will continue to look !	4218
0	the food was tasty the delivery guy rude . he actually demanded a tip and when i informed him that the person paying declined he literally almost asked to come in and speak to them .	4218
0	we ordered take out here tonight . we got egg fried rice , pork fried rice , chicken lo mein , mongolian beef and 2 egg rolls . my daughter liked her egg fried rice . but she was the only one who liked her food . everything else was either flavorless or mushy . the egg roll in my opinion was gross .	4218
0	i ordered food tonight for my husband and i . we 've ordered from here many times . the chicken had no sauce on it and our soup did n't come with the chips i asked for . i called to see if we could come pick up sauce but did n't get that far because the incredibly rude lady on the phone was disgusting . she stated `` no you did n't say that i took your order ! '' in fact , a man took my order . i had to hang up the phone because of how she was speaking . not okay for a neighborhood business at all ! ! !	4218
0	someone needs to tell these losers what a wok is . the broccoli and beef dish i ordered was obviously boiled in water . the sauce was simply poured over the ingredients after they were boiled to the point where they were cooked into mush .	4218
0	when going here for lunch my food was sub-par . it tasted like leftover food and had very little flavor . i did not come in expecting much and i left dissatisfied .	4218
0	basic chinese food nothing special . i 've had better ( see my reviews ) . sorry will not be back .	4218
1	i ca n't say enough great things about this company and the crew they have . i arrived at my business today to find the sprinkler system had busted and the entire 1500 sq ft store was flooded . within 30 minutes of my phone call , a full crew was at my office starting the clean up process . the entire crew was extremely friendly and very hard workers . so happy i contacted them a+++ ! !	4219
1	called and spoke to karen at absolute flood response ... she was extremely helpful i explained to herwhen i noticed the water pouring from my washing machine . skyler and joel came out immediately explained the whole process in great detail from start to finish.. they then began the drying process immediately..edgar romero came out and met with adjuster and help me through the whole process.. thanks again for an amazing job .. i will always recommend absolute flood response ...	4219
1	these guys should be called absolute best people to work with ! super professional group of people who know what their doing and how to get it done with no bull in between . i highly recommend them to anyone in need of ventilation or flood work . they certainly have a repeat customer in me .	4219
0	stay away from this company ! besides being liers they charge an arm and a leg . i would call other companies before calling this one .	4219
0	absolute flood response claimed that i did not give them a check for my insurance deductible . my insurance agent called me up and told me that absolute flood response did not include my payment in their bill to allstate insurance . wow . i have the payment form and a copy of my check from my bank to prove it .	4219
0	this company is horrible ! never use them ! after getting deposit , they do n't return your call , your email and do n't do anything but overcharge you !	4219
1	avanti green has been cleaning our home for over a year now . we have been happy with every visit . it was important for me to clean our home with eco friendly products , especially with children & pets . the crew is always very friendly and prompt when they arrive . another company that we used sent different people every visit , not avanti ! we always see the same faces . avanti even offers carpet cleaning , which we have used & have been very happy with the results ! i love coming home to a house that is fresh & clean .	4220
1	i had avanti green to clean a condo today and the team did an excellent job ! we had melissa and antonia and they were professional , friendly and always on task . they came right on time too . everything was cleaned thoroughly and was smelling so fresh . they even made the end of the toilet paper rolls and the paper towels into flowers ! great work .	4220
1	i usually clean my own home . but after living here 8 years the house needed a good deep cleaning . so i called avanti and they came and cleaned the house and carpet . i am very happy with the outcome ! ! they cost more than most other places but i really feel i got my money 's worth ! !	4220
0	they may be good but they do n't return phone calls . been trying a few days and the same person says they will call back . so much empty promises . if you run a business please learn to return phone calls otherwise do n't bother .	4220
0	this review is for their non-responsiveness . they do n't answer emails , calls or requests for quotes via yelp . based on reviews - really wanted to give them a shot , but they are very unprofessional or simply do n't care for the business ( which is a vegas thing i have seen with many other companies ; ca n't be bothered ) .	4220
0	i had repeatedly tried to contact this company to get a quote to clean my home . i managed to speak to someone once , and was told the manager would call me back and give me a quote . i never received any calls or emails from them . they have lost my business due to their non communication , i have since found someone else who is more reliable .	4220
1	it sounds like other yelpers are n't too impressed with the tula faculties , which , fortunately , i 've never had to use because i live down the street . i can , however , speak to the quality of the yoga classes . the studio , the instructors and the classes are all great . i love the high beamed ceilings and the relaxing scents .	4221
1	i 've attended a large handful of tula yoga classes to date and i 've always left feeling great . while the service at the front desk is slightly abrupt ( see other reviews ) , the place is clean , relaxing and really makes you feel at home . while i generally go to grace 's class ( grace is an incredible yoga teacher - very attentive , knowledgable and helpful ) , i 've been to a few others who are equally as good . i really do love it here .	4221
1	this studio went thru some changes of instructors a few months back ... so . other than this transition period , it 's always an amazing studio . so many classes ... power flow classes for those who want a more intense session vs hot hatha classes for beginners or those focusing on stretching . leaving most classes leaves me feeling great	4221
1	i 've had 2 facial appointments here at tula ( online vouchers ) . enjoyed them immensely . started hot yoga at this studio . it is so calming & beautiful inside . beware that it gets busy on the weekends & evenings .	4221
0	came here with the intention of trying another class . the service at the front was so downright bad i did n't even want to stay for the class . i will try again , but i really do n't see how the attitude came about in the first place .	4221
0	the front desk staff is not friendly or helpful and are very unwelcoming ! tried 3 times to go , and could n't make it past the front desk due to the rudeness of the front desk staff ! if i 'm going to be paying that much for classes , i 'd expect some courtesy from the employees ... .its yoga after all ...	4221
0	i do n't know what the big deal is with this studio ... rooms are small ( one of them actually have all their props in it , occupying a good chunk of the room ) , staff is n't friendly and classes are alright . had a treatment at the spa and it was good . i personally prefer studios like yogatree and moksha .	4221
0	laughably bad . booking this appointment was brutal . i could n't get through to reception and left several voicemails before anyone returned my call . normally , i would just move on to the next spa , but i had a travelzoo voucher . i got a seaweed wrap and a massage . she left me alone with the wrap instead of massaging my hands , feet , head . afterwards , she gave me this tiny little towel and sent me off to shower in the communal locker room .	4221
1	always come here when i feel down on myself and need a good motorboat ...	4222
1	love all the women there . they are very nice and sexy and i love the dj 's , just hate the management . yaz and angela are so rude and down right terrible people .	4222
1	great place . i love it . i had my best friends bachelor party there . he did n't want to leave , calling it his favorite place . if you go , see a dancer named india . super hot , girl next door type	4222
1	cynthia d is the type woman that destroys the experience of a strip club . ooo a girl touched your boyfriend 's shoulder . get over it you 're insecure . hustlers is an upscale strip club with good looking girls and good food . a girl came up to my boyfriend and practically sat in his lap . i think it was great the girls did n't feel intimidated to stop over while i was sitting there . also they have poles that go all the way up to the ceiling so the girls get a little crazy on the poles very entertaining .	4222
1	daddy hit this jizz-joint after 12 hours of steady day drinking on a quest for rock bottom . would n't recommend walking , unless your wish in life represents the shower scene from american history x , spring for a cab . the talent was outstanding ! i left a piece of my heart in cleaveland that night with a sweet young gal named chrissy ( dibs ! ) , along with about 400 bucks . minor hand play in the private rooms was to my delight . cheers boys !	4222
1	best club in cleveland for beautiful girls and great service . open late , until 4:00am on weekends so it 's a good place to stop in after an event or night out . food is good , and drinks are strong and decently priced for a strip club .	4222
0	place is average at best . creamers are sloppy . fish tacos are the tits , but do n't overcome the creamers . felt like i was in lorain and not a metropolis on the rebound . would rather stuff my face in the creamers from christies any day of the week ... plus no tassels .	4222
0	terrible strip club ! the girls half assed the dancing & the food was awful ! the manager refused to take something off of my bill because the waitress who disappeared for 30 minutes said i ate it , but i did n't ! the staff do not work together either ! i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy ! just bad ! ! ! stay away ! ps : if you do test your luck , do not order the steak marsala , wings , or mozzarella sticks !	4222
0	i was visiting my family from ohio and went with my brother to this place . being from miami i expected a level of interest . instead i got the worst experience of my life ... the girls look like the they came directly from lorain county trailer parks . the staff was co.pletely rude never be back again .	4222
0	great girls great music . walked in at 1:50 am and got refused service by the short male bar manager after being ignored for 20 minutes but paid $ 10 cover ... .and for what the `` bikini dancers '' after drinking hours ? otherwise great atmosphere . considering i 'm industry this review says a lot more than that pissed off customer with a hair up their ass .	4222
0	women were pretty and inviting but management sucks . we arrived at 150 am and were denied service by the rude male bar manager . surprisingly they have late night hours and the food is what is expected . hospitality is needed by management , they were very unaccommodating .	4222
0	if sunday is there only good night then they should be bankrupt by now . this place is empty and all the girls have no ass or boobs ... .the 2 women with ass ( yes they are black ) disappeared into the private hallway and never returned ( um wonder what happened to them ) anyway it 's just super slow and not worth the $ 5 charge or actually $ 10 for my girl and i ! ! ! !	4222
1	i 've had their `` cleveland 's '' breakfast many times and it is perfect every time . the best eggs and sausage breakfast in town . i do n't know how they do it , but their scrambled eggs are the best i 've ever had . i 've tried to duplicate it at home without success . i get the same thing every time i go . scrambled eggs with sausage , potatoes and toast with a side of guinness . yum !	4223
1	went here because my girlfriend loves greek food . there is n't a whole lot of greek restaurants in madison so we thought we 'd try this . it did not disappoint , it had a very authentic feel and the food was delicious . if you 're looking for greek food in madison this is definitely the place to go .	4223
1	gyros were excellent . perfectly juicy and seasoned . topping it with a fried egg was just icing on the cake . i 'm trying to think of a reason not to give it 5 stars , but i just ca n't . nothing much to tell you other than that plaka taverna undoubtedly serves the best gyro in madison .	4223
1	this is the easiest review in madison . the food , service , and atmosphere are all on point . they take what they have and put out a great product at the right price . check out their menu , and if they have something you like , you 'll like it here . protip : go on a nice day in the summer and sit in the back patio area .	4223
1	yummy gyros and the cucumber sauce is a good as other yelpers have said . prices are reasonable , portions are generous and the interior is super-cozy . we 'll definitely be returning- i 'm looking forward to eating my way through the menu !	4223
1	today we had a great breakfast at plaka ! everyone in the place looked happy to be here- there was one fellow waiting on tables who acted resentful about being at work but his snappy irritated attitude did not do anything major to us personally ( though it took one star off the five possible stars he could have helped earn for his team ) . we enjoyed 2 plaka breakfasts and 2 breakfast sandwiches which were quick to arrive and really tasty . bloody marys with local chaser ales were goood ! ! ! where else but in madison can you get a classy breakfast for 4 plus 3 bloody marys for $ 36 but in mad city ... ..	4223
0	i 'm only giving this place 2 stars as the people who run the place are the most unfriendly people i 've ever encountered . they seemed angry that they were busy . i tried to be nice and make small talk and they acted like they did n't even hear me . the food was average . the hummus was n't typical at all . it was chunky and did n't have a nice taste . i have eaten at the top greek restaurant in the world . i know good hummus . they should really be nice to the customers they get . madison is a small town and people will go elsewhere .	4223
0	once was enough for me . food and portions are decent , especially considering the price . the guy that runs the place ( owner maybe ) has zero customer service skills - sufficiently bad that i wo n't return . while every interaction he had with us was crude , the final one was the worst . the bill arrived with an order he double counted - he proceeded to argue about it with us until he finally conceded ( while never fully admitting fault ) that there were more plates than people on the bill . there 's no need to return .	4223
0	soooo meh ! the pancakes tasted like potatoes ! and the potatoes tasted like oil ! a fun interior , but the food i had was totally disappointing .	4223
0	spanikopita mushy with zero flakiness and little flavor . seemed microwaved . lambmeat used for lamb kebabs fatty , spongy , unchewable and underseasoned . waitress had an attitude to top it all off . if you want good greek food , avoid this place .	4223
0	i 've always wanted to stop in ; the spray painted sign has been piquing my interest for some time . finally , i went for brunch yesterday , and was underwhelmed . the inside is cozy , with about 12 tables and a small bar . i had the gyros omelet , which was pretty bland and would n't have been edible except for the cucumber sauce . the bloody mary had so many solid spices that it was like drinking silt - kind of gross . service was okay - they were friendly .	4223
0	food is disgusting . the veggies are overdone and spanikopita is soggy . the owners verbally abuse their employees and have done so in front of customers . stay away .	4223
1	incredible ! try the chicken tikka and the shami skewer ! home made hot salsa is on the table , and the naan bread was freshly baked to order ! i will definitely eat here again .	4224
1	this place serves delicious and healthy meals . big portions and fresh bread . i usually get either the chicken kebob or the shami kebob . cant go wrong with either one . dont forget to ask for the dinner so you get the delicious rice with your meal	4224
0	this place is a bit too pricey and expensive , other afghan joints are a but cheaper than here .	4224
0	bad product burnt not a clean place long times to get orders everything is a fail the product lacks flavor really unfortunate was hoping for better this place is a dime a dozen you can do a better barbeque at grocery store sad place and products	4224
1	pretty nice for the price ... staff is nice worked hard for us ... people living here are hard working nice people and its called siegel suites now	4225
1	nice place to stay room is a great size for me . could use a bigger refrigerator and wish i had more cooking space	4225
0	i would call this either the la cucharacha motel or buy my drugs here motel . the place is dirty , cockroach infested , a central drug corridor and the most lying little bitches ever working the front office . they will say one thing to you telling me they do background checks of their potential guests for felonies , etc . then you find out that they just let whoever they want stay there as long as either the price is right or some guy gives them a compliment . we were told to remove our other comment because it was damaging to the hotel . no we will not remove the comments . fix the place . it 's disgusting .	4225
0	do n't let the word suites fool you , a better name for this place is roach motel , this place is over run by roaches and drug dealers . and carman at the front desk is not very friendly . this place use to be nice will never have relatives stay here again .	4225
1	i walked in ... .and we were able to get a reading right away . my boyfriend did a tarot card reading and everything seemed to be very accurate . i did a palm reading . i loved it . a few great things i did n't know were revealed and others were confirmed that i have been working on . i highly recommend this place . i have searched a lot over vegas . i 'll definetly be going back in the future ! ! !	4226
1	this was a great experience , i had the tarot cards and my palm read . everything she said was accurate and on point . every questioned i asked she answered with a great deal of explanation . i 'm in awe over the entire thing . i walked in not saying a word about myself . only thing she asked was what i wanted to get done . i told her and she started . i left the place feeling more positive and confident about myself and the decisions ill be making . id recommend this place . ill def be going again .	4226
1	i was nervous about going to a psychic but she was fabulous ! very intuitive ! i also felt very comfortable there and that was one of my fears . she was legit . i was visiting from slc utah and every time i come out here , even if passing by , i am coming back !	4226
1	i had a good experience . there was very positive and warm energy here . this was the real deal . no amateurs . my reader was wise , confident and insightful . i will be back .	4226
1	my 2 friends and i went there ... me , being the believer , them the skeptics . jazzmine was great . i think she nailed all 3 of us accurately ! the palm reading was very informative and gave me lots of detail . the tarot was good but have your 3 questions ready ... i was n't : ) all in all , we have not stopped talking about the experience and everyhing she told us . i would definately recommend ! : )	4226
1	i stoped by this place yesterday mostly because i been driving past it for years on my way to work . the place was very cool they have a lot of those new age psychic items i asked about their services . they offer several types of readings and chaka cleansing i went with the 15 min tarot card reading the owner read me herself i have to say i was very impressed with her reading i also asked about the chakra cleansing since i been looking for a place to do that and the price was reasonable for that so i went ahead and had that done as well and wow i feel so much lighter i will visit again	4226
1	i too felt very comfortable here . she was so kind and more than willing to answer questions . also , i too believe she 's legit , for any question i was answered on point as well as she saw things - like my stress and insomnia- as well as saw the trip i was planning ! i ca n't wait to visit lv to see her again !	4226
0	the lady gave me a reading for 5 min then started to pressure me , to buy candels and have reading from her	4226
0	a little more then disappointment . i double checked the hours online and on facebook before driving almost 40 mins to find out they were not open . ( hours were 12:30-6 today ) .	4226
0	started out okay as a couple 's tarot reading , then individual . we still are n't sure how a 1/2 hour between the two of us reading cost us $ 175 , but the high pressure sales to rid us of past life negativity for another $ 500 was offensive . skip this place .	4226
0	is this place ever open ? ? ? i made an . appointment and showed up and the place was closed during business hours ! then another time i came and closed as well i 'm thisnis very unprofessional ?	4226
0	i give this place 2 stars only because in the past jazzmine has been spot on but in the recent months i 've called to speak with her , her reading seemed more like a guess than anything . i 'm highly disappointed because i am a regular and i even tip when she asks . i did n't pay all that money for incorrect information .	4226
0	i 'd like to give more of a review but they were n't open . we drove all the way out to find the door locked . even tried to call but no answer . i hope everything 's okay !	4226
0	just got off the phone with a very rude receptionist named gina . i asked her what time they were open until today and she said 5:30pm when yelp says 6:00p . i went ahead and asked her about the mistake on yelp and she responded that actually 5:30p is when they had their last available appointment time . i told her i wanted to book it for 5:30p and she then abruptly rushed me off of the phone and told me there were no appointments available . maybe hire another receptionist to be representing your business ? that was absolutely awful !	4226
1	we have been using state farm , cie taylor agency for the past six months . our agent torrie tyler has been exceptional in servicing both our auto , and renters policies . i would highly recommend this agency to all of my friends and family .	4227
1	great customer service . angie was very friendly and helpful . she was able to answer all of my questions with no fuss and took time to explain everything to me . she treated me like a real person just not anther number or just another customer which is hard to find these days .	4227
1	i 've been a client of andrea 's for over a decade and i 've never even considered changing agents or insurance companies . she 's always professional , personable , and is quick to assist me anytime i need anything . ( that includes answering any stupid questions i throw at her . ) andrea never makes me feel like a client . speaking to her is always like talking to an old friend on the phone , and just so we 're clear , i only know her as a client . you 'd be hard-pressed to find a better insurance agent to take care of you .	4227
0	been a policy holder for 20 years but had to cancel due poor customer service . the iq level in that office is questionable along with not giving a flip about giving professional service . cie taylor is partially retired and the clowns are running her business in the ground .	4227
0	i have been with state farm for nearly 20 yrs . although the company as a whole is good , my local agent , cie taylor is very unsatisfactory . so much so that i switched agents recently . i was usually unable to speak to her when i called , having my questions redirected to a subordinate who usually could not answer my questions . on the rare occasions when cie did return my call , i found her aloof , dismissive and arrogant . there are too many other state farm agents in the area to tolerate this kind of treatment . choose another .	4227
0	do not go to this agency unless you want none of your claims handled correctly , to be overcharged , lied to & plain out rude	4227
1	the staff here are wonderful . i 've been having troubles with my mac lately , and they really help me a lot . i 've been happy with their service , and they symbolize the apple customer service standard	4228
1	kudos to illini tech center for providing honest service and advice . i brought in a cracked ipod touch , and while they were n't able to fix it there they provided me with the contact information for applecare . i came in here once before for a power supply issue , and they were very friendly .	4228
1	this is technically an `` authorized campus store '' as opposed to an apple-owned store . so , this location is a joint operation between uiuc and apple . even so , the service is exactly the same as you would find in an apple-owned store . this store has a full selection of macbooks , iphones , and other apple products . the service is fast and friendly , and they even allow you to make computer repair reservations online ! update ( 3/11/11 ) : the illini tech center carries macs , ipods , ipads , and software ( but not iphones ) . they are owned by illini media and are n't part of the university .	4228
0	laptop went in with a broken trackpad and came out with a broken display and logic board , each of which never had prior issues . they claimed both failures were my fault and refused to do any repairs until i paid $ 1400 , even though the original work was covered by warranty . their conceited employees also made me feel like i was an annoyance for simply being in their business and did the bare minimum throughout my entire experience .	4228
0	terrible . i brought in my mac to get the power supply checked out ( nothing wrong with the hd ) and they returned a computer with a completely corrupted hd . fortunately diskwarrior and half my weekend allowed me to repair the damage they did .	4228
0	they have most of the basics re : apple products , but the most lackluster employees i 've seen in a long time . the guy who `` helped '' us seemed so massively distracted by the phone call another employee was making ( i think via skype ) on an ipod touch , that he literally did n't hear us asking questions right next to him . it was very weird . his attention span lasted for about 40 seconds max . then again , i 'm used to la , where most ( if not all ) sales associates are wannabe actors . maybe i 'm just spoiled by their unnaturally sunny disposition and extra-attentiveness .	4228
1	very nice environment with friendly waitstaff . food was satisfactory , a pleasant evening .	4229
1	the best part about this restaurant is it 's location ! do n't get me wrong , the food is good too . probably not the best authentic chinese food that you can find in toronto , but it 's clean , offers good service , quality food at a fair price . i would absolutely visit this spot again .	4229
1	awesome new place that just opened up recently . my favourite dishes were their xiao long bao , pork belly bao and beef noodle soup . has a nice authentic shanghai style taste to it , will definitely come back .	4229
1	servers were very attentive and catered to our 2 yr old child , food was very tasty and was reasonable priced . clean attractive atmosphere .	4229
1	yes ! , giving this this place 5 stars . the food has the wow factor here , and even simple dishes such as chicken with broccoli have a different spin here . the shrimp curry actually had more shrimp than filler , the service here is excellent and the decor is clean and modern : ) great location too : ) if you are in the mood for western style chinese food but with a flavor infusion you really need to try this place out : )	4229
1	stopped in for a snack . i had the green onion pancake and tea . very nicely done . food quality was good as was the service .	4229
1	excellent ! we went here for first time since we were in town and the soup dumplings were amazing ! if we come back to toronto this will be a must stop ! highly recommend this place .	4229
0	not impressed . service was quick but our appetizer came last and our order was repeatedly confused- wrong dishes were delivered to our table twice . food was pretty good but not great . will definitely not go back .	4229
0	found bugs in my food and they did n't seem to care . waited 15 min for the waiter to come and then took another 15 min for the manager to come . i told them i did n't want the food anymore but they still ended up charging me regular price . never going back here again . service is crap , food is terrible , and it 's very expensive .	4229
0	very good reviews so i checked it out . not happy with service . i could tell the waitress was being pushed around by the manager too hard . waitress was the only one to speak to me the entire time despite having 10+ workers brushing my back while doing other things . food was decent . not great portions for $ 16 per person . seems like they got comfy or just assumed that someone coming in alone was a write-off . not worth the high price tag !	4229
0	the food is good , but they do not take amex card . if you pay us dollar in cash , the rate is 1:1 , i checked today 's exchange rate is 1 $ to 1:28 canada $ , i also gave tips . what a rip off !	4229
0	i ordered kungpao chicken on uber eat and only to find out there are two long hair underneath the chicken . truly disgusting . i swear to god .	4229
0	nothing really stands out about lee chen asian bistro . their food is okay , nothing special , and they are a little more pricey on a dish by dish basis than the average asian restaurant . tried the xiaolongbao and shu mai , both were below the normal dim sum standards . also had a rice dish , noodle dish , and chicken dish which were not too memorable . decor is nice , the actual restaurant is tucked away sort-of underground . service was a tad slow . overall was okay but do n't think i would go again .	4229
0	ordered pork and green beans , and there was no pork . chicken and broccoli had zero flavour . you can get 10x better chinese food for half the price . just so disappointed .	4229
1	after having tried about every other pizza place around , i made it to noce and it 's awesome . it 's so awesome that i stopped to write this review . the pizza is fresh and beautiful , yeah they do n't do custom orders but they have great choices and if you like a crisp yet chewy crust this place ca n't be beat . i have now tried 3 different pies and still loving it . if you have not tried this place i highly recommend it .	4230

0	this place will last 2 seconds down here . hey , lets open a pizza place by crust and edisons . been trying to call and phone is continuously busy . : ) nope . wow . what za . we 're totally crushing on them not answering their phones . no omissions or additions in our best interet . thanks for knowing what we like or do n't like . ahahhahh . weirdo	4230
0	came here for the `` amazing '' vegan nirvana pizza . first , we called to see if we could simply remove the onions ( as we get sick from them ) and got a simple `` no . '' we decide to get it anyways and pick them off , and our first bite is a raw , pure piece of pizza dough ! i can actually still form shapes with the dough , it 's so completely raw . chewy to the point of spitting it out , easily the worst pizza i 've ever had in my life . burnt crust and raw middle . incredibly disappointed ! waste of money . will never be coming back .	4230
1	this hotel has a very elegant feel to it . i was here for an organization conference and it was a lot of fun . the hotel rooms were very nice , as well as the lobby and seminar rooms . their ball room is also very nice . it is close to downtown for easy access for the night life . ( i know because i 'm from madison ) . our organization made it a little rowdy but it was still fun . the staff is also excellent and responded to our requests and needs very fast and with courtesy . i will absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone who is coming to madison .	4231
1	i did n't have much of a view from my room on the club level . however , the facility was clean and quiet .	4231
1	good hotel ! friendly staff , the restaurant in the hotel is good too . i wish our shower had more pressure , other than that great place	4231
1	i think the place is great for the price point , but i got it on priceline ( for around $ 50/night ) . it 's a little out of the way if you do n't have a car and want to hang out downtown , but the front desk was super willing to arrange shuttles , and there 's always badger cab . the restaurant is n't bad and the front desk and cleaning staff were super friendly . the workout room and pool are nice enough to make me actually want to exercise . decor is strange in some ways , but its super clean and new-ish . i would happily stay here again .	4231
1	i was very happy with my short stay here . our room was deliciously cold when we walked in from the humid august air . the staff was friendly . our bed was comfortable . i had ample pillow choices . it was quiet and i slept through the night . very clean . my one complaint was `` where was the robe '' ? . i could not find it anywhere . hotels need robes .	4231
1	friendly staff , clean cozy room , booked last minute , free shuttle to town . i would say well stocked bar but my husband is a booze snob & he says semi-well stocked ; )	4231
1	great bargain on a fine hotel . nicely appointed rooms with large lg flat screen tvs and heaps of pillows on the beds and fluffy comforter . when i was here , they offered a foursquare check in promotion of free vip lounge access getting you food and drinks in the evenings and a nice breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs and muffins with canadian bacon . yum !	4231
1	it would have reviewed a 5 star but there was not a free continental breakfast . other than that , extremely fluffy pillows , comfortable bed . the room was clean , tv could be updated due to streaks on screen while it was on . nice sized pool , could be a little warmer though considering it was about 10 degrees outside . hot tub was great and relaxing . breakfast and room service was way over priced considering its $ 115+ for a room . a great getaway for an over the night stay .	4231
1	got the room for 70 bucks . staff was polite , room is nice . parking is free and convienent .	4231
1	great stay while i was in wisconsin labor day weekend to visit a friend . rates were very reasonable and staff were all very friendly . i like the free shuttle service to downtown by all the bars , restaurants , etc . highly recommend !	4231
1	*the staff is incredibly polite , friendly and helpful . *the pool and hot tub area are clean and inviting . *they have a really nice and updated fitness area . *the room was very clean and the hallways even smelled fresh . *i look forward to staying at this sheraton , when i 'm in madison .	4231
1	the bedding was amazing ! ! ! tv is too slow as in every sheraton . too much chlorine in the pool ... ... the service and rooms make up for it . try staying on a private floor ... .the club lounge has complimentary breakfast and happy hour snacks ! worth the extra	4231
1	clean rooms , nice lobby , close to olin park , alliant ctr , on the bike trial , just off beltline ... ... couldnt ask for a better stay at the price paid .	4231
1	i wish i could rate the staff separately from the room . staff gets 5+ stars . everyone helped me around , talked to me about everything and anything i could ever want to know about madison and made getting around an unfamiliar city very good . the room itself was okay . the pillows were very squishy and offered no support . the bed was comfortable though . there was no refrigerator , which seems odd for a city that is so foodie friendly ( and has amazing dairy stuff available to you ) . so really 3 stars for the hotel , but the staff earned it an extra star .	4231
1	i had to stay here for an extended period of time . the staff was friendly and knowledgable , and the beds are extremely comfortable . the bar downstairs is good to unwind if you are on business and the it has an amazing view for jogging along the lakeside in the mornings . my only complaint was the lack of lighting in the rooms . reading documents is difficult for my eyes due to the lampshades .	4231
1	we stayed here for a night using priceline . our experience was amazing ! they provided us with a free bottle of champagne for our anniversary . the hotel was clean , staff was friendly and we were really close to downtown . they even have a free shuttle to take you downtown on the weekends . overall , awesome experience !	4231
1	pros : decent location , clean rooms , free wi-fi , updated amenities , pool , fitness center cons : could hear everything through the walls to another room , temperature was difficult to set accurately , with the exception of the heartland grill , there are no other restaurants close by . overall no major complaints , but for a sheraton i expected more .	4231
0	arrived at 11pm to be told that they oversold the hotel and sent us elsewhere further away . the manager on duty said its there policy to overbook the rooms . it looked unclean and the staff clueless . avoid at all costs .	4231
0	stayed here 3 nights . rooms are very dated and really need a facelift , had to call for towels & toilet paper ( although they were delivered promptly ) . desk staff were just ok , bartender was rude . they advertise a shuttle that runs a continuous loop to hot spots but it is limited hours . was told shuttle was not available both times we asked so we finally gave up & probably spent an extra $ 100 on taxis . no mini frig or microwave in room which is pretty standard for rooms in this $ $ range . just not good .	4231
0	an absolute shit hole . lobby smells like rotten wood . room is dirty and half the outlets do n't work . had to move a side table to charge my cell . the climate control system is really load and wakes me up anytime it turns on . nothing in walking distance and hotel shuttle is not reliable . i have to come back to madison in two weeks and will not stay here .	4231
0	this review is for the service i received at the hotel . i stayed for the weekend at this hotel and had a pair of new and expensive earrings stolen from me . i am absolutely positive i left them on the bathroom sink ( i hesitated to do this in the first place ) and when i returned after the maid service came in to clean they were gone . i looked everywhere and they were definitely gone . i called the operator and was told that i would get a call back immediately about the situation . i never received a call and will never return back to the hotel . hide your stuff so it does n't get stolen too !	4231
0	i attended a meeting in this property 's first floor space , the inspiration ballroom . the complimentary coffee and ice water were appreciated . but , the noisy air handling system was a huge distraction . the constant background humming was punctuated by loud vibrations every minute or two , ruining the ambiance and suitability for business meetings . on the plus side , parking is far more convenient than any of the downtown hotels .	4231
0	gross is all i can say ! ! ! ! had to stay here for business but wow has it gone down hill ! ! room was filthy when i came up ! ! sheets had spots ! ! flies everywhere ! cake all over the rug ! ! windows to the front doors were filthy coming into the hotel ! elevators were gross too ! looked like a motel 6 ! ! ! go downtown ! !	4231
0	not happy at all with my stay this time . i have stayed here multiple times for work but this time i was placed in a small wing of rooms off the conference rooms . rooms 200 's . when you open the door to the wing there was a strong smell of sewer gases that went all the way into the rooms . a hotel like this should never have this issue . for two days in a row the room was not cleaned appropriately . the beds were half made and towels were not replaced . never seen anything like this . very bad performance sheraton .	4231
0	unfortunately , this review reflects primarily on the manager on duty during our stay at the sheraton : robin holm . not only was she unreliable and difficult to communicate with , she lied to us and was very rude , using incredibly unprofessional language . she was totally unapologetic for a mistake that she made , which forced us to rearrange our entire afternoon . her behavior , in conjunction with a crappy hotel location , makes us never want to stay here again . choose the hilton ! ! much better location and competent staff !	4231
0	i 'm really sorry to say that this was the worst spg hotel i 've ever stayed at . madison is known for having very lovely , friendly people but we did not feel comfortable or welcomed at this hotel at all . pretty much nothing about our hotel stay went right -- we could never book the shuttle , the food was terrible , it always took at least half an hour for a taxi to arrive to the hotel , the rooms were very bare bones and not well-cleaned , and the staff was super rude and unprofessional . i can not in good conscience recommend this hotel to anyone .	4231
0	the lobby is deceiving , it looks like it would be a really nice hotel until you get to the rooms . hallways were dim and brown felt super uncomfortable just walking to the room . once in the room it is dated . popcorn ceiling , miss matching furniture , mini fridge on the floor and no microwave . went to iron a shirt and the ironing board was stained and the iron was broken . got into bed and there was n't even a fitted sheet on it ! such an unfortunate visit . wo n't be back .	4231
0	i 'd go as far as to say 2 stars is generous . a very dated hotel , very limited services . 1 of the 2 stars is for the club lounge which was half decent . .5 is the location , for my purpose it was perfectly located . .5 the front desk attendants were friendly.. i 'm certain there are better places to stay in madison as it is a wonderful city . i stayed true to my spg platinum status and gave it a try , however i will not be back .	4231
0	i 'm pretty sure i have n't stayed in a hotel this dated in decades . mattress : old , soft , terrible bathroom : yoga positions required to reach the tp behind the toilet bathroom sink : seriously , came to *just* above my knees . would be a good height for a five year old . tv : worked occasionally front desk staff : did n't even bother to look up when you came through the front doors . my son has just started school at the university of wisconsin . we will be back many times -- but we wo n't be back to this hotel .	4231
0	very small double bed room . small full-size beds that are very hard you can hear springs snap/bend . bathroom does n't seem that clean and is very outdated . staff friendly , but this is one of the worst hotels i 've ever stayed at .	4231
0	the hotel is dirty . the halls smell like wet dog everything is dusty . our room smelled like bo and a $ $ . the chairs and sheets had stains . ewww . they did move us to a different room which smelled better . the staff was nice enough but that did n't make up for the hotel quality . i would n't return to this hotel .	4231
0	nice staff , boring location away from the downtown area , nowhere to walk to . the hallways are depressing as hell , no mini-fridge in the room . we ended up leaving here a day early to stay at the double tree downtown . sucks . : / i would not go back here .	4231
0	- the heat did not work in the room - no shampoo - feces stains on towels - room looks like it is from 1986 - outlets not working - smoking area for customers / employees in entrance - no recycling . odd since i was given a monologue on arrival about how this is a 'green ' hotel . was this just another word for saving housekeeping costs ? i gave an additional star for the employees that do what they can under this horrible management .	4231
0	not impressed . -rooms really need updating and a deep cleaning . our room had two holes in the ceiling , not to mention a blood stain on the shower curtain . the gigantic old tv would randomly turn off mid show , and the only way to fix it was by unplugging it and plugging it back in . -the staff was not very friendly or very attentive . they did what they had to do , and they rarely did it very nicely . the bartender was actually quite rude to us- twice . i wo n't stay here again , and i would not recommend it .	4231
1	greg is seriously the best at communicating ! we wanted to book them for our wedding . he is responsive and gave us all the info we needed ! if you are looking for a wedding snack , definitely contact them !	4232
1	these pretzels made to look like a mustache are the bomb ! there 's nothing like fresh baked bread and they do it well . the sauce is worth the wait in line , and there prices do n't cost a arm and a leg . they make them quick right in front of you , they are pretzel assassins please like my review if it was helpful thanks your awsome .	4232
1	delicious soft pretzels in the form of mustaches , what 's not to love ? i have been a return customer to the mustache pretzel truck for the last 2 years . the only time i was disappointed was once when they were at a vegetarian festival and the pretzels just tasted different . otherwise all of my experiences have been great . i have only ever tried the original one , i would be open to trying the other ones , but i just enjoy the original so much ! one time i bought a mustache pretzel for my sister and it smelled so good i ate the entire thing before it could make it home to her . that says a lot !	4232
0	not a pretzel . disappointed . they are more like doughy bread . flavor not good , even as a bread .	4232
0	this has to be the worst pretzel i have ever had ... .it did n't even taste like a pretzel and the butter on top tasted sweet ... .the cheese sauce did n't help either ... ..it was obviously from a can .	4232
0	terrible customer service , have no idea how to manage a line or realize who 's been there longest . after standing there waiting 10 minutes to order they decided a customer who left and came back with her kids should be served first .	4232
1	thank you aaron for your prompt response and awesome job with my cooktop repair ! i completely short-circuited the ignition switch and needed to replace it asap . called and aaron was able to fit me in today within just a few hours . i ca n't thank you enough for your quick response time . also appreciate you giving me honest feedback on what parts needed to be replaced . reasonable , fair and quick response time . i will definitely be using you again ! thank you !	4233
1	great service ! they were quick to come and fix the problem and fixed the problem fast also ! very nice and professional . i will be using them again when a problem arises !	4233
0	had an appt with a 12-3pm arrival time . that time came and went with no arrival or communication . i called multiple times between 3pm and 430pm with no answer from the main line or aaron 's cell phone , so i left a voicemail . it 's now monday and still no call or communication . i took time off work and got completely ghosted . i think it 's safe to say i would not recommend this company .	4233
0	update : still never got a call back from them , so i called again . they said , `` they ca n't imagine why that would happen '' and offered to make me another appointment ... like i would take time off work again and let them in my home ? no thanks ! ! no apology , nothing . they should change their name , these guys are not `` pros '' .	4233
1	awesome little dive bar . great burgers . good beer . nice , causal divey feel to it . good sized bar even though the stools are getting a little worn . it 's got two nice pool tables too !	4234
1	great burgers . good beer . nice , causal divey feel to it . good sized bar even though the stools are getting a little worn .	4234
0	not really a bad place to go on half-price burger night , which is either tuesday or wednesday . they serve cheap pitchers of beer every night . i would n't tell you to stay away , because it 's very cheap and the service was pretty friendly . but be aware this is a dive , although not quite as divey as it looks from the outside . they have a pool table and the when we were there a guy was smoking the whole time he was playing . so the health code is apparently not a big priority . for a cheap bar/restaurant in the falls , try river city grill or jimmy biggs .	4234
0	this place deserves no stars ! went with my husband around 6pm , about 10 people there sitting at the bar & playing pool . well lit & clean but no one working there even acknowledged us , after sitting at a table for approx . 8 minutes . that 's when my husband went to the counter to place a food order & was told they do n't have real coke , they have `` bar '' /fake coke . and that 's when we left . major disappointment . lookout silver swan on front st. , here we come !	4234
1	i have been going to north scottsdale laser & skin care for about 3 years now and extremely happy with the results ! dr anderson does my treatments and i find she has great input without coming across like she is trying to sell me more product than i need . the staff is always friendly and i am always dressed very casual as i usually go when i am not in business attire .	4235
1	great staff ... efficient and knowledgeable . did not try to sell me during my consult .	4235
1	great customer service and fanominal providers !	4235
1	i have been going to north scottsdale laser & skin care for 4 years . it 's a very friendly & clean environment and the staff is always so sweet . i go to dr. anderson for my treatments ( botox , filler ) . dr. anderson really takes her time with you and i always feel 100 % trust and comfort with dr. anderson , therefore i would highly recommend doing your treatments with her . they also do monthly specials which is great for your budget !	4235
1	i 've been going to north scottsdale laser and skin for almost five years . the staff is always friendly and welcoming . dr. jessica anderson is wonderful and so gentle with botox and juvederm . it 's easy to make appointments and they frequently offer specials !	4235
0	this skin care clinic is too expensive with almost no effect . i signed up for a laser treatment for my acne scars but after 6 treatments also , my scars did not reduce a bit . i was very upset with the treatment as i was really hopeful the treatment would diminish my acne scars . please do not visit this clinic if your concern is acne scars .	4235
0	received botox from dr anderson and it created a bigger problem than i had before . now my eyebrows are bumpy : / she 's very nice but do not trust to go back . just called to cancel my follow up ( why would i go back if i look worse than when i came in ? ) receptionist was not happy i was canceling and was rude . i was not going to leave a yelp review - but now i think this is well deserved . do not suggest .	4235
0	do not go here . i have been dealing with these people for 3 years , now and just found out that they can not give me a refund or use my + $ 1000 for their services . that my money is no longer mine and that they keep the money because it went through accounting . what ever that means . bottom line is they took over $ 1000 from me and wo n't issue a refund or offer me other services . there is no money or service to give to me for my services . horrible office manager by the name of susan .	4235
0	after numerous phone calls and discussions , i was finally able to receive my refund for services purchased but needed to cancel due to a medical situation .	4235
0	i went here a couple of years back after purchasing a groupon or living social deal for some facial treatment -- not botox . the procedure was supposed to take 30 minutes . i came in dress very casually and was treated badly by the entire staff , from the woman at the front desk to the person who performed my treatment . they were dismissive , and seemed to want me out of there asap . the 30 minute treatment lasted just 15 minutes . i will never go back . just because someone is not dressed to the nines is no reason to treat them like crap .	4235
1	the food here is great although pricy . i ordered the seafood spaghatinni and it was delicious . my wife had the pizza and she loved it . the tiramasu is a pass and although fresh it was not sweet at all , not sure what marscapone they are using . imagine being a diabetic and ordering a desert that does n't have sugar . i would go there again but would try the cheesecake instead .	4236
1	we were just passing by looking for a nice restaurant and we found here . the interior design is so beautiful and food is even better ! i enjoyed a lot ! yammy !	4236
1	i absolutely love it here . the ambiance is beautiful , as you really get the italian feel . the waiters are very attentive and kind . the wine list is like a bible so i am pretty sure you will find what you like . i have had the golden spoon risotto which was so delish . the duck was so tender . i loved their passion fruit cheesecake but it 's meant to be shared , as it 's very decadent . the nutella tiramisu is good if you do n't want anything too sweet . it 's a great place to check out after shopping at sherway gardens .	4236
1	came by for lunch hoping for a lunch menu , but they only use their dinner menu . food is pricey . mushroom risotto is really good though . i am super picky about risotto and it was right on . my criticism is that this place has looked the same forever . it feels too 90s in there with metal vines on walls and ceiling and too much decor happening . it really needs a makeover for the price point . service was very good . seasoned waiters here .	4236
1	really good and will go back . went last night for wedding anniversary . calamari to start was excellent . wife had duck risotto . very rich and creamy . good , but not amazing . i had the bolognese tagliatelle , which was great . baked brussels sprouts on the side were also fantastic . service was slow . bill was $ 120.00 with no drinks or dessert .	4236
0	i been here twice in the past month and the service has been exceptionally slow . the pricing is rather high for service quality . the meals were ok but it took forever to get them . i would definitely not recommend this restaurant for any sort of business meeting or dinner as it will not be an efficient experience	4236
0	i had a business dinner here recently . it is a large , outdated resto with a few gimmicks to keep you going . they have massive pepper grinders , and a wine-list that mirrors the yellow pages . they fail to deliver .	4236
0	i 'm downgrading from 5 to one star . the owner apparently has some philosophical issue with using debit . my date did n't have a credit card . he had to leave , get money from an atm , and come back , while i stayed behind so they knew he 'd come back . not cool tell the owner , `` welcome to 2017 '' ! ! this is completely unacceptable , and a huge inconvenience for both myself and my date ! not ok at all smarten up owner !	4236
0	over rated . they need to do better risotto was a complete mess , hard core rice in little or no broth not even creamy . i will not recommend this place , waste of time	4236
0	the seafood linguine pasta is super salty to the point that its unedible . for the price you pay , you expect it to be good .	4236
1	the best indian food in pittsburgh ! no where else has compared . after trying other indian places around pittsburgh , this will be our go to from now on .	4237
1	this is the best indian restaurant in pittsburgh . the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the food was fantastic . hat 's off to chef billu !	4237
1	excellent lunch buffet . good selection , spicing just right . includes dessert and naan . it 's not fancy on the outside but the food is very good and service first-rate .	4237
0	way too over priced . no good temperature control . servers do n't k know much about the menu . quality of food is good . wait time too long specially on weekend . this guy is charging for how much a high end fine restaurants would charge . nothing fancy about the place	4237
0	i went here for the sunday lunch buffet that is advertised on their website . i get there literally hours before the buffet is supposed to end only to find the restaurant closed ! drove over 40 minutes to get there only to find the place closed , very disappointing . apparently the grand deluxe weekend buffet is no longer a thin , it 'd be nice if they would update their website . i 've been there before and the food is really good , but this last visit was just unacceptable .	4237
0	awful . i ordered takeout , and when i showed up a half hour later as they said to , they had n't even processed the order . the person i talked to was unapologetic and acted like it should n't be a big deal for me to put in my order again and wait another half hour . this was my first experience here , and i 'll never return .	4237
1	well this was our first time here . very clean place , friendly staff , pizza and cheese sticks for carry out , my wife and i enjoy our meal very much can not wait to go back . updated few weeks later i try it again . all i can say is yummy ! ! !	4238
1	i love me some toppers and i have to say pretty much every toppers looks and is about the same so let me speak on the quality of food and staff coming out of this place . first of all , i have never had any bad food from this location . it is always hot , and does n't taste re-heated . the staff ? they are fast and friendly whether it 's picking something up or having it delivered , this is one of the best locations for that . pretty happy with this place , what else can ya ask for ?	4238
1	well this was our first time here . very clean place , friendly staff , pizza and cheese sticks for carry out , my wife and i enjoy our meal very much can not wait to go back .	4238
1	i am incredibly picky about my pizza . if the the crust is n't good , i do n't even want to bother eating it . it 's so frustrating to me when i pay money for a pizza and it just sucks . toppers does n't suck . it is the best pizza i 've had in madison wi so far . people kept talking about glass nickel , so i got it and , i did n't understand the hype , i was not impressed . toppers is way better . the crust was flavorful and substantial , not thin and cardboard-like . definitely recommend .	4238
1	the toppers sticks are really good and the people working there are even better . i 've noticed the staff has become friendlier and more helpful in the past couple months . if youre looking for delicious greasy pizza toppers is a go-to .	4238
1	this my favorite pizza place . they have an absolutely mouthwatering house pizza menu ! the service and team are awesome . try them out !	4238
0	not worth the time . ordered online twice and when i go to pick up my order it has not even been made yet . first time i waited but this more recent time i was feed up . the whole point to online ordering is to set a time when you want your food to be ready . apparently they do n't get that or maybe do n't care . not going to waste my time on sub par food .	4238
0	the other reviews definitely are n't lying about this place being awful . our pizza arrived late ( more than an hour after ordering ) , and incorrectly made . i guess one should n't expect much more from a chain pizza joint . the extra couple bucks at a `` better '' pizza parlor would be well worth it .	4238
0	this place is horrible ! our order was 40 minutes late ; the cashier was rude , lied to us about starting our pizza the first time we went to pick it up , and tried to make us pay for the pizza in the store even though we had already paid online ; the order was wrong ( we paid extra for thicker crust and did n't get it plus one of our dipping sauces was missing ) ; and one of our pizzas was completely doughy . seriously , do n't waste your money ! we threw almost a whole pizza away because we could n't eat it .	4238
0	ordered delivery from here a few times . everytime i was disappointed by the quality . barely warm , lacking toppings , and cheese . not at all what i 've known toppers to be . the best location from my experience is the fitchburg location near the super target . unfortunately i moved near this location . guess i 'll have to find a new favorite pizza spot .	4238
0	i used to love toppers when i ordered from them repeatedly at their east washington avenue location . had the misfortune of being forced to move out , and moved to middleton . the mineral point road location has repeatedly brought the pizzas only . no paper plates , crushed red pepper , grated parmesan , all of which were par for the course at the east washington avenue delivery people . just saying ...	4238
0	had great experiences with other toppers pizza . they left out ingredients that my pizza carried . called back to let them know and the person on the phone did n't seem to care . just not good customer service .	4238
1	just had my vsg performed by dr kolasch and lets just talk about how amazing he is ! he is very friendly and welcoming the moment you meet him . dr. kolasch is also a great surgeon he tells you step by step what 's going to happen and does everything in his power to make you feel comfortable . and omg the staff is also just as sweet and kind . even after surgery 2 of the staff nurses came to visit me to make sure i understood what i needed to do to stay healthy.. they are one big caring family !	4239
1	had to come here on the whim for my husband because he had to get some testing done . we got scheduled the same day . we checked in at the registration department near the radiology and the woman was so nice ! ! she walked us over to the waiting area and we did n't wait long at all . we finally got called and my husband had his testing done . once we were done , the tech showed us the way out . easy breezy !	4239
1	as new grandparents we would like to offer our heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the wonderful caring maternity staff for the safe arrival of a beautiful long awaited grandchild . from entering the hospital to coming home our daughter was treated with kindness and experienced excellent care from doctors , nurses and housekeeping . the premises inside and out were a credit to all concerned . we are fortunate in matthews to have such high class facilities . i was tempted to stand by the pianist in the lobby and sing so loud they could hear me in pineville . maybe next time .	4239
1	everyone i talked with was friendly and helpful . the wait was short . the care was kind and caring . the process was easy . the parking lot was pretty full so make sure to leave enough time to possibly wait for a spot . lovely facility . *note for ob/gyn care at this facility : midwives are not allowed . i hear this is not the place to go for a natural childbirth . although as far as ob/gyns go , i 've found one of the kindest physicians i can imagine here .	4239
1	i 've had great experiences at this hospital . the lines are never very long , and the facility is clean . it does n't even have that creepy hospital smell . i 've also found the staff to be really friendly and helpful . i 've had some kind of awful experiences at cmc , especially the ones in the heart of town , but presbyterian is a wonderful alternative for whatever emergencies occur .	4239
0	horrible hospital ! ! overall , lack of patient care ! some of the staff are friendly and helpful ; however , others act as if you are bothering them when you ask them to perform a task that should fall under their job duties .	4239
0	do n't expect quality service . from the ed/er to being admitted the service was poor and the cna 's and nurses on the weekends are the worst . i would give -4 stars if possible . was there for two days no pleasant faces , all the staff looked like they did not want to be there , and it showed . my advise is to stay well !	4239
0	this er is horrible ! i 'd give it negative 5 stars if i could . my daughter had a weird episode of high blood pressure , dizziness and chest pain while at cheer practice , she 's 10 and very fit . i brought her at 8pm on a monday night . it took 4 and 1/2 hours before a doctor saw her . that is ridiculous ! the staff was unfriendly , not helpful & just horrible . i would n't come here again if my life depended on it ... literally ! !	4239
0	twice i have had surgery here and both times have experienced poor nursing help following my procedures . this is not towards any of the doctors or anesthesiologist i have dealt with . only the nurses afterwards . it seems some of the nurses either do n't bother to communicate with each other or do n't bother to follow all orders written by doctors or to notify a doctor after a procedure that there is an issue that might need addressing .	4239
0	came in at 6 pm and was seen at 12 am . the doctor was nice and i stayed so long i had two nurses and they were very pleasant . i ended up having a stomach virus but stayed in pain longer than i expected . it is now 3:45am , and i 'm still waiting on meds that the doctor told me he was ordering at 2:45am . besides the wait time i appreciate the service given just wish i could have been home the same day i came in .	4239
1	the pharmacy at this walgreens is great . my family 's used it for years and though they 've had some personnel changes , they do not happen too often . they get to know us , recognize us when we drive up , and even make sure to keep one drug in stock because they know we need it . they also promptly answer phones , help find discounts , and work with me to ensure we have the best options for my family 's health . i love the drive through , but , unfortunately there is often a long wait . once you reach the front , they always give personal care .	4240
1	i love this walgreen 's because of the location and because of sales items in the seasonal section . a lot of times i can purchase cruelty free and vegan items in the clearance section .	4240
1	i had a larger transaction than i normally do here , with multiple coupons . the register slowed down , but the cashier , rae , was amazingly patient and kind ! she handled it very well and kept the other customers and my toddler happy while we waited for it to catch up . 10 stars for her .	4240
1	stopped here for some otc medication while on vacation after visiting another complex establishment . location was very cleanly , we found what we needed , and almost every servicemember in the store greeted us . customer service was excellent and the lines were fast .	4240
0	*red flag when the pharmacy technician confuses acetaminophen for psudoephedrine . so dropped off a prescription at 2pm on thursday was told 1 hour . went back at 5:30 and was told that the prescription was written wrong and that they need to get a hold of our doctor but since it was after 5 there was nobody in the doctor 's office . why they waited until 5:30 to call is frustrating as well as not calling me to let me know . now it 's friday 1:45 p.m. and they still have not contacted the doctor and im on my way out of town without my daughter 's meds .	4240
0	their teenage cashiers require more training when dealing with customers . rude and disrespectful to regular customers . i used spend in the range of 2-3 hundred dlls a month here . not anymore .	4240
0	i have used this pharmacy for years and never had a problem until recently , which prompted me to write this review . the pharmacy staff was rude and did n't seem happy about even answering my question or helping me about an prescription for my daughter . they seemed to even question why i was calling and just talked over the top of me . i will definitely be switching pharmacies . i have two small children and ca n't risk them messing up medications .	4240
0	so we purchased a gadget to keep the cellphone on the dash which fell straight off . it was purchased several miles away from this location . husband went to return it with the receipt and was told to go back to the original location of purchase because he did not know my old phone number to look up the rewards card . had to spend gas money to go over to the other store . very inconvenient to say the least .	4240
1	last night it was reinforced that , while this eat ' n park in particular is further than three others , it 's worth the drive . always fast , friendly service . their ability to accommodate is always appreciated . even if we show up with 12 people , they 're ready . food is on point and delicious . whether we stop for lunch or late night dessert . consistency . good stuff !	4241
1	i came because i had steelers tickets the day before and was told over the loud speaker that i 'd get free super burgers . we were hungry so we ordered the super burgers ( does n't come with fries or anything with this promotion ) and the chicken quesadillas . the staff was friendly , food was decent , and the place was very nice . no issues getting my discount . would recommend and come back again !	4241
1	they say that eat n parks the place for smiles ? well it is . had a great angus beef double burger . cooked to perfection and topped with a secret sauce . also tried the fried pickles for the first time . loved them . it was nice that they were pickle spears instead of chips . and the home made ranch dipping sauce was creamy and a perfect complement to the pickles .	4241
1	very relaxed and a great place to stop by for some good food .	4241
1	it was a sunday and i just flew in from california . checked into the room and started driving to look for dinner . after looking for 45 minutes for some decent cheap food . i decided to drop by this place to give it a try . this was the first time i went to this type of restaurant but i guess it 's a chain of them . it 's probably comparable to a carrows in the west coast . i ordered meatloaf , a sunday and some salad . all in all it was pretty good and i would'nt mind going back here . they do have alot of different options on the menu that i wound't mind trying .	4241
0	i did a take out and i wont do it again . i ordred the tureky dinner it was a mess the turkey was dry they left out the potates and green beans were raw the roll that came with it were so hard the rest of my order was the same when i called the manger said he was sorry and would send a gift card t comp the order it neer came i think he just wanted to get me off the phone sham n you have mre proud in your buisness its not the frist time its happened i can forgive one time but three times	4241
0	normally bad , slow service . there is absolutely no energy in the place . maybe they are just shorthanded , not sure , but something is definitely missing .	4241
0	it 's mother 's day and my waitress ( from the older generation ) just assumed that my mother was mother . she gave her a cookie and then continued on to the other tables . not once was it assumed that i could 've been a mother too . i am 20 and i think this is age discrimination . meanwhile this establishment is showering a grumpy old man with foods of his delight . maybe if i throw silver ware into the aisle as this man did maybe i can get my mother 's day cookie . i 'm not actually a mother but i wish it could 've been taken into consideration that i could 've been . that 's all .	4241
0	every time i go to this eat n park they mess up my order and thw manager acts like it is my falt the steak is not steak it 's a hamburger there 's slow to fill up the salad bar slow refill your drink slow to take your order and when they 're out of salads at your fault that you ordered that salad you should have order something else so the manager says i would go to any other eatnpark not this one stay away from the one in sewickley	4241
0	does management ever visit their stores ? this was one of the best before the new build out . now it 's the worst in their fleet . ignored , long waits , poor quality at salad bar , empty bins , rotten fruit , empty soup crocks . avoid at all costs . fear that food handling is intentionally manhandled and patrons may be at health risk . have ten visit attempts due to visiting person in hospital . never a good experience . stay out ! ! ! again , how can management not be aware of this place ? !	4241
1	april cut my hair ... man what a beautiful barber . i will g back just to see her not to mention the mvp treatment as they call it . it little bit more than ot he r but definitely worth it .	4242
1	pretty girls washing and cutting your hair , sports on the television with audio . love it . it 's not a fine barber shop , but one step above your run of the mill barber shop . i 'll be back for sure .	4242
1	always a great haircut . my son loves it and never complains about going	4242
1	great place to get a hair cut . i came here for the first time not knowing what to expect . they offer a free upgrade to mvp for your first cut which includes : cut , wash and massage . julie did an awesome job ! i will definitely be coming back here for my next haircut ! purchase the season pass for a great deal on mvp haircuts .	4242
1	i have been getting my hair cut here for 4 years now . the service as always been amazing . the staff seems to not turn over either . if your looking for a great place to try for a hair cut this place i guarantee you 'll love !	4242
1	breanna is the nicest and really performs a quality hair cut . she is very professional and i will continue going to her as long as she 's at the glendale location off of union hills dr. she 's also great at suggesting products that work perfect for my hair style & cut .	4242
0	first time visit styles says 30 min after waiting for 50 min she starts calling other people that came in way after me . plus they have four people on staff and only 2 cutting hair with people waiting absolutely terrible service .	4242
0	would n't honor my free coupon . even though there is no stipulation about a first visit . even though it was my second visit ok then she asked if i had a punch card . no can you give me one i asked . she said no but if you had one its 5 dollars off . so the computer shows i was here before and you ca n't offer me anything . employees were non helpful and non caring . basically a f u attitude	4242
0	just left and my 11 year old son is in tears . got a totally different hair cut than he wanted . she cut it way too short . she was rude and his neck is all red and scratched up . never once apologized or try to make things right . this is the 2nd time we 've had a bad experience here . we wo n't be back .	4242
0	i asked for a taper in the back . the lady ( wo n't mention a name ) had no idea what that was before beginning her attempt . she asked irrelevant questions prior to beginning which made me uncomfortable . after she scrapped off half my hair line.. the stylist from the other side of the room came over out of her own concern and attempted to fix the mess up . my haircut became a coaching opportunity . you can see from the picture i uploaded that i am not exaggerating this review . i actually set up an appointment with a different barbershop the same hour to have it fixed.. even they could n't really reverse what was done .	4242
0	i have brought my son here a few times now for a haircut and each time seems to get worse . they are in such a rush to be done that they do n't do a good job and i end up having to clean up the edges at home with my own trimmer . really expensive for a half-assed job and we wo n't be back .	4242
0	would n't honor my free coupon either . i even had in my hand checking in . employees and managers were non helpful so i disputed with the credit card and it cost them fees instead . lesson learned , hopefully to corporate too	4242
1	i do like this place . went down for a holiday party and the valet parking was horrible ! other than that , was a great morton 's experience . everyone is always polite and everything is always cooked to your liking . i wish i could save room for desert ... maybe next time .	4243
1	this is the sh $ t ! downtown at its finest . honored to be in the after work crowd here ! it 's just all that ! money makes a difference my friends . nice to see . drinking with the highballers .	4243
1	bar review the cosmopolitans are really tasty and a great portion . my favorite item was the tuna tacos . this is a good happy hour overall but the atmosphere here is odd ... not too happy . the servers were excellent and the happy hour items are unbeatable . order anything you want but do not order mojitos , they are bad ... really bad . manhattan and cosmopolitan are too good ! i can not wait to try their late happy hour soon .	4243
1	it was the most amazing experience i ever had my husband took me for my birthday my name was on the top of the menu they come by and clean your table spic and span from every single little crumb . their food is delicious . the $ 129 steak was so good my husband and i split it and still had to take some home . i would recommend this place for special occasions or if you really want to impress somebody because everything here is top dollar . the staff are wonderful , everyone is involved with everything you 're doing it was overall an amazing experience . ! !	4243
1	we had a reservation at 6:45 and we seated immediately . service was outstanding and atmosphere . i had the porterhouse and my wife had the filet . we shared the brussel sprouts & cheesy potatoes . the food was excellent and also the wine . will definitely go back	4243
1	server was fantastic ! ! ! we decided to share a meal because it was late and the portions are quite large . we had the morton 's salad , chicken bianco & horseradish mashed potatoes - yum yum and yum ! ! ! we have been here before for christmas parties so have never been able to order what we like so we were excited to try some new stuff and glad to say we were not disappointed . definitely coming back !	4243
1	it 's a fairly upscale steakhouse in cleveland , so be prepared to drop some cash . the steak is cooked skillfully ( though , frankly , i 've had better ) . the service is good , and the decor is elegant . overall , not a bad place to spoil yourself , but if you just want some decent steak , you can get similar quality for cheaper at an outback .	4243
1	the happy hour bar bites are solid value and realistically , if solo , a good dinner option . we dined in the dining room , service was 5* , our steaks were prepared perfectly . the pea pods , horseradish mashed potatoes and wild mushroom side dishes were great . the chocolate soufflé was ok , a bit mushy . i 'll ask next time for less seasoned salt on the steak . overall a really good dining experience . it 's also near the casino , walked over after dinner for an hour and enjoyed the activity .	4243
1	i do n't know where to start ! lol this restaurant has become my favorite it 's two mormons in new york but this location knocked my socks off ! the customer service was excellent ! they treated us like royalty we had such a fantastic meal . the chef mike held no punches our meals were so perfect so much so that we asked to meet the chef and tell him how amazing and talented he was . ca n't wait to come back to cleveland just to eat here	4243
1	every time i have visited this location i have been impressed . i like this location much better than manner others do to the quite environment and excellent service staff . since i am a member of landrys it is always best to visit when they offer their best specials .	4243
1	took my wife here for our anniversary . the customer service at this place phenomenal . the greeted us with excitement and even said `` happy anniversary '' as we entered . the waiter we had explained the full on menu and was so nice when my wife kept changing her mind . afterwards , they treated us to a dessert for the occasion . i must say , my wife and i might make this our every year anniversary .	4243
1	great food , excellent bartender and nice old fashioned appeal . hit the tables afterwards !	4243
0	seriously ? ? ? ? ? -- -- -- -- original message -- -- -- -- from : landry 's select club date:01/30/2015 6:30 pm ( gmt-05:00 ) dear valued guest , this morning you received an email from us , notifying you that you had until february 15th to use your birthday reward . this email was sent to you in error . there will be no change made to your account and , we will not be extending your birthday reward . we sincerely apologize for this error and any confusion this email may have caused .	4243
0	was seated next to the front door , every time it opened a cold breeze would enter the restaurant . salad was ok but very small , i ordered the filet , cooked medium , was ok but on the dry side , could have used some a-1 . restaurant is way over priced , i have had better steaks on my backyard grill . not worth the money	4243
0	decor is tired . carpet worn , drywall repairs still unpainted . feels tired and old . steak was just ok , sides were far better than the steaks , across the board . service was great , but no enough to cover the mediocre meal.. go elsewhere .	4243
0	honestly , for as much as this place charges , the food should have jumped off my plate and did a jig for me . i did n't think it was anything special at all . the service was good , the ambiance was ok , but the food tasted just ok. with all the hype this place has , they sure did n't live up to it .	4243
0	i love steak . i think great steakhouses are rare . the experience that my wife and i had in morton 's of cleveland was really bad . server , ok . manager going through the motions , steaks ; well sub-par is being to nice . salad great . please , someone please charge me more but do n't serve me average tasteless steak . please . i am a nice guy and just want to have a great steak with flavor , in a nice place . with people who notice that i a not eating my main course . some body , please take my money but also please do n't disappoint a steak lover . thank you for reading .	4243
0	the bartender was one of the meanest , grumpiest bartenders i 've had in years . older lady - bad red-hair , mean as hell and obviously pissed off at the world . finishing my drink and going somewhere else for dinner . avoid this place whenever she 's working .	4243
0	service was outstanding and the decor was updated and beautiful . each receives a star . the food , the prices and the drinks received no stars as they were below average and astronomically priced . it seems since landry 's took over the quality went way down and the prices went way up .	4243
0	not impressed ! was looking forward to a really great ribeye and after cutting a bunch of grizzle away , it was just okay - perfect temp and a great portion , but again , just okay . i 've had better sirloin 's at much less expensive prices . the morton salad was overdressed but the mushroom side was very good - they brought the steak up a bit . brussel sprouts are all the rage lately , but morton 's fell short - over-grilled and bland . really a sub par steakhouse in my opinion and definitely not up to the hype . should have gone with a local place .	4243
0	this review is for bar area service only . we had 2 servers ... one blonde , one brunette . the brunette was extremely courteous , attentive , and had a smile on her face . the older blonde lady was very rude . she scowled when we asked for our check . she scowled when we asked for straws for our water . she was very curt in her responses ... definitely a lot of attitude . the food was n't even that great that night . my trio of filet mignons arrived barely warm and they were not the best cut . disappointed in the food and the service was terrible . not going back .	4243
0	to me , if you 're going to drop a hundred bucks per person on dinner it better be worth it and this fell short of my expectations . i had the bone in ribeye and it was average at best . not what i was expecting for a $ 60 steak . the brussel sprouts were hard and bland . and the twice baked potato left a lot to be desired . our waitress was not very attentive and had to ask for refills a few times . i would absolutely make a trip to ruth chris but i 'm taking mortons off the wish list . overpriced for above average food .	4243
0	the older lady bartender ... .i think her name was chris should retire . she never said hello , welcome to morton 's or i will be right with you . hahahahaha . maybe cause she was busy looking at a sheet of paper on how to make a certain cocktail the personality of a doormat . crappy attitude .even the guy next to me was scared to ask if she would put on the basketball game . food was great . the manager was cool . run the other way if you see this lady there . you will know who she is . trust me	4243
0	be aware that although their hours are posted as open until 10pm or 11 pm , it may not be so . tried to come to the bar at 9 on the dot tonight only to be turned away by valet attendant in the doorway bc as he says , they closed early today . several patrons were inside and bartender was still serving but i was not allowed to even ask him myself . save yourself a trip and parking and call ahead .	4243
1	i recently had my mercedes benz repaired at new look collision . when i got my car back it looked amazing ! the whole staff was so professional i would never thought i was in a body shop ! the girls in front office and who answer the phones are very polite ! ca n't say enough ! thank you to the staff at new look collision ! ! !	4245
1	everything came out amazing . what was a bad experience from the accident became a great one after new look collision took over and repaired my vehicle . i am glad i choose them . i knew i had the right team on my side . without a doubt the best experts for your repairs . i 've had 3 experiences prior to this one and after my 4 accident ( none my fault ) i can honestly say this is the shop to go to . i have geico and the geico team worked with new look collision , geico kept me updated of any changes . everything ran very smooth ; a big thank you to geico and new look collision .	4245
1	meme handled our account from beginning to end . she was thorough , professional , and handled every detail with perfection . all my family will use this company from now on because of the outstanding customer service i received .	4245
1	i brought my truck to this place to have my broken trunk latch replace . i brought the part for them to install it and they did not even charge me for the labor ! i just gave the guy $ $ $ showing appreciation.erika was very professional and has good customer service..	4245
1	i brought my car here because it had high ratings on the google page when i searched for a body shop . boy , the reviews were not wrong . i was fortunate enough to get meme helping me throughout the process . not only was she polite and kind , she was awesome getting me information or updated etas . will definitely bring a vehicle here god forbid i get into another accident .	4245
1	do n't look anywhere else for a collision center , you 've found the only one you need to go to ! the manager , paul williams , is personable , helpful and knowledgable . constant updates and progress reports . they will never leave you in the dark and will keep in constant communication with you and the progression of your vehicle . if you have any doubts , do n't . this is the place to go . know that you are in good hands .	4245
0	i just spoked with paul williams who response to my previous reviews because of the poor rating i gave . first , he sounded like he 's concern about it and i do n't know what he 's after for but the conversations ended up ugly . i do n't like the word he said `` done '' what is that mean ? they tell their customers they give lifetime warranty with their jobs and now it sounded like only the paint job is guaranteed life time . this place is a bunch of `` bs '' . very poor customer service.. they do n't even deserve a 1 star at all .	4245
0	they were slow and like to place blame on the clients instead of where it should go , them ! management is horrible and threatening . go anywhere else but them . i am going to tell everyone i know not to , it was the worst experience ever .	4245
0	i had a bad experience with new look collision . it 's a bit long and complicated to explain but i feel as though they have a scam going to get insurance business . bid too high , revise it low , do they work and revise again to higher number to get more from the insurance company . i would discourage my friends from going here .	4245
0	i think this is the worse collision center i 've ever known . they will not call you for any updates for the repair and my car was stock with them for 33 days . i read some reviews here in yelp the same problem with me . and every time i call them they give me reasons like need approval from my insurance and after 2nd ; 3rd wk keep on calling them they give same reason . for bumper repair it took them more than a month . they should have time frame for the repair ... i guess thier doing the bigger damage first for more money ... it looks like quantity against quality is happening on this facility .	4245
0	i was very happy with the original work they did on repairing my door on my rav4 but the door guard was coming off and i have been waiting over 4 months for them to fix it . every time i go in to ask they tell me it will be here in 2 weeks and still nothing . the last time i went in i was told definitely 2 weeks and that was over a month ago . originally i would give them 5 stars and was recommending them to everyon i could but that has all changed . very unhappy .	4245
0	do n't settle on their quote of estimate get another opinion . they will write down things do n't need to be fixed .	4245
1	i love coming to this place for a pedicure lulu is amazing . great personality and always attentive to customers needs , may i add excellent memory . she will remember you .	4246
1	my all time favorite nail place . super clean and hardly any wait , meaning lots of nail techs	4246
1	love this place ! they are always very nice when i come in and they always do an amazing job with my full sets , manicures , and pedis ! this picture is four days in with the manicure .	4246
1	awesome pedicure ... even included a hot rock massage on my feet & legs ! the massage chairs here are so nice ! ! i would give 5 stars but i had to wait pretty long , other that , a great experience ! i will be back !	4246
1	i 've been going here for the past 2 years , ever since i moved to the area & i love it ! the people there are so sweet & are so family orientated.. they were extremely nice to my daughter when i had to take her in with me one time..	4246
0	zero stars would be more suitable for this place ! i got a manicure and pedicure and here is the picture of my manicure from just a few hours ago . not worth the $ 23 i paid for it . prices are constantly changing depending on who you are . a girl in there had an argument with the owner because of differentiating prices . so to test the waters i asked the owner how much for a bikini wax , to which she responded $ 30 , but their sign says $ 25 ! i 'm so tired of them taking advantage . it should n't be that way ! would not recommend this place at all .	4246
0	horrible my nails look like chodes and they rushed because they wanted to go home . uneven and ugly .	4246
0	if i could leave 0 stars i would ! ! ! ! my $ 30 gel polish lasted all of 2 days before chipping ! i finally returned to get the nails redone and they refused to repair the nail with the nail design without charging me extra ! this place cares nothing about their customers so disgusting . avoid at all cost not worth the money that you pay . the girl who works in the front is rude just all together worst experience ever . will never return ! only came because my favorite salon is closed on sunday . instead visit queen nails and spa on glendale you can thank me later they are amazing .	4246
0	this place is terrible- go to the salon down the street . although i was the only customer in the salon this morning , the lady rushed through my gel manicure . i got a simple gel manicure , only one solid color . my nails look very sloppy .	4246
0	on september 15 , 2016 . i went to superior nails . i plan on going back just to show them what a horrible job nancy did ! streaks on fingernails ! pedicure was dangerous ! she actually cut my skin and clumped the polish on my left big toe . i explained to nancy that i was a diabetic and i can only get a pedicure about once every few months . heading over there today for a refund ! i was in need of a new nail shop , but guess what ? it wo n't be superior nails on 83rd and lower buckeye in phoenix , az ! no stars ! in fact , can we do negative 5 ?	4246
1	i buy most house hold improvement items from here . almost always have good luck ( once could n't get my item as they were out of stock ) . staff is super friendly and i do n't spend much time looking for anything . happy that there is a store like this in the area so i do n't have to drive far for small stuff . i typically come in the weekends so i run into the same employees who i find knowledgable about the store . i do n't ask technical questions so ca n't comment on how helpful the staff is about explaining how to do house projects .	4247
1	great supplies ! i could not find a certain screw anywhere and i finally went here and they had it ! super super impressed . 5 stars !	4247
1	i really like these guys ! if you want one trip vs multiple trips at big box hardware stores , this is your place . each ace hardware is family owned , so that 's just another incentive to buy from a local . i made three trips to home depot thinking it was something convenient , but turned into a hassle waiting in line for exchanges only to get the wrong aerator . one trip to ace and the young lady who helped me was like , `` moen ? yeah those can be tricky . here 's what you need . '' one stop .	4247
1	i was very indecisive when i went into your store today . i needed several items and even though i have an idea of what i wanted to do , i was n't sure if there was a product available to complete my project . i met zac and he was awesome ! he was knowledgeable and able to show me several options . as a retail manager , i know associates have a lot to do but zac took the extra time to help me . i wrote zac a compliment card by i feel the service level he provides deserves the world 's acknowledgement ! zac..your are awesome and your service is not average but amazing !	4247
1	nice , friendly local hardware store . came in to get a few odds and ends and was able to find everything on my list . the cashier was a friendly , older woman and asked me if i needed help carrying the heavy items out to the car . prices seems comparable to home depot or lowes but you wo n't get lost trying to find stuff .	4247
0	drove 15 minutes to look for specialty item . none at home depot . cashier asked if he could help , told what looking for and lady said i may find it in aisle 17 and went back to talking to other worker . no help at all . others seemed helpful .	4247
0	people at this store were so rude . was never willing to help or anything.. showed us one tool for $ 100+ so we asked for something a little bit more in our budget and the dude started getting all sour . never coming back . go to home depot instead.. it 's just a few more minutes away , the workers are always so helpful at home depot , & the products are more affordable.. horrible horrible first experience . will never be back again	4247
0	i had shopped here for years . their is two guys in there that know what they are doing everyone else is clueless . after years of patronage i went and asked if they could cut a plastic pipe for my garbage disposal . they refused to do it . standing around doing nothing 3 people in the store ca n't spend 2 minutes to cut it . `` you did n't buy that '' 5 dollar `` pipe here '' says 1 of the clueless . so no screw off . i will never be back i live in southern highlands this store is so close but i would rather drive 20 miles then go here .	4247
0	i only go here when i absolutely have to . it takes forever to check out ... even if you 're the only person in line . god forbid there be a line , then you just gave up your whole saturday afternoon . obviously the prices are high , but that 's for convenience and location , so that 's a given .	4247
0	this was probably one of the worst retail experiences i 've ever delt with if you close in 10mins i do n't need a reminder ever 20 seconds your going to close as a i customer i should be catered for help not a reminder for me to leave.isnt taking care of customer part of retail job ? i do n't understand the staff was more excited to go home than to take care of customers only place you walk in and out because they will not help you .	4247
1	great chill place especially on wednesday night . great vibe .	4248
1	good place to go for nice mature fun . good music and good people .	4248
1	my very favoite place in town square . drank strawberry fields , amazing . ate perogies and carmel mousse , delightful . had 4 of the 6 bartenders wait on us . wonderful service . never had to wait for even water or a dirty dish to be cleared . it was a great experience . especially since we were there thru a busy friday night dinner time and still had great service . def going back frequently . try it , you 'll be impressed .	4248
1	the service was outstanding . the staff was very accommodating . we work in the hospitality business and the service was beyond expectation . our waitress elena greeted us from the moment we stepped foot in the door until the very end . we receive our drinks in a timely manner and never once had an empty drink . we will be back due to the level of service we received . it was a great environment .	4248
0	service is terrible . there were 2 of us , the hostess sat us with only one menu . after we had to take turns to share the menu , we finally decided on our entrees . 30 minutes passed , no one ever approached the table so we decided to leave . on our way out i wanted to let the hostess know that we were never greeted , after which she asked `` what table number were you at ? '' how am i supposed to know ? is it a requirement to know your table number in order to get waited on ?	4248
0	went here on a friday night . it was the most dead place ever . we asked what time , if at all , people start coming . they said , `` not until 1:00 . '' ok , so you close at 2:00 , and people come at 1 ? so you have one hour of business ? wtf ? peaced out real quick . blue martinis is where it 's at .	4248
0	wow . going a 2nd time a few weeks after the opening . talk about loss of credibility fo ' shizzle ! the service really sucked big time . waited approx 15 minutes unti we could even wave someone down to order drinks .	4248
0	yes , this place has been the worst , service is bad , dirty and over price , think mcdonalds is still better than this place ! wife and kids didnt like it .	4248
1	i really love this place . it 's like being in another era . while reviewers have mentioned that the food is n't of amazing quality , well - it is a truck stop , but it 's always tasty and cheap , and the service is extremely friendly and quick . overall an adorable place - it 's always busy for a reason . and the train overhead is just the best .	4249
1	this is a terrific place with the sweetest staff i have ever come across ! the club sandwiches are very yummy , the turkey is roasted in house , no yucky deli meat . great breakfasts with good sized portions and low costs ( i usually get a sandwich to go for $ 5 to take to work and they always load them up with lots of turkey , white or dark meat whatever you like ) orange cream milkshake is the best i 've ever had and they keep a little tray of banana bread ( buttered of course ) wrapped up at the front where you pay for only $ 1 . a great little treat for after a meal . love !	4249
1	the real deal in truck stop gastronomics ! minimal use of salt , good coffee , simple burgers and thick milkshakes . if the food does n't impress you , then sit and stare at the seizure inducing decor : flashing lights , trying-too-hard-to-fail 50 's diner ambience , and authentic jukes blasting country tunes . damn good pie , too .	4249
1	do you want to know why i appreciate blackfoot truck stop ? because , it feels like home .	4249
1	if you looking for a classic truck stop food place . eggs , flapjacks , bacon steak etc . this will hit the spot . affordable prices . nothing flashy but tasty and filling .	4249
1	looking for a delicious breakfast in a laid back environment with a side of people watching ? prefer an atmosphere where you 're either a hun or a dear ? bottomless cups of coffee and a breakfast dish that includes pork chops ? then the blackfoot truck stop is perfect for you with prices to match and the decor is just busy enough that every visit is sure to reveal a new gem .	4249
0	i used to go here at least 2 times week . the coffee was good and the portions were overly generous . the burgrers here great and my fav was the chicken salad sandwich which was overflowing over with huge chunks of fresh chicken . i was in here again for the first time in 2 years . ordered the chicken again and was sadsly disappointed the amount of chicken was a small schmear of it on thin bread that fell apart . i used to not be able to finish it before . this time i wanted to stop on the way home and get a snack . bitterly disappointed .	4249
0	have been meaning to try this place for quite sometime . i know it has quite the cult following here , however i quickly discovered that i will not be a part of that following lol . definately an experience atmosphere wise . i felt like i was back in the 80 's . service was ok , food was ok at best . if you like processed cheese then you may like the omelettes . overall i prefer the deerhead cafe for a cheap eats/dingy diner vibe . much better tasting .	4249
0	seriously did not understand the hype of this place . it was disgusting . our cups were n't even cleaned , took forever to order food ( and they charged us for something that we never even ended up getting ) . and to top it off , hair in our fries . i had the worst stomach ache after leaving that place . i gag every time i think of that experience i had and i will never go back . it would be in your best interest of you avoided this place all together .	4249
0	heard so much about this place , but i 'm afraid it was far from fabulous . we were served quick , but then forgot about . the eggs benny were sub par . not sure what the hollandaise sauce was made of , but it was n't eggs ! sort of a white , tasteless gravy . the hash browns were mush in my mouth , and looked seriously unappetizing . the decor is so over-the-top tacky , but goes with the territory . definitely get what you pay for ; cheap , and pre-made/packaged . might go back for a burger , but breakfast was blah ! !	4249
0	staff not attentive to their job - got a dirty spoon and bunch of redundant questions from our server . they do n't even reply to emails .	4249
0	worst hash browns i 've ever had . people are deluded if they think the food is even remotely good . when i say hash browns i think , hashed/shredded and fried/browned potato 's . not 6 boiled potato 's chopped into large chunks , unseasoned , white and soggy mess in a bowl that i was served . i went here for the charm but this place is operated like worst truck stop in america not a place you go for good food cheap . seriously , shred and fry your hash browns no one likes boiled chunks of potato !	4249
1	i just got my brows perfected by paige . she is the only person who has ever walked me through the steps she was doing . i am very excited to go back ! she is also the first person i have ever rebooked with . she made my experience wonderful and not to mention i learned a lot from her !	4250
1	this place has been nothing , but amazing ! i love the wax they use , the technique , the friendly staff , and well what more can i say . i have always done a last minute call and they have always been able to assist with getting me in right there and then . the staff never pressures you into buying anything ( like some others ) and it 's just mentioned as you check out if you would like to book your next appointment ... . ladies and gents if you need waxing , even an asap one then this is definitely the place to hit up .	4250
0	they had offered free wax first time visit , so i went ahead and did my eyebrows . i moved here from miami about a year ago and have n't been able to find a place where they do my eyebrows and keep the shape i have . i was n't too happy with the lady that did my eyebrows ... she did n't do a clean job and messed up the shape of one of my eyebrows . is there any place in charlotte that can do a good job waxing eyebrows . no luck yet .	4250
0	i came in hairy and left hairy . it was honestly the worst waxing experience i have ever had . she did n't prep my skin at all , waxed the same areas over and over again , and then did n't removed excess wax . unreal .	4250
1	i absolutely love coming to kaya . the food is amazing ! amazing ! ! ! and they have a nice beer selection on draft . id suggest making reservations if you 're going to be eating dinner there any evening or lunch on the weekend . i 've been there perhaps ten times now and the food and service are solid 10s .	4251
1	i had heard about kaya since i first moved to pittsburgh but it was only recently that i got a chance to try it out and i regret not having done it earlier ! this is a nice place for both lunch and dinner , with good food , drinks and helpful service . i ordered the cuban sandwich , which was delicious and the other two people in my party ordered the paella which also seemed amazing ! i will be certainly going back when i am in the strip district or i can even make a trip just for kaya .	4251
1	great crowd , great interactions with the staff , really great drinks , and really really great food . kaya makes for a terrific night out . possibly the best fish tacos in town .	4251
1	i had the jerk wings and they were fantastic . they were cooked to perfection and they were bursting with flavor . i already ca n't wait to have them again	4251
1	delicious food and drinks ! our server was friendly and suggested some good items for us to try . we will come back to visit !	4251
1	food was really good ! seating was a bit uncomfortable , but the service was great ! the only thing i wish for is a broader wine selection .	4251
1	i couple of the dishes could be better from their menu . but they have a 5 course menu once every month with original dishes which was one of the best dinning experiences i 've had . you can choose meat , vegan or vegetarian . my boyfriend got vegan and i got vegetarian so we were able to try everything . only thing is i wish there was a little more lighting inside . been here about 5 or 6 times and service has always been goo	4251
1	this place was really wonderful . ate here for the first time today and will definitely be back . i had the cuban with sweet potato fries and a salad ( that salad ) and could n't even finish i was so full . my friend got the kaya burger and it was huge ! it looked delicious and i will definitely be trying that the next time i go back . the restaurant has a great atmosphere and everyone i talked to was very friendly . i wish i had caught the name of our waitress today because she was awesome ! ( waitress , we talked about my scarf from thailand . you were great ! )	4251
1	definitely tasty , but it 's not at the top of my list of `` places i 'm dying to go back to . '' unique and interesting ambience , service was good . we called to make a reservation friday morning and they only had an early time or late time remaining -- we took the 8:45 reservation . so definitely call beforehand if you want a reservation during a `` prime-time ! '' we ordered the alligator , vegetable green curry with shrimp added , and the crispy fish tacos . the tacos were the hit ; `` best fish tacos i 've ever had '' according to my boyfriend .	4251
1	order the sorrel tea . it is really good !	4251
1	ah , one of my favorite sandwich combos in the burgh ... pork and banana sandwich , with conch chowder and sweet potato fries . the combination of savory and sweet in all three make for one of those addictive meals that you inhale before you even have a change to realize what happened . the fiancee and i also periodically venture down for the standard big burrito brunch fare , which my eggs benedict did n't disappoint . great bar and a decent draft selection that 's worth checking out every once in awhile .	4251
1	finally had the pleasure of trying kaya ! food was wonderful ! staff were all very nice ! portions were large for the price ! great little place with great flavor !	4251
1	best fish tacos i 've ever had - and that 's coming from a california native . excellent food and the jerk wings were great too .	4251
1	i love kaya . this place just exudes a fun and friendly atmosphere , and is the only place i know of where you can order tapas in pittsburgh . they 're all delicious , and if you 've never tried alligator you can do that here too .	4251
1	i 've been wanting to come here for months , and finally went tonight for a friend 's birthday . it did not disappoint . highlights : a festive hip vibe without being over-the-top ; happy hour drink deals ( half price on all drinks ) ; very tasty guacamole ; and huge portions of delicious and unique-tasting food . i had the jamaican green curry with shrimp , and ca n't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow . my meal was a bit pricey ( $ 21 ) , but given that it really was two full portions ( three more moderate portions ) , i feel like i got my money 's worth . i 'll be back .	4251
1	atmosphere , food , drinks are great . not too many places i would give a 5 star but this is the exception . i 've eaten here a few times and each time has been phenomenal . coming from a vegetarian that says a lot . the rainbow salad is fantastic .	4251
1	kaya was highly recommended online and by our hotel , and it was our first stop in pittsburgh which was also the first stop on our honeymoon . it was delicious ! cold beer , corn and lentil beignets as an appetizer , caribbean rainbow salad with crispy tofu added , and tempura avocado bahn mi tacos with waffle fries . it was a perfect , hearty meal . check it out ! it 's beautiful , cozy , and we had great service .	4251
1	kaya is great ! the bean dip is sooooooo good . i love salsas and dips but this has to be one of my favorite bean dips ever . the flank steak salad was great also . the smoky flavor is great and the dressing just really makes it flavorful . i 'd def eat there again . next time dinner though .	4251
1	this is an amazing place ! great atmosphere , very clean , beautiful bar , and most importantly , great food ! shoot for the fish tacos ; yum ! ! ! the only reason i did n't rate this a 5 star was due to the service being quite slow and lackluster . other than that , go now !	4251
1	the rainbow salad is the salad you 've been waiting for . lovely restaurant and attentive service too .	4251
1	another excellent big burrito eatery but this time island fusion . all the fish dishes are super .	4251
1	one of my absolute favourite restaurants in pittsburgh ! ! ! for a few hours infused with friends , martinis , and delicious culinary fare , i feel like i took a flight south to the caribbean ! i even leave saying things like , `` eh man ! '' it 's so classy and cool , and the staff is friendly as can be . must go here again asap .	4251
1	fish tacos are consistently delicious ! i get them every time ( or convince my husband to , so i can have a bite ) . still love this place !	4251
1	i went to kaya for lunch with a yunzer friend . veg options were n't abundant , but the lone veg lunch entree , jamaican green curry , was solid . i particularly enjoyed the saffron rice . decor and service were both pleasing . another success pulled off by the big burrito restaurant group !	4251
1	love this place . get the black bean dip .	4251
0	very overpriced for what you get . i had the skirt steak which was stringy and tough . i 've had much better meals at mad mex . our server was extremely impersonal and we were rushed out . will not return .	4251
0	after many years of enjoying and recommending kaya , i am reluctantly forced to downgrade it from 4.5 stars to 2.5 . as uncharacteristic as it is for a big burrito group establishment , i must sadly report that the service and food quality have diminished to the point of consistent disappointment .	4251
0	what is it with you guys ? you all really need to eat something amazing before you say this is as good as you think this is . they let people vape here . wtf ? the cocktails are watery and dont get the dark and stormy . it is a chain restaurant but calling a row of tables in bar a `` real '' restaurant ? no , this is a bar with tables . also , caribbean ? no , latin american maybe ... but i have never seen this stuff on a menu bahamas . over priced ? you betcha ... do men in pgh not take take off baseball caps ever in `` nice '' places . mediocre .	4251
0	disappointing - service was very slow , the food was unexceptional . i think we got the `` b '' team on sunday .	4251
0	what a bummer . totally overpriced and overcooked fish . per the servers suggestion , i got the porgy fish , which was completely overcooked and dry . pretty disappointing . mojito was decent and outdoor seating was nice . service was not overwhelmingly friendly , but it was fine .	4251
0	had to wait 30 more minutes for the phoned in pick up order after i arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes after my call . unacceptable for a burger and a salad .	4251
0	when you sit out side it smells like poop . smh i would never come back again . why would make people sit out side if you know it smells like poop ? ?	4251
0	worst service ever . 10 minutes affter seated and multiple staff walking past my table but no one poured my water and no one even acknowledged i was there let alone take an order . ca n't imagine how slow and horrible the rest of the service was . i got up and left . too bad because i had good food here in the past .	4251
0	the service was excellent . the restaurant was not exactly quiet and appropriate for a romantic dinner . most food was quite good . unfortunately for this vegetarian couple it was disconcerting to receive the tofu cracklins to find out that they 're deep fried in the same oil as the fish dinners . thus our tofu tasted like fish . we also thought that there was way too much dressing on the field greens .	4251
0	i stopped in for 2 beers as i had eaten a late lunch so this review is for that only . pros : interesting and unique atmosphere including decor and music , , , diverse yet not a overwhelming selection of drafts and liquor . lows : quite simply rude , curt and unacceptable service from the 2 bartenders ( lets call them the `` richard cabezas '' to keep with the theme ) ask them a question and get a one word answer unless they were correcting me about something and that was combined with an eye roll . just did n't feel welcomed and comfortable which is super rare for me anymore and lets just say i will not be returning .	4251
0	another terrible experience at a big burrito restaurant . this is probably the 10th bad experience i 've had at a big burrito restaurant . usually it 's mad mex , but this time it was kaya . i walked in and asked for a table for two and a half . the hostess who did n't make eye contact with me , informed me there was nothing but outside seating available . it 's funny because there was over half the room available inside . her claims over reserved tables were unwarranted , there were plenty of tables open and were n't being seated for another 45 minutes . avoid this dump .	4251
0	do you have this issue where you really want to like a place and keep going back only to wish you had n't ? we do , with this place . the one consistent item we like is the black bean dip . we order this every time and it rises up above every other item we have ordered . please kick me if i walk in again . i warn myself but i do n't listen .	4251
0	i 've been to kaya in the past and it was great . however , it appears to be experiencing a rough go of it lately . i went for lunch and ordered the jerk chicken . the menu describes it as a `` tropical chop salad , romaine , flour tortillas , mango , pineapple , cucumbers , tomatoes , cilantro , avocado . '' what i received was chicken atop a pile of pineapple with some slices of avocado on the side . the redemption of the meal was the wonderful chowder and some good wine .	4251
0	planned on lunch there after reading the great reviews . we started with the black bean dip . when i noticed it was microwaved , we quickly paid our tab and went elsewhere to eat . this is a neat little place with a cool jamaican atmosphere , but the really have to lose the microwave . i can make microwave dinners at home .	4251
0	underwhelming . we got the chicken and waffles and the waffles tasted like eggos waffles from the freezer and the chicken was wayyyyy too dry . fish tacos were okay but fish was also too dry . would be not returning .	4251
0	particularly bad food in a neighborhood that sells good food . weird unseasoned fish tacos and bitter plaintain chips . yuck . i would not return .	4251
0	food was good but our wait staff made the experience regrettable . at first we could n't tell if he was sarcastic and joking but after multiple interactions , realized the waiter was being extremely rude . every time a friend asked for a drink he would roll his eyes , make comments about how long we were taking to finish , and told us we could n't order menu items because they were getting low and needed them for other dishes . i emailed the restaurant privately to discuss this incident but received no response .	4251
0	was asked to review this for fiancee . she went there with friends for drinks on a this evening ( sunday ) and waited about 20 minutes to be served at bar ( bar was not busy ) before finally giving up . was walking out of place and made a mention of this to the doorman who said thanks , have a nice day , and f*** off . nice manners	4251
0	just , seriously -- do n't come here . the food is so repulsive that i 'm surprised they 're still in business . i actually am having trouble revisiting the food we ordered there enough to just write this review . also , despite what you hear , the cocktails suck . do n't waste your time .	4251
0	jerk chicken quesadilla was extremely soggy on one side . pricey beer . loved sitting outside and people watching though .	4251
0	i ate here recently and was fairly underwhelmed . i had the black bean quesadilla with pineapple . it was bland and not very flavorful . i could have gotten a better quesadilla at mad mex . i was disappointed , as others have raved about this place . even the guacamole appetizer was a bit bland .	4251
0	the food and drinks are terrible . we ordered tropical guacamole and it was watery and full of pineapples , i 'm not sure avocados were even involved in that situation ... we had the poke tostadas , which nearly made me sick and i love raw fish . these were recommended by our waitress , who charged us full price for them even though we hated them and did n't eat them . we arrived during happy , which would have been lovely if our drinks did n't taste like straight tequila . and everything was extremely salty . the restaurant has a nice intimate atmosphere , but lacks the culinary talent and service to make it worthwhile .	4251
0	the food was not great . the wine also sucked . there are other better options available around . this is not the best food for the kind of price i paid . for the basic appetizer like chips and salsa , i found that the chips were burnt . very average food .	4251
0	ordered the flank steak with coconut rice . looked excellent and steak was cooked as i asked ( medium rare ) . however it arrived mushy and the sauce was flavorless and thick ( like a gelatin ) . it was also overpriced at $ 23 . i would n't return here .	4251
0	the beginning of the meal was the best part of the meal . the calamari was excellent and it went downhill from there . we order the conch fritters which came out burnt and we ordered the flank steak sandwich which was average and the side salad was terrible ! i would also have to say one of the most annoying things is that our waiter smelled of cigarettes which was really disgusting ! the last thing i will say about this restaurant is that they contacted me after the above post stating management would contact me to discuss my issues and now a week later and nothing . it just shows me they do n't care about their customers !	4251
1	jamocha shakes , yeah ! our family was hungry and looking for something fast but a little different . we turned into this arby 's off peoria . i knew we were going to get jamocha shakes , but we also picked up 2 crispy chicken clubs . the bacon was lovely and the chicken was crispy and flavored acceptably . my son enjoyed his chicken cordon bleu very much . of course , we devoured our deliciously seasoned fries . although the bill was pricier than other fast food joints , we enjoyed our meal . jamoch shakes are still 5 stars !	4252
1	i love their french dip ! ! i did n't wait long at all in the drive thru , great customer service with delicious food !	4252
1	amazing ! ! ! ! best au jus sauce ever ! splendid customer care ! definitely coming back to this location again : )	4252
1	i am a care provider for adults with developmental disabilities and we were greeted by a cashier by the name of shawn who is absolutely the most sweetest and compassionate person i have come across in a very long time she not only went out of her way to make sure that they had everything they wanted but also took time out of her busy schedule to sit down with us for a bit . she looked at them for the human beings they are not for their disability .	4252
1	i eat at arby 's a lot . i have been to a number of different locations and out of all the ones i have been to . this one has always come out on top on all counts food , customer service , accuracy and speed of service .	4252
1	i eat at arby 's a lot . i have been to a number of different locations and out of all the ones i have been to . this one has always come out on top on all counts food , customer service , accuracy and speed of service .	4252
1	i have to point out credit where it is due : to the lady working the drive thru around 4:30 pm today- your attitude rocks ! i know how hard it can be to have a job working in a fast food place and it is definitely doubled when working drive thru so when i find someone with an extremely positive and happy attitude i have to point it out ! food was tasty and hot as usual , thank you , and the turnovers were great ! i 'm glad to find someone with as positive an attitude as yours working in my area ! i hope you never lose that calm and competent attitude !	4252
1	the furnishings were clean & updated . had greasy smell when walked in door , but i expect that from fast food establishment . everything we ordered was exceptionally fresh . the bread was fresh , staff sliced the roast beef fresh . the cooking area appears clean and the staff was friendly . i 'm glad we stopped in . $ 15 for two to eat ( drank water ) and one yummy salty caramel shake . almost didnt stop in because of last review . and , they play american country music if anyone is interested ( im not fond of it , but it is different for phoenix , az ) .	4252
0	waited in drive thru for 10 min . when i got to window my chicken still needed to cook so they asked me to pull around . i smiled and said ok . i waited for 5-6 more min before the guy came out with my food . he said oh sorry , we ran out of beef . i didnt order any beef . .. i had two kids in the car one being 3 months old crying . and my chicken wasnt even hot ! i am pretty sure that they forgot about me .	4252
0	i just ordered a salad and it had at least three things wrong . i asked for no tomatoes and it was covered in them . i received the wrong dressing and was missing my sauce . the salad was also supposed to have bacon but that was missing too ( and had little cheese ) .i ended up with almost $ 9 for a bowl of lettuce and a small soda . i wo n't be back..	4252
0	this is the slowest drive-thru ever . i waited for 25 minutes with two cars in front of me ... what ever happened to `` please pull into a parking space and we 'll bring it out to you '' to avoid holding up the whole line ? cashier apologized , asked me if i wanted sauce and offered free chocolate pastry . guess what ? no sauce and no chocolate pastry to be found in my bag . seriously , if i ever want fast food in my area again i 'll just drive the extra mile to sonic .	4252
0	the kid at the counter needs to learn to balance taking orders and filling orders . the food was stacking up . and he kept taking orders . when he got around to filling the orders . he was mixing things up . they lost my order and had to remake it .	4252
0	service is sub-rate at this arby 's i was locked in the drive thru for 35 minutes of total disrespect to clientele . when i asked why i was told walk in customers were more important . i 'll never return to this location which is sad because it 's in my area .	4252
0	they always get my order wrong always ! ! ! ! last time i came and went through drive thru i told my bf check the bags cause they are notorious for missing an item or two or getting the order wrong . sure enough they were missing my potato cakes and turnover ugh i can see once or twice making mistakes but every time ? ? ? ? and i come here randomly like once a year or 2 times in a month for 6 years and always get it wrong ! absolutely terrible i worked at arby 's i know what it entails this is unacceptable	4252
0	sat in line forever . no one in line in the drive through . how is that there is a wait ? lady told me she would be with me in a minute . what they doing ? lazy . i just left . 6/5/2016 at 740pm	4252
0	i went into arby 's today to try the blt they are advertising as 2 for $ 6.00 . i ask to order just one as it was just for me . the counter person ask the shift supervisor how much one would cost . her snippy answer was $ 6.40 for one . i ask is the correct and was told yes ! i said thanks and left never to return again .	4252
1	to put it simply taco bell is the bomb . no not every taco bell is created equal . this taco bell out waterworks mall is superior to all others in the region . that my be an exaggeration but hey that 's how i feel . so many fond memories with my family and friends eating at this taco bell . no trip to waterfront is complete with out eating here first . the restaurant is kept clean , the foods comes out quick and they are not skimpy on the taco fillings and plus they serve some menu items from pizza hut , that 's a plus in my book .	4253
1	weather it be for stoners , drunk people , or people who are trying to dine on american- mexican food ; it will always have a special place in my heart . the food is always cooked fresh , the pizza is kinda eh , unless it 's straight out the oven . overall i would give it 4 stars , when it 's busy it 's the worst though .	4253
1	i ordered 3 items in the drive thru on a slow sunday night . when i got to the window the woman was very polite . i waited maybe 2-3 minutes for my food and when i got it , everything was hot and fresh . a lot of times the potatoes are hit or miss , but at this location they came fresh from the fryer . this is a really good taco bell .	4253
1	pretty much like most combined taco bell/pizza hut locations . fast , efficient service with good and accurate food preparation . you either like their unique spin on food or not . myself , i am a huge fan !	4253
0	rude workers , awful food , crappy taco bell , they are to bust having an attitude and slamming that drive up window on you , they do n't have no time for a thing like customer service ...	4253
0	this has got to be the slowest taco bell anywhere on earth . pretty sure i could have gone to the grocery store next door bought all of the stuff and made it at home before i could have been served here . the line did n't move for more than 20 mins and i was stuck and could n't even leave .	4253
0	i have been waiting for my food for over 10 minutes . other people here are claiming they have been waiting for over 20 minutes . not cool . there are a couple of unhappy customers . a lady just asked to get refunded and the food was out literally in 5 seconds . the service is super slow , at least they are friendly . may be they are understaffed ? i do n't know . the place is almost empty .	4253
0	i have tried to give this place a number of chances after consistently waiting an inordinate amount of time each time i go . just went again two days ago and waited at least 10 minutes , after finally getting to the window , and after all of that , they forgot my drinks . had to wait another five minutes until they took two more orders from other drive-thru customers to finally get my drinks . it 's a shame because the location is very convenient , but their service is extraordinarily slow for `` fast food '' . the only reason i did n't give it one star is because the food is good .	4253
1	my boyfriend and i spent a fantastic friday night drinking at this bar while on our recent mini-vacation to calgary . tasty non-traditional bar munchies including garlic fries and corn on the cob . best bartender ever . i 'll say again . the best bartender ever . we enjoyed free entertainment with the quazi-country band upstairs and could 've gone downstairs for even more rock & roll had we wished . as a tourist , i was too absorbed with the local flavor happening all around me as the night wore on and the patrons got more and more intoxicated and the bartender got less and less willing to tolerate their insanity . thanks for making our trip to calgary more awesome palomino .	4254
1	when you go , try the cheap parking lot in the alley behind their patio . then go inside and get a sampler platter of their smoked meats . the brisket is my favorite .	4254
1	loveeeee palomino . food is delicious . huge portions . there is live music as well . great place to eat when you can enjoy it outside .	4254
1	i only stopped in for a beer and had the starter ribs but that dry rub is delicious . i will have to come back for a full meal experience one day ( soon ? ! ) .	4254
1	went here for supper with a few friends . atmosphere is really neat , lots of cool decorations and things to look at all around the bar . on our way walking over to the palomino we could smell the bbq from a block away - this seemed like a good sign . the ribs and brisket were amazing , the garlic fries were super garlic-y but i love garlic so that was fine with me ! this is some of the best bbq i have had in calgary . my friend said the bourbon apples were amazing and would recommend ordering them . i will definitely be coming back to try out more on their menu !	4254
1	ok , to setup expectations here ... this is a dive/trendy/bbq place . probably not the place to take your date on the first night out , but if you find they like it sloppy , then definitely this is a great second date spot ! ! super casual , odd building , great food and awesome servers . live music in the basement too ( check the website for schedules ) . go ! edit : spelling	4254
1	not the same `` country '' atmosphere i remembered from years ago but the food and service are still awesome !	4254
0	i had high expectation of this place from reading the other reviews . i do n't know if it was just an off night or of all these people are wrong . service was soooo slow and our server was never anywhere to be seen . took her ages to take our order . food took ages to come , and it was cold . plus when we asked for the bill it took her 5 mins to bring the credit card machine over . maybe they were busy , but for the size of the place and the amount of people in there i really do n't think this was	4254
0	just arrived in calgary and decide to eat at this establishment . we grab a seat at the bar and the first thing i notice is a sign above the bar that reads `` keep working hard , millions of people on welfare depend on you '' . i am in shock . is this suppose to be funny ? ? ? ?	4254
0	so from service to food to atmosphere everything sucked . messed up my drink that i had to wait for 20 mins . and food was greasy and for a bbq place they have no idea how to make it . you will be disappointed .	4254
0	i usually enjoy the palomino . i work for a large office downtown and i wanted some of my coworkers to taste the palomino 's fare . 7 of us showed up friday afternoon only to be turned out by an rude hostess . the restaurant was not full but apparently putting 2 tables together would had been too hard . the food is usually good but not worth the crappy experience we received . you can bet your bottom dollar that i will make sure that my company never hold events or order catering from the palomino .	4254
0	children not welcome for dinner . that would have been nice to know when i made a reservation for 10 on a saturday night . instead , we only found out when we showed up at 7pm . needless to say , finding last minute alternate arrangements for 10 is not easy . a noisy bbq joint sounds like a great place for a large family dinner but apparently their liquor license does not allow minors after 4pm . this should be abundantly clear on the website as well as on the phone when making a reservation .	4254
0	a big disappointment , the cooks obviously have limited knowledge of real smoked bbq and no pride of what it is they serve . our waitress was friendly but the food was a disgrace . the ribs were dry as well as the brisket that was served cold . the sides or `` fixings '' were sloppy and lacked soul . this restaurant has an open kitchen that allows clientele to have a view on the cooks as they work . clearly the standards are low and the kitchen personnel lacks experience , pride and energy .	4254
0	it was right across the street from the hotel where we were staying ( and we could see their patio right from the room window ) , so this is where we had lunch over the weekend . between the somewhat lackluster service ( by a waitress who admittedly did n't seem to care ) and the rather bland food , i was far from impressed with this place . the caesar salad had some zest , but for a place that seems intent on meat based meals , the burger i had lacked any real appeal whatsoever . it made me long for my vegetarian days .	4254
1	i have stayed at this hotel numerous times . it 's a great choice for a budget option close to the freeway . the concierge is always friendly and the breakfast is pretty good ! many of the rooms are updated and the beds are very comfortable .	4255
1	best western phoenix metro center they have a whole new management team they 're headed up by new manager chris the front desk lady named jane as well as most of the people there are worthy of many many orchids a few touches needing cleanup but it 's a very fine property ... nice pool good free breakfast and a superb staff ... all hardworking in very likable mahalo nui loa from hawaii to their fine staff p t brent hawaii	4255
1	completely acceptable best western experience . no frills , but free wifi , free breakfast , clean rooms , cable tv , clean bathroom , swimming pool , nice location right in the freeway . not the nicest bw i 've ever stayed at , but got the job done and was a nice experience .	4255
1	dog friendly . clean and well maintained . decent hot breakfast including waffles , eggs , potatoes , sausage , oatmeal , fruit , yogurt , juice , and coffee . very friendly and hospitable night staff . you can tell they take pride in their establishment . could n't ask for more from an economy motel !	4255
1	the staff here is very friendly and accommodating . free breakfast is a plus ! the pool is nice , rooms are very clean , and it 's across the street from a mall .	4255
1	very clean hotel . we had a smoking room on the third floor . my only complaint is that there was n't a fridge in the room ( but they do have a microwave ) . besides that , it is a very nice place to stay .	4255
1	amazing considering the price , staff were great and cleaner trinidad stood out with his above and beyond service . good news , they are remodeling too . only advice , have plain scrambled eggs as a choice for the non meat eaters . thanks	4255
1	good value . nice lobby , good breakfast selection . rooms are clean and newer . the pool is ok , the hot tub is small . close to i 17 and easy access to downtown	4255
0	10/16 to 10/17 2015 . under staffed , employees stressed with a over booked night . rooms were not ready at 10:30 at night . had to go find sheets and towels for the night . offered nothing but an apology .	4255
0	one star is very generous for this place . i paid for a executive room with fridge and microwave but that did not happen . the front desk was rude , the room smelt awful , and the bed was very uncomfortable . also the free breakfast was a joke , it was super cold and gross ! never stay here ! ! !	4255
0	stayed here for 2 nights . it was awful . i felt very uncomfortable in the room , could n't sleep . we ended up checking out at 4am the day we were leaving.. the hotel is right next to the highway so you hear the cars/trucks/motorcycles all night long . just a very uncomfortable hotel atmosphere . also , they charge a $ 2.50/day service charge . they over charged me $ 5 , but when i called , they did reverse the charge .	4255
0	this area is god awful . the service was `` eh '' . the room had crickets in in , which i chased around and tried to smash . and the shower had no hot water . i should 've brought my own tent if i wanted to go camping !	4255
0	wow this was a tough one . staff was nice but as they told us another weekend short staffed day . no room avail at 4:30 took a king room with nothing not even hbo . i booked a double queen w fridge and microwave . 4 night stay and on the 4th night got the double queen room . packed hotel with some staff trying really hard others not so much . what u expect at a less expensive hotel . no soap , shower curtain or towels but a nice note promising to come back in a few hours with the supplies and they did about 5pm or so . could be better if it was properly staffes .	4255
0	not the greatest , but i 've stayed at worse . my view is a homeless encampment .	4255
0	horrible ! backs up to the 17 , fine but on thursdays there is a car show somewhere near and they do burnouts down the frontage road and the parking lot ! good luck sleeping and i 'm a car guy ! the roads are super small and the neighborhood is a bit sketchy as well . like park under light sketchy . even the bestwestern 800 number says they have a reputation . luckily i was just passing through town ... .	4255
0	we made our reservations using expedia . they said we could check in at 3 pm . got here & were told no check in until 4 pm . went to the motorcycle show & came back at 6 pm . one of the two rooms was ready . they had not even begun to clean the room . finally get another room . then the tv remote is missing . try to call the front desk & no answer . walk back down to desk & get one . have to wait on maintenance man . i will never stay here again ! ! ! i 'm giving zero stars ! ! ! this is horrible .	4255
1	not the easiest to find if you 're just drifting along dufferin , but it 's the kind of place that rewards the traveler with a piece of mind and home-style cooking from the eastern block . ever wondered what it would be like to have a plate of authentic perogies , or mashed potatoes with chicken kiev ? moldova is the place that easily unites three generations under its roof for a dinner - as it is common in eastern europe . feeling nolstagic ? welcome home .	4256
1	great place , delicious food , wonderful and warm atmosphere with great service . i had grilled seabream and it was to die for . loved this place . will come again .	4256
0	mediocre food , service is horrible . got a borsh soup which was not fresh you can see it in the picture . salad was not fresh eather , could smell that it was in the fridge for a long time . and in the end they gave us wrong bill ! check your bill ! never coming back !	4256
0	i ` ve been there and what gives them these two stars is food . but the service is bad . i think they expect you to pay for a smile from the waitres cause you ` re not gon na get one for free . and the worst is mandatory tipping plus they expect yuo to tip more just asking how much you ` d like to tip .	4256
1	pricy , but friendly folks . hit and miss on parts stock . did n't have a common fel pro gasket in stock . best to call first !	4257
1	shout out to roberto for helping me with some wiper blades ! he went above and beyond and had a pleasant attitude the entire time !	4257
0	each time i have come to this location lately they have demonstrated complete incompetence . why ca n't they hire and keep knowledgeable staff ? their prices are high , too . i do n't think i will be returning soon .	4257
0	the manager of this store , i think his name is ron , is probably the rudest person i ever met . he seems to have a chip on his shoulder and is not friendly or helpful . the rest of the staff is mediocre . it must be a requirement to work there . go to another place if you want good service and polite staff . he is not management material .	4257
1	visiting from new jersey this week and wandered into hurley 's because i love irish pubs . went to two other ones in montreal first and they did n't compare . rod was a terrific bartender and incredibly friendly . the beer is about $ 8 a pint but that 's worth it for the authentic feel of ireland ! i was in ireland last year and this place really was like hanging out in dublin . we were at hurley 's twice this week because we enjoyed it so much the first night . highly recommend !	4258
1	very good bar . the food is great and not all that expensive . if you want a beer , a black and tan is definitely the way to go . the live bands they have are usually great and the staff is very accommodating .	4258
1	my wife and i ate here last time we were in town , the food was great , the beer was great . mark was our server and he rocked . we started with nachos , they were well cooked and full of toppings . followed it up with the lamb stew which was excellent ! my wife had the club sandwich , it was huge . great bread , awesome topping and the fries it came with were amazing . go here !	4258
1	this place is both relaxing and fun at the same time . one of the best irish pubs in the city . you never get bored of the interior design of the place with many things you discover every time you go there . staff are friendly and on top of their job . the food has a good quality . you can find a very good selection of beers , whiskeys and other drinks . later in the evening specially on weekends you can enjoy live music as well .	4258
1	from quaint and quiet , to loud and boisterous , hurley 's has it all ! depending on time of the night you can have a quiet conversation or hear a local band . either way , the cider is good , the space comfortable and like a pub you 'd want to be your local . of course good company is important , but i feel like you could probably strike up a conversation with a stranger and have just as good of a time here .	4258
1	poutine and guinness as well as the staff is on point ... . come one , come all to this gem of a pub	4258
0	do not order the fish and chips . it was inedible . i went home and had a bagel , which was much better .	4258
0	good atmosphere but was hot and food was not superb . chicken tenders are the frozen kind . sweet potato fries were good however . go for a drink and skip the meal .	4258
0	waitress was a complete bitch . i had to go inside to ask for service on the outside patio . i asked `` is there someone working outside ? '' she replied `` uhh yeah ? '' i said okay can you send them out please she replied `` it 's me why what 's the problem '' just wanted some service she laughed and continued being her uneducated self sitting on the counter talking to someone in the back . trash	4258
0	very very slow service . 15 minutes have passed and still am not able to order . this is quite amazing . do n't expect to have a quick beer . it just wo n't happen .	4258
0	very very bad . first of all , the service is bad . we had to go inside and find our waitress ourselves , and everything is slow . the food is also not good , the burger meat patty taste bad , and the bread bun is bad , and i do n't like they put blue cheese in the burger , it ruins everything . and with such bad service and bad food , they expect at least 15 % tips . worst pub i ever been to .	4258
0	long wait for a waitress to take our order and an inordinate amount of time waiting for her to bring two guinnesses to the table . and then a long wait for the check . we were going to stay and order some food but bailed . i do n't be back . no wi-fi , or at least if there was , i was n't able to connect to it .	4258
1	very friendly and professional . we would give ken 10 stars if possible . ken and his team are the best . we have had 6 mortgages and 2 refinances through the years.this was absolutely the best experience , expedient and great knowledge they know exactly what they are doing . they kept us informed every step of the way with frequent e-mails , if we had a question and called we where never told he is busy or out of the office someone had an answer immediately . gary & michele	4259
1	we had a recommendation on this company from a few people . i did n't know if they did loans out of state but after speaking with ken he said they do loans in several states . our loan went smoothly thanks to ken sarna and his team at jfk .	4259
1	i will update this seeing how things turn out , btw this company knowingly allows some other company / single agent to get all their calls . so when you google `` phone number for leaderone financial '' you get the phone number for some other guy who answers as some other company name . not very re-assuring when you 've sent all your confidential docs to a company . i know leaderone does not control google rank but they continue to do business with that person , obviously it is acceptable to leader one since they have not cut ties .	4259
0	got a pre approval from these guys last year while relocating to vegas . took the pre approval to the realtor and once we found the home , neither us or the realtor could get a hold of them . as in , they just fell off the face of the earth . no calls or emails returned , nothing . they just vanished . we ended up having to find another lender in a hurry and thankfully we were able to close a deal . but not thanks to this company . worst and most bizarre experience ever . our loan `` agent '' was kc mccool , but not cool at all . avoid at all costs unless you like stress .	4259
0	i worked with gloria witt and i had the worst experiences ever . premature pre approval . crazy changes after being in escrow like increasing down payment refinancing car etc.. lost escrow deposit . unprofessional business practices and false promises . please do research and do n't be a victim like me .	4259
0	dealing with mike dean has been terrible . surprised to find out about his racist & anti semitic views on people during working hours . lots of business lost .	4259
1	i was here a few days ago on june 7-8 2014 . the room was kind of small . i liked the fact that they had a fridge and a microwave . the pool was smaller than i expected to be but they had a hot tub . everything was good .	4260
1	great ! thanks for letting me use your pool and hot tub . i stayed at the comfort inn nextdoor and it was a fleapit . glad someone had the door propped right open for anyone to walk in , which is what i did . probably should do something about that , which would be fine , had someone not also left the pool door unlocked too . well while my wife and mother were at the adele concert , i had a great time ! thanks again , and maybe have that security problem fixed . xoxo mr . splashy	4260
0	arrived after a long day , and was ready for a nap . went to lift the sheets and found so many nasty stains . called the front desk and had someone come up to change the sheets only to find that the new sheets were also stained . my sheets were replaced 3 times and they still had stains . the girl at the front desk was very nice and tried to make it up to us , but i was very disgusted . i wanted to leave but could n't find another hotel near by with openings the next day and in my price range . i will never stay at a best western ever again .	4260
0	looking for a place the rest after a long day ? a hot tub to sooth those achey muscles after a long drive ? somewhere that you can find a bite to eat ? keep looking . this is not the place for you . no points on all accounts . the one star is for the nice cleaning staff , do n't let it get to your head .	4260
1	so bomb ! never disappoints . staff is always really down to earth and nice , cooks are always on point .	4261
1	love smash burger ! ! such yummy food ! i go here all of the time and have to say i get the best service especially from meghan ! she is so sweet and efficient even when it is really busy she takes the time to ask me if i need anything and knows my regular order , the delicious chicken sandwich ! she is great ! !	4261
1	sooooooooo good ! tasty tasty mar-dee-dee-delicious make you wan na love all yo enemies & forget about the rest . way to go 'smashburger all though you forgot my salad , i still like this restaurant .	4261
1	absolutely my favorite burger place . the garlic , olive oil and rosemary fries are an absolute must ! ! ! ! !	4261
1	i never have a bad experience when i go to smashburger , i fervently wish they 'd install a location up here in prescott .	4261
1	really good place . very good burgers . good atmosphere , does not have too-loud music like 5guys . the staff here are good so far . only reason i did not give them 5stars was fries , too small . i like bigger fries more like johny rockets .	4261
1	i love this location . the employees are super sweet and attentive and the burgers are awesome . i ca n't help to stop and eat here every time i drive by it . lol ! i love you smash burger . you guys keep doing you.. it 's working . see you tomorrow . lol	4261
1	after having a horrendous experience at a different restaurant yesterday , i *had* to go to smash burger today to restore my faith in restaurants . thank you sb for the awesome service and amazing food , as usual .	4261
1	the burgers are great ! their meat is fresh , never frozen and you taste it ! a must for a fast lunch . you should be there before 12:00pm . then it gets quite crowded ... it 's yummy but not cheap . burger , fries and a coke : 11.10 $	4261
1	great chicken sandwich with spinach , cucumbers , onions and goat cheese served on gluten free bun . thanks for offering that option to those of us who ca n't eat wheat and want bread the places that offer gluten free buns are few . counter help was incredibly polite and sweet . it 's nice to know that some people still are being taught manners . my hope for humanity was unsmashed by visiting this place . it 's my new burger joint ! ! ! !	4261
1	i decided to try this place out since i hear about it on the radio all the time lately . omg , i mean i could just die , they have the best shakes to go with the meals , i was going to get a whole meal but i probably would n't make it out the door so i just got a shake , they are hagen daz , i believe , chocolate , ohh just let me die with one in my hand ...	4261
1	a great burger place usually with fast and great service . it think it is infinitely better than red robin . they have a great variety of burgers all with fresh ingredients . my personal favorite is the arizona burger . fresh guacamole and jalapenos ! yup ! their milkshakes are also amazing ! the best is oreo or salted caramel ! give it a try ! i do n't think you will be disappointed !	4261
1	love love love this location ! i work incredibly close to this smashburger location and whenever i get the craving for junk food ( which honestly , occurs more often than it should ) , i drive over and order some food to go . buffalo fries are addictive ! tastes like wings but are french fries . best thing in the world . staff is incredibly cordial and welcoming -- especially bret !	4261
1	the service is awesome and the food is great . it is located right off the 101 and elliot . super easy to get here . i ordered a regular smash burger with oreo milk shake along with fried sweet potatoes and fried onion as side dishes . the meat on the burger is super tender and juicy . it makes burgers from mcdonald doesnt look like food . milk shake portion is super generous . not only it is in a tall glass , they also give u extra on the side as well . the fried onion is a bit greasy but it is still delicious . fried sweet potatoes was mouth watering . i will definitely come back here again	4261
1	just ate there the other day and i was very happy with the service they provided after there was some confusion about what i had ordered , they sent it back it , fixed it , and it was delicious . smash burger is not the healthiest of places since it has a lot of grease but it does hit that hang over spot .	4261
1	ordering online to this location was extremely easy and convenient since you can prepay for your meal and select the time you want it ready . my arizona burger was made right on time and packaged very well with the modifications i requested ( no onions to avoid stinky onion breath at work ) . the burger itself tasted like your usual smashburger with great flavor and heat from the raw jalapeño . definitely a good place to get lunch !	4261
1	i love burgers , i have burgers about 5 times a week . today was my first smashburger , it was great i will definitely be back and recommend them .	4261
1	very good for barely more than most drive through joints . service is always good and atmosphere is friendly .	4261
1	stopped at smashburgers after a movie . i ordered the avocado club fries and a malt . it my friend had the colorado burger onion rings and a soda . we both left full and very satisfied . the burgers were very good as were the fries and onion rings . . pleasant and speedy service . will definitely go back .	4261
1	food was smashburger good . service was very friendly . had a four peaks peach ale with my lunch , yep they have four peaks in bottles . sat outside on the patio and enjoying the december sunshine . i can see this place getting full at lunch time , small parking lot up front but more in the back . come early and enjoy a burger .	4261
0	hopefully just the night , but this has been the slowest , dirtiest , smash burger i 've ever been to . all trash cans overflowing , staff moving really slow , and food took ages . not to mention they ran out of shakes at 645pm . bummer .	4261
0	i love smash burger in general but this location is bad . slow and bad customer service	4261
0	the service and food handling is marginal at best . the girl that took my order and handled the money also puts the food in the bag and on the trays without washing her hands . when i questioned her about it she had a bit of an `` attitude '' about it and she insisted that her hands do n't touch the food . however , wearing gloves would certainly insure that . although the foods ok , it 's not so great that it makes up for that experience . i wo n't be returning .	4261
0	counter service w/delivery to table . wife had avocado big burger , i had big burger w/ onion strings and guacamole . nice seating arrangement , very clean rest rooms . burgers were supposed to be medium rare , but were medium well , they were otherwise o.k . a block west of the 101 on eliot . for the money you can do better ,	4261
0	greasy and overpriced . hard pass . i 've given them a second and third chance , they have disappointed every single time . poor quality thrown together product , bad ! fries and burger should n't be that hard to create but they manage to do a hell of a job doing so . would not eat here again .	4261
0	better than average food but i 'm telling you the parking situation both here and at the baseline road store is horrible . update : smashburger must have a very unique & innovative training program for their shift leaders/managers . as i walk towards the cash register a few nights ago the guy who looked like he was either the shift leader or the manager says to me how 's it going `` boss '' . and when i did not respond to that because i think that is a very disrespectful way to greet a customer he says what can i get for you `` boss '' . this is a place of business ... not some gathering of the boys in the hood	4261
0	corporate crap . cold anaseptic ambiance , overpriced burgers , fries had so much extra oil i gave my car a lube job after dinner . place stinks !	4261
0	bad burger . mostly mustard and cheese . tiny beef patties . server said it was normal though .	4261
0	way to much salt on everything and i like salt but this was over the top . i was looking forward the the veggie fries but i could n't eat more than a few . the chicken was fatty , really fatty and flavorless aside from the layer of salt . my friend raves about the burgers so maybe that 's the way to go ... . honest to god i would n't eat here again for free . gross .	4261
0	trash burger was so bad i had to drink a whole can of coke and a cup of extra bold coffee just to begin the process of liberating my molested taste buds from the odious remnants of `` burger '' stubbornly clinging to my palette and degrading its integrity like barnacles cementing themselves to the hull of a vessel . short version : this place is cabbage .	4261
0	they did not give me the metal cup with my almost $ 5 shake ! if you are dining in and order a shake or malt you should get your shake glass and metal cup ! i 'll wait to go to denny 's for a shake next time !	4261
0	we ate here last night because my better half wanted a burger . i ordered the chicken sandwich with the red hot and bleu cheese . my better half ordered just a plain burger . the food was decent and the sweet potato fries and regular fries were good . the only thing that was strange was the small bun it bugged me . the bun seem to be very small for the chicken sandwich . i asked the staff what gives . the staff said that what they have because of the min wage hike . i was like okay . hopefully they will mention a option to upgrade the bun next time to a larger size .	4261
0	food can taste amazing if it was n't poured with salt . the burgers were super salty i was able to see the salt on top of the meat . the onion rings were also super salty . i could n't eat half of it . by the time i took a sip of my soda i felt that even that was salty . the salty burger and onion rings messed up my taste buds . second time this happens . will not be coming here anymore .	4261
0	i do love the food ... ... .but the app really sucks . i bought twice in a day and could not get the points for the 2nd purchase . this has happened a couple of times . then today , app says network issue at the printing location . please submit a picture through the need help button . well , there is no need help button and this is way too much work . so tired of this terrible app . will never use again and looking for another burger place now .	4261
0	first time here and what a mistake . dining room was dirty with food all over the floor . took to long to get the order , did not seam busy . got home with food and was given the wrong burger . would have just eaten it but not with jalapeños on it . went back to get the correct burger and got my money back . place was in even chaos when i was waiting for my burger . will not be back .	4261
0	this was our 3rd time at this location . 3 strikes i 'm out ! the first time computers were down . second time grissly chicken . today , third time , computers down again . will not be returning which is a shame because i love smashburger .	4261
0	absolutely rubbish . paid $ 45 for my family . portions small so expected quality . oh no . burgers were pink . fries where soo greasy . tables were messy . wo n't be back disappointed beyond belief	4261
0	was extremely disappointed with my visit today , usually the food is awesome not so much today , the smash fries were swimming in grease and my arizona burger bun tasted like it was day old . i can say after today i 'm not a smash fan anymore !	4261
0	stopped in for burgers on the way home . when we got home and unwrapped our food i was disappointed to find sloppily thrown together burgers that would rival your worst mcds experience . we wo n't be back	4261
0	do n't expect your food to be ready at the time you pick in your online order . they are always late and less than friendly about it . there are establishments with much better levels of service .	4261
1	love this bar ! cool place . there 's is no drug dealers or hustlers . whatever you wan na call it	4262
1	this place is a dive meets your favorite local movie store . cheap drinks and fun times . i was a fan !	4262
0	cheap drinks ... terrible menu it looks like every thing is from microwave so i just ate chips ... .the bartender was not friendly at all . she was somewhat inattentive and there was n't alot of people there . the size if the bar was a nice size with pool tables . however i will not be returning .	4262
0	dirty place , shady people , pool hustlers , and drug dealers . stay away . do n't go alone , watch out for pick pockets .	4262
1	these guys are really , really good . i 've had marco and tony and both those guys are solid in their trade . really , really glad i finally went in there after a workout at laf . my new place to get my cut .	4263
1	i recommend this place for adult and kids haircut . its a family owned place and the owner is very friendly .	4263
0	i have long hair and just wanted a trim . i found this place to be dirty . the guy dug around for scissors in a hair filled drawer .	4263
0	10 dollar hair cut is not true . walked out with 14 dollar bill plus extra charge for using my debit card ( they do n't take credit cards ) the haircut was good , a basic cut and trim . the up selling to buy shampoo at the beginning of the haircut was a bit of a turn off . also lots of dirty towels in sink and floor littered with hair . when i checked out the barber seemed more interested in counting his receipts for tips then thanking me for my business .	4263
1	we just bought a ford explorer platinum from capital ford . jared valenti was extremely helpful and went above and beyond with all our questions , features and logistics . the specific model we wanted was not in their dealership and they had to get it from elsewhere . jared made sure we had another explorer for a few days until our new car arrived as opposed to going back home with our trade-in . he made sure the new car was detailed to our level of satisfaction and explained all the features to us .	4264
1	exceptional service ! chris hess , our sales rep , was phenomenal ! got us in and out in under 3 hours !	4264
1	i do n't live in charolotte but when i 'm in town again and need service done to my car i will definitely come here . i had the pleasure of working with chrissy and another person ( do n't remember his name ) african american with glasses . he was very attentive and let me know what was going on with my car and how much it would be . very nice people in there .	4264
1	so helpful and have earned my business for life ! i am so happy that i called when 2 other businesses would n't even see me for a week they tried to help me over the phone . # lovethem ! thanks paul !	4264
1	very professional and courteous . i have been a customer for many years , since they were young ford . the service department are genuine and helpful , the customer service staff is friendly and helpful , and the sales staff knowledgeable . the last issue i had with my focus was attended to very promptly and corrected the issue in a timely manner . i have yet to ever experence anything but a professional treatment from capital ford , and in a time when customer service seems to be an afterthough for most companies , they are head and shoulders above the competition . great job ! thanks bobd	4264
1	ask for omar to be your sales consultant . he really knows the vehicles and options . was very professional and a pleasure to work with .	4264
1	good experience , the price advertised is what you get . had a very nice salesman named moose . made a counter offer and they took it . dealt very fairly with me and the process was fast .	4264
0	had a terrible experience with this dealership ... first they call you incessantly to get you to come in , which against my better judgement , i did despite the aggressive , one size fits all sales pitch . i got help from a salesman that knew less about the vehicle than i did . upon leaving , he promised to send me pricing on my trade and on the vehicle i was interested in within an hour . several text messages and 2 weeks later , still have n't heard anything . do n't waste your time here , there are plenty of dealerships around that would appreciate ones business and provide much better service .	4264
0	the worst ever . awful customer service , awful service team . total nightmare . the only reason they got 1 star was because you ca n't give 0 stars . still waiting on general manager to give me a call back about his poor employees .	4264
0	the overall experience was stressless , mainly because we already had financing in place . however after reviewing our credit report it was noted that several banks had hit our credit , without our consent . which never should have happened because we specifically told them not to run our credit plus we already had financing in place . not acceptable business practice and leads to mistrust and a lack of integrity .	4264
0	the service department has some definite problems . initially , i took my vehicle to capital ford for a recall . i was told it would take 4 hours to complete , so i leave the vehicle . i get home and i get a call that the vehicle is ready for pick up . i would have waited an hour for the installation . days later , i get a call to bring the vehicle back because the technician did not log the serial number from the part . unless , you like driving back and forth to capital ford , do n't use the service department .	4264
0	terrible . quick lane service is awful - almost unbearable . would skip this place . went in for a quick oil change . wound up waiting 2 hours . half the service not complete , no receipt for work done ... ..	4264
0	started the process of purchasing a car from them over the internet , but have now stopped after incessant calls and scripted messages . judging from the reviews present , they clearly engage in aggressive tactics that probably are n't customer friendly . will take my money elsewhere .	4264
0	this is an absolutely terrible dealership . very unethical business practices , hidden package fees , and a demeaning finance team that not only treats you like an idiot but is horribly incompetent and did n't even remotely meet compliance issues in regards to paperwork . avoid this place at all costs	4264
1	i had a great experience at this location last week . i had to come here instead of the 32nd st location , as they did not have the equipment in stock that i needed . connor at the counter , and a gentleman in the yard whose name i forgot ( but starts wit a `` j '' ) helped me and they went out of their way to solve a small towing problem . i appreciate a to z 's style of doing business like it should be , with the customer put first . not to mention , all of their employee 's are always appropriately dressed and professional , this is not something you often see anymore . definitely recommend .	4265
1	i planned my reception myself and used a-z for a big part of my site- ranging from the chairs to the generator to glasses and tables . the staff there , becky rodgers , in particular , was a joy to work with- very responsive and helpful ( which was great as my order changed a lot of times ) . she made sure my order was right and worked closely with me to ensure everything was perfect . they delivered and picked up everything exactly as promised and were very professional and fast . they also have tons to choose from and will help you make the best choice for your money . pricing was competitive too . highly recommend !	4265
1	i was very impressed with the customer service . while i was waiting for my equipment to be brought out at least five different people asked me if i was being helped . everyone was very courteous and the equipment worked perfectly . i wo n't hesitate to come back whenever i need to rent some equipment and i 'll recommend the store to others .	4265
1	this company is awesome ! it is very well run and all the staff is well trained and knowledgeable . i appreciate that they do not charge a damage waiver fee that actually covers nothing unlike other companies ; honest business ... . very refreshing ! i would highly recommend a to z for any project you have on tap ... . all their equipment is expertly serviced and ready for use . do n't go anywhere else , you will be wasting your time	4265
1	i rented some chairs and a stock tank for a party and my experience from the first call through post-party pick up was excellent . everyone was nice and professional and made the delivery and pick up a breeze . the chairs and stock tank were clean , and easy to unload from the delivery cart & super easy to reload as well . i would highly recommend them for party rentals .	4265
1	i rent from here often and have always had a good experience . the staff is friendly and knowledgeable . the service is quick , easy and the equipment and party rentals are reasonably priced .	4265
1	the service was prompt and friendly . i returned my rental shop vac the same day , and they saved me money by charging for a 4 hour rental instead of the 2 day . i would definitely come back .	4265
1	i received a call from bob brown the director of party sales regarding my previous disappointment . bob spent the time to look into my complaint and not only refunded the money for the linens that were not what i ordered but gave me a break on the other items we rented . thank you for going the extra mile and you can count on my returning in the future !	4265
0	have been renting yard equipment and trailers here for 14 years . the staff is always friendly . the pickup and drop off parking is kind of a mess . we rented high top bar tables and linen for a party for the first time this weekend . my wife requested shorter linens . we got long linen that was hanging on the ground . we did not want to damage anything so never even pulled out all but the one . asked for a refund but the office staff declined . the guys at the drop off were super nice and apologized about it . too bad , guess we will not be back .	4265
0	customer service is not a priority at this business . i was a die hard customer until a piece of equipment needed a repair during the warranty period . every time i spoke with someone i was told a different story as to why the repair was n't covered under the warranty and each time i spoke to someone about the repairs needed i received a different quote . i finally got them to agree to me paying for the parts and they would waive the labor . when it came time to pick up my equipment , i was told they had no record of my conversation and that they would never agree to that . i 'll go elsewhere !	4265
0	do not expect timely service ... .or really any service at all . thankfully , due to them not getting me a quote because `` they are busy '' , i found andrews party rentals and went with them for an event . also , as noted in other reviews , keep in mind that they will not actually bring the items to the location , but actually only dump them off curbside . maybe it 's just me , but i 'm not keen on dragging tables , linens , heaters , , etc off of the curb and into the actual location of the event . i gave them 1 star only because you have to in order to post a review .	4265
0	we have used a-z rents many times in the past , but this will probably be the last time . we had several problems with equipment that we recently rented . instructions were wrong and some of the parts were missing . we had to make two extra trips back to the store during the course of the rental . staff members and even the store manager were not empathetic . i called the corporate office to speak with someone to share my concerns , but my call has never been returned .	4265
0	perfect on the drop off of rented tables and chairs but when it came to pick up on the monday morning absolutely useless . my wife and i took a day off work with the plan that we would go out for the day once these people had picked up but when i had n't heard from them by 11.40 i decided to call . the response was we are running behind schedule because monday 's are always busy but we should be there in another couple of hours so there goes our vacation day wasted . i would not recommend this company .	4265
0	watch out for this place ! they say they do n't have any hidden fees but they will get you in other ways . i called twice to rent an asphalt roller and they said they had it in stock . i drove all the way down there to pick it up . after getting there they said i have to rent their trailer for an additional $ 80 . they also told me the wrong ball size for my hitch but offered to sell me one for double the normal price . after i agreed to all their extra terms they informed me the asphalt roller was n't even there ! thanks for wasting my saturday morning jackasses ...	4265
0	do n't waste your time here . i rented a rotisserie and grill here for a large party i was having . the rotisserie did not work at all , which made cooking a 55 pound pig almost impossible . not only was the equipment faulty the staff were extremely rude . they were not patient at all over the phone , which should have been a red flag from the beginning . a to z rentals ended up ruining something important to me . if i would have seen all of the one and two star reviews on here before i rented i would have saved a lot of time , money , and heartache .	4265
0	after being on hold for 20 minutes and being transferred to several people , someone finally offered to help me . i needed to rent tables , chairs , and more for a birthday party . long story short- they have horrible customer service and i was told there is no guarantee on time of delivery . they were unable to work with me and could not offer a solution . if you are looking for a party rental company- call michael at rentaffordable.com in tempe . a-z is awful .	4265
1	gorgeous theatre i was thoroughly impressed by the outer and inner decor . a friend mentioned they had just redone the space and it 's absolutely beautiful with great views regardless of where your sitting . sound us incredible and there are multiple exits and entrances which mean your in and out quickly . the cafe is surprisingly mid priced and there is service on the first and second floors which is great for intermission . overall thoroughly enjoyed watching the lorax here !	4266
1	i saw i love lucy at the royal alex and it was fantastic . the theatre is a wonderful preserved piece of history . absolutely stunning . i do n't understand these people that complain about the close quarter seating ... .. that is the way it was and to change a thing would be a crime . to be polite , yes people were much `` smaller '' back in the day . people who have no appreciation for history would rather see those seats pulled and 3 foot wide recliners put in there . maybe you should stick with movies at the galaxie or go the acc . do n't change a thing royal alex - we love you just the way you are .	4266
0	beautiful old theatre with zero comfort . the balcony seats will have you sitting with your knees in your chest and your back aching from the wooden seats . its horrible . we had a subscription for years but decided not to renew after our last visit there . shame for a city like toronto	4266
0	i went to see blue dragon at the royal alex last week . the staging is fabulous , the writing is pretty weak , but you almost forgive lepage because 1 ) he had a co-writer and 2 ) the staging is so good . adviso : do not sit to the far left of right in the lower balcony . the stage is very obscured , but the ticket price is still $ 86 ! make sure you speak to someone live , and ask about the view . the staging was important in this play , and we could n't see lots of it .	4266
1	the service and quality of odc makes other cleaners pale in comparison . this is only place that i will take my garments to be laundered or altered . solid 5 stars !	4267
1	phenomenal ! personalized , go the extra mile service is what 's provided here . i love that everything is done in-house . and the delivery service ? amazing ! i trust my garments to them year after year and they leave zero to be desired . thank you for the exceptional , unsurpassable service !	4267
1	first time stopping in and i was immediately greeted by a friendly smile . unfortunately i did not get her name but she was very pleasant and informative about the company , dry cleaning service and also being a new customer i would receive 25 % off my first order on top of your very reasonable prices , wow ! i had many concerns with a new wool jacket i just bought in switzerland , so my expectations were high , she put me at ease and assured me it would be perfect ! i will definitely be back and appreciate the outstanding customer service . i will highly recommend organicare to anyone . thank you !	4267
1	when i started researching places to get my wedding dress dry cleaned , prices were all over the place . i was pleasantly surprised when i called organicare and they told me it would only be $ 100 , especially without using toxic chemicals ! it took about a week and came out perfect . i 've used them again since , with just a formal dress ; the cost was $ 13 and i was able to pick up the next day . i definitely recommend this place , the girls up front are always pleasant and they have candy by the register !	4267
1	my wife and i work a lot and it 's impossible to drop off and pickup dry cleaning during regular business hours . a friend recommended organicare 's home pick up and drop off service and we immediately signed up . the quality of customer service and cleanliness of our garments is second to none . i have since recommended organicare to my friends and they 've been very happy as well .	4267
1	i live in gilbert and work in downtown and continue to bring my clothes to them for the last 4 years . they are the best that i have found ! the customer service is excellent and mariah the manager to great ! ! i love the new remodel and the free bottle of water . brad the owner is always there or at his other location in desert ridge . plus the wet cleaning does n't leave a smell . huge plus ! !	4267
0	after posting this review , i sent a copy to the owner at organic dry cleaners by e-mail . he never responded . this place does bad work and provides bad customer service . do n't go there .	4267
0	super pricey for me . i didnt think it was worth the `` organic '' label . not even sure what that means . anyway - never went back . never will , even though its close to me , paying over $ 100 for dc & a simple alteration wasnt worth it .	4267
0	they did n't live up to the one star , but had to put something . what kind of place will press something for you once ... for free while you wait , but the next time will only allow you to drop something off to be pressed if you also get it dry cleaned ? even after saying i did n't want it dry cleaned , i would have been charged the same price as if it were dry cleaned and pressed . terrible customer service with unprofessional staff . i will definitely never return after the useless service i was provided .	4267
0	just got a message from brad calling me a `` loser . '' not sure what precipitated name calling given i left my initial review over a year and a half ago . all i can say is thank goodness i have a pint of ice cream to get me through this ... as an attorney , maricopa county judge pro tem , and non-profit board member , i like to think that i contribute a little more to society then brad who appears to relish in overpriced , shoddy dry cleaning , and taking his ball and going home . cheers to you brad our good man ! *please note the sarcasm if you are able to process .	4267
0	quite pricey for dry cleaning . $ 6.20 per tie is too much money ! $ 2.95 to launder a shirt is okay , but there are places that are cheaper . the total cost to dry clean a men 's suit is around $ 15 . the staff is friendly , and the dry cleaning is done quickly . however , the price is too high . i am still looking for a cheap , reliable dry cleaners in phoenix .	4267
0	avoid unless you want your clothing ruined . worst cleaners ever . owner is a jerk and has no idea how to be a responsible business operator . sure they 'll be happy to overcharge you for substandard quality and if you dare complain they will call you names . terrible customer service .	4267
1	as soon as i walked in i was immediately greeted and was offered assistance to find what i was looking for . the gentleman answered all of my questions . i will definitely go to this party city just for the customer service .	4268
1	they have everything here but no black candles.. what is a b day without black candles ? really every other thing on the planet is here ! it was in and out no fuss , helpful staff , so many options , balloons , cards , everything for a party for sure !	4268
1	great customer service from an energetic staff who dropped everything there were doing to help me . clean location and everything organized well . i was surprised by the attention i received from the moment i walked in to leaving .	4268
1	this place has everything you could ever want to throw your own theme party . prices are fair . huge selection and a huge store .	4268
1	best place for anything to host 10 stars if i could great people i go all the way to this one because of their service	4268
1	first time here and i must say they know their stuff ! the lady working with our baby shower invites is really knowledgeable about her station !	4268
0	steer clear from this particular location . my girlfriends wallet was taken from the front counter , when we called to get the wallet back all of the cash was taken out of it and the wallet was all wet ( someone took it to the bathroom ) . we asked the `` shift manager '' to take a look at the cameras and he refused to . there is a camera pointed straight at where the wallet was left . go to another location if you do n't want to get robbed by their broke employees .	4268
0	second time coming here in two weeks . today was worst than the first time . service is terrible . we wait for almost an hour trying to get a staff member to help us . one noticed us and is just laughing on his earpiece talking to some other moron not helping us . we waited so long along with other customers who also end up walking out empty handed . not to mention when we walk in are not greeted and when we leave 5 girls are laughing and bullshit around one check stand talking about personal shit . it 's hiring season , hire new staff ! ! ! ! !	4268
0	will never shop here again ! ! ! employee scowled & gave me the incorrect information on the floor . the guy at the cash register would have been going backwards if he worked any slower . never again ! ! !	4268
0	not sure why blowing up balloons is a 2 person job when there 's a line of 10 people . these 2 employees are loudly talking about a customers fake butt . i have $ 560 ( pretax ) worth of stuff in my cart just watching these idiots whispering about this poor lady . i hope corporate reads this . if i were the lady being talked about i 'd sue for sexual harassment . i will drive across town before i ever come to this location again . horrible !	4268
0	they had nothing i was looking for ! the balloon selections were cheap looking . they 're under staffed and not very helpful .	4268
0	does not take payment over the phone will not blow up balloons , so you can just come in and pick them up no way no way no way no way will you ever get my money any of your locations that is a terrible policy !	4268
1	i go here once a month for a facial to help with my super acne prone skin . i always see tiffany and she is truly the best . i would highly recommend her and the location in general to anyone !	4269
1	i 've gone here a few months now and i usually go to deb who is really good but she was n't available the last two times i called for a next day appt . i went to a girl last time who was okay but she started me late and finished early , which i did n't care for . today i went to ashley and she was awesome ! ! she found all my knots in my back quick and i feel so great after ! probably the best massage i 've ever had ! the staff is always very friendly and nice ! ca n't wait till my next appt !	4269
1	got a last minute appt with paul for a massage this weekend . first time i have seen him and it was an excellent massage . i let him know about my tight shoulders and vigorous exercise routine . he listened to what i wanted out of the massage and addressed those issues . i asked for firm pressure and got it . he was professional and gave a full body massage . i will definitely book him again . so nice to get a more therapeutic massage rather than those that just rub around aimlessly with minimal pressure .	4269
1	great place , everyone is super friendly . it 's a great deal for a really good massage .	4269
0	i attempted to make an appointment online . it stated someone would call me to confirm my appointment . but nothing . even if there were n't any openings , it would have still been nice to receive a phone call . guess i 'll take my money elsewhere .	4269
0	i had a great massage my first visit and bought a year membership but it went downhill from there . it turns out the one good therapist is nearly impossible to book . the others i saw were mediocre at best . recently , a service issue developed that i tried to resolve . the staff was unapologetic and the management was unresponsive , leaving me with a very bad impression . there are plenty of other great therapists in the area . do n't waste your money or time here .	4269
0	tried calling for an appointment on a friday . their first availability was the following wednesday at 2 pm . does n't do me any good when in need of a massage due to muscle soreness . what is the sense ? receptionist recommended that i call another location . not interested in going here . will find another option .	4269
0	horrible experience . the enestitician applied steam for less than 2 minutes and plowed an extraction tool into my face leaving a scabbing sore on 2 areas of my face . she never fully cleaned off my make up as i had mascara flakes around my eyes when finished . she seemed more interested in selling me products after the procedure . it was awful . i do not recommend at all . save your $ $ $ $ . no star . only had to apply one to post this	4269
1	love dr. garcia ! we 've been going to foothills pediatrics since our oldest was born ; she is now 2.5 , and we now have our baby # 2 who we , of course , bring in to see dr. garcia as well . dr. garcia sees a ton of patients , and always remembers our girls . she also always has the time to sit and answer all our questions and concerns . i must say that the front office staff has gotten a lot better since dr. conti , and i think there is still room for improvement . but ... they will not keep me from seeing our favorite pediatrician , dr. garcia .	4270
1	great practice and awesome dr. we have been seeing dr. conti since day 1 for our child . he is fantastic and i could n't ask more from a doctor . he cares and listens and is really interested in my sons well being . he also gave us his personal cell number and pager . we have called him numerous times and he has been very helpful even if we called late at night . dr. conti is the best . they have another doc there but we have only seen conti . as for the office staff and other medical staff , they are all friendly and helpful . i highly recommended this place for a pediatrician	4270
0	been coming here for 10+ yrs ( 3 kids ) & since dr conti 's death , this practice is failing fast . longer waits ( fewer people waiting ) staff has gotten rude ! time to look for a new dr .	4270
0	terrible place ! do n't go there- they do n't value people 's time . we 've been waiting for 2 hours before seeing a doctor !	4270
1	i did my bankruptcy through h & k and it was painless . the hardest part of course was putting my creditor list together , but i knew going in i would have to do this . they did all the speaking for me in court as i did have a creditor presence who was trying to collect money . they helped me after court to cease additional phone calls . ' my experience was fairly quick and they kept me completely informed along the way . i would recommend them . they are a little on the higher price side , but to me it was worth it .	4271
1	i met with mr haines and of course professionalism is expected of an attorney , never the less , i was extremely impressed by my interactions with mr haines and would recommend that an individual seek guidance from the firm . my whole experience from start to finish was a positive one .	4271
1	the process was straightforward ... i could n't seeing giving five stars due to their almost negligence on returning email messages . other than that , i was satisfied with my results and would recommend to others going through the same generation . i just bought a new car . god is good ! ! !	4271
1	they handled my bankruptcy . everyone was very knowledgeable and always able to answer my questions thoroughly.they even put my bankruptcy on a rush so i would n't have to postpone my wedding .	4271
0	if you use haines and krieger , you will never see a real attorney , just office folks , they handled my chapter 13 okay , but they did n't do anything too get my home that i wanted too keep refinanced too a fixed mortgage in the 2 years i was paying them , all they ever did was have me resubmit my paperwork over and over and over , a complete waste of time.do yourself a favor and go somewhere else .	4271
0	absolutely horrible ! ! they pressure you till you pay them , then they do n't return a phone call ! worst customer service i have ever experienced . i would not recommend them to an enemy .	4271
0	friend of mine used them . they charged him for a chapter 13 bankruptcy , then charged for . a modification . learned the chapter 13 was not the best way to go and converted him to a chapter 7 , which they charged him for . they could not modify his loan and then charged him 500 to short sale his house . he paid them over $ 12,000 and ultimately lost his house to foreclosure . all of this and when i spoke to them i only got to meet with assistants . save your money .	4271
0	during the consolidation they made it sound painless and they would take care of everything told me if my creditors still harass me they will file a lawsuit against them for free ! ! as soon as i payed the retainer fee i never heard from them again i called and called and called just got different people voicemails never got a call back finally one time i spoke to someone who told me they were really backed up and he was reviewing my case as we speak he would call me back later that day.. that was weeks ago and not a peep ! !	4271
1	we were back just a couple of weeks ago to see daniel tosh 's great show at the mirage . ( you have to check out the restaurant stack at the mirage ! ! ! ) ok back to the review . after hiking at red rock canyon we stopped in to get some jeans and shirts for hubby . our fav sales guy , tim , has moved to a different men 's wearhouse location but we still had outstanding service from abraham and eddie . abraham went out of his way to help find the right style & size jeans we were looking for and eddie found some great casual shoes . thank you guys ! ! : )	4272
1	frankie and her staff is professional , friendly and takes their time to make sure i looked good and felt comfortable in my suit . had a problem with the tailored blazer being too tight and it was fixed with no questions to my liking .	4272
1	they are awesome here ! ! i went to jos a bank and got a suit ( well my husband did ) and they were awful . they kept getting the wrong sizes- had to keep doing alterations and the customer service is n't the best . i needed the suit for a specific date and the employee tried negotiating with me - waste of time . anywho we left and took it right across the street to men 's wearhouse where darby the manager took great care of us . she was awesome and made us feel a lot better . she took care of my husband and made sure he looked good in his suit . i will keep coming back ! thanks darby !	4272
1	i 've been to this location anywhere between 50 to 70 times . i 've never received service like i did today and from none other than a young man name daemen wright . he went the extra mile for me and went out of his way to show me what was truly available and not just what they had in my size . he stayed with me and answered all of my questions while never once pressuring me into a sale ( which is why i bought so much ! ) amazing job and a humbling experience from a fellow sales professional . whatever training they gave this man , he is clearly using it , call him first : 702-940-5945	4272
1	jared was extremely helpful in my purchase . i went to buy a blazer looking to spend around $ 300 , but left spending over $ 1,000 on an entire suit and shoes . even though i spent more than i had anticipated , i was completely happy because jared was very helpful and saved me a lot of time and confusion picking out the right stuff .	4272
0	rented a total of 6 tuxes for a wedding . unbelievably bad experience . wo n't ever use again .	4272
0	do n't go here if your if your a fellow introvert . they 'll have you in something you do n't want in a heartbeat . also , seems to be no connection to the store and their website . website announces all these sales , go into the store , nothing .	4272
0	horrible service . employees are of no help . they could careless about what you 're purchasing , only thing that matters is clocking in and out for that `` high competitive pay '' paycheck lmao .	4272
0	over priced tuxedo rentals . can not get measurements right . rude staff . nasty old lady store mgr . that could care less about their screw ups do not shop at this location	4272
0	awful customer service . manager on duty was extremely rude and rushed me to make a purchase as i browsed the store to pick out suits . i finally handed her back my suits and walked out the door . not much selection in vegas and have to deal with this ... no thanks i refuse to support management which does not value its customers . i actually try and shop at their other outlets or on line . john c .	4272
1	in vegas there are very few full service bike shops left . this is the best i 've found . i built a mountain bike from good used parts bought on ebay and other places and once it was running they fine tuned it for $ 50 . they told me i built a $ 900 . i only spent $ 250 , including the tune-up . runs like champ , i 've bought a few other things there since , no high pressure sales , no up-sales , no bull . love it !	4273
1	i just left this shop awhile ago . now this is what i call customer service . my rear tire popped so i needed a new inner tube . they said it would take 15 minutes ... 15 ! ! ! i ran across the road , grabbed some lunch , came back . not only did they replace my inner tune , they cleaned my chain and tightened the bike so it feels extra sturdy . i was smiling the whole ride back home . reasonably priced and great customer service . thank you , thank you , thank you !	4273
1	their shop is large , but not much for accessories , they do have a good return policy , assuming you have a receipt and everything is still in the package .	4273
0	they may have all the things you need for your bike but the employees are the problem . particularly the bald headed guy . he was a liar . we were buying a tire and they have it , we have to come back to get the bike and have them assemble all of a sudden he said they never had them .	4273
0	* deserves zero stars * called in and spoke to someone before driving through construction and rush hour traffic all the way from south henderson -- told me they had the exact measurement inner tube for mountain bike . arrived 45 mins later only to have the same guy tell me `` well , i knew this other size would fit.. '' yeah buddy- the `` other size '' i could 've bought from a bike store 1 mile from my house ! ~~ no apologies . no offer to sell me the tube for a discounted price ~~ horrible customer service- i wish i would 've read the other reviews ... .ugh	4273
0	i rode the bike i bought ( giant lx ) for a few months completely normally , did n't tweak it or mess with it . one day the front wheel pops off while i 'm riding for no reason and flings me off the bike . when i confronted the store owners about their faulty product that caused my accident , they refused to apologize and blamed the entire incident on me . please , do n't trust your safety in biking with this business .	4273
1	this store is so clean and neat . there 's always plenty of staff to help and everything is so organized unlike another las vegas location . i 've been here several times to update my registry or purchase items and most of the time they have it in stock . all the staff is so friendly and even have helped me get items out of my car that were too heavy to return when family has purchased the wrong or duplicate item . i will continue to come to this store for our babies needs and necessities . 5 stars for cleanliness , organization and customer service .	4274
1	we found one item missing on a bag we bought . we came on the 2nd day and just changed the bag for less than 1 minute without any paper work or question . alex is wonderful helping us with the change .	4274
1	i placed an order online off my friend 's registry and picked it up an hour later . amazing customer service , as i watched three associates patiently work their way through everyone 's needs at the customer service counter . the gentleman who brought out the car seat also carried it to my car . bravo !	4274
0	the worst customer service experience i 've ever had . i saw a lot of people working but when i needed help and when i wanted to check out , there was nobody to be found . i walked out and left my cart .	4274
0	terrible experience from their close out sale ! we wanted the very last floor model of something that had a sale tag on it and they would n't let us purchase it ? ? ? ? you do n't want the very last sale of something ? ? so stupid . garbage employees . glad company is going out of business	4274
0	usually overpriced and and not worth it but closing down so the sales are great so long as you do n't care about customer service because lets face it these people are almost out of a job and not exactly friendly . make sure to check everything as they ring you up at the counter because the discounts do n't match the signs and after you pay all sales are final and they wo n't do anything about it even though it 's their fault . really not a big surprise they are going out of business	4274
1	we had a great experience trading in 2 minis for a new countryman . this is the best car buying experience you will ever have . naomi and cody are very knowledgeable and made sure our factory order mini has perfect . even if you buy a bmw or merc you will not get the friendly family like feeling you get at this dealership . their service department is first rate so no need to worry about that . if you want a mini this is the place you want to buy it	4275
1	i could not have had a better experience . my car buying experience was done with straight forward communication and manager todd nolan who i have bought from previously continued to impress . he is the reason i actually came back . vehicle is as advertised and a pleasure to own . thanks again !	4275
0	they never return your call or messages . i 've left 3 messages over the last month for someone in finance to help me and no response . maybe understaffed ? !	4275
0	very poor experience here . felt like we were judged for our outward appearance . first thing you learn in sales is not to make assumptions on someone 's wallet based on how someone appears . extremely poor experience was ready to buy a car today and they just assumed that we were only there for their amazon promotion which we ended up turning down due to how we were treated and just leaving .	4275
1	friendly local pub . room at the back can be rented for parties or poker nights . decent food but make sure kitchen is open . lots of choice when it comes to beer or cocktails . more of a summer pub due to nice outdoor area .	4276
1	it 's definitely had a revamp . i love the bartenders . they 're great . tv 's appear to have been updated and it 's a very cozy space . not a party bar , but a good place to meet friends .	4276
0	this place is a dive . which is great if you 're in the mood for a dive . the staff is very friendly , but they 're slow . the food is pretty gross , to be honest . do not go there to eat . if you do , stick to something simple like fries . do not drink draught beer there . it 's usually flat and not tasty at all . stick to bottles . the tvs there suck , do n't bother going to watch sports . the only thing good about this place is the patio . it 's right in the annex , has a decent size , and is close to parking and subway .	4276
0	utter disaster ! ! lolz ... ... . bad food , bad service , creepy owner staring girls down even customers ... ... hate hate hate	4276
1	i like the ice cream at cold stone but sometimes the choices are overwhelming ! ! this location can get super busy during the summer months , and can be packed with loud teens . definitely a local hangout for them . if you can get over the screeching , the ice cream itself is very tasty and worth the occasional treat !	4278
1	i 'm not sure why this has such bad reviews ... coldstone is awesome ! yes you do have a wait a little longer but the process takes a little longer to mix the ice cream and the add-ins . it can be a little pricey but you get a lot and it 's quality ingredients , so it 's totally worth it . i usually get something from the signature collection , but you can also make your own , which my dad likes to do . i will definitely continue going to the hudson location .	4278
0	long line out of the door ... . first time at a cold stone and my last . if i ask you if you have a sugar cone and you say yes , how the heck does it end up on a waffle cone ... .and then you have prices on a board for small . then you add money for the cone . clearly explain your menu ! ! ! ! ice cream was fine , but could be much cheaper elsewhere and the ice cream comes with a sugar cone ! ! ! ! the portions are too big ... . a small should be small . i do n't need a pound of ice cream .	4278
0	so i could n't decide between 2 or 3 stars bc this ice cream is not bad , it 's actually good but like a spoonful before i 'm having a heart attack from the molasses thickness of dairy goo brings me down from my heaven to wtf was i thinking ... shoot wo n't even finish my gift card.. eat on	4278
1	phenomenal service all around . the oral surgery team and ms. jackie were very professional . i had a family member have major work done and everything came out perfectly . the front office staff was very attentive . the wait area was clean , that 's usually an indication that the place is professional . the consultation area and rooms are clean as well . my personal experience with other dental offices have been mediocre and usually take hours to get things done . not here . in about an hour my sister was all set . they even helped me walk her out to the car ! amazing ! ! ! keep up the great work . highly recommended .	4279
1	i had the best experience at this location thanks to jackie de alba she is wonderful a true asset to your team . this was my first time getting a procedure done here and i had a lot of worries but she said exsactly what i needed to hear to make me feel at ease . she was very patient and caring with her voice . thank u so much jackie !	4279
1	coolest cat in town ! love , love , love this dentist , i have been going to dr. porter for years and will not see anyone else . his assistant olivia is wonderful with calming nervous patients and they make you feel like a friend , my husband hates dentists due to past experiences so it was a major relief finding someone he would go to . the staff is fantastic and explains everything regarding insurance and what is actually out of pocket - no hidden costs and they explain everything . highly recommened ! !	4279
0	finally getting my daughters braces off today . i would highly recommend going to any other orthodontist in town . this place is a disaster , they never have the same otho working , it 's always over booked , the office staff does n't know what 's going on and they try to preform unnecessary procedures . i got a second opinion elsewhere and it was the best decision i 've made .	4279
0	horrible horrible horrible is the least i can i say . i went in for oral surgery , they told me there were 4 patients in front of me mind you my appt was at 11am . so why were n't they prepared for me ? each patients surgery at least takes one to four hours depending on severity . so why would i be fasting all day when my appt was so early ? ? and when i asked them , joanna said because that 's how long it takes when you get surgery if you walk into any of our centers . just letting everybody know ! this is how this location works , be prepared .	4279
0	the wait time here is ridiculous especially when i have an appointment how do you get scheduled for an appointment a month later from the time of your tooth hurting then not even seen at the time your appointment is scheduled this is an hour later and i 'm still waiting to be seen smh does n't make any since	4279
1	the people are awesome at this location ! their manager , derek makes this store what it is ! the place is always clean , stocked , and friendly clerks ready to serve . the car wash is decidely not awesome . it does wash your car adequately but the driers do a poor job . for the price of a deluxe wash , i would expect someone to wipe it down afterwards . the owner just does n't understand customer service/value for his product and this is evident in how he treats his employees , pinching pennies to the point of providing a subpar product .	4280
1	when it comes to local support you can count on ahwatukee auto spa ! ! brian and william were both helpful with setting up and guiding mountain pointe high school in fundraising for grad night . thank you for your tremendous contributions ! !	4280
1	great people . great car wash . awesome vacuum area . definitely recommend to everyone ahwatukee is lucky to have this car wash .	4280
1	brian was extreme helpful and inform me of all the available discounts and opportunities- come here so often it was nice to know that there was available options and programs .	4280
1	excellent wash ! i 'm not usually a fan of auto washes , but this one does a really good job on cars and suv 's	4280
1	car wash - free vacuums , reasonable prices and car gets clean ! morning staff ( eric ) - one of the nicest guys you will ever meet . always upbeat and friendly , making a new arizona resident feel welcome . evening staff - outstanding . always polite and willing to help . prices are fair on beer and soda . just an overall good clean place .	4280
1	this shop is fantastic . i brought my car a couple of months ago for a small detail . the guy did an incredible job . very 'detail ' oriented : ) last weekend i noticed a big screw in one of my tires . the tire shop was closed so , i went to the detail shop and asked for help . both guys were busy but , they stopped and changed the tire for me ( so i could keep driving ) . their willingness to help is what surprised me the most . it is very hard to find that these days .	4280
1	i love how they use a brush to pre-wash the windshield to really remove the bugs before going in . it 's pretty cheap and affordable and fast too . they offer monthly memberships and i am debating on getting one !	4280
1	brian was extreme helpful and inform me of all the available discounts and opportunities- come here so often it was nice to know that there was available options and programs .	4280
0	i thought i would give them a try since they 're close to home but i had to run my car through twice because it was still dirty the first time . they were very nice about it and comped the second wash , but it was still dirty the second time too . to top it off , their free vacuums are very weak and the blow dryers at the end of the wash blew off a piece of trim off the top of my car which was never found and cost me $ 103 at lexus to replace . they only got two stars instead of one because of their customer service . the car wash itself and the vacuums are awful .	4280
0	the car wash was pretty good and fast , but the dryers were disappointing to say the least . i paid for a premium wash and the dryers left a wet streak down the middle of my car . so now i have a clean car with a water spot stripe down the middle ... for a $ 13 wash , you should expect and receive a better finished wash	4280
0	i had got the $ 13.00 car wash with auto tire shine . when i pulled around for the wash an associate sprayed off random spots on the car did n't even try with the bugs , after the car wash i pulled around to look at the quality the tire shine was all over the rims so i drove around and got a free re wash what was nice but got the basic because i did n't want the tire shine . long story short the tire shine was still in the rims/ ps mirror was pushed in with a hub cab missing and the quality sucked ! worst car wash ever !	4280
0	the car wash pricing at the pump is misleading . the names are intentionally vague ( crystal , supreme , and extreme ) and there are no prices listed . without realizing it , you can pay $ 10 more than you planned for a 2 minute car wash . very sneaky on their part and not good business .	4280
0	i have previously been happy with my growler purchases at this location . however unfortunately today not only was my growler filled well below the 64oz line , when i actually got back to my house it was filled with a completely different beer than i had ordered . needless to say disappointing and since i live 30 miles away , not easy to fix .	4280
0	the only reason i give this place 2 stars is for the manners for the staff outside ... not for the quality for a car wash that set me back $ 24 ! totally not worth it , will never go back . i did n't think i had to do research on car washes . my car is 30 days old ... not much to do , but they still did n't wipe down the inside of the doors or the leather seats . why am i paying more then ? i did n't even get the cheapest wash . i 'm so disappointed and want to make sure no one else goes through this !	4280
0	place has issues . i , ve experienced problems most every time . first off , pump screen was damaged , making transaction hard to do , when u cant read words . then pump did n't give a receipt , so had to spend time obtaining from clerk . then wash code i received was incorrect . back to clerk for correct code n receipt . staff was friendly . car wash code worked fine . went to vacuums and found 40 % of stalls didnt have hoses . found stall with hose , and come to find vacuum barely sucking . so tried another hose and second hose fell apart immediately . wont be coming back . : (	4280
0	my wife went in to cancel our monthly membership over a month ago before we moved out of town . they said a manager will take care of it . now i see i have been charged twice since then and called to have it canceled . they said i need to come in . i said i do n't live there anymore and need it canceled . she said a manager will have to do it that no one there has the ability to cancel memberships . seems like a bad way to do business . i hope they cancel this and promptly refund my last two charges .	4280
0	****do not go here . car wash dings car and manager does n't care*** my wife recently brought my car to get washed . after the car wash my wife noticed multiple dings and chips in the paint . when she approached the manager , william , he said it was not them and refused to assist . this place will jack up your car . dont come here ! !	4280
1	the whole staff , specifically crystal , has been extremely helpful from the application process to the day i moved in . the things i needed on move in day were ready or fixed right away ( within the hour ) . i have never met a leasing office team more flexible and welcoming ! thank you for making this such a positive experience ! ! ! the apartment was very clean and seems to have been just recently painted , with few minor areas of wear and tear . they have been remodeling the shared community spaces as well . so far , this apartment is definitely 5-star worthy ! !	4281
1	love it here its just myself and my dog . the staff is great especially crystal ! the grounds/maintenance men are great as well always out on the grounds cleaning picking up and fixing things . the neighbors are great and helpful . there are restaurants and shopping 400 ft away . the rental price is great all utilities included and you cant beat the location . i also feel safe here .	4281
1	our stay at the colonnade apartment homes has been the best ! the management staff is so friendly and efficient , the atmosphere is nice and feels like a community . plus , the apartments are a great size and feature working appliances that , if need be , can be fixed quickly by maintenance . the pool is clean and is great for bbqs , and the staff has hosted bbqs for all the residents to prove it ! i was initially attracted to the colonnade apartments because of their accommodating leases , and i am so happy we stayed and lived at the colonnade apartments	4281
1	very nice and cool people maybe cooler ac would be good and better internet everyone is quiet and friendly price a little to high but nice .	4281
1	i have to say i 'm extremely surprised about all of the negative reviews here . i 've been here 2 years and no complaints ( remember , more people write negative feedback , than praise positive ) sure , there are a few issues that any property has , but that 's the nature of life . you are in an area that markets the price , and fits your lifestyle . since greystar took over , the growth of improvement has been nothing but wonderful . i 've had nothing but great assistance in all maintenance repairs , and the staff has been very courteous . you ca n't beat the location !	4281
0	well an update . i guess you ca n't have license plates on your car without fear of someone stealing them . brought the amount of theft we 've had to the attention of the office and was literally shrugged at ! did n't even notate that something happened or take a report of it or really was offered an apology . all i was asked is if i filed a police report and then they proceeded to put it back on me as if it was my fault ! long story short again still not happy and absolutely nothing has changed . do n't waste your money .	4281
0	on 9/9 i stopped in the office to inquire about renting a 2 bedroom . there was no one in the office so i sat down on the love seat . a man comes from the back and sits down at the desk , he does n't speak . as i 'm sitting there waiting to be assisted , a male resident walks in . the man behind the desk ask him , how he could help him . the resident ask about pest control because he has an infestation of roaches . needless to say , once i heard that i immediately headed for the exit ! !	4281
0	well i never lived here . but i got a really nice look at the place when i tracked my stolen iphone to an apartment there . you have to love the find my iphone app ! you could see it was in one specific section of the apartments ... the police was nice enough to come out and knock on the doors , however most of the people who live there simply turn off the lights and did n't answer the door . it 's that kind of friendly place . so here 's what you do if you want to live with people who will steal somebody 's iphone from a clothing store changing room , definitely move there .	4281

0	very disappointed with polly ( manager ) when a tenant moved in on april 27 and was promised internet and cable tv and now more than 1 month later still neither and no expected date for installation ! this place is a joke ! the worst example of honesty and lack of customer service ! all inclusive rent options are a farce !	4281
1	this truck stop is one of my favorites when i 'm in vegas . easy to get in/out of . plenty of parking . good food options .	4282
1	had . fairly good experience minus the jackass that left his truck running all night . shower rooms were nice and in good condition . only downside was that in the private bathrooms there were n't any seat covers . close enough to food choices .	4282
0	their security guard is a major jerk . he was more concerned with where i `` parked `` instead of providing other options . apparently , we were confused about where to enter the blasted building . he could 've handled the situation better , seeing that my license plate indicates i 'm not from here . i 'm glad my aunt was only getting change from here . i would n't spend a red cent from there .	4282
0	linda 's customer service absolutely sucked tonight ! ! ! i gave her a few seconds to at least greet me and she just looked at me ... typical . but after she was done with us , she greeted the trucker behind me and asked him all kinds of questions . why is that ? ? ? that 's not okay linda . i have my receipts . they have typical trucker showers ...	4282
1	i was looking for an ice cream place late last night and found this place next to jobots . the flavor choices are unique and everything i sampled was very good . i got a scoop of the greek yogurt and the carrot cake i wish i got a scoop of the cucumber sorbet , but i knew i could n't finish 3 scoops . i love how the ice cream is served in a takeout container with a fortune cookie . definitely a special little place !	4283
1	fun little spot in downtown phoenix . great ice cream with some interesting flavors .	4283
1	i had some great ice cream here . as the photos depict , it still comes in a chinese food box with a fortune cookie tossed in . fairly low prices , too .	4283
1	best icecream ever ! would definitely recommend this to everyone . they got tons of unique ice cream flavors . my favorite is their grasshopper mint !	4283
1	there is a line constantly out the door for melt and for a good reason . the icecream and sherbet let 's not forget that for the lactose free individuals is divine . the whole style is great also . from the little chinese take out boxes , to the fortune cookie , melt has a style all of its own . also , for any avid sticker collectors they have some pretty cute stickers to decorate that mac or hydro that are constantly used for stickers . again , melt has a great product , fast , and delicious .	4283
1	cute little ice cream place ! we had the flight and chose 5 different flavors ! they were all delicious . i love how they come in cupcake tins .	4283
1	delicious giant single scoop waffle cone . and a fortune cookie . what more could you ask for ?	4283
1	amazing ice cream ! the fruity pebbles actually taste like fruity pebbles ! great flavor and presentation , with a cute spot in the art district of downtown phoenix . the decor and upkeep inside could use some work , which is the only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars . it seems a bit shady walking into this place , seeing just a single case of ice cream , but do n't let that stop you !	4283
1	ya ! great ice cream in downtown phoenix that is open late ! udder delights from gilbert makes it way to the city . the staff is super friendly and the ice cream is top notch ! hit this place up asap .	4283
1	i love ice cream places that serve unique flavors . this was it . and they serve them in chinese take-out cartons with a fortune cookie ! they had flavors like trix , banana pudding , lucky charms , etc . but their flavors are rotating so you might not see the same that i did ! go here . there are tables and chairs outside .	4283
1	took a family bike ride here . good stuff ! friendly staff and great selection !	4283
1	best ice cream shop in the valley . interesting flavors and fair prices . the line can get long , but it 's worth it .	4283
1	what a dope shop ! ice cream is great quality and fresh unique flavors ! the poppyseed joint is my favorite . they also cary mexican candies ! great place to check out if you are cruising the row .	4283
1	oh melt , how i love thee . let me count the ways . i love you fruity pebbles , the nutella , and vietnamese coffee , the green tea , and the strawberry banana sorbet . was truly a flight of fancy for my taste buds . i love the one of a kind shop itself . and the service was outstanding . btw , the sample of cucumber sorbet was perfect to round out this treat of a night .	4283
1	stopped in here late monday afternoon . awesome coconut ice cream .	4283
1	love this cool spot ! great variety of fun , gourmet flavors . not to mention , the owner- pablo , provides exceptional customer service and keeps my friends and i coming back .	4283
1	cool hipster-ish place , a great place for you to take a date to . across the street is a even more hipster bookstore we took a walk in after our delicious ice cream .	4283
1	melttttttttttttttttt my heart : ) ) ) ) i love it here , cute hole in the wall . i got the mint chocolate chip in a chinese to go box : ) with a fortune cookie . we sat outside , people watching . i like it here .	4283
1	had 1/2 banana 1/2 chocolate and it was da bomb . only thing missing is a water cooler ( for some reason i always want i glass of water after ice cream ) . staff was great and willing to let us sample away to find just the right flavor for each of us in the group .	4283
1	what on earth , i adore this place . thai iced tea ice cream ? a miracle .	4283
1	actually found this on yelp ! totally loved it , such a cute local ice cream/ yogurt spot ! nice selection- especially with the non dairy ice cream , perfect for vegans or lactose tolerant ppl & the employee was so down to earth/ friendly , def recommend trying this place out !	4283
1	excellent ice cream made in the phoenix area . best chocolate i 've had in a long time . very friendly server who was more than happy to let all 5 of our group try any flavor ice cream we wanted . look forward to another visit of this delicious ice cream soon .	4283
1	melt is a sweet tiny shop with the most unusual variations of ice cream . something for every taste . the service is adequate . young girls doing what they can to handle one flood after another it seems . not much room to sit unless it is cool enough to sit outside . even so , this certainly has become a favorite for my daughter and i any time we visit phoenix . love it !	4283
1	defenitly a places to be if you have the munchies : ) their ice cream is amazing it 's really weird once you hear the flavors but they can give you samples if you ask nice enough -- fruity pebbles was great !	4283
1	very interesting flavors ! i got the cap ' n crunch ( tried fruity pebbles and birthday cake ) , my friend got chocolate chip-mostly chocolate , and my bf got sweet and salty brownie . they come in little chinese food take out boxes which i do n't really like because i feel like it 's gon na leak out when it melts . the parking is atrocious but i found a decent spot after circling the block once . and the building is a renovated house that fits maybe 6 thin customers at once . lots of outside seating though . i will say this place is insanely popular though for adult and kids .	4283
1	pb & j ice cream is really good . also got blueberry cheesecake , which was not as good but still good . good place with good flavors .	4283
1	sometimes getting lost is the best way to find amazing treasures hidden in a city . i 'm still new here so finding cute little ice cream shops like melt is fantastic . though it was $ 3 for a miniscoop , the ice cream i tried was really creamy & tasted fresh . which is a lot to say considering most ice cream shops tend to keep theirs frozen for a minute . i recommend the chop suey . it had walnuts & berries in vanilla cream . i 'm not a sweet tooth type of person so this was a perfect blend for me . they come in these cute little fortune cups !	4283
1	how creative is this place with their presentation and selection in flavors ! definitely my spot to chill and enjoy a delicious ice cream while exploring downtown phx	4283
1	this went from a storefront to a corner ice cream stand in front of jobot . good ice cream and service with a smile !	4283
1	i 'm not a local , so trying this spot out was fun ! a it was easy to find ( through gps of coarse ) b they had some amazing flavors and c the staff was patient with our big group order . i ordered the coconut pineapple sherbet and it was refreshing , my cousin ordered the pomegranate sherbet which was also yummy ! it 's a very tiny place but worth seeing . the outside patio was the perfect spot to hangout . xoxo	4283
1	yummy ! i had the jobot coffee ice cream and hubby had the salted caramel . he said it was n't the most delicious waffle cone he 'd ever had but it was still good . the ice cream is creamy with good flavor-worth the cost !	4283
1	if your looking for the best ice cream in the world you have come to the right place ! i absolutely love that they are opened up next door to my salon ( hair or dye salon ) ! its my guilty pleasure and my clients love it as well ! !	4283
1	my friend and i are traveling the west coast and are trying ice cream everywhere we stop ! this place has the best ice cream and sweetest scoopers ! i had a split of peanut butter swirl and el diablo . definitely try the snicker doodle too . good vibes .	4283
1	this ice cream place is very cute and close to my house . the girl who was working last night when we went with jon and amy was so friendly and helpful and did n't mind giving us about 1000 samples . the ice cream comes in little chinese food to go containers and have a fortune cookie on top ... .too cute . i thought the best flavors were the superfood ( nutella ish ) , coffee , and coconut ( mmmm ) . this is n't my favorite ice cream ever , but it was pretty damn good ... ..i would recommend it if you are in the neighborhood .	4283
1	this place is cute , small , and at the heart of downtown phoenix ! the staff is friendly , the ice cream is good , and they support local artists . it 's quite random . i ordered two scoops of grasshopper mint . delish ! jets the random part : they put it in a chinese food takeout box and garnish with a fortune cookie . haha ! you go melt !	4283
0	went to see what all the hype was about . only a few flavors available . got a two scoop of chocolate and `` get figgy with it '' . cost close to $ 9.00 for two scoops no toppings . i 'm all about supporting local businesses but feel this place is a little over priced for what you get . quality was okay as was customer service .	4283
0	we stopped in after my daughter 's dance recital for a celebratory ice cream . the only two flavors available- cucumber sorbet and chocolate . really ? no thanks , we 'll take our celebration elsewhere .	4283
0	overly expensive ice cream . this place is a bit hard to find because there 's a large munchies sign but nothing significant that says melt . they did n't allow me to get a mini scoop in the waffle cone because 'the cone is too big for the scoop . ' so what ? what if i like a lot of waffle ? we got the cookie monster and the mint flavors , both of which tasted watered down . melt is an appropriate name for this establishment because that 's exactly what i allowed my ice cream to do after the first bite .	4283
0	warning ! ! this place must no longer be what the pictures and other reviews are saying ! ! melt is now just a rolling cart stand at this address . the ice cream flavors were super limited . they did n't offer any toppings other than their signature fortune cookie . i have to say the ice cream was n't horrible just far off from what i was expecting based on the other reviews and pictures .	4283
0	ice cream good however i did n't try the flavors i wanted because the girl behind the counter made it feel as though her job was an inconvenience . got what sounded good but not ultimately what i wanted because i felt bad asking for different tasters .	4283
0	hipster ice cream place . overpriced and inefficient . line was long because the employees were hoodlums more interested in listening to their rap music than scooping ice cream . pretty unprofessional . the ice cream was fine but nothing special .	4283
0	the ice cream was okay , it was confusing trying to find the place since now it is just a stand . i was n't too impressed with the flavors since they were so limited . also it was kind of pricy for the little amount that you did get .	4283
0	i could pay $ 3 for a whole cartoon of walmart brand ice cream and its about the same . not bad , but nothing special . went for the flight , but was told not serving because manager trying to decide whether to charge more for it ? ? really hard to find , sign really small and lots of construction . would n't bother coming again ...	4283
0	it 's not the best location to have an ice cream cart . the top layer is literally melting . i felt bad because i took my family and my sister did n't end up getting anything because of the way it looked . we ordered 2 waffle cones and 2 chinese cups and it was almost $ 26 ! the ice cream was good but definitely not worth that price point . i was really disappointed because i remember it being so much better . also , they were very limited on the ice cream flavors .	4283
0	went here tonight to get some ice cream . we were excited to try a new place . it 's located in a cute bungalow on 5th st by roosevelt . we walked in and looked at the case : a variety of homemade ice creams all half melted ! ! ! we asked the guy behind the counter what the story was . his response : `` uhhhhhh yeah it 's kinda hot . '' really ? ! apparently this place is called melt for a reason . and at $ 4.50 for a small you can keep your half melted ice cream . we went to safeway and bought a carton of frozen ben and jerry 's for $ 4 .	4283
0	i just went to melt & the guy did not use gloves or use a tissue at least when he got the donut for my friend . that 's gross . he had a cold sore on his lip , and those are very contagious . me and my friends even think he did n't wash his hands , from how fast he got back with the donut . not sorry for writing this review , just watching out for future customers .	4283
0	disclaimer : i want to try this place at the right time and redo this review ! came in on a saturday night and there were literally only 6 flavors in the ice cream freezer ( all of which were near empty ) and a lot of other products were sold out . my friends sucked it up and got a peanut butter & jealous shake mixed with other flavors i ca n't remember and the other got two heaping scoops of a berry ice cream for himself . i must say , they looked good . so 1 measly star for having so much out-of-stock , but i will visit again and i will have ice cream ! hopefully .	4283
0	this is a place to get ice cream and enjoy a night out with the family . ice cream was good but i found it very offensive and certainly inappropriate that they posted a political sign saying f $ # k trump on their register . freedom of speech is fine but not vulgar language at a family ice cream place ! !	4283
0	i have been to melt a few times . this last trip was terrible ! from the minute i walked in , i felt pressure to make a choice immediately . the staff just stared at you . less than helpful . i tried a few flavors and decided on the peanut butter . meh ! ! simply not that great . also , stupid expensive . not worth it . if you 're in the downtown area i would recommend sweet republic , or churn . much better service and ice cream is way better there . not pleased and will not be coming back !	4283
0	tried the fruity pebble ad cookie monster , both were super good ! ended up with fruity pebbles , good choice ! poor customer service . 10/10 would not recommend the man that was working tonight . sounded like he could 've been the manager , mot sure . loved the outdoor atmosphere.. cute date spot .	4283
0	high prices , lame flavors , skip . i was expecting some more unique flavors from the reviews but was sooo disappointed in the small selection of plain jane flavors that i ended up not even ordering . my husband had a peanut butter chocolate sundae which i tasted , it was very rich but nothing i could n't have gotten in a tub of grocery store ice cream . my sister got a small brownie ( looked old ) with scoop of vanilla and hot fudge . our order for those two small-standard regular joe desserts totaled $ 17 ! ! not worth it .	4283
0	disappointed in the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream as it did n't have many chunks of cookie dough , although it was tasty . the coffee ice cream was smooth and creamy with a mild coffee flavor .	4283
0	i loved going to this little ice cream shop but ever since they changed their location their service and quality have gone downhill . the ice cream is still good but they 've always got a low stock . the ice cream is n't as `` insta-worthy '' as it used to be . i miss the old melt .	4283
0	ice cream is good but dirty / no clean vibe . out of a lot of things and blaring music playing while trying to order	4283
0	so with all the hype we decided to try melt . tiny ice cream shop , went on a friday night , the guy and girl working it were n't very enthusiastic , looked like they did n't want to be there . ice cream was okay , $ 6 for a double . started to melt quickly , we wont be going back . should have gone to sweet republic !	4283
0	the ice cream was delicious however i gave it one star for horrible customer service . the girl who works there made it seem like such a hassle to ask for samples . she has such a horrible attitude , i understand if it was super busy but it was n't . very disappointing experience especially after hearing all the rave from people about how good this place is .	4283
0	do not ... i repeat , do not get the grapefruit tequila sorbet unless you really want to relive your college days of waking up with the taste of vomit in your mouth . truthfully ? the rest of the ice cream was so-so , but sadly underwhelming . try the ice cream flight if you ca n't make up your mind - it 's a good amount of ice cream for the price . the street was unlit and a little shady . not a place to come if you 're not familiar with the area .	4283
0	just a stand in the corner of jobot . not one flavor tastes good enough to warrant the $ 4.50/scoop price and very icy and not creamy at all .	4283
0	i feel bad , but man , 5:30 on a saturday night and you have 4 flavors ? 4 ? ? and the vanilla only had enough for 1 scoop . bummer cause the vanilla was good - but not what we would have ordered if we had more choices .	4283
0	the name is certainly accurate ... the ice cream melts really fast within a few minutes of being served , never really had this problem at other places . price is a bit much for the size and the flavors taste a bit too artificial for me . cool concept for the takeout box and the fortune cookie .	4283
0	this is a tiny establishment with some outdoor benches . they offer a fair number of flavors . i had the fruity pebbles and birthday cake on a waffle cone which was delicious but with a bottle of water it came out to $ 9 ! i only had two scoops and this is not gelato ! super pricey ! : |	4283
0	so rude and was so unprofessional , my wife told him it was our first time can he suggest the most popular he was like no did n't give any samples so yeah , i understand the names being unique but no info on flavoring overall will not go back and was expensive	4283
0	i became skeptical of this place when i saw that the ice cream came in chinese take-out cartons and came with a fortune cookie . i tried 2 flavors and was out . the ice cream was flatout not good	4283
0	cute store , variety of flavors , cute concept with the chinese to-go boxes & fortune cookie on top . but poor customer service ! the chubby white girl with the septum piercing was really rude . she did n't smile at us , barely responded to our questions , and just looked really bored . the cashier was unhelpful , and walked away when more people behind us came . and finally , the ice cream was n't that good ( birthday cake & nutella ) & melted once she scooped it onto the box container .	4283
0	so bummed but this place is definitely not open . it is surrounded by caution tape and it 's boarded up !	4283
0	we popped over here for a snack after a pub crawl and i was n't wowed by the ice cream . it was a tasty enough but the texture was off - the mouth-feel was n't what you expect from ice cream .	4283
0	it 's pretty good ice cream but they just raised their prices for $ 4.25 for a single scoop and $ 8.25 for 2 scoops of ice cream lolol like it 's pretty good but definitely not that good . the flavors are interesting but not worth that much .	4283
0	great ice-cream favors , but they are always packed and only have a little bit of staff working . the line is usually long to get served & the when my turn comes to choose the ice-cream i feel rushed . customer service is n't great .	4283
0	melt used to be good before they switched their ice cream vendors completely to udder delights . do n't get me wrong they 're still good , but i 'd rather eat blue bell than eat melt . karen 's kreamery was better . sorry !	4283
0	a little annoyed that i drove 30mins to try this place out and all they had was 5 flavors to choose from ! ? for the people that have to make a drive maybe you should call ahead , and see if they 're serving more than 5 flavors or have waffles in stock . it was a waste of my time ...	4283
1	friendly staff and fun atmosphere ! everyone that works here is polite and helpful . would recommend to anyone !	4284
1	i received great service here ! my starter died one night after i got home from a long drive . the next day i had my car towed to century 3 kia . within 4 days , they had replaced the starter and checked my whole vehicle for any problems . the communication was great on their end and they kept me in the loop the whole time ! the service was a little pricey even after they knocked off $ 30 ( very nice of them . )	4284
1	century 3 kia is great . the staff there was professional and nice , and willing to help . i i would suggest them to anyone	4284
1	i could not be more pleased with the great service and staff at century iii kia . the are knowledgeable , friendly and quite obviously customer focused . they always seem to `` go the extra mile '' on each of my service ( and flat tire ) visits . great service anywhere these days is hard to find . not here . you 'll be glad you got your car here .	4284
1	very quick and friendly service . comfortable chairs in waiting room . free beverage and snacks . clean facilities . i would recommend for routine services .	4284
0	special finance is a joke . they get you in promising you the stars to make you look like a jerk . sam was a very rude guy showed me two cars one with high milage the other had body damange . was told about all these banks they have that help people . yeah right the sales men r perverts and if your a pretty thing oh they are more and happy to put you in a car . just stay away	4284
0	friendly staff , will tell you to come out and feed you crap over the phone and to your face . if you hear oh we 'll call you tomorrow the bank has n't responded then do n't hold your breath they wo n't call you to say sorry could n't get the deal done . if you call and leave a message looking to see what 's going on do n't expect a call back once they get you there and they know your definitely not able to get a car from them your tossed to the side	4284
0	unprofessional does not begin to describe these folks . requested pricing online and asked simply for awd and navigation . it is now five hours later and still no quote ... it is 2018 . in 2000 i bought a car online and it took 25 minutes . just baffling .	4284
0	after waiting & waiting , then a text drive , i was basically offered $ 0 for my trade and required to basically pay off the current loan to get approved . of course you get all the bs on the phone- '' no worries '' -just to get ya in the door .	4284
0	bought a car from these guys . ended up paying full sticker , but that was n't unexpected , as the expected price was only $ 100-200 under based upon web site estimates . they did throw in stuffed animals for the kids . but that is not why i likely would n't return . the problem was , they screwed up the paperwork . i had to return to this place twice to sign additional copies . and i had to hound them for months for them to process my vehicle registration . and after all that , no apology , nor do they provide free inspections like the other dealers . next time , i 'll go elsewhere .	4284
1	i was seen within 25 mins . george ( pa ) was super nice and took the time to listen to my concerns and did a good job explaining everything to me . the ma and front desk staff were nice . i would go back again .	4285
1	i like i can see someone when my regular doctor isnt available . i know you make an appointment so that you dont have to wait , also .	4285
1	i have to leave a 5 star rating for george fuzfa , pa and his staff this evening . i was in and out withing 30 minutes and treated with the utmost respect . he actually listened to what i was going through and genuinely cared . i believe he went above and beyond to help me this evening . i will be forever be so grateful ! thank you for all of your help and support . !	4285
1	we were called back right away . staff was very helpful , friendly , and knowledgeable . thus is the only urgent care we use and highly recommend ! ! thank you .	4285
1	i have never been to an urgent care before and this was an entirely pleasant experience minus the reason i needed to be there . there was no wait , the receptionist was lovely and immediately got a nurse when i came in ( i sliced my thumb really good ) . the nurse was helpful , professional and kind . the doctor was compassionate , timely , easy to understand and made my stitches as painless as possible . the entire staff made my visit pleasant . i 'm not a phoenix resident but if i ever do need an urgent care again , this place and these people are it !	4285
1	came in today for a suspected eye infection with my 11 yr old daughter.. was in and out within an hour . front desk receptionist was very friendly as was the nurse don and doctor or np raul . everyone was very friendly with good bedside manner . this is the second time we 've been here.. first time was when my daughter had the flu . both times were positive experiences.. based on all the negative feedback i saw , i thought i 'd offer my opinion . i think they may have made some staffing changes . they are definitely aware of the bad feedback . they have signs in their office asking people to leave yelp feedback .	4285
1	came here for a school physical for my son . came in and was out the door within an hour . great staff and doctor , super friendly and knowledgable . will defiantly be using in the future .	4285
1	tired of my doc now and wanted to try a new place . i went early this afternoon . no line , got right in to see the nurse practitioner . staff were all quick , friendly and able to answer all my questions . no one likes going to urgent care , but i 'd go back if i had to .	4285
1	efficient service from check in to the doctor coming into the room . doctor was pleasant and attentive . listened to my concerns and provided tests to determine health issue and prescription . this urgent care is convenient for my location . hope i do n't need to return soon but if i need to do , i wo n't hesitate to visit them again .	4285
1	awesome service . we were in a hurry and they got us in and out in 1 hr 15 minutes . my 11 year old son had an ear infection and twisted ankle . the doctor was thorough , took x-rays of his ankle , and when he saw an abnormality , he took an x-ray of his other ankle to find out that it 's just the way my son 's ankle is configured . all is well and we 're on our way . good thing , because it 's a 3 day weekend . now we can rest easy and enjoy our out of town guests . thank you medpost !	4285
0	rude receptionist , rude pa. do n't bother , especially if you are in a lot of pain from ear infection , kidney stones , etc . they do not prescribe pain meds as a rule .	4285
0	very bad service.. checked in on line so that i did n't have to wait in the lobby , since that 's what check in on line is . still waited for over an hour after my set check in time . very unfriendly service . when i asked how much longer i have to wait they called me i . and put me in examining room and left me waiting longer .	4285
0	avoid ! waited over an hour and a half with 4 people in front of me . receptionist was nice but that 's all . no urgency with my 103 degree fever and chills . will not be returning as the wait time was unrealistic with one pa on staff .	4285
0	total wait time in the lobby was about an hour . staff was nice . once i was actually seen , the doctor is yelling in another language on the phone in one of the rooms . ( did not put me at ease . ) after 30 minutes in my `` waiting room '' the dr. barges in and was aggressive when answering my questions . he did n't really seem to take in what i was saying . and based off asking me my previous experience just prescribed me something similar ? not sure if i was properly helped like i could have been . i wo n't be coming back to this location .	4285
0	provider started out nice , but made inappropriate comments about me female area , pinched internally me with the tool used to do pap smears . and did absolutely nothing to help me with the pain i was experiencing . she prescribed me a medication for something i did not have and gave me ibuprofen which i already had . i was only looking for immediate pain relief for pelvic pain still not sure what the issue was with that . simply i feel like my insurance will be charged and i really was n't helped because i still was in pain when i left . will not be going back there	4285
0	warning ! do not go here ! my son had a 50 % oxygen level , he is 4 . they made my husband and my son wait over an hour to be seen . this should be illegal . warning ! do not go here ! ! !	4285
0	this place is horrible , service sucks beyond belief ... this is the 3rd time i have been there for myself or daughter . they ask for insurance but are to freaking lazy to run it . so , i get a bill from 6 months ago saying insurance denied . called insurance they said that this urgent care waited 3 months or more before submitting a claim . now i have a f @ cking collections on my credit report . this company sucks ! ! ! do n't waste your time no o e does there job right , except the doctors ... .	4285
0	first i will only be nice to give 1 star listen to all the reviews ! ! ! ! the lady at the front desk was very nice so was the cna ok the train stops there ! the so called dr george fuzfa what a joke anyone can go to school to be a doctor it takes more effort to actually be one ! ! ! ! ! hint hint how awful u should be ashamed how u treat people . this place wo n't stay open long if u stay ! ! !	4285
0	i took my mom here around 7:15pm , two people walked in after us . people that came after us , were seen before us , because they paid the co-pay , and my mom had achcccs . you would think , it would be based on first come first serve . but i felt like there was some sort of discrimination against paying co-pay vs people with az health care . very disappointed , and shocking .	4285
0	honestly they have terrible service here we made an appointment online and when it was time for the appointment they tell us that something came up and they could n't make time for us and that we would have to wait an hour before we would get a chance to be seen .	4285
1	in town for the gay games 9 i went with a friend so he could get a quick haircut . i decided to get a neck trim . even though i 'd never been there before i was told neck trims were free . both my friends haircut and my trim were flawless and we both loved the complimentary hot towel treatment afterwards . i 'm totally going back for a straight razor shave this week . thanks for such attentive and superb service .	4286
1	great place to get a haircut . $ 15 , can you do any better ? when you live in cleveland you are looking for an edge and rockefeller gives it to you . there is n't much in cleveland to get excited over but to be honest - you feel like a million bucks about your hair after a stop here . actually is a great staff . i go to donna , she 's excellent . knows what she 's doing and cool to talk to . i would suggest a visit . no happy endings but they do the hot towel shit and it feels amazing .	4286
1	step in , sit down , tell your barber what cut you want and hop into the conversation the guys are having , or just chill . you have three chairs and three expert barbers . no frills of the salon here . ryan did a slick job and took his time with my cut , finish with a straight blade on the back of the neck . old school professionals ! if only they had beer .	4286
0	it 's a disaster ! the guy who cut my hair has no idea what he was doing and he charged me 22 $ . definitely not going back again !	4286
0	tried to walk in and they said i needed an appointment , when their sign clearly states no appointment needed . they said they could n't take me as they were `` too busy '' with two people in chairs and no one waiting . so , i made an appointment for the following day . i called ahead to see if they were able to move my appointment around and were very unaccommodating . did n't care that i canceled my appointment and did n't work with me to try to find a time that would work . will not be giving them my business ever .	4286
0	great location , personable barbers , doing cleveland proud . gets 2 stars for cutting my face with a straight razor on my wedding day . went in for a straight razor cut , came out bleeding . i 'd probably go back but i would n't let them handle a razor near me again .	4286
1	love mary at eye love ! takes the time to sculpt my brows to a shape that is right for me . do n't trust those brows just anywhere !	4287
1	i saw meghan today for a consultation and brow shaping . it had been ages since i 'd had anyone professional look at my hairy brows , so i was a little nervous about what to expect . meghan was very friendly and easy to talk to -- -and she put me at ease about what shape my brows should be and what to let grow in a little more . the experience was very much pain free and i am super thrilled with the results . added bonus -- the space is beautiful : great lighting , a super cute puppy and a calming decor . i 'll be back !	4287
1	i 'm very picky about getting my brows done - especially after having bad experiences elsewhere . mary has become my go-to-girl for brows ! she really knows her stuff and has a knack for shaping your brows in a way that looks natural . some may think it 's too pricey , but it 's totally worth having a brow expert taking care of your brows ! you do n't want to risk someone messing it up !	4287
0	i just tried to book an appointment here . they said they need my credit card number incase i do n't show up for the appointment . i offered to pay in advance of the appointment using cash or credit to avoid having my credit card kept on their computer and they said it is not possible to pay in advance . can we say potential data hack waiting to happen ? ladies computers are a bad place to store credit card info .	4287
0	not worth the money at all ! my eyebrows look awful , it 's a waste of your money for sure ! maybe other girls are better than amanda ! do not believe the reviews you read like i did and drove all the way there to try it out and get un even and not clean eyebrows !	4287
0	i came here after seeing all the great reviews . i grew out my eyebrows for weeks and was super excited . after my appointment my eyebrows still looked bushy and absolutely no shape . i 'm not sure if that 's just in right now but i definitely was n't pleased paying 50 $ ( with a tip ) for them to tweeze a few hairs . very dissapointed , i 've now found an amazing place near my house that shapes my eyebrows perfectly for 10 $ . not worth the money at all .	4287
1	we come all the way from the east valley to get our 5th wheel tractor serviced . these guys are the best ! whether it be servicing your rv or your work truck . none better !	4288
1	real helpful staff and good turn around times . have had my 7.3l worked on here multiple times from major repair to routine maintenance and they do good work each time . they helped fabricate a speciality fuel neck for my trucks unique flatbed setup within my budget too .	4288
1	i took my motorhome to deer valley diesel because i had a fuel leak . they were very efficient and knowledgeable . they found the problem and fixed it for a reasonable price . they took the time to explain the problem and how they solved it . i felt very comfortable with this establishment and will return for oil changes etc .	4288
1	my chevy silverado 's transmission was running at 220 degrees . i brought it in to dvd . within a few hours they changed the transmission fluid and filter and the temp dropped down to 180 degrees . perfect ! i will be back .	4288
0	website says they are open till 7:30 i show up at 4:15 . the door is unlocked but they told me they are supposed to be closed they did work on my truck and my check engine light came on but ca n't run a diagnostic on it real quick . but i guess drinking beer at the counter is more important then helping a customer .	4288
0	horrible service..said my mint condition 2008 dodge 3500 less than 100,000 miles . took in for manifold gasket which was $ 1500 and left there and within 3 days my motor was blown . this had to have been set up for profit . this business is full of scam artists and rip off artists who create problems and want more money . do not trust them . then they tried to hold my truck for ransom . i got my keys back from them and drove off in black smoke to get it fixed properly .	4288
0	if they have -5 star i would give them , this shop they do n't know anything about mechanics . they 're a punch of idiots working there . from their owner to the service manager . careful guys all they trying to do is to emptying your pocket.. and they keep asking you to buy parts to replace it for you with out knowing what 's the problem . i put over 10k with over a week sitting in their lot and still nothing than i towed to the dealership and the dealership found the issue with 2 hours . it 's a shop with full of scams .	4288
0	beware ! all i have to say ... .went in for one issue and they kept coming up with other things that needed to be fixed , which had nothing to do with what i went in for in the first place . did work without my approval . checked them out on bbb after the fact , they have an f ! should have checked before i went there . beware !	4288
1	ica is a really nice , well-maintained retail store and range . it 's staffed with professional gun experts that can answer any question you might have about firearms . they also have a nice outdoor range for everything outdoors ! ica is affordable and sometimes you can find a groupon for a bargain ! it 's a great place to go target shoot on your lunch break , date night , or just for fun . they have a nice selection of guns and accessories and they even offer reasonably priced memberships for the indoor and outdoor ranges.. for the price you pay at any range for a couple hours/day , you might as well get a membership here and practice every week !	4289
1	had a great time here earlier today . well located just 10 miles outside pittsburgh , and easy to find with plenty of parking . definitely a safe , fun environment .	4289
1	i love the indoor shooting range ! open 7 days a week so i can always go down and blow off some steam . knowledgeable staff , local , and good prices . cant beat it !	4289
0	went there to visit . shooting lanes were filled with debris . messy . seeing where you are trying to shoot is very important , and the lighting was very poor/inconsistent as you move the electric target retrieval system back and forth to different distances . business hours listed here on yelp are not the same as those posted on door of the establishment . i submitted the edit to yelp a while ago but hours posted are still incorrect . very expensive and some unusual membership stipulations . must use their ammo , no option to join their outdoor range only .	4289
0	it 's a shame that the person they have operating the outdoor range is so rude and unprofessional , as well as unsafe . i 've been a member since they reopened the bulger location , but i 'm done . i will not tolerate unsafe practices at any range . avoid this place .	4289
0	if i could give less than 1 star , i would . our short experience here was highlighted by a very unpleasant interaction with the incredibly rude owner . not only did he refuse to honor our groupon , but he also acted as though he was doing us a favor by allowing us to patronize his establishment . we will never return and encourage others to steer away as well .	4289
1	i have had several procedures done by dr. meger . i had a mommy makeover in 2013 . most recently in nov 2017 i had a face lift , eyebrow lift , and eyes done at the same time . i have only great feedback for him and his staff . i will not go anywhere else for facials or any other treatments . i am 60.5 years old in my profile pic .	4290
1	absolutely amazing ! from the moment i walked into the door for my consultation to my post op appointments they have been awesome ! my mommy makeover results are fabulous and i 'm only a few weeks post op . i am constantly getting compliments on how good i look already and minot even close to being completely healed yet ! highly recommend them to everyone !	4290
1	dr. meger , did my facelift and breast aug. and my tummytuck ... nearly 20 years ago , and today i 'm still so happy with my results..and what 's amazing is he still has the same staff ...	4290
0	staff and dr. were very nice and office as well . had a breast lift and augmentation a few years ago at first i was not pleased with the results gave it a while and i still am not happy left breast completely numb from nerve damage . the look like they never dropped and really just do n't look like any of my friends that have had them done elsewhere . now i 'm trying to get ready to have them removed .	4290
0	my wife recently had breast augmentations from this degenerate . paid him 8k and she now has one large b size breast and the other is a small d. my wife and i were both shocked when we unwrapped the bandages . i immediately called him . he did n't answer , and then responded with a text saying `` yo you called ? '' . really ? ! ! ! ! what kind of doctor is this guy ? ! ! ! i then replied with what was going on ... and he replied and said `` it is what it is '' with a face ! ! ! really ? ! ! ! 8k ? it is what it is ?	4290
0	great staff , horrible results , uncaring surgeon , filthy facility . had breast implants removed , and a breast lift . sutures look like i just came off the frontline of the battlefield . nipples disfigured , one breast `` folds `` in the middle with muscle movement . i have had several doctors agreeing my results are horrible . dr meger has very poor bedside manner . not even a call back to find out why i am unsatisfied . too many surgeons in the valley- do n't take a risk with this one . but hey , i got a free pen and plastic glass with dr megers name on it !	4290
1	for men 's hair cut : it 's a decent place to go . reasonable prices . the staff is really welcoming and the service is real good . they listen to what you say and give you the hair cut you want .	4291
1	great price and quick cut	4291
1	i know all quickie hair cutteries can be hit or miss but this great clips location has always been both friendly and reliable . on this particular trip huda did a great job on my daughter 's hair was very pleasant in doing so . be sure to check in online though as waits can be long . this is a very popular location and therefore is very busy .	4291
1	was rushed in for a quick updo that came out great and lasted all night !	4291
0	bad staff ... staff was not welcoming at all . i checked in online for my two boys and within 5 mins we were at great clips . on screen we were shown the first to get haircut , however they took other in . when i asked why is that -staff with raised voice this is how it works and you r next -i waited for next one and again they repeated same taking other in before us . with raised tone and bad . i left with my 2boys from there without getting haircut . will not go again . bad bad staff ... .they do not have a curtesy to talk to a customer . worst staff	4291
0	if you 're a guy this is the place to go to get a screwed up haircut . thank the lord i always wear a hat cause if the general public saw my haircut they would run away like the asians run from godzilla . i never understood why people pay 30-40 bucks for a haircut until i went here . i highly would recommend a man never go here .	4291
0	be very specific with your instructions ! ! ! i said a little of the top and the stylist took off about half my hair .	4291
0	seriously the worst haircut i have gotten and mine is the simplest guys cut possible . instead of having the girl try to fix i decided to get out of the chair as soon as possible . thank god for baseball caps .	4291
1	i 'm originally from nyc and you ca n't go wrong with a dominican from washington heights doing your blow out ! from tratamento , rolos y un dubi great job all the way ! cash only !	4292
1	the staff does an amazing job with my daughters hair each time she comes . products they use are top quality but if you do n't ask for it you wo n't get it . there is usually a wait if you do n't get there when they open so plan ahead . would be a five star but the prices do change for the same style and treatments . bottom line - i trust them to take care of my daughters hair and will keep coming back .	4292
1	a little pricey but i feel as if i 'm finally getting my hair right on track . i get a relaxer every 2 and 1/2 months and it cost about $ 60 then you can choose your choice of deep conditioners , i usually get the $ 15 one . when i come in between getting my hair relaxed its about $ 40 , i might get a wash then pin-curl , sometimes a roller set , whatever i 'm feeling at the time . everyone is nice and accommodating and they get you in and out in a relatively quick time , no wasteful waiting . and they have plenty of girls on hand to get the job done .	4292
1	k..i needed to find a new dominican salon , because my old one closed down on me : ( . i am officially in love with this place ... i did n't need an appointment , the place was close to packed and i was getting my hair shampooed less than two minutes after i arrived ... .my hair feels amazing and healthy . one star off for inconvenience since they do n't take cards , but other than that , i 'm in love .	4292
1	yvelisse does an awesome job on my hair every time i come in . all ladies in the shop are so nice .	4292
1	what a pleasant surprise ! moved to charlotte from new york a few months ago , and i 'm pretty picky about hair salons , yvelisse did not disappoint ! i have natural hair and she did an excellent job ! yvelisse made me feel comfortable and the finished product was great ! i would definitely recommend ! *side note : this salon typically does n't apply the roller sat technique to natural hair , however i requested it . for me it makes all the difference !	4292
1	they do a magnificent job with the blowout . you will come out with silky straight hair blowing in the wind to rival any hair product commercial . they get you into a chair quickly and the service time is also quick . it is a lot of direct heat but they deep condition and the results are worth the price .	4292
0	the one star is for the lack of service . i went to get my eyebrows done and they took forever to see me , after they said it 'd be 5 minutes . just before i was going to say something , that 's when she called me back . mary does a great job and seems to be the only one that has etiquette in customer service . she was so courteous and we even spoketo each other in spanish . some of the others have attitudes for no reason . they keep that up , they wo n't have any business .	4292
0	i went here once to have my hair coloured and they destroyed it . i told them not to bleach it . well they layed me back in the bowl and brought me up and it was bright orange : ( ... i.e bleached ! what i explicitly asked them not to do . so , they colored it again and it looked ok but a few days later when i washed my hair , the color ran out and my hair was yellowish and felt like straw . so of course it became brittle and over the next two weeks broke off . i have n't been back since wo n't go back again .	4292
0	the 1 star is not for styling ; their blowouts are wonderful and last a long time . i 'm giving them 1 star because of their service . i 'm natural and my hair is 4a/3c . every time i walked in , they acted as if they did n't want to do my hair . and they also assumed i did n't know spanish . i understood the jokes they were making . they will never get another cent from me !	4292
0	got my hair colored here and felt very uncomfortable with other stylist looking over me to watch . very nice salon though . i 'll be back for a quick blowout sometime soon !	4292
0	stay away ! ! ! they mix relaxer in with their conditioner . ruined my 10 year olds thick hair . completely changed the texture . also were several patches of hair burned out . she has breakage along hurt edges now .	4292
0	stay away ! ! ! got the $ 10 conditioner and now my curl pattern is completely gone ! ! i used to go here when i was getting a relaxer ... however now that i 'm natural , i will not be back seeing that they mix relaxer with their conditioner ! !	4292
0	they destroyed my hair ! ! ! do not go to this salon they use too much heat , chemicals that are too harsh for black hair and the manger is unprofessional !	4292
1	i just moved here from minnesota and was having a hard time finding a stylist . i came across stacy ann and could not be more pleased . i am growing my hair out from a bob and she has made styling it during this phase much easier than i could ever imagine . i also have a bit of a natural ombre color and needed a light brown to cover my roots . she matched it perfectly . it is spot on and looks so natural . not to mention , she has an awesome personality and is super easy to talk to ! thanks , stacy ! ! !	4293
1	i 've been gong to stacy for years - even while living out of state . i book an appointment with her as soon as i know i 'm going to come into town . she took me from very very short to long and luscious without any awkward grow out phase . she has fixed my botched cuts from others ( and from myself : / ) and always given me beautiful color .	4293
0	i understand that this place may be very busy , but the fact that i 've called three times and have n't gotten a response is ridiculous . trying somewhere else .	4293
0	unprofessional to customers . first impressions are everything to any customer who is looking to use you for hair services .	4293
1	super nice when i called about my neighbor complaining about my dog . they said it sounds like my neighbor has the issue ! haha !	4294
1	they respond fairly quickly ! they got back to us often and rescued a dog that was being neglected within 24 hours . thank you !	4294
0	this place hates animals i called because my neigbors were beating up there dog , they wanted me to sigh a swore statement in 14 days , now the dog is dead , i wish the women who answered the phone was dead	4294
0	is everyone there that answers the phone unhappy ? second call ive had to make and second time the person is just rude with attitude . this is what you pay them for ... get new customer service reps that would be happy just to have a good job ! everyones replacable next time ill just call the police department . unbelievable ...	4294
1	great cleaners with very reasonable prices . being a repeat weekly customer has its rewards . owners always remember my name and dry cleaning is completed in a fashionable manor . had a problem with the hangers leaving a mark on my slacks . owners quickly remedied the situation . pay in cash and get a discount . great customer service with a smile .	4295
1	my go-to dry cleaner , mostly because it 's near the house.. they do 2 day service if not sooner which is great ! if you pay when you drop off you get 10 % off your bill !	4295
1	do n't understand why this place would get unfavorable reviews , as my clothes are always cleaned immaculately & lady at the counter is always so nice . very organized place , unlike other cleaners i 've gone to . i recommend this place . your clothes get cleaned in 24 hours . and the prices are reasonable .	4295
1	been coming here for the past 4 years and have alwaus had a good experience . open monday thru saturday .	4295
0	horrible customer service , i hate writing bad reviews but if the business pushes me to do so i do ! do not go here , have yet to find a good place to dry clean my clothes in this city . once i do ill for sure write an awesome review , stay away and do not come here . they throw your clothes on the ground , they have others clothes on the front counter where people can just walk away with , hopefully they go out of business soon . unfortunate to say , but if you do n't do it right get out of that business !	4295
0	do not ever go to this place ! i dropped off a few shirts and when i picked them up , one was missing and it was a brand new versace shirt and when i asked her to look for it she started yelling in her own language and did n't wan na look for it ! ! this is a very expensive shirt and coincidentally the only one missing ! ! thieves ! ! ! ! and she had the nerve to give me attitude ! !	4295
0	the quality of their work is mediocre . but the lady at the front desk is so incredibly rude and ca n't even communicate well enough to understand specifics about what you 'd like to have done .	4295
0	absolutely awful . i am still in shock at the aggressive nature of both a male and female . actually screaming and yelling and throwing hands in the air . all because they over charged me and had torn buttons off . i just asked a question . never ever give these people your business . do n't know where they learned their customer service but i have never seen anything like that . unbelievable .	4295
1	adam 's auto group made finding a new car and trading in my old one the easiest thing i 've ever done . would absolutely recommend adams to everyone i meet .	4296
1	great service , easy , and fast buying experience . i literally purchased a vehicle within a few hours ; no hassle -- no strenuous paper work or foolery . great knowledgeable team and salesman brandon is amazing at personalizing my needs and accommodations .	4296
1	the experience was great , the car i bought three weeks ago is doing great : ) . they were honest and upfront , and also very helpful and kind .	4296
1	i bought a 2004 jaguar xjr from them and im proud to say two years later its still running good and i really got a great deal from adams at a whole sale price you guys will always have my business .	4296
0	had my eye on a lexus isf , and had the displeasure of speaking to an employee named jenna through email . asked five questions regarding any possible damage to the vehicle , to include brake pad life and tire tread , and was told `` there are 35 pictures of the vehicle on the their website and i can decide for myself ' . i do n't know if this was due to her being ignorant , or possibly just stupid . nice car , but will look elsewhere and never do business with them due to this experience .	4296
0	if i could give 0 star rating i would ... .read the reviews ... seem to have good cars , unfortunately no good employees ... .dont know who owns or runs this company , but at current pace will not stay in business with the level of responsiveness or customer service.. i 've noticed a bit of bias in the other ratings ... seems the females rate it good and males tend to have problems ... hmmmm	4296
0	called to get pricing and more information on a vehicle . was rushed off of the phone and never called back with any information . i called again and someone answered and then hung up . no idea how the dealership has any customers at all ? ... .	4296
0	looked a used car today for grandson after second visit . test drove and then discussed purchase price . the price on the sticker was $ 1,000 less than what they said i could purchase the car for . when i asked why the offer was more than $ 1,000 over sticker price on car they said error on sticker . the manager would not discuss and we were treated like so what . frankly after this experiance and looking at other reviews on web site glad we did not make a purchase from adams .	4296
1	amazing manicure and pedicure . a hidden gem in mississauga . the staff is very friendly and inviting . definitely will come back ! highly recommended . i believe they specialize in nails and facials and massages . i 'm coming for a massage next , as they have registered massage therapists . i felt welcomed at shop although it was filled with girls : )	4297
1	have been a customer for a while . clean environment and professional staff . always good job ! the best part is that alice always gives great suggestions of colours and design . worry free~	4297
0	i tried to book an appointment for a manicure pedicure and biogel on my nails , the woman had a hard time even understanding what i am trying to get done . after 5 minutes of trying to explain what i needed done , i was frustrated and decided to go to a different place . i am an esthetician myself and if they ca n't get my appointment right..i ca n't imagine how my service would go . shame	4297
0	it was my first visit to this spa and likely my last . i chose this nail bar based on the reviews . environment was nice , spacious and elegant . quality of service not so much . i had a pedicure done - the filing job was poorly done , nails were still uneven and not clean , cuticles poorly cut . polish application also was uneven and streaky . she did n't even cover my nails completely . 2 stars for the nice ambiance of the facility and the cute kitty they had there .	4297
1	awesome experience .. professional , fast , no bologna just great service ... . 10 outa 10 ...	4298
1	great experience . overall process was very painless and the tint turned out great . set an appointment via text . steve showed up on time and knocked the job out in my garage . i 've had several cars tinted since living in las vegas and every single time something goes wrong . twice i 've had my cars scratched or dinged , and i notice it after the person leaves . they made it clear they would treat my vehicle with respect and they did . i would recommend these guys and use them again .	4298
0	dont waste your time with impact auto glass and tint . they installed tint on my car 10 days ago called them back so they come and fix issues i 'm having they wanted 100 dollars on top 130 dollars they already charged me to fix issues that they should address when they installed my tint at the first place . i called them to schedule new appointment to fix issues and they said they will come at 8am on saturday nobody showed up and called me to provide any information if they are coming or not . i called them and they are not answering their phone .	4298
0	terrible service ! ! ! starts out great with some nice girl on the phone and then they become very very irresponsible . i caught them in 2 different lies and when i asked the girl about it she hung up on me , after they left us hanging for days . they are not truthful i would not let them come to your house although the installer that came was a very nice guy . i used eco-tint they are awesome highly recommend eco-tint .	4298
1	yesterday i went here with my boyfriend to get some new furniture for our house after finding them on offer up . gave us really good prices on everything . when we got home we realized the table we had purchased had a factory defect . although we originally picked up all our furniture and did not have it delivered rubins furniture came out the very next day with the very same table already assembled . thanks guys ! will be back in the future !	4299
1	found a daybed i 've been trying to find for weeks now , thank you for the sweet deal . i 'll be back ! good customer service and quality furniture	4299
0	never ever buy furniture form this place . they are nice when you are purchasing however they are horrid if you have issues with your furniture . i bought a couch . it 's over firm and the pieces are uneven . no one would want to live in a house where this couch is the main thing to sit on . it gets more comfortable over time my arse ! julio is a joke now snap finance are idiots too . their furniture is crappy chinese stuff that sits uneven as all hell if you want good quality furniture do n't go here . this is for the desperate people or anyone who loves hard ass couches .	4299
0	i would think being in a small business your customer service would be better than a big box store ; i was wrong ! you guys beat out rc willey and their horrible service by far ! you win ! ! ! good luck staying in business ...	4299
1	overall an average hampton stay . my room was clean and adequate . the whirlpool tub in the room was a nice way to relax after a long day . always plenty of hot water , even though it was very loud to fill the tub . my only complaint would be that the flow of the breakfast area is poorly designed and severly undersized for a hotel of this size . i would stay again if working in the area .	4300
1	stayed here for a wedding with many other guests . the hotel is undergoing a renovation . from what i can tell we had a renovated room which was very nice and colorful with barn doors and a flat screen lg tv . the staff was friendly at check in . the valet is $ 20 and self is $ 15 expected in this area . breakfast is free which is a plus but , really nothing special . it was packed . america . i would stay here again ! ! !	4300
1	great hotel . clean , quiet , and great location . the staff recommended restaurants and nightlife , and their recs were spot on . the shuttle was super convenient and was there in less than 10 minutes after we hailed it . breakfast was your basic fare -- waffles , yogurt , cereal , etc but was well stocked . great value !	4300
0	i left two chargers in the room i was staying in . i came back the same day , soon after i checked out , thinking they would have them . i was wrong ! whoever cleaned the room must have kept my chargers because according to them they were n't in the room .	4300
0	nice lobby . nice hotel . very slow internet . i realize it is free , but you should n't market it as a freebie if it ca n't be sold otherwise . definitely no high speed at this hotel .	4300
0	how is this a 4 star property ? i came back to my room twice , and walked into the toilet acting up . i literally had to look around for an employee one night to get a new room key after mine stopped working . my tv never worked during my stay , despite my comments to the front desk . there are hotels everywhere in this town ... .stay elsewhere .	4300
1	i like it . friendly folks . business-friendly rooms . overall good stuff . not really close to anything uptown , but that 's okay , you 're not technically in charlotte . you 're probably closer to the south carolina than uptown ... but sheraton and starpoints starwood blah whatever it 's called does a great job . downsides : fitness room is muggy and warmer than the hallway . do n't y'all know people get hot and sweaty when they work out ? ( turn up the a/c ) . um , that 's it . everything else is very nice . i would come back .	4301
1	i 'm giving this hotel a 5 star . everything was clean from the lobby , elevator , walls , halls to my room ! everything was updated , the washer and dryer worked wonderfully . the staff was very friendly and helpful . they have a restaurant/bar downstairs . breakfast buffet was only $ 5 per adult and $ 3 per child . the location of this hotel is prime with the mall across the street and other shopping centers around its great i would recommend staying here and will be back !	4301
1	best place to recharge in pineville after a long day at work . comfortable beds , friendly staff and a great breakfast .	4301
0	horrible cable service in the room . you change a channel and it takes time to get to the next . will not come here again	4301
0	i hosted a function at this hotel 3 years ago . it was great - the staff was attentive and covered all my needs , and the facility was excellent . i called them to arrange the same event this year , and it was like working with a completely different group of people . guest rooms were over 1.5x the cost , meeting room unavailable , they did n't have my information ( that i sent them ) while they were talking to me , so i was giving them details i had already provided ... what a mess . i am now looking for a different hotel to work with ; i wo n't be back here .	4301
0	warning - when they say `` some construction '' they mean the whole lobby , bar and restaurant ! now i know why it looked like such a nice hotel online but was way lower than the others in the area - follow the yellow tape and signs to the side door , past the stairwell to the `` front desk '' . it is now 9:00pm and i still hear hammering . did i mention that one of the phone lines appeared to be cut ? they said 5 more weeks until they are done ... avoid until complete is my recommendation - or best of luck .	4301
1	pretty cool place . i agree , any seat is a great seat . pretty nice layout . i ca n't speak to the food because we ate before we got there . we saw chris d'elia who was surprisingly pretty funny . i bought the tickets before i checked out some of his performances and was a little nervous he wouldnt be great . he was pretty funny and i had a great time at the comedy zone !	4302
1	i really enjoy coming to this location.. you get to see all of your favorite comedians at a fairly good price . ordered it ahead and pick it up at will call ! i probably been at this location like 5x . and the staffs have alway been helpful and caring . it can get a bit overwhelming for them with sooo many ppl ordering and served at the same time.. and they managed to move around without disturbing people 's view . which i love about this place .	4302
1	service was a bit slow , but the environment here is fantastic ! we only had a few beers , but the food at the neighbors table looked great and they complimented its taste ! the prices were quite expensive though ... at least compared to the restaurant upstairs .	4302
1	i love the comics that come through here . i have seen john witherspoon , jay pharoah , and the ffcs group ( chicobean , bdaht , darren brand , and osamabindrankin . the wings are excellente and drinks are reasonably priced . the website charge high fees , so it is better to purchase them on site . a great charlotte gem ! i did have a little incident with being double booked at a table but burpie worked it out .	4302
1	i visited the comedy zone on sunday afternoon for a family friendly improv show by the chuckleheads . i enjoyed the experience , the location and parking were decent . in the comedy zome , they have bacon cheese fries on their menu . those were the best bacon cheese fries i have ever tasted in my entire life . i ca n't wait to go back to eat more ! i also had a margarita ( it 's $ 20 for 4 people ) . it was pretty decent . i do n't drink margaritas often so i 'm not sure what i can compare it to , but it was really big and i only split it with one other person .	4302
1	love the comedy zone in charlotte . have seen top notch acts and have laughed my butt off . although the food and drinks are kinda pricey , it is great to get out and laugh so hard . the facility is clean and any seat is a good seat .	4302
1	cool spot , great location . i always enjoy myself when i go to comedy zone . the food and drinks are average , but the entertainment is awesome . i wish they would update their menu , they have drinks on the menu that they do n't serve . i would recommend going to comedy zone for fun and laughter but not food .	4302
1	i have n't visited a comedy club in years ! ! ! this was my second time visiting the comedy zone , of course i had a wonderful time . tonight deon cole from blackish was performing ! ! ! his stand-up brought the entire room to trears ! ! hilarious-loved it . i went with a meetup group so there were about 90 members there . overall my experience was great ,	4302
1	love this place . always leave with a pain in my side from laughing . almost famous is my favorite . the host is hilarious . good is alright , drinks are reasonable . always a good time , always !	4302
0	drug addict thieves parking your car , they will steel anything they can get there hands on and ameripark will do nothing to seek justice for you ... they stand by the thieves they have working for them and not the people paying them to park there car .	4302
0	i 'm so fucking upset i 've sobered up . i purchased expensive ass tickets 2 months ago for the best seats and they shoved me into the fucking side of the stage . i ca n't see the comedians facial expressions which for this guy is half his show . i 'm so upset this is a fucking waste . will never come here again . the seat diagram they have online is not at all representative of the real set up . the other people at my table are equally pissed . i am so mad i almost want to leave and get my money back because i feel i have been screwed now .	4302
0	i had a horrible time here . they say us at a table that literally gave me a headache . i have a neurological condition , so it is uncomfortable to turn my head to the left . we were in a group and the way it worked out , i had to turn my whole body towards the stage and still could n't really see the performers . when it was over , there was a mad dash to get out , since it was late , but the exit was very cramped and the tight security would only let people through certain areas . i wo n't ever go back .	4302
0	i enjoyed the show however i felt the food items and bar drinks were very pricey , $ 14 for a cheeseburger that did n't look very good or very big was a bit expensive in my book , they also automatically added an 18 % gratitude to my check and i was only there with one other person , so i found that to be odd .	4302
0	v-good talent , but rude / hostile office staff .	4302
0	upset ! went to a show last night ( 12/21 ) . the waitress brought me back someone else 's credit card ( could n't tell because the place was so dark ) and now they ca n't find mine ! now i have to freeze my card through christmas and now i 'm stuck in charlotte for the holidays ( ca n't go home ) ! *and of course no one is accepting blame* i wish i could give `` negative stars '' on this review . the only thing good about it is how mike , from the club , initially tried to find out what happened . other than that ... i must be expendable .	4302
0	we were seated in the front of the club ( gold circle ) . no wait staff ever came to take a drink order . the comedians were beyond boring . the headliner started arguing with an audience member and threatened to fight , then cut his set short to go `` fight '' . ridiculous and a waist of time !	4302
0	to crowd.. the food is not good and the drinks are juiced up.. good for a laugh here and there but not my first go too	4302
0	loved the atmosphere , but the server was shitty period . it took over 10 minutes to get my card back from paying for my food . how can i just get there and get my food , and the people we were sitting with it took over 30 minutes to get the same dish and they ordered it before we sat down . then had some excuse about the cooks did n't hear them . its worst when you see other people get there food that also just got there as well . the other servers were hustling and ours was in their own world . i hope they see this so they can figure out what to do with them	4302
1	our designer paul was outstanding to work with . the pool he designed for us exceeded our expectations . answered any questions we had through out the process . ca n't thank paul enough for making this experience a enjoyable one . once we finalized our pool plan we worked directly with terry who was in charge of the construction schedule . she was very efficient and answered any question we had in a timely manner . anytime i needed to get in contact with her she was always accessible . i would recommend desert springs pools & spas to anyone of my family or friends . we love our new pool !	4303
1	i must say this company did a fantastic job doing my pool . from the beginning paul our designer listened to what we wanted . he added touches my husband and i were thrilled with . my pool is simply stunning . terry , joe , jason , dan , paula , cindy thank you from the bottom of my heart . you made one of my life long , dreams a reality and at a much lower cost than some of the other companies i looked into . thank you for your hard work and attention to detail . glad i did my homework on several companies before choosing desert springs . i am so pleased . thank you again .	4303
1	desert springs pools & spas did a great job in building my pool . the knowledge these guys have , was unbelievable , and you could tell they knew what they were talking about when it came to swimming pools . i could n't be happier to be working with these guys , and would recommend them to anyone out there looking for a pool . thanks desert springs pools & spas	4303
1	i have purchased a pool from desert springs before and have just completed a spa package with a complete landscaping job . not only is it done to my satisfaction but the process was easy with great communication the entire way . would not look any further for any future needs . great crew along with the design to the financing to the finished product . 5 stars ! ! ! !	4303
1	desert springs pools and spa did a great job on my pool . they are very professional and on top of everything . i would recommend them to anyone considering a pool . they did an awesome job	4303
1	great service and easy process all the way around . mike g did a great job with the design and was available anytime i needed him . dan the foreman was excellent and you can tell he knows his stuff . terry in the office was awesome with the communication . finished in the time they said and made good on everything . great company and could n't be happier .	4303
1	i absolutely love my new swimming pool by these guys . you can tell why these guys are the best builders in town . they were always available every time i needed or wanted to talk to the designers . i even changed my mind multiple times when it came to the design , and they were always so accommodating . i could n't be happier with what desert springs built me and we will be having pool parties for years to come .	4303
1	desert springs did a fine job putting in a pool , pool heater and landscaping for me . price was on par with other contractors and they always were there to call if i had questions . the pool has been in 4 years already and they did do quality work . the whole process took about 2 months to complete .	4303
1	they remodeled my pool and did a fabulous job . we loved working with our consultant brandon as he had very creative design ideas . the company was awesome to work with . the construction crew and the office staff were a pleasure	4303
1	we had our pool built by desert springs 8 years ago and no problems . the few times we have needed a repair service , their service department took care of us . service was quick and professional . i have to say , i was especially impressed by the customer service that was given by the service . manager mike . he followed up and made sure we are happy . this is the second pool they have done for us and we are customers for life .	4303
1	we are about half way done with our pool ... .. our salesperson paul , designed a beautiful pool that will certainly make our back yard look gorgeous ! he has been great to deal with and has been very helpful with the process . we have been happy with everything so far and everyone that we have dealt with has been pleasant and helpful . i would recommend this pool company to anyone !	4303
1	desert springs pools & spas did a fantastic job on our pool ! we signed our contract in january , they began work in feb and we were completed at the end of march ! dan , dan , joe , cindy and terry were great to work with ! we had some minor issues but everything was taken care of immediately . we would recommend this company to anyone looking for an in ground pool in the las vegas area . the quality of pool equipment is great ! all pentair products . we are very please with the outcome . this was the `` best bang for our buck ! '' call them today !	4303
1	i recently had my pool installed by mike , i have never been more satisfied with how beautiful my backyard is . i would highly recommend them to all my friends and family . wonderful customer service !	4303
0	now there is a problem plaster cracking and cool deck breaking up after just 2 years now desert springs do n't want to answer emails	4303
0	been waiting nearly a month for them to get me a quote and design . tough to go with a company that does n't seem to have any interest in designing and quoting a pool ...	4303
0	dont use this company . they should n't be in business . worst company i 've ever dealt with for any purchase .	4303
0	this is the worst people to do any business with ! the lack of communication is ridiculous ! they do not return phone calls or update you on the process of the pool construction . they show up one week consistently then disappear for weeks . pool was completed a month behind schedule . only after we complained , and got a hold of the general manager was anything address . i would suggest you hire another company to build your pool .	4303
0	dont use this company . they should n't be in business . worst company i 've ever dealt with for any purchase .	4303
0	ok , just a follow up . one of the trenches that they `` back filled '' totally sunk in after the first big rain . they took 0 responsibility and fortunately my landscaper stepped up and made the repairs as a gesture of good business practice . i am sure to need another pool built . just like i am sure that someone will ask me for a recommendation . i do n't think i will use these guys again . they simply do n't make me feel good about my purchase and the few dollars that they may save you upfront will be spent in the end dealing with their penny pinching .	4303
0	rude unprofessional and tried to over charge me ... do yourself a favor use someone else ...	4303
0	they overestimated and overcharged when it was obvious that the work they initially described did not have to been implemented . they did not do the work they described in the contract and the work they did do was basically a comedy of errors . they rebuilt a flush well built paver patio with a border that had a five inch gap between the two sides . in addition the patio was not flush with the sides and the pool cleaner they sent left the pool dirtier than when he arrived . stay far away from this company if you have any sense or concern about quality .	4303
0	our pool is n't even 4 years old yet & we were told we need all new plaster ! of course this is after both valves on the pumps went bad and had to be replaced in the first year . but hey , its only $ 4400 ! ! the re barb & ties keep poking through , talk about shotty work . and i agree with the other bad reviews , trying to get them to come out to fix their crappy work is like trying to part the sea . shame on you desert springs !	4303
0	this company lies about using subcontractors . they tell you they are employees . they are illegals and do substandard work . they demoed our in-ground-pool and then covered up one of the two skimmer jets . we told them there was a jet there and they said there was n't . then we showed them photographic proof . they finally believed us . what kind of pool only has one skimmer jet ? wth ? this company sucks ! do not use this company ! they will take your $ and then not honor their contract !	4303
0	horrible service . they tried to pull a couple of fast ones . al is the worst employee i 've meet in a long time . never gets back to you via text , email , or phone call . the owner and sales mgr was just as bad . never use them or al . its a joke of a company that is on the way down .	4303
0	wow ! soooo glad i read the reviews..i will definitely not be using this company for our pool renovation . yikes	4303
0	stopped by to get a quote for a pool . the guy came out later that week to measure and go over what we wanted done . said to give him 3-4 days and he would get back to us and email the design . two weeks later ... .no email , no phone call , nothing . if they ca n't get back to me with a design to take my $ 50k- 75k , how can i trust them once they have my money ? ? ?	4303
1	i love frilly lilly ! i specifically go to see crystal , she is amazing at waxes . her brazilians are quick with hardly no pain and my skin is never irritated from the wax . she 's also amazing at eyebrows , she really takes her time and is very meticulous . really any service i 've gotten from her has been wonderful and she is delightful to be around even when she 's causing you mild pain .	4304
1	love love love the service here ! i got a brazilian wax and this is my very first time getting it at frilly lilly . it turned out to be a great experience ! the girl i think her name is jen , very professional , and very detailed while doing her job . my best brazilian wax experience ever !	4304
1	it was my first time at frilly lilly and my first time at a salon in calgary . i came from ottawa where i had one esthetician of choice so i was nervous for something new . but the girls there made it a wonderful experience , felicia was who i had my appointment with and she was just wonderful . she made me feel welcome and relaxed and she is very skilled at what she does . i got the brazilian wax , which is never pleasant , but i can say for sure she made the experience the best one that i 've had . i recommend her to anyone . thank you frilly lilly for making a normally unpleasant experience very enjoyable !	4304
0	i have gone to this place for years , and will go back but never to jen ... . lets just say i had an eyebrow disaster . i will never tint again here . i asked for a light brown and i looked like bert and ernie . awful and right before engagement photos ... .	4304
0	i 've been here twice . i was not impressed whatsoever . i had two technicians who did a very poor job on my brows , leaving lots of strays everywhere , not to mention dried wax on my face . one of them even told me that since frilly lilly does n't specialize in brows , i really should n't be coming here . front end is dirty and cluttered with little trinkets and bric-a-brac , reception was disinterested and disorganized .	4304
0	i had my first gel nails application done one week ago at frilly lilly- today i had them redone elsewhere ! ! please do not go here . they were horrible ! thick , uneven & bloodied cuticles was what i got . i was very dissappointed because i read good reviews but my experience was anything but good . i went to the aspen location in calgary and the nail tech said she had 5 years experience but i do not believe it . i really should have walked out when i saw it going downhill but i did n't .	4304
1	i have gone into this store many times and each time they are friendly , helpful and never try to get me to spend more than i need to . in fact , they 've talked me out of buying things so i could save money and be more knowledgeable . i 'm pretty sure this is a family run business , always the same people working there . they seem to really care . they have a pretty good selection of all things pool related for a small store . prices are on par with other stores .	4305
1	really appreciate all the help they have given us to get our pool in shape . never forced us to buy anything or sold us stuff that 's was n't necessary . they have also been very patient with a first time pool owner and answered all questions . highly recommend !	4305
0	i had a similar experience as one of the other reviewers ... mainly that after the work was done the tech informed me that the invoice was nearly triple what was quoted prior to the work being done , but there was nothing in writing and that it was my misunderstanding . on top of that , the work was done incorrectly . i had a couple of relatively heated arguments with sun devil , in which they assumed no blame or responsibility , and proceeded to belittle and insult me . i do not recommend sun devil pool supply .	4305
0	had a horrible experience working with the store in chandler location near fry's.after confirming the appointment the technician did n't show up.when we called they simply said it was a mistake by a.j who confirmed the appointment and they can not show up ! we canceled the appointment and the owner did not care to apologize as well.beware of those company as they can not keep up to their commitment .	4305
1	our son attends the welding program , and will be graduating this april . the staff has been helpful , and the instructors have been knowledgeable . everything was clearly explained from the start , of course we ask questions . our son is on time , and attends daily . the only reason they have n't received a 5 star rating is because he has not gone through the job placement assistance yet . he 's a go getter , so i 'm sure he wo n't just sit back and wait for them to get him a job . : )	4306
1	i 'm in the third phase of the hvac program . i 've greatly enjoyed and learned a lot here . i 'm already in the field and my instructor answers a lot of questions the technicians i worked with did n't seem to have answers for . pretty boss and pretty excited to continue learning about the hvac field . a lot of hard work but it 's worth it .	4306
1	just like any tech school , you will only learn the basics . then you have to grow up and learn the trade on the job ! place really gave me a direction of where i want to go in life . not saying this is the best place to go , it was hard . but life is hard !	4306
0	i 'm currently attendingin the hvacr program and it seems good so far but ill keep you updated out ...	4306
0	as i write this im a student here with a couple months left before im done . dont come here . im a vet so i used my gi bill meaning i didnt have to pay to come here for the welding program . its about 20,000 to come take a 10 month course to learn 4 types of welding . thats not good . you can go to the maricopa skill center and learn the same thing for 10,000 and thats for a 17 month course . and good luck using your `` credits '' anywhere else if you come here because its a for profit school . do your research please . this was just the closest place to my house .	4306
0	i 'm a u.s. vet ... i finished the school ... .they are trying to stick me with a large bill because some one who no longer works there messed up the gi bill paper work ... i would no recommend this school ...	4306
1	wonderful adult store in vegas.. clean and bright place.. feel free to bring ur lady or even mom.. smile ! the staff is knowledgeable and very friendly . great selection of books and toys . am buying a new vibrator for my gal ... have decided on the model , but will let her pick the color . adult emporium is highly recommended .	4307
1	i actually prefer this place over the adult superstore for a few reasons..it 's slightly cheaper and the enrivonment is slightly more fun and cute and even more playful if that 's even possible . the adult superstore is somewhat more dirtier and cold . this place has extensive movies , toys , and even clothes and memorabilia type of stuff . clerks are pretty friendly and helpful too . definitely check this place out !	4307
1	very nice place with good help . wish they had a little more bondage gear though .	4307
1	never been to a store like this before but everyone who worked there was very helpful and friendly . crystal , who helped us , was very knowledgable and professional . she is easy to talk to and knew exactly what we needed . i would not hesitate to go back or to recommend this establishment to someone . wonderful people work here ! ! ! love it ! !	4307
1	i love this place ! everyone employed there is fully capable to help you in any area from outfits to toys . this is the place to go	4307
1	i was very comfortable shopping here . justine was polite , helpful , and knowledgeable . i appreciate her honestly and the fact that she was never crude or inappropriate . i purchased several items and it was easy and fun . thanks , justine !	4307
1	i came in to browse and ended up leaving with some fun new toys . there 's a great selection and they have products for anything you have in mind . carsun helped me pinpoint the products that were right for me . i 'll definitely go back next time i 'm looking for something exciting .	4307
1	i came here to purchase a birthday gift for a friend and was really unsure of what to get . raven was incredibly helpful and we picked out a super cool toy . i 'm sure that he wo n't even need birthday sex after one round with this ! lol	4307
1	fantastic customer service from kayla , haylee , and justine ! ! they helped me find everything i was looking for . highly recommended ! !	4307
1	amazing place with so many things to see and buy ! we stopped by upon arriving in vegas and received great customer service from colleen . she was friendly , funny and went above and beyond in helping us find what we were looking for . kudos to colleen for making our experience a 10 ! stop by this fun store when in vegas ! !	4307
1	absolutely love this place ! they make a friday night so much more fun ! justine made our visit soooo worth it ! definitely come and see her !	4307
1	bobby and devinne were awesome as they answered alot of questions and very professional . nice store . highly recommended ... you wo n't be disappointed going there . alot of fun stuff .	4307
0	nice store but i have to give them a low rating because they are funny with the coupons that they advertise here on yelp and on the radio . they advertise 20 % off your purchase . what they do n't tell you is that it requires a $ 100 purchase *now* and *then* you get a coupon for 20 % of a *future* purchase . that 's just plain bad policy and bad advertising . so you 're basically buying a 20 % coupon for $ 100 even though their ads clearly state that they offer a 20 % discount . i enjoyed shopping there but i 'm unlikely to return due to bad customer service policies like this one .	4307
0	rudest people . horrible service . waited forever for someone to help me or even acknowledge me . this place has gone down hill .	4307
0	quality sucks ! bought a necklace 2 days ago , and when i opened it , it was broken ! ! ! ! wtf ? and i call to see if i can get a new one and they say no because it has been a couple of days ... i did not want my money back i just wanted a necklace that was not broken . horrible customer service .	4307
0	iam aware of the company policy of no returns or exchanges . how ever i purchased a pricey item , brought it home and the box was nearly empty . employee ashley failed to check the box for me . there for i am unhappy with her customer service . maybe you guys should check closer for petty theft . as iam left with an expensive tab with nothing in return date to ashley 's poor judgment .	4307
0	yuck yuck and more yuck . watch out for cleaner hes a pervert . also 2 guys that hang in arcade.obviously they did n't want me . but my man yes . big fat african guy and latino guy kept looking in our booth . complained to management about cleaner . they did n't seem to care . one clerk guy with lots of tattoo and glasses very unprofessional snd seemed to want to protect cleaner when i told him the problem . awful .	4307
0	came here with a friend looking for some edc apparel crystal at the front counter was very rude and immediately blurted out across the room that she 'll need some id it 's an 18+ establishment . i 'm 34 and the person i was with is younger but was very obviously over 18 . we went and dug her birth certificate out of the trunk and we 're turned down again immediately without even looking at it . apparently they do n't appreciate business here	4307
0	gross aber langweilig ... die auswahl ist im vergleich zu shops in der heimat eher enttäuschend	4307
0	the staff in this location is very rude and not helpful . when asked about certain items a lady with blonde hair kept giving me a attitude for no reason ! oh we do n't carry that anymore ! ! does it say we do ? ! ? ! she was yelling for no reason & i was only asking a question . lol	4307
0	rude staff went in with my girlfriend and was immediately carded . i did n't have my id but we are 26 years old ! the staff did not need to be so rude . went to adult superstore down the street instead . these guys really need to improve their customer service . i wo n't be going back .	4307
0	large store with selection , but terribly rude employees . plenty of other toy options in vegas . avoid this one .	4307
0	this place looks nice on the outside but once you get in the freaks come out . i didnt realize its a spank theatre full of creepy people . the pissed off rude chick behind the desk had to yell at two different people to leave us alone and stop following us around . the bra that was there brand has already fallen apart didnt expected that for $ 28 . good thing there are a lot of other stores in vegas .	4307
0	not happy . i felt like i was being followed the entire time . received very short , vague answers to my all of my questions . the staff even stood outside of the dirty dressing room the entire time as i tried on apparel very awkward & uncomfortable . to top it all off i get accused of stealing as i walk out the door ! ! stores like this should have a non judgmental atmosphere so people feel free to buy & explore . so disappointed my first time in the store was incredibly insulting . never returning .	4307
1	i am completely satisfied with the quality of this car wash . it 's fast , convenient , and reasonably priced . the staff are also very helpful and pleasant . i 'll be taking my car here again the next time it needs washed .	4308
1	reasonably priced but no full-serve . the vip wash was very effective .	4308
0	the worst experience ever . i used to always get my cat washed here and vacuum after and have given them hundreds of dollars and i was just vacuuming my cat and the guy cut vacuuming my short after less than a minute . ( it was supposed to be 4 minutes and a guy came over and rudely said ca n't you see we are closed . i thought only the wash was closed and not the vacuums . the machine took my $ 5 and now i have 4 tokens a dirty car and i do n't want to ever return to use the tokens . incredibly rude people .	4308
0	if you own a truck and do n't have a bed cover this is not the place for you . thy apparently do n't have the proper equipment to get the job do n't for all vehicles .	4308
1	shout out to kenny who is the best at a+ customer service ! ! great location to go and smog your car . fast and easy and great conversation too ! thanks jiffy smog !	4309
1	well i went early this morning and i met kenny who works there he was very polite very informative i just moved here was asking him questions about certain things where to go how to do it and he was so helpful in so many ways and did it fast easy great job on my car and i had very pleasant conversation with him i really enjoyed my experience at this location durango if i got to go back next year the next i will go and kenny 's there thanks kenny	4309
0	downhill service ! used to be a good place but under new mgmt it is awful . rude , inconsiderate staff treat you like your bothering them . guy asks me what i want . i say a smog check as my car is parked 3 feet from the smog test machine/shack . few minutes later asks me again what i want as i again have to say a smog check . mumbles at me as he types then hear the word `` done '' as he leaves me standing there . refused to take a coupon , mumbled expired , did n't look at my other two coupons . used to go there the past 15 yrs with multiple vehicles . never again !	4309
0	do n't fall for the jiffy smog coupon on the internet . it 's not worth a penny . the company just wants your i.p . address to send you junk mail ; in return you get nothing .. nada , for the coupon you present and are told by the technician , unfortunately you must pay the full price for the smog . what gives ? we are all suckers to patronize this company that is all smoke and mirrors . i will never use them again . buyer beware . i just could n't believe it when the tech charged me the full price for the smog certificate for an almost brand new car . what a racket !	4309
1	nice people running this place . it 's downfall is it 's complete lack of style . you will feel like you 're in a fat bachelors living room . the place is a mess and most likely many health code violations are going down in this joint . that being said , the owners could n't be nicer ( although not the most chatty ) and the coffee is good . they need some music however and maybe some younger people working there .	4310
1	great little coffee shop with a lot of original coffee drinks , wifi , and plenty of space . try the aztec powder stuff . it 's great !	4310
1	neat place a little bigger than the standard starbucks but the coffee is good , there is lots of seating and the staff is very nice . they have free wi-fi and a small conference room in the back great for that lunch business meeting or a late afternoon meet up . they also have live christian music on friday nights , i thought that was kind of cool . they get fresh pastry 's in daily and i have n't been disappointed yet . this is my tuesday morning hang out . i meet business people here every tuesday for a network meeting and they welcome us with open arms . check it out .	4310
0	we pass by this coffee shop every day and have been wanting to go in . this morning we decided to give it a try . we went in around 7:00 am on a wednesday morning and there were no customers there , although a couple did show up while we were waiting . the gentleman behind the counter was very nice and helpful . unfortunately we did not think the coffee was very good ( we ended up getting qt coffee afterward ) and the service was a bit slow . also , there seemed to be a lot of things strewn around inside which took away from the experience .	4310
0	went to coffee cove on a monday at 6:10am . sign says they open at 6:00am , but the shop was empty with the lights off . is this place closed ? so much for trying a new coffee shop .	4310
0	way over the top with the christian music and christian icons . coffee is ok and the staff are pleasant - just not my cup of tea	4310
1	jose ' did excellent work on fixing the problem in the bathroom last friday . keep up the great work . kudo 's to the maintenance staff .	4311
1	just wanted to share my appreciation for our maintenance team , mr. johnny and mr. jose . i have lived here for over 4 years and they are by far the best maintenance crew the property has ever had . when they repair or fix something , it stays fixed . they are polite and care about tenants comfort and experience while living here , thanks guys for all you do ! ! our new manager ms. kylie is very friendly and works hard to keep tenants happy and our property safe . our property is clean and quiet . they are older apartments but the team here does everything they can to keep them comfortable and in good repair .	4311
1	we had a great experience at river ranch apartments . the new leasing manager , christina davis , is a true and caring professional . my mom has a unique set of issues and was facing a time crunch . christina 's knowledge and efficiency saved my mom hundreds of dollars . she was amazing . our apartment is clean and quiet . i feel very comfortable with my older mom living alone at river ranch . the entire staff makes my mom feel like her needs matter and like she is important . no bugs , no animal waste , no loud noise . we love river ranch and highly recommend talking to christina davis if you are looking for a new apartment .	4311
0	lived here a year and half . constantly asked for bathroom to be fixed after `` repairs '' . never was . black mold in closet & filthy carpet when we got the keys to place . drunken people sitting on balcony across the way arguing at 2a.m . , pool was green with algae during summer , dog crap everywhere . than when we move out they try tho slap us with a fee of things that were broke when we moved in ! we moved in quick because we were new to town and needed to find a place fast . huge mistake . steer very clear of this place !	4311
0	i live in the 2nd floor , and the downstairs residents smoke in their apartment , the smell travels into my apartment . i also noticed it when i would turn the bathroom light/fan on or sometimes the air conditioner that it would start to smell like cigarette smoke . in addition , my cox cable line needs to be replaced and the apartment management will not give permission to run a new line to my apartment . i ca n't live without tv , can you ? the price is reasonable , but , there are issues so be careful before you sign a lease .	4311
0	horrible ! if you want to walk out of your apartment and step in a pile of dog poop , this is the place for you . you might get lucky and get your car keyed as well . plenty of traffic at night to the same apartments . funny how it 's not always the same people going to them at 1am . at least you 'll never need a prescription when your neighbors already have their own pharmacy . stay away from this place . you 've been warned .	4311
1	we 've done both a mortgage & a heloc ( home equity line of credit ) through summit and overall things have worked out fairly well . the heloc was quick and seamless , we were able to work with staff mostly via phone & email and things went off without a hitch . the mortgage was a bit more annoying ; our agent just was n't as communicative and timely with responses as i would have expected . we 've also been able to pop in for notary services on occasion ( call first to make sure someone is there with the stamp ! )	4312
1	i have banked with this credit for some 30 years ; in those years i have had few complaints . i find their customer service is excellent . i was not happy with the process for online access when adopted but have learned to work with it .	4312
0	very disappointed with fraud protection . personally i will be out hundreds nearly a thousand . pulling money asap so it 's not tens of thousands missing next . unfortunate as i 've been mostly happy with using summit over the years .	4312
0	we went in to talk about a home loan . none of our questions about the home buying process were answered . we know where we 're at and we needed someone to give us hard answers because we 're not a bank , not sugar coat things . they ended up pushing credit cards on us and never giving us the information we requested . we will not be banking with them because they could not be honest with us , or provide any consistent answers on our best options .	4312
1	by far one of the absolute . eat car buying experiences i have ever had , cisco the manager was great with helping , eduardo was busy as a bee but was outstanding when he worked his way over to me and my dad , and the financing manager clark , could n't be a nicer man , will definitely come back to buy another car soon !	4313
1	still great people i have had the best help with my vehicle i would definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family they have done a wonderful job on my truck or suv but awesome job guy 's	4313
1	for me when it comes to buying a car it can be really stressful . i was so glad i found newport motors . they made the whole car buying process really stress free and fun . i do n't have great credit but they were able to work with me and help me get a car loan . i was so impressed with the staff and treatment i received . i would recommend newport motors to anyone looking for a friendly trustworthy place to get a car .	4313
1	absolutely awesome purchase experience with newport motors ..salesperson genc friendly not abrasive no bs straight to the point , the gm russ treats you like family purchased a cadillac srx from them and will recommend anyone to them . thank you for the awesome experience ...	4313
1	everyone there , the staff is awesome . especially nathan gold/gm he gave me a good price for the corvette and for the trade . he is a great listener and is patient . he will take the time to explain the cost and to work with you . i also want to mention the service manager harold moore . he will go out of his way to help you with servicing your car . i recommend this establishment .	4313
1	i bought my car on saturday and i absolutely love it ! ! it was my my first time purchasing from a dealership so i was a bit apprehensive . the entire staff was awesome and made it such a great experience . brian took care of me and made sure i understood everything and answered all my questions . susan did a great job on helping me get a good car loan and even helped lower my interest rate . i would absolutely recommend newport motors and will definitely be returning : )	4313
1	the best and most honest auto shop i have ever worked with . it is refreshing to deal with smart , friendly people who take pride in their work . i highly highly recomend this buisness . fair and right price on service.. .thanks curtis and sam , and all of the employees ... ..	4313
1	alejandra chavez was very helpful and made the process of purchasing a car easy for my wife and i . if you 're looking for a car to buy , this is the place to go .	4313
1	huge inventory selection , great deals and best customer service . highly recommend . ask for yousef he 's the sales manager there .	4313
1	im very happy with the collision center they have all been very nice to me some moron hit my truck and they have been taken care of him .hard to find good service . but my vehicle is getting the work do me good guy 's .	4313
1	so i got my car maintenance here and i have to say they really took care of me harold the service manager made sure i was taken care of and worry free . they go above and beyond for their customers here . there 's a lot of places around to get your car . but when it comes to trust and stress free i would choose newport !	4313
1	i have been to newport motors to purchase three of my vehicles as well as service and have body work done and all experiences have been great from start to finish . from my salesman jonathan to the service manager felix everything was handled in a timely manner and with professionalism ! all of the office staff was extremely friendly as well . i also do n't understand the negative reviews , my experience was excellent all three times	4313
0	went there because they say they can finance anyone . filled out an application , waited around for 2 hrs , had to leave . they said they would be in touch . i have received no phone call or e mail and its been 2 weeks . i have left a message for the salesman as well as e mailed back twice . still no callback . do n't waste your time here ! ! !	4313
0	i went into newport motors to see about getting my $ 200 fee for referring my coworker to get a car here . of course they did n't want to pay even though they tell you to refer anyone and they 'll take care of you . i work in a very busy restaurant that serves 400 people a day . i could either tell them that newport motors is an honest business or a trap . so over $ 200 you could of got some good promotion but instead i will tell every customer that comes to eat to stay away from newport . i left the dealership and immediately bought new license plate frames just to get your name off my car .	4313
0	to bad there are n't negative stars ! went in to see a car they had listed on the internet , bait & switch ! `` it just sold yesterday , do n't you want to look at something else ? '' not only that , the salesmen , including the fleet manager were foul mouthed as they talked about their night out before !	4313
0	put prices on your vehicles and maybe people will be interested . i hate waiting around for a sales.person to go look up a price and waste me time . i want to know what your asking for it so i can make a decision of its within the range i 'm looking for . stop trying to trick people and waste there time pulling them into your building . i do n't have time for that , therefore even if it was a deal i will not be purchasing from this place .	4313
0	lied to my about getting a second key fob for my vehicle . when i went to pick up reg . papers and fob they acted like i was from mars and no one knew about the second fob . apparently not much has changed in the car game . funny thing was , i was going to purchase a 2nd car there that same day . but once you lie to me , i am done with you . so for the lousy $ 100 fob you lost a good customer .	4313
0	on first take nice folks then second visit there got a total different vibe decided not to buy from here .	4313
0	very high pressure sales ! spoke with eduardo in sales and a finance rep who were both very helpful , explained i only had a limited down payment and they were willing to see what they could do . while they were working on the `` deal '' , was approached by another sales rep clark who asked us the same questions the other two had and continued to the point of being offensive ! ! ! if you find a sales rep that you like here , congrats , and do n't bother speaking with anyone you do n't need to . ridiculous how desperate they are to make these sales they will do anything , including pissing off a potential customer ! ! !	4313
0	called to get some basic information on services and the man on the phone was so rude and hung up on me . if you 're looking for a car this place is not the store for you .	4313
0	this is the worst place to buy a car . they lie about $ 49 down unless you have excellent credit but then you can go anywhere else and get zero down . they lie about the payments also . they 're based on 4.9 % interest which you 'll never get unless you have excellent credit . they have a new guy in finance and he does n't know what he 's doing . stay away from this place . they suck !	4313
0	worst car dealership ever . they are crooks , i thought i was buying a vehicle and getting financed thru them but at the end i was only leasing it according to their shady contract . do not go there . there are 100 of car dealerships in las vegas , go to a honest one .	4313
0	scammers ... they had a 07 acura tl posted on their website for $ 9488 when i called to check availability it was still available but , the price they had listed online was not the actual price . the vehicle was several thousand more . they put a disclaimer on their site stating that the price could be wrong ... , it 's the old bait and switch . i guess they truly did n't wish to sell the car .	4313
0	the only reason i 'm giving this place a bad review is because of the sales representative name alex . she has the worst attitude and just very unpleasant . i was ready to buy a car but she changed my mind and i just went somewhere else . if you go to this place , please do n't go to alex ! ! ... . even if the sell did n't work out . she was still very rude and approached the situation unpleasant , she 's not mean to be a salesperson . i very much so do n't recommend alex . go to eduardo , he 's awesome !	4313
1	this location has some interesting pieces . it 's the most recent one to open & it already has a lot of stuff ! alas i did n't find anything i liked enough to buy . but will check back next time i 'm in the area . the good thing about used , vintage & consignment shops is that they always have something new next time you come by . plus prices here are super duper cheap !	4314
1	this is the best kind exchange in the city . the staff is so kind and so accommodating ! they treat you like you are their best friend . the clothing offered is vintage , in great shape , and usually under 20 bucks . on bag sale days , you can fill a whole bag of vintage goodies for just 20 bucks !	4314
1	update : i checked out their most recent bag sale , and now they 've put everything up on hangers where it belongs , and you can actually try things on . not sure if my first review helped change this around , but either way -- thanks for bringing the fun back to the bag sales !	4314
0	this location sucks . the 2 females working when i came were so friggin rude wow.. i do n't think i 've ever been treated so rude for absolutely no reason . they also took none of my 15 items ( all designer names ) i found that odd : / will not be returning . save your time and go to another location ! !	4314
0	not the place to go if you are looking for anything of quality , or a good deal on disposable fashion trends . h & m , zara , and costa blanca for $ 20 ? you can get brand new items from these stores for less .	4314
0	unsure if i ever found anything at this location throughout many visits , i brought a full big bag of various brands ( incl free people , uo brands , zara , a & f , asos etc ) twice but they only took two ( noname i think ! ) items the first time . i think my husband found a good spring jacket at this location , needed stitching though .	4314
1	i 'll keep this short and concise . i agree with just about every other review that has come before . it is impossible to leave this store without buying something ! my go-to place for kitchen stuff !	4315
1	ordered a coffee maker online and received it the next day ! excellent turnaround . they also had a significantly better selection than anywhere else .	4315
0	if i could give no stars i would . do not buy from this store . the prices may look cheap , but after i had to pay to have my broken appliance returned and was then told it was working and i would have to now pay to have a new one shipped to me . are you kidding me ? i would n't have returned it if it was working perfectly . but it 's their word vs mine .	4315
0	be very careful of this place . the comparable prices are way off on many products . they do n't put the model numbers on their website so that direct comparisons ca n't be made . comparing the power rating of the product usually shows that they sell products at the lowest end of the range . just checked the comparable for a food mixer and it 's overstated by $ 150.00 .	4315
1	these guys are aces . not only are they starting to have wicked live shows , but they host calgary only hip hop karaoke . staff is always nice , drinks are always great , but stay away from the crown floats they run about $ 12 ( they do n't have guinness or strowbow on tap ) , only order it if someone else is buying . overall always a fun time to dance with friends and great music . hit the downstairs to hear some of calgary 's best djs . plus tubby dogs is now in the commonwealth family , try the sumo dog !	4316
1	i 've been to commonwealth a few times now and have always had an amazing experience . the whole place is beautiful , the decor has a fun vintage feel and has a lot of different areas depending on the vibe you want . the cafeteria as they call it , features great fusion style snacks and the bourbon based drink menu is absolutely to die for . i highly recommend you try the dumplings !	4316
0	i 'm too old for this kind of place . what kind of club is that ? let me spell it out : - 60 mins wait when you arrive at 11pm - poor air ventilation means that there is some serious bo odor that hangs like a curtain - people are passing out drunk , and not getting thrown out - douchebags are groping girls without consent - many sloppy make out sessions in the front bar - it 's way too packed it 's like a training ground for 20 yr old douchebags with no game . i do n't remember the dj in the downstairs bar , he was still learning his craft - but his music taste was good .	4316
0	waited in line for about 10mins on a saturday night and one of the bouncers were walking up and down the line eyeing our group the whole time . once we got to the start of the line to get in , the bouncer switches spots with the bouncer checking the ids and denies my friend entry because his drivers license photo has a different `` jaw line '' than what he looks like ... .he even showed him his health card and credit card too . overall , bouncers here are racist and i do n't recommend going .	4316
1	been here a few times and was n't so pleased with the service . the five stars are not for the store but for the cashier that was at register 8 today around 3:15 pm . his name was nicholas . what a great asset to this store . he should train a lot of the other employees on how to treat customers . he went beyond his job and carried a conversation that he started just by paying attention the the items i was purchasing . definitely manager material . thank you nicholas !	4317
1	going to give 4 stars based on several early morning visits . going early during the week has always been hassle free . employees pleasant . store clean , even the restrooms . produce fresh , which i have found at other walmarts is n't always the case . is it me though or does this store seem smaller , maybe its the layout of selection . i ca n't tell . i really do n't recommend visiting at night , the area is very sketchy .	4317
1	usually hate walmart but this one is new & cleaner than most . everyone was friendly ... like , actually smiling & helpfully , plenty of parking , carts were available . no complaints . so far so good .	4317
1	the store is still very clean . only problem was having only 2 registers open that had actual cashiers . anthony was a great and friendly cashier .	4317
1	this walmart is great . since it 's brand new & even though it 's in the good hood , it 's super clean , well kept & the cosmetics section is one of the best i 've ever seen . they have the maybelline superstay foundation & the entire color range for the brand new covergirl foundation . the only brand they do n't carry at this location is physician 's formula . this location also always had a huge selection of air freshener items in the cleaning aisle & that 's why i keep coming back . it 's smaller than a regular super walmart but still has everything you need .	4317
1	well this is actually a nice walmart no crack whores trolling the parking lot . the isles are clean and orderly .	4317
1	big store . clean . plenty of handy parking . lots of choices . great location . the pickup for online ordering is right inside the door , not way back at the back of the store , so you do n't have to walk a mile to get there . and ... .comfy chairs to sit in while they fetch your order . i love this wal-mart . there was even samples in the food section on the weekend , wow ! do n't forget your donut at an awesome price . there is something for eveyone , and if you are not in the mood to shop , eat at the in store subway . place to relax .	4317
0	trash service . a customer was saying he went to this location for 10 years and a manager said hello to him for the first time . the employees wearing a yellow vest dropped a peace of paper and started to cuss in front of a family with kids . my advice is to advoid this location .	4317

0	black friday ad says they have iphone x . my husband went in the day before and asked if they had the iphone x and the employee said they had a ton . on thanksgiving thursday we go in at 8pm and the employees all say they never got the shipment of iphone x 's . went to a different walmart and said the same thing . frustrating !	4317
0	customer service is terrible . there are 100 customers an 2 registers open ? ? ? ? ? ? customer service desk is a joke . stand in that line for 45 mins just to get assistance . prices not posted or prices do n't match what is scanned . bought chicken that was already rotten ... .gross ! i 'll stick to safeway and sprouts	4317
0	for a newer store the air conditioning is terrible ! i could not even shop , i feel bad for the employees . i was told by the employees the air conditioning is controlled by a out of state company .	4317
0	store is clean , but always children running around unsupervised while screaming and sketchy people everywhere . also insane how you can have 2 lanes wrapped around the store and still remain to only have 2 lanes open ... open more lanes . literally watch employees stand around and watch the lines .	4317
0	this is a nice new store , but ... .. this , store has lot of problems . twice i have gone to buy fat free milk and twice there was none . how can this happen . i also went to get syringes at the pharmacy a couple day after the store was opened they did no have any . i started to look around and found hundreds of racks and spaces empty . what gives ? i also saw this through the store . i hope this is not the way the store will be managed . as usual it is the responsibility of management to keep the store shelves full . i hope because this is a new store this will cgange !	4317
1	friendly great service - i drop off ebay sales here . these are prepaid usps items , which they accept . post office picks up about 9 am . boxes are sturdy , get their list of boxes . park right in front ( sometimes just off to the left or right ) . busy post office season - stop here	4318
1	love this store ! the employees are always thorough and kind when i come in . convenient location and so much quicker than the post office .	4318
1	great service ! ! the employees are always very helpful . i like having my mail box at this store . very secure and safe for package delivery .	4318
1	i drive down the road a little further to use this location . the staff here is friendly and helpful . the one closer to my house acts like i 'm a burden for them . thanks aliante ups , you are definitely worth the drive !	4318
1	had to return something from amazon . had my return slip , walked in , bought a bag , she was already printing out the label and putting it in a plastic sleeve and she attached it and i was outta there in less than 2 mins . : ) thank you ! !	4318
1	friendly staff . very helpful . super convenient . i like ups rather than using a p.o . box because it 's an actual address . i like 24 hour access as well .	4318
0	the ladies there seem to not like their jobs facing people because they are not friendly or do not like people of other ethnicity . the end !	4318
0	tried to get a price to ship over the phone . debbie says `` we do n't give prices by phone . bring it in and we 'll give you a number . '' riiiiiight . i 'm going elsewhere ... they do n't need my business . probably not yours either !	4318
0	i needed a document notarized and the lady was flustered and extremely unprofessional . she did not appear to understand what needed to be done and so directed her incompetence towards myself and family member i was with by trying to humiliate us with provoking questions . it was a strange interaction and i will not return to this location for any services when there are others choices available .	4318
0	claims to be a full service post office but it does not envelopes for media mail items . must go to walgreens and buy one and then come back . geesh , might as well go to a real post office then !	4318
0	the staff was rude , and they have over priced packing materials and shipping costs . better have your items packaged and labels printed prior to going there because you will end up over paying every time . $ 25 just to have them pack your item no matter the size , so have your item ( s ) packed and ready to go before you enter this place .	4318
0	horrible unfriendly customer service . just go somewhere else and save yourself the trouble and aggravation .	4318
1	my stay was ok to good , it seems the staff is overworked due lack of nursing staff which causes at times for your medication to be delayed in getting to you . what helped me was i always asked if the medicine i was given was what the doctor ordered and was the instructions as far as when and the amount was correct . but for most part the nurses try to do their best and it shows in their caring matter but you occasionally get one that might be having a bad day . my family was always their to check on my care so that helped in the over all care that i received so that being said i would recommend this place .	4319
1	it is a great place my mom was here after her second knee replacement and we both loved the cna and a few nurses.. i feel having pt in the same place was great no worries in having to transport to and from pt .	4319
1	i was not a patient ; i just checked this place out with a friend . i will update this review after a few days . as of this writing , i was told this location was recently bought by a management company based in nevada . the admission lady that helped my friend and i today was awesome ! her name was angela d. she gave us a complete tour and answered all of our questions . my friend was referred to this location by a friend from her church that used to work here .	4319
0	i have just learned of the grievous neglect at this facility of my great uncle . i do n't have the photos but understand photos were take of piled clothing , opened nutrition drinks sitting on the same table as used gauze and needles . the patient was immediately removed , 911 called and taken to the er where he was found to be very dehydrated , bruised , hungry and with low blood sugar . this type of care is egregious and extremely disheartening . i 'm sharing in hopes that something can be done to redirect the care provided by this facility and share our story .	4319
0	do you want substandard care ? do you want to be in pain while recovering from major surgery and not get pain medication or have an incompetent doctor tell you that any other pain is `` just stress ? '' then by all means , go here . if you want somewhere where they actually care about you , then definitely go somewhere else . this place is lousy , understaffed , and you have to wait forever for them to answer your call light . run far away from here .	4319
0	it depends on who you get to care for your loved one , but overall the care was pitiful . they left soiled clothes on the tables and chairs in the patient 's room . they lost items of clothing and put my dad in too small women 's clothes . his clothes would go to the laundry and never get returned . if you asked them for help , they 'd disappear and never come back . i would 've liked to give a better review , but if you have another choice , try somewhere else .	4319
1	dr. green is an amazing and caring dr. you can tell he genuinely cares about his patients . i have been seeing him since his residency when he moved to mesa , i followed . though i live very far from his office , i feel the drive to see him or any of his pa 's is worth it . my children are seen here as well and i ca n't recommend a better dr. , or dr.s office . all the pa 's are caring and competent and the rn 's are very helpful and listen . they do not make you feel rushed .	4320
1	what a pleasure doing business with this organization ! efficient , effective front and back end help . my appointments were easily scheduled and i was seen on time by dr. thomas who was very thorough . complete turn-around from waiting for over two hours each visit to see my other pcp ( whom i had been going to for years ) .	4320
1	this office is heaven sent ! i believe i saw heather and she was wonderful ! i believe natalie is in the billing office and she is great ! they really know what they 're doing . i had a wonderful experience with everyone there .	4320
1	i have been using this physician 's office for about a year . i prefer dr. kerry green . the 5-minute quick care for established patients has saved my life !	4320
1	dr. thomas is great . over they years they have grown and become more busy but they have still been able to maintain their high service .	4320
1	i have been a patient of dr. green for 10 years . i absolutely recommend him to anyone . he is very popular doctor so i see him when i absolutely need to otherwise i am seen by his pa 's and they are great ! ! everyone is nice , friendly , and caring in the office .	4320
0	a very money hungry office . when you go in for your yearly physical they will bill you twice . once for a physical and once for 1 medication refill . you have to go in for the physical to get a simple med refill that you 've been on for 10+ years . when questioning the check out desk on this policy she said cause it takes the doctor more work to give you a prescription refill . such lies , they just want more money . this is extremely poor customer service , i will be switching offices .	4320
0	new patient advised to get there 30 min early . was there 20 min early , completed all paperwork and waited . walked out after never seeing anyone and being at the office for over 60 minutes . if you are looking for an office that maintains a schedule this one is not for you .	4320
0	they did n't help me with anything and i went on 4 different occasions and still have the problem thanks for nothing	4320
0	i can only give this place two stars for my pa melynda , but i 'm changing offices next year . she 's great and wonderful to work with , but the desk staff is the absolute worst . they are extremely rude and condescending , even with just setting an appointment . if you 're new to the area like i was last year , do not waste your time . what everyone says about being money hungry is true . they charge for literally everything . this office needs to get new reception workers or a new attitude .	4320
0	just called for a new patient appointment and was advised it would have to be an `` annual exam '' bloodwork , etc . when i explained we had a clinic at work that we did this annually with i was advised it was required for all new patients . at that point i hung up . seems more worried about making the bucks then seeing the patient . moving on . sad thing is , i am an established patient at this practice . they just lost two patients in less than a 2 minute conversation .	4320
0	not like it used to be . i 've been going there for over 10 years . staff not like it used to be . love my doctor , but staff makes it very unpleasant .	4320
1	great place for taking kids to get haircuts . it is a bit pricey ( 21.00 per child ) , but you have to look at that as hazard pay . they have little cars for the kids to sit in and videos for them to watch while their hair is getting cut . the stylists are great - very patient and have a bunch of tricks to get the kids to cooperate . we took our 2yr old for his normal cut and our 3 yr old for her very first one - no tears from either kid . i 'd highly recommend for anyone with small kids that are nervous about first cuts . one note - they specifically request cash tips .	4321
1	my son loves it here . he usually chooses the batman dvd to watch while on the police cruiser barber chair . this is truly a trip to the barber that all kids can look forward to . there 's free arcade games as well !	4321
1	great place for the kids ( girls and boys ) . have a file for the kids and know how they cut the hair last time . easy for me ! they do a great job with keeping the kids calm and occupied during the cut . even afterwards they still want to hang out and play in the play area . always a consistent haircut and warm and friendly welcome . price is a bit high for kids otherwise would have given it 5 stars . overall it 's worth it to spend a few extra dollars .	4321
0	this is place nice and clean and has cute merchandise . i agree with some of the previous reviews that the staff is n't that friendly . at the end one of the girls requested cash tips . i had cash on me , so i left them gratuities . but if i did n't have cash , i certainly would n't have bothered going to an atm and returning to the store . at the end they did n't offer my kids any candy even though they asked for candy . my kids were very well behaved during the haircuts .	4321
0	when this place first opened , received very good haircuts and overall service for my kids . over the past year , every time i go in the stylists are different and the cuts and service not good . my last two experiences resulted in stylists spending less than 10 minutes cutting my kids hair and uneven results . no styling such as ponytail or braid like in the past . felt very rushed and will not be going back .	4321
0	today we arrived at 3:05pm to get my son his first haircut . there were n't any customers but there were three hairdressers there , all on ipads . we were told that they were expecting a lot of people at 3:15 and they 'd be booked until they closed at 4pm ( door said 5 ) . honestly , it would have taken 2 minutes to cut my 18 month old 's hair . you can almost count how many strands he has on his head . we wo n't be taking any of our four kids here again .	4321
1	was a little nervous about trying somewhere new to get my hair cut and colored . so happily surprised by jennifer 's artistry ! she did great work and i love the cut . the color is beautiful !	4322
1	i received a email for a coupon of 5 $ off any 10 $ purchase & lem me just say as soon as i saw that i ran to the store and had to grab a few goodies . i love make up , i 'm a make up fanatic . there 's only a handful of ulta stores on the west side of phoenix and i specifically love this store here in goodyear . it 's always clean & organized . plus it 's always stocked .	4322
1	my ulta hairstylist nicole is amazing . she always does a great job with my cut and color . she asks questions and listens to what i want and executes my wishes perfectly . she is also so friendly and easy to talk to . i highly recommend stylist nicole at the ulta on litchfield and mcdowell .	4322
1	to be honest this place seems pretty chill , some of these bad reviews seem like over the top . but then again , the demographics of this area consists of bougie , uptight , horribly orange women with their little chihuahua 's in their bag that expect everyone to kiss their ass as they walk . it 's like any other store to be honest . i have had some stern cashiers but i do n't blame them having to deal with these crazy women that come in . i can name horrible experiences at other stores but my thing is there 's always two sides of the story and obviously people just say what 's convenient for them .	4322
1	first ulta i 've been to , across two states , where i was approached by several staff members . i knew vaguely , what color i 'd match in an urban decay foundation , and the staff member on the floor confirmed it by testing it on me . i went in , looking like a hot mess ( no make up , other than brows ) , but was still approached and recommended product . i spent wayyy too much here , but it was definitely worth it for how attentive the staff was to guests on the sales floor . i 'll definitely be back .	4322
1	i 've been getting my hair done by angie halby for awhile and have never had a bad color or cut , i enjoy her enthusiasm and care for her customers , and makes sure her clients leave happy .	4322
1	i went to ulta randomly on friday night , where i met nicole spivey who fixed my 'chopped ' bangs that were recently cut at another salon . she 's awesome ! super friendly , good vibes and she knows what she is doing . i will be returning for her to cut my hair . thanks nicole ! : )	4322
1	some of their staff may not be that good but most of the times that i 've gone there i have gotten some help from staff that were really knowledgeable and patient with mme .	4322
1	this review is for the hair salon . i had an appointment with a different salon to have my hair curled for my birthday , but they got really behind and could n't keep my appointment . i called ulta and they were able to get me in within the hour . they truly saved the day ! vivian was very friendly and did a great job styling my hair . ulta came to the rescue and made my hair pretty for a very memorable evening ! i am so grateful !	4322
1	i have n't been to this ulta in a long time . i used to only come here occasionally because i found it hard to get help and preferred ordering online . i am happy to say that when i went in last weekend everyone was very welcoming . i was immediately asked if i needed help finding anything . i was looking for a specific type of makeup and was led to miguel , who was so nice and helpful . he helped me choose the perfect shade of foundation that looks totally natural on my skin . i appreciated the help and will be back .	4322
1	i was lucky enough to attend the urban decay event this past saturday at my local ulta in goodyear az . it was amazing ! ! ! learned a ton of techniques . made new friends and of course tried out products i have been wondering about . staff went out of their so we could try on multiple colors of the new lipstick launch and even provided breakfast . best event ever ! ! ! ! yeah goodyear ulta store ! ! ! ! you filks at ulta rocked it as always . special about out to michelle , the prestige make-up manager . she hires the best educated employees and her department is the best ! !	4322
1	i 've been getting facials with kayla over the last few weeks and she is amazing ! she is very professional and always personalized the treatment for how my skin is acting that week . plus she always gives free samples ! today i also got a last minute haircut and the receptionist rose was so pleasant and was able to fit me in with stella right then so i did n't have to come back later . stella was so sweet and kept me laughing the whole time . i highly recommend this staff and ca n't wait to go back in a few weeks for my next appointment !	4322
1	i do n't get all the negative reviews , i love shopping here and i also get my hair done here on a regular basis . i am always happy with the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the products . i could easily spend a whole day ( and paycheck ) and this store . i recently took the urban decay master class they offered , i was impressed there was no charge for this class and it was very attentive , they also were n't pushy on products you did n't feel you needed . i actually want to go back now and get some things i passed up on , love this store !	4322
1	25 percent off all highlights 6/6/14 - 7/6/14 come and ask for me ! this is a great deal ! the store is going through a remodel , it is very exciting . we are open through it ! the grand reopening is in october !	4322
1	a great and friendly place to get your hair done . the gentleman that did my hair was exceptional and he was super friendly while my sister and my cousin kept on rushing up towards me . bought makeup that day too and the ladies who helped me were okay but i repeatedly had to rush around the store in order for someone to help me .	4322
1	i visit ulta every chance i get . i know the staff changes a lot . also , customer service is different for every client , however , since i 'm a regular , i 've been able to find nice staff who knows me . they are friendly and attentive . ca n't speak for everyone but the ones who help me always are . i realized i had n't written a review . i usually do n't for places i frequent but i always find what i need . today i got a replacement for my stila lip plus a few other things . there 's always something i need . lol	4322
1	i had the most amazing cut and color today done by nicole ! ! ! it turned out exactly how i wanted it . she took the time to make it perfect and do the best for my hair . she was professional and fun to talk to . overall a great experience , i know i will be back !	4322
1	i came in a few days before christmas to get my hair done by christian le . he did a beautiful job . i wish that i had a before picture to post to show you what a major difference was done to my hair . i came in with many different colors and dark spots in my hair and christian was able to correct it . thank you so much !	4322
1	i absolutely love ulta beauty and their staff . everone is so nice when i walk in . definitely want to give a shout out to stylist angie . she is the best stylist i have ever had . she is so knowledgeable about the products she uses and my hair comes out perfect every single time . love ulta !	4322
1	i spoke to a wonderful lady named june who was such a help ! she has a great attitude and answered all my questions . i ended up purchasing a blue-light technology toothbrush that was exactly what i needed for long-term teeth-whitening and my dentist told me last week that my gum problem is now tremendously better ! he could n't believe it . anyhow , june was great and all the staff helped me get the things i wanted ! i purchased a face moisturizer that is making my makeup even look better ! plus , my face does n't feel so rigid . thank you to a great team !	4322
0	hair product shopping good but pricey and sales are not that great - hair styling - not ever again .	4322
0	i had my hair cut done by angie and she did an awful job , i mean awful i had 11 inches taken off at first it looked good and i did not notice seeing as my hair is naturally curly then following day when i straightened my hair it was completely uneven ! i have no idea how a `` professional '' can cut hair so uneven i was extremely disappointed especially since i am very careful who touches my hair .	4322
0	i buy quality expensive products here , but the way they treat their loyal customers shocking !	4322
0	i 've visited this store a handful of times and every single time i am disappointed ! this is the last time i will ever visit this store . the entire staff stands around and gossips with each other rather than greet and assist . i walked the entire store looking for a particular item and watched 3 different people stand around and watch me . starting to compare this store to walmart in its customer service . do yourself a favor and head to sephora where the ladies/men know what customer service is !	4322
0	i have been in this store a handful of times and while the giant selection of products was outstanding , that staff was not . everytime i had a question about a product , i either couldnt find a sales associate or they were all too busy gossiping with each other to mind the customers . i once wandered around the perfume aisles for a good 15 minutes before anyone even took notice . i dread going there unless i absolutely cant find a certain product elsewhere . not recommended unless you feel like being ignored .	4322
0	lord help me . every single employee i encountered in this store was rude . they need to clean house in this ulta . do n't even get me started on corine , the cashier . her attitude absolutely disgusted me .	4322
0	this ulta is hands-down terrible . customer service is non-existent compared to other stores like target . do n't plan on using a coupon ( the fine print rules out just about everything you 'd want to buy with it ) or doing and exchange or return ( better have a receipt and abide by their super strict return policies ! ) . after too many bad experiences here i 'll now be using their testers to find my makeup colors then buying them on amazon !	4322
0	every time i visit this location , i get zero help , rude employees . i needed assistance at the brow bar , nothing . several woman standing around gossiping & playing music . they are bothered if you need assistance or an opinion . obviously no commission . if you like friendly & helpful service definitely visit another location . these people do not care about their customers spending my money where it 's appreciated !	4322
0	worst ulta i have ever been in to . the help on the floor was unfriendly and not helpful . i normally go to the surprise and arrowhead locations , and i would never come back to this one . maybe i landed on a bad day ? also , they do not let you combine your club points like the other stores . so it was a completely wasted trip .	4322
0	terrible customer service & sales staff ! i 'm a sales manager , if i ran this location many of the employees there would be out of a job due to replacement . make a change ulta ! ! !	4322

0	i went in to buy some foundation and few other things . there was not one single person that was friendly or truly helpful . in fact they had a terrible attitude and were very rude . i asked for their ad and the girl was so rude about it . i 've been here twice and not once did i feel welcomed . the brush sections was a disaster i could n't find what i was looking for . i use to shop at the camelback location and it 's completely a different store i will take my business back to them . this store is disappointing .	4322
0	most times you can find any type of product here . the last two times i have come to this store they have been out of several products i needed . i have never had any of the employees be helpful or nice . they are always off gossiping together and when you actually go to ask them a question they walk in the opposite direction . whatever you do be very wary of getting a cut or color . they have messed up several friends hair .	4322
0	i went in to ulta for specific things.. this locaction never has anything stocked , so i knew i would n't get all of the things i needed but seriously none of the items i needed were there . none ! i 'm very disappointed in this .	4322
0	i spend a decent amount of money at ulta and when i come in they treat me like i 'm a thief because i want to try the makeup and fragrances ? ! they followed me around the store so many times . i have lots of receipts and bank account transactions proving how much i spend . i rarely come in to this location anymore unless i really need a product . good job !	4322
0	i have been a customer of ulta for years , i did not realize how over priced they are , recently i bought a clairol spin brush for $ 59.99 at ulta , two day later i was shopping at walmart and noticed it was $ 15.00 cheaper i ca n't believe the price difference . i can see maybe $ 5.00 but $ 15.00 is a lot of money . i wrote to ulta and basically they said too bad so sad and they did n't seem to care . they did however thank me for being such a loyal customer , well needless to say that is over . not only are they overprice but they do n't seem to care	4322
0	very dry and unfriendly customer service . bossy and uninterested as though they are doing you a favor . besides having scarce items in stock , their checkout girls both had attitudes and also towards a customer who had questions . i felt bad for her and to top it off they kept giving her the mean girl stare down as she walked off ! they did not even have small bags to place my purchase and errors in cashing having to call in the manager . what a waste ! avoid this location . cosmetics shopping should be a pleasurable experience especially when you 're paying those prices should it not ?	4322
0	not very welcoming , no one is ever around to help ! it 's a good thing that i know what i want when i 'm there . but when i want to ask a question about a product , no one is available to help .	4322
0	seriously , i am not sure why i am surprised that nothing has changed at this store . they have hands down the most unfriendliest clerks there . even the manger was borderline rude . hello , we are coming in to buy beauty products and want to feel great ! i will not come back again , i will wait and go to the arrowhead location . on a side note , there was one lady who smiled and greeted me and she was at the prestige make up side , i wish i got her name , but she was a really attractive black woman . too bad she is stuck in a fish bowl of grouchy women .	4322
0	i was looking for a clear mascara , i was walking in circles trying to find someone to help me ... when i got tired of looking i had to walk all the way to the back of the store looking for an associate who just pointed the isle where i supposed to find it . really ? i just walked out without buying anything . horrible customer service !	4322
1	as always the 6 month checkup went very well . brian was on time , very knowledgeable and answered all questions with patience with both me and my husband . highly recommend .	4323
1	now that is off season for summer take advantage of the 49.00 tune up . just had mine done today . we also just purchased a condo for my mom and the inspector from our realtor 's referral was not allowed on the roof as an inspector to check the unit , so we hired dukes of air and it needed a $ 300 repair that the seller will have to fix .	4323
1	manny , luis , freddy and beto arrived on time and were very professional . they completed the replacement of my new ac system ahead of schedule and left the area clean . manny was able is answer any questions i had and communicated well . i would highly recommended them .	4323
1	a service company does n't get any better than dukes of air . we came home on a sunday afternoon to find our up-stairs a/c off and the temperature climbing . i called dukes at 1pm , they had someone at our house at 2:15 and the the a/c was back up and running within an hour . not only was the service done quickly , but they walked us through every step of the process - making sure we understood what was wrong with the system and what was normal wear on a 15 year old system . excellent local company .	4323
0	our air conditioning suddenly went out last week . naturally are home got really hot really fast . we called them and left messages . it is now a week later and have never yet received a return phone call . we went with another company and had a service tech on scene in about nine hours . if you ca n't take the time to land my business , when will you find the time to keep my business ? no thanks .	4323
0	technicians may be great , but i just tried to schedule a repair or replacement of a through the wall a/c unit and the woman who answered the phone was extremely confused ... `` through the wall ? is it portable ? '' no , i told her , it 's actually installed in the wall of the home . `` no , we do n't service portable units . '' thanks for listening .	4323
0	horrible service ! they deleted my initial review ... makes me wonder how legit their five star smearing really is . stay away from this company unless you want to over pay and deal with vulgar disgusting service people showing up at your house . quoted me twice the amount another company did . $ 1200 for a $ 40 part , sorry company ! stay away	4323
0	after waiting 7 week 's for an appointment their technician called 20 minutes late to tell me he was just then leaving . that is not 5 star performance : all those reviews must be fake .	4323
1	i give this company 5 stars . from the initial phone call i made , to the final walk thru . every bit of their service was professional . any time i had a concern or questions , i called and was given answers and explanations . i will use design builders for any construction work i need in the future . thank you again to the design builders team .	4324
1	excellent customer service , professional and friendly . i always recommend my clients , family and friends use this company . there 's is no job too big or too small for them to handle . christina always does a great job getting anyone i refer taken care of in a timely and professional manner . thank you for all your services !	4324
1	design builders is a great company ! ! i love their cusomer service and hands in way of doing things ! ! definitely the company to use when looking for a gc ! ! nick and randy have been thorough in their work and i appreciate their work ethic ! !	4324
0	horrible . took pictures of my house and never followed up . i had to contact several times and then ask to shred the photos .	4324
0	design builders recently installed mailboxes at adagio a condo community in las vegas . there are close to 300 residences and no one has been able to get mail for over 1 month . everyone must go to the post office . they deserve zero stars if possible . if you are an hoa do not use this company as they are totally incompetent .	4324
0	i contacted this company about some ti 's i needed done . i find it interesting that after calling and speaking with a receptionist who took down all of my information , nobody ever called me back . she assured me i would be getting a phone call from their designer/builder that day . it 's been over two weeks ! ! ! not good customer service at all .	4324
1	we got a groupon to go to boss archery someitme last year and it was a blast ! the instructor was funny and very knowledgeable and helpful . and it was a great date night . i think there were two other couples there and a couple of younger boys , but everyone loved it . the boyfriend and i made a deal that for every balloon hit , the other person would have to give 5 minutes of massage time . made date night even more fun and the competition was great . i won . : - ) we 're actually going back tomorrow and i ca n't wait to whoop his butt one more time ! haha hello hour-long massage !	4325
1	very friendly staff and they absolutely know what they are talking about . we love going here to practice shooting .	4325
0	i tried to book a birthday party there and was met with rudeness and hostility once i asked if i could use the groupon i purchased . they refused to apply it for the party or any purchases . when i asked why i was told it was because groupon received most of the money i paid do they would n't accept it . they treated me like i was trying to cheat them by using a groupon promotional they provided . i wo n't go there .	4325
0	some of the rudest people i have ever met since moving to the south . i see why the place was empty . was going to buy my wife a bow today but am happy they showed true colors and my money will not go to them .	4325
1	a residential track ( which , i 'm not a big fan of ) , but the layout here is good . the staff is very professional . i did n't care for the ill equipped pro shop or the whiffle ball driving range .	4326
1	i have played starfire numerous times and always have a great time . today i was suffering with allergies but wanted to play nonetheless . this review is less about the course and more about the staff especially the cart girl `` christy '' when she came around to my cart i must have looked like i was ready to die . from asking what medicine i was taking to making sure i was hydrated , her concern for my well being was sincere . of course i was flirting with her , that 's what old guys do and i 'm sure i reminded her of her grandfather , but she was extremely kind . my experience today at starfire was 5*****	4326
1	driving range and putting green were closed for overseeding so we could n't get any practice in ... yeah , that 's the reason for my high score . the other reason was the incredible amount of sand and water on the course . course management is key here as opposed to grip-it-and-rip-it golf . overall , it was a great course that i 'd come back to play .	4326
1	the best part of starfire ( aside from the good golf , is the fantastic beverage cart person , christy . her wonderful customer service is unsurpassed .	4326
1	we did easter brunch here this year and it was awesome ! brought the entire family and it was great for all ages . lots of selection , fast and friendly service ( molly is the best ) ! definitely a consideration for mother 's day this year as well .	4326
1	usually well priced considering it 's scottsdale . well kept greens and fairways . even though there are houses and condos around it still feels somewhat secluded . what puts this place over the top is the customer service . played during phoenix open weekend when rates are obviously jacked up and told the pro shop we would n't be able to finish 18 and they happily gave me a rain check .	4326
1	what a nice place to sit outside and enjoy a chicken avocado sandwhich . the food is always good and the gold course view is kilker . service is typically good , but the pace of the restaurant is a little slower , so do n't be in a hurry to eat . if you can tolerate the retired republican coversations going on around you then it 's a 5star ... i can barely keep my mouth shut at times , so it 's a 4 .	4326
1	this is a tight golf course if ive ever played one . put it in the books that you will probably hit a house . they are just a few yards off the fairway . the greens werent bad . nit the best but they rolled fairly true . the greens were pretty hard so they got quite a roll . there werent alot of sandtraps which was nice , good sized faireays as well . the best part about tbis place is the happy hour specials . they have these fries that are out of this world , beer prices were very fair . really e joyed this course	4326
1	good course . went during the summer and it was pretty well maintained . they had cold water every couple of holes . it was fast playing and the staff was nice . would play again .	4326
1	we have been coming to starfire for a while now , the new chef in the restaurant has really turned this place around . great quality food , good prices ! the staff is always friendly and the course is amazing !	4326
1	great happy hour . great food . had wings and the brussel sprouts . very tasty and a great deal . sat on the patio and enjoyed my meal with great weather !	4326
0	my t-time was at 1130 , after finishing the front in 3 hours i 'd had enough . waited 15 min . @ each hole , and the ranger could care less . the woman driving the beverage cart was rude and impatient . when i went to leave , there was no attempt by any of the staff to see why i was leaving after 9 . just a poor experience and will not be returning .	4326
0	we paid the `` twilight rate '' of $ 29 but after 4 holes in two hours , the pro shop said we should be able to play 9 . really ? i 'll be supporting a different course come may thru sept .	4326
0	the course itself is alright . you are playing between houses the whole time . the old guy who is the `` ranger '' is somewhat patronizing , but then again a lot of golf rangers are . there is no driving range to warm up and the first whole is a par 5 , it can throw you off . there building a driving range though , it 's just not finished . overall , there are to many other courses that will give you more bang for the buck .	4326
0	the three different nines are fun to play , but do n't confuse this with a country club . no real range to warm at and even the foam ball play area and putting green are n't in operation . oh and btw your tee time has been pushed back because the men 's club had trouble teeing it up earlier . too many other options in the valley to play . why come here ? doubtful i will again .	4326
0	played today . it was the most unpleasant experience i think i have had on a golf course in a long time . tee time was noon and there were grounds crew on at least 70 % of the holes while we were playing . right in the fairways with no interest in getting out of our way . such a loud course , between the mowers and the roads it felt like we were golfing on the 101 . skip it and find another course .	4326
0	this course is what i would call a well manicured back yard ! if you enjoy playing golf off someone 's patio and paying over $ 50 to do so , then by all means set a tee time ! otherwise book one of the million other pristine courses .	4326
0	waiting in line for 5 minutes because the guys in front of me were messing around and taking an exceptionally long time to pay . when i got up , the cashier said that he already gave my tee time away . i pointed out that it was 8:43 and we were set for 8:41 and gestured to the goofballs in front of me as the cause for being tardy . did n't care . i complained to the starter . the starter said too bad . you can go to any of the other 100 courses and play without jerks , a maybe even a driving range . i 'm never going back .	4326
0	absolutely awful ! ! ! hour and half to play 4 holes is bad enough but when i went to talk to the manager just to inform him , did n't even care about getting a refund , and he called me a liar . that guy deserves to be fired . do n't go there until they finish reseeding and the manager is fired .	4326
0	wow ... the only reason they are getting 1 star is because i ca n't give them zero and comment ... if you have an opportunity to do this versus golf n stuff , choose the later ... they sacrificed gardening maintenance for a marshal at every hole who will try and check your belongings to see if you snuck beer in.. also , they will send cart laddies to try and rush you along when you are held up by everyone else . if you 're looking for a leisurely golf game and to have a good time , i recommend choosing another course .	4326
0	horrible management 30 minute waits on each hole because they can not hire a starter who can do a mediocre job of managing a 27 hole course .	4326
0	terrible experience with rude staff . the marshall was on our asses every other hole . the wait was atrocious and we were stuck behind people all day . we were yelled at to hurry up , even though there was literally no where for us to go . crotchety old retirees with nothing better to do than hover over us .	4326
1	i have been coming to see alicia for almost 2 years and have always been very happy with her work . alicia is fast , meticulous , and very talented with nail art and is able to do any design i have requested . i usually visit christina for my pedicures and i love every minute ! christina has great eye for detail and is always concerned with her clients ' comfort . i have visited other technicians at embellish nail salon and have never had a negative experience .	4327
1	had a glitter gel manicure almost 4 weeks ago and still getting compliments on my nails ! ... ..this place is amazing and i have angelina to thank for that ... ..she is so meticulous and does everything with perfection ... .i do n't live in the area but if i did , i would be a regular for sure	4327
1	i 've been going to embellish since may and i 've never been disappointed . john is awesome and i am always complemented on my nails anywhere i go . i would send and recommend this salon to anyone ! i recently moved about an hour away and still make the trip out there . ca n't beat the quality and service .	4327
1	great job ! i had a bad nail job at a different salon but embellish fixed me all up and i 'm very happy with the job they did .	4327
1	the salon was really clean and they had plenty of staff working to take care of everyone . it was decently crowded - about 8 people there on a friday ( late morning ) . it seems like it might be hit-or-miss with the staff members though . i did the upgraded $ 25 pedicure and was a little disappointed with the pumice and massage portions of the pedicure . she just really was n't into it ... definitely half-assing it . seemed like other employees were more committed to their job . maybe she was just having a bad day ? lots of nail polish colors - more than most other salons in the area	4327
1	i love that the gel polish lasts pretty long on my nails before coming off , at least 2-3 weeks . it 's definitely my new go to nail salon , even though i have to drive 20 min to get here . my only complaint is that it 's always sooo warm inside the salon ! turn up the a/c please !	4327
1	i ca n't say enough good about christina and the entire salon . i have such a difficult problem with ingrown toe nails . since going to this salon and seeing christina ... i 'm cured . she and the entire staff are accommodating , kind , and make a mani-pedi a luxurious experience .	4327
1	new owner and fantastic new service . trang is a magician , i 've never experienced a pedicure close to hers and one that lasts up to 4 weeks . she has my eyebrows looking great too i 'm very pleased . i now look forward to my salon time , thank you for all your hard work !	4327
1	had been here a few times for pedicures . but i recently started coming here for my nails . they are amazing ! they have done any style i have wanted . they can accommodate any schedule and are so friendly ! their prices are crazy reasonable ! and since going here for the last 6 weeks , i have n't had one broken nail ! love them ! ! ! !	4327
1	i brought my sister here for a fun girls day and embellish did not let us down ! i have heard great reviews from many friends and they exceeded my expectations . it was a very clean salon and fairly priced . both of our nail techs engaged in conversation and made sure we liked what we received . plus they are fantastic at nail art , as the photo shows , my sister got hello kitty . this is my new go-to salon !	4327
1	i got to say this is a really good nail salon . their prices are decent but let me tell you it is worth your money . they give you a nice mud mask for your legs and feet ! it leaves a mint feeling that will wake you up . also no other nail salon does a good callus remover they actually remove your calluses ! it has been more than a week and my calluses are still gone ! :0 ! they also make sure to file your gel nails so it wo n't look so thick which i prefer . hands down awesomeness !	4327
0	this has been my nail salon for a couple years and i 've always been happy with the service . since the new ownership/management the quality and care is not the same . the last two pedicures i received , nail polish was chipping in two days , that 's never happened to me anywhere .	4327
0	i had a gel pedicure done . several days later , a toe loses its gel . i went back to have this repaired . i was asked to find the color that had been used . i tried . i was told it was not the correct color several times , no one offering to assist me . finally , a tech fixes the nail , letting me know ow it does n't match . it only took an hour of my time . ugh . two days later , another nails gel comes off . you know i 'm not going to bother to go back . ever .	4327
0	just asking where angie and alisha went ... thanks ...	4327
0	wo n't ever go back ! ! very rude . i spent $ 28 on a pedicure to have half of my toe polish chip today . i went in and asked for someone to polish them again . i had to wait 15 minutes even though nail technicians were standing around . no one was friendly , apologized or anything ! ! ! ! so many nail parlors in gilbert , i wo n't ever spend a dime in here again -- oh and maybe smile at your customers sometimes or even ask them things instead of just point !	4327
0	i sat and waited for 25 minutes before someone asked when i arrived . and not in a polite way , i might add . i had some extra time between appointments and thought i could get some self-care in , but instead i was ignored and wasted my time . thumbs down to this place . i will never return all tell everyone about the lack of customer service . if i could give zero stars , i would .	4327
0	i have been going here for 2 years now . i drive a long way to come here too . the owner who has been doing my acrylics , has recently become rushed , rough and totally f 'd up my nails . she made them too short . used the wrong fill color . they are all uneven and one side of some nails are accualy higher . they even have imdicoloration spots and bubbles ! this has happened the past few times and when i ask her to fix it , it is still the same . then they raise the price ! the whole job is totally sloppy . i 'm done with this place .	4327
0	been going here for some time with a friend who has been going forever . the last three times we went the gel manicure began pealing within 10 days . i could get away with going almost 4 weeks before . they have obviously `` watered down '' the product they use or gone to a sub standard product . when i mentioned this on the second pealing i was rudely told that they should n't last more than 2 weeks . we are trying a new salon today called nails of the world , watch for a review .	4327
0	very very rude people ! i will never go back ! ! they get upset if you kindly tell them they made a mistake .	4327
0	i went there for the first time about a week ago . a few days after getting a pedicure my big toe became infected . very disappointing because i was very impressed with the pedicure . i also had a full set put on which i was not impressed with at all . i had french tips painted on and they look very sloppy . unfortunately i will not be returning .	4327
0	i 'm not too happy with my experience here . got a fill yesterday and it 's a lot different color than what i originally had on my nails , and it 's already starting to chip around the cuticle because he put the fill on so thin . the little cup that he had the tools stored in was filthy with other nail filings . did n't seem very sanitary .	4327
0	i 've been coming here for over a year and drive all the way out here every 3 weeks for a fill and have for almost 6 months now . lately the service has been rushed , the owner has been incredibly rude and i 've had it . i 'm taking my money and business somewhere else . last time she was so annoyed she was complaining out loud to me , smudged my nail and did n't bother to fix it and the quality was just , overall , subpar . nail salons are a dime a dozen , perhaps you should check your attitude and treatment of loyal customers .	4327
1	the turnaround time is a little bit high ( ~25 days in my case ) and the customer service response can take a few business days , however , for the price i paid the quality of product i received was fantastic . the image is crisp , the colors are accurate , and the build seems sturdy . i would be hesitant to order this in a rush but i look forward to finding another reason to order something from here . if your order seems to be taking a long time try to get in touch with them via e-mail and they should get back to you .	4328
1	ok , despite all of the negative reviews i actually got my order and it was on time . for the price the the quality was not bad either . mind you my order was small ( two pieces ) but still i got it a few days before the estimated date . my only issue was the customer service . after seeing the negative reviews i decided to give them a call and check on my order . a woman answered and told me that they were no accepting calls , nice . i would have given them five stars if their customer service was better . p.s . i hope others get their orders ~ s ~	4328
1	i was a little bit scared after i placed a patch order when seeing all the negative comments , but the result and service came out just fine . the normal turn around time is 7-15 , they shipped my product 13 days , and i got it 2 days later . the product came out exactly the same as i expected . i ordered one patch only , so it took them a lot faster to process my order . this is the only store i found so far you can order only one patch per order .	4328
1	i love my new patch ! i was n't expecting it to be screen printed , though i am guilty of not reading the item description 's fine print . also , the patch was a bargain and received in a very timely fashion . all in all , i am very satisfied with my order . thank you !	4328
0	horrible service . i ordered two t-shirts from them online on may 31 , it 's now june 25th , no shirts yet . i emailed them twice and got vague semi rude responses . finally got a tracking number yesterday , says it has n't even left the facility yet . oh and i payed extra for express shipping , i do n't know why . this has been a horrible experience . i 'm a member of a nationwide militia and know a ton of people who shop here for tactical clothing here . i 'll have to spread the word .	4328
0	they shipped my patches in well enough time . but the patch colors were far off from what i ordered . they had the nerve to send me pictures of the patches next to picture i ordered from and actually say `` they 're close enough '' . nope . these are garbage . $ 75.00 down the drain . i asked several other questions in my email correspondence and they were all ignored . and the last email they actually ended it with `` please let me know if you have any further questions '' ... find a local shop and give them your business . embroidered patches look way better than these anyway ...	4328
0	worse service ever . they are only out to get your money . patches look awful . poor quality . not as described . refused to help fix the situation , they only want your money .	4328
0	you guys took over a month to process and deliver my small order of 3 patches ... and you got it wrong ... wow ... you guys are incompetent..	4328
1	dr. lieber has been my primary doctor for the last four years . i am so thankful i found him . he listens , takes me back within minutes of my apt time and if there is blood work that needs to be done it can be done in the office .	4329
1	dr. lieber has been my primary physician for the last three years . the reason i chose this man was his specialty in internal medicine since he would be much more attuned in the going on 's of my body . his hours are not bad from 7:30am until 4p , i think m-f . i like that blood work can be done at his office as well as how he interacts with his patients . he provides advice and suggestions and ensures that you ask questions , and when you do he provides not a brief broad answer but rather he looks into it . like his staff as well . so for a primary physician i fully recommend him !	4329
0	came to him looking for a new pcp , looking elsewhere after one visit . while professional he lacked updated information regarding hypothyroidism and rather condescendingly corrected me on a point that he was wrong on . he also had a general attitude of `` get whatever stupid comment you have to get out done with so i can write you a prescription and get out of here '' . maybe i caught him on a bad day but it was bad enough not to give him a second chance . would give him less than two stars but overall the visit was quick and efficient but seriously lacked attention that is commonly found at other practices .	4329
0	if you want to be seen by a dr. who looks at his laptop more than he looks at you or spend time with you or even listen to you , this is the one to go to !	4329
1	extremely friendly and helpful staff . a rare find in las vegas . kudos to however hired them !	4330
1	the only place to purchase pool and spa supplies in las vegas ! friendly staff and great selections ! thanks guys !	4330
1	i have found this location to be very helpful . unlike some stores they seem to greet me and are in good spirits . i recently visited for a part they did n't have available and recommended another local source . i recommend this branch from my recent experiences .	4330
1	this place is great and conveniently located in the southwest . i was in a jam and had a broken filter on my pool . they had the right part and many other fun pool supplies . staff is very friendly and they 're open on saturday 's too . they have all pool supplies available if you 're a pool owner : nets , chlorine , toys , etc . great service and great prices .	4330
0	i needed a valve assembly but their price was $ 30 higher than amazon , which they do n't price match . their prices for chlorine and pool salt were higher than costco/home depot . friendly staff though . i 'd rather wait an extra day for amazon shipping than buy from a company that is n't price competitive .	4330
0	was there for 20 minutes with only one customer ahead of me . they only had one employee on duty and he never acknowledge people walking in . stay on phone the entire time i was there . he could of least ask what was needed while on hold but never looked up . had previously had fairly good service . i would recommend one of the other stores in future that has a bigger staff	4330
0	holy hell has this place gone to shit . this chick working in here literally just cranked out the nastiest wet fart i 've ever heard while the dude was trying to give me advice on a water test . good god i 'll take my money to the eastern nps , at least al does n't fart 5 feet from you . **updated 7/7/2017**	4330
0	they are price gougers ! they charge $ 25+ more for parts than their online site , which they do n't honor to match . that is what nps ( former store name ) did and changing the store name to `` leslie 's swimming pool supplies '' , does n't change their attitude with the way they run their business . all they want is your money ! the more they sell to you ( even if you do n't need it ) , the more money they can amke from you .	4330
1	wonderful staff . knowledgeable they explain everything step by step . love the facy that there pretty much on time for a doctors office .	4331
1	awesome staff and dr yee ! helped me out with an urgent eye concern ! i recommend this place highly ! !	4331
1	i only have a little experience here and that 's based in a visit with a friend . i had a couple questions and she was very helpful . she also was exceptionally helpful to my friend buying glasses . what i loved about this place is that they have a large selection of glasses paid by medicaid . i hope everyone who needs medicaid glasses can read this review and find their way here .	4331
1	dr westfield and his team went out of their way to ensure my satisfaction . now i have the perfect vision i hoped for .	4331
1	i had excepting service @ westfield eye center ! everyone so helpful and 2 top my experience w/my . visit , i was seem by dr. westfield . he is a very nice doctor ! thank you westfield eye cntr for a+ customer service !	4331
1	everyone here has been terrific . very professional and kind . we will always come back . thanks westfield .	4331
1	the staff and surgeons are knowledgeable and courteous . the surgery counselor was courteous and thoroughly explained the paperwork and procedures that occur during the process and completion of surgery . i am writing this review to assure anyone considering a lasik procedure , they will be more than pleased with their overall experience .	4331
1	this is the best place to get your eyes checked the staff is so knowledgeable and friendly and dr westfield is the absolute best eye doctor in las vegas in my opinion ...	4331
0	i had spent a year going back and forth with no resolution to my swollen optical nerve . dr houchin just requests more tests and when you go to appointments , he does n't have the results . also , when it came time for an eye test , he gave me a very strong prescription and when i went back to get it corrected , they wanted to charge me for it . not going there again .	4331
0	i had an appt for cataract surgery and my daughter already had purchased the plane tickets when , out of the blue , dr westfield announced he was changing his days of doing surgery . that really sucked ! never was even notified of this change and they lied and said they tried to reach me , found out when i got my preoperative exam . when i finally got the surgery , the lens was placed in the wrong spot and i now have ghost images in that eye that dr westfield says it would be dangerous to try to fix . stay away !	4331
0	the best way to describe this place is `` ghetto '' . the front office staff is `` ghetto '' all the way , the waiting room is filthy , the place is something you would expect in tijuana . the only difference would be that the staff in tijuana would be more polite and caring . enough is enough . demand better . this is at the eastern location . i assume the others are just the same .	4331
0	i am receiving invoices when i paid in full on my visit ! ! ! so annoying ... ... and the prescription is the worst i have ever had . they tried fixing it and still not right ! dont go there ! ! !	4331
0	the very worst las vegas has to offer ! ! ! the doctors are horrible . they will allow a patient to lose their sight before they will retire from the field . do n't risk your ability to see ! would never again take my parents to this group for cataract consultation . for 10yrs . one dr kept stating my mother 's cataract was not ready . it did n't make sense so i took both parents too two other places and both said her cataract was huge and needed to be removed as soon as possible .	4331
0	since they have moved there office to south jones they have called me 2 times and rescheduled my appointment , i finally get to my appointment and sign in and i do n't get checked in for over 20 min . that 's ridiculous there are people canceling their appointments due to the fact that the office is behind , their telling people they are an hour and a half behind and it 's only 9:40am , how the heck does that happen	4331
0	worst place ever . diagnosed my husband with glaucoma.. for years doing drops . went to another place where he was told he did n't have glaucoma . doctor yee should go back to school .	4331
0	so i had a va appt that was scheduled for me to go here . this place is like a cattle herding station , some of the staff members are nice , most are not . if you are looking for a place without a caring and friendly service minded staff , this is it !	4331
1	phenomenal store and ownership ! friendly , helpful , and great customer service ... especially the owner who is often working there .	4332
1	the first time in my life that packaging and sending packages has been completely hassle free . great customer service , hardly ever a line , and notary on site . they make it all easy !	4332
1	notary fee schedule compliance ( a.r.s . §§ 41-316 ) : a notary can charge no more than $ 2 per signature . notary fees are set in rule ( a.a.c . r2-12-1102 ) . see the notary rules starting on page 47 . this is what it says ... i 'll get clarification from arizona secretary of state if it is per notary signature or if it is per customer signature . i 'll update my review after i hear back from them . thanks !	4332
1	i 've been a customer for a few years . the service is unmatched . they will earn your business every visit !	4332
0	seems like new management is making this the next ups closed . last 3 visits have been fairly consistently disappointing ; long wait , rude short correspondence , twice overcharged for no reason-they must be hurting for money . our romance ( 10 years ) is over ! really sad your appreciation for your old clients does not mean anything to you any more , so glad there are plenty of options out here . taking all my references with me !	4332
0	although the location and hours may be convenient as opposed to the post office , their prices are so so so much higher than the post office for priority mail . i would rather make the trip the 24 hr self serve machine on valvista than over pay . i gave two stars because the notary service was quick and fair priced	4332
0	absolutely hopeless . why anybody uses this company i do not know . they have `` mislaid '' 31 large boxes but whoever you deal with in ups just passes on another number for you to chase . they get one star because i can not post this with any less .	4332
0	horrible service i was very disappoint in this store . i came in with a amazon return . they had me bag it up in a 5 $ bag . and then lied to me horrible horrible will never return to this ups store	4332
1	i was lucky to have such a wonderful tech do additional imaging following my first mammogram . lexy , the ultrasound tech , was so informative and pleasant . she explained the exam completely and answered all my questions . she had a very peaceful bedside manner . thank you lexy !	4333
1	today i had a mammogram at the ahwatukee simonmed imaging office . laura was so kind and professional . the exam was less painful than normal , and she was quick to finish . i would highly recommend anyone needing a mammogram to request laura .	4333
1	i had such a great experience at this location , it was worth the drive . i arrived fifteen minutes prior to my appointment time , and by the time i filled out my paperwork , they already called me back . the mammography tech was very professional as was the ultrasound tech . i got my results the same day , which is really great when you are biting your nails waiting for news whether it be good or bad . i really appreciated their professionalism , as they were able to have compassion for me as a patient while giving me the best care possible . for any future imaging , i will choose this location anytime i possibly can .	4333
1	i had my mammogram done today , laura was my tech . laura was efficient and very pleasant to talk to . i usually am nervous having this exam done but laura made me feel very comfortable .	4333
1	i needed last minute x-rays and had a pleasant experience at simon med ahwatukee location . sara was very nice and professional .	4333
0	although the tech was great , the front office was inconsiderate of anyones time . they told me come at 10 am , without telling me my appointment was at 10:30 am . i got there at 9:50 am to be sure to have to time for paperwork that took all of two and a half minutes . so i sat for 40 minutes for what took less than 5 minutes .	4333
0	horrible billing practices with a contracted company called mydocbill.com and simon med overbilled . look carefully at your bill 's and what is paid vs. what their billing company says is paid .	4333
0	i am giving two stars because the staff was nice , misinformed , but nice . this is the second time i have tried to get an x-ray and have been given grossly inaccurate time estimates ! ! ! i called before i drove here and was told there was a 15 min wait . i re-confirmed when i got here . i had to wait 45 min . do not trust their time estimates . if you are not retired or independently wealthy and have a schedule to follow be sure to quadruple any times they provide to possibly be on time to your other obligations !	4333
0	rushed through procedure , records dept asked for previous baseline for comparison . meanwhile they give my dr inclusive results . every time i call i 'm disconnected or on hold for 10 or more minutes . records dept . receptionist ca n't tell me her last name or the name of her boss . i finally drove back to the office that did the imaging and waited more than an hour for my records . i 'm told that their office manager would call me at 9 am this morning ... no call , no surprise . i 'll have further imaging done elsewhere .	4333
0	it is impossible to book an appointment by phone due to long wait times . i booked an appointment on the web and they left me a message to tell me that time is not available . i think i will look elsewhere .	4333
1	unlike most of the reviews on here i really enjoy going to this starbucks ! artell is so nice and friendly and always makes conversation . there is a sweet girl here who knows what i want to drink before i get to the counter ! they 're always really quick when they make their drinks and the drinks always taste delicious . thanks so much for being an awesome starbucks to visit ! i 'll keep coming back .	4334
1	thank goodness there 's a starbucks on my way out of town . you 're my lifesaver on those long drives . this one is location inside the albertsons grocery store .	4334
1	have always dealt with very nice employees here . miss the old crew that used to work there so slowly the new crew is learning everyone 's drinks the way they like them . recent construction has made things slower but still faster than other locations by far . thanks for being awesome carefee starbucks !	4334
1	barista artell was super friendly , personable and made my strawberry-banana-whey smoothie deliciously . he was kind and pleasant to chat with : ) thanks artell ! ( i hope i 'm spelling his name right ) fine , quick , pleasing service from this small sbux inside the albertsons .	4334
0	worst starbucks in the valley not worth the awful parking to go in and get treated rude and they do n't even honor promotions that other starbucks do	4334
0	i went to this starbucks yesterday morning . it 's inside alberson . i was asking the lady works at register a question . she seems really impatient ! i probably will be back , but it 's only because of coffee . there customer service is sucks !	4334
0	i made an account just to review this starbucks inside albertsons -- that 's how bad their service was . i asked for two very simple drinks , a black sweetened ice tea with and without lemonade , and i never tasted a disgusting starbucks drink until now . i will definitely be driving an extra 2 miles to get quality starbucks at anthem .	4334
0	i went in with ten minutes to spare before i had to leave for work . i had a gift card , and ended up being .31 cents short . i tried to pay via my starbucks app , but they did n't accept that type of payment . i asked them just to refund my card ( by now , i had been here for about seven minutes ) , and both of the people working did n't know how and said they would have to call a manager instead . long story short , i did n't have time for that and ended up leaving without my card being refunded and without a drink ... all over .31 cents .	4334
1	great place to do laundry , ask.for jessica or rocio .	4335
1	we were looking for a laundromat that had the huge washers for blankets . this laundromat had them . woo hoo . lady working the laundromat opened the door for us to bring all the loads of clothes . very friendly . she even made recommendations for me . after leaving she gave me a coupon for our next visit . great place .	4335
0	i have been to 24 hr laundry mats before and always had an attendant this one no attendant so if you use a machine and unknowingly it do n't work but your money is in the machine and nobody to service the machine and or do a refund ! its a filthy place and completely over priced !	4335
0	hours are inaccurate . this establishment is not open 24 hours ! the place is grimey inside and it costs almost $ 7 to use the washer . the trash can is over flowing with flies flying around the entire place . the detergent dispenser is almost out of stock & cost almost $ 2 for 1 load . on top of that , more than half of the washers and dryers are out of service . also smells like mildew inside . avoid at all costs !	4335
1	this walgreens always goes above and beyond for me and my family . it must be hard for most of your customers to be sick and not understand the process to fill a prescription . good for all of you for keeping a positive attitude .	4336
1	i do n't know why everyone hates on this walgreens . this is the only pharmacy i go to since moving to the area . sometimes the drive thru is a hassle but usually i can get in and out pretty fast and they have whatever you could possibly need .	4336
1	new management brought in all new pharmacy techs . i feel confident the new lady ( forgot her name - kristen ? not sure but she 's adorable ) will get them all trained and up to speed . she seems very competent . i also really like tanya too . she remembers me , she 's always smiling and ever so helpful . things are looking up at this location thank goodness !	4336
1	`` drew '' at the pharmacy answered all of my mom 's questions , was friendly , and even cracked a joke . it was a very short visit , but pleasant .	4336
1	went to the theranos clinic and had some blood drawn . melissa was great . very polite and professional . would recommend to anyone that . i know . walgreens has to be the best pharmacy in the states .	4336
0	this company has the worst customer service ever ! - they put you on long hold times ( up to 18 minutes ) , they take a long time to refund your money ( 40 days ) , you have no way to reach the corporate office . i finally had to go through the bbb to get results . the whole chain just is n't worth your time and money .	4336
0	this review is for the pharmacy . recently my healthcare was changed so instead of going to cvs for my prescriptions i had to switch over to walgreens . this walgreens fucks up my prescriptions every month . all i need is a simple birth control refill and every month it 's not ready when it 's supposed to be even after i call . i do n't like wasting my time so to come into here and be told it 's not ready and i have to wait 20 mins is a extreme hassle . the workers are n't very nice either .	4336
0	had an appointment scheduled for noon . arrived 15 minutes early and waited for over an hour . i never saw the clinic physician because no one ever came out . words can not describe how unacceptable and unreasonable this is . i will never come back . update : i decided to come back for a flu shot . my appointment was scheduled for 9:30am and again no one is here .	4336
0	everytime i go in there are customers with large dogs running around , i even seen one do it 's business on product . i told the manager about it he treated it like it was nothing . i would understand if they were service dogs but 98 % of them are not . i was in the check out line today and i hear growling behind me i turn around it 's a large pitt bull really ! the pharmacy well that another story . good thing cvs is across the street . that 's my rant for today .	4336
0	do not use this pharmacy ! their customer service is an absolute disgrace . my doctor called in a script for me that was urgently needed and these people had the audacity to make we wait 24 hours ( to complete a one minute med fill ) , or 11am the following day . i show up to pick up my medication at 1pm , giving them more than enough time , and it still is n't ready . to top it all off , they do n't have a manager on staff until 3pm . if you have urgent medication needs , stay away from this place as this is now the 2nd time in as many chances where they 've completely failed .	4336
1	i have to put an update since i believe in fair business and consumer practices . the owner personally contacted and apologized for the experience i had at her spa . she was very caring and gracious in offering me a `` re-do '' free of charge . i went for a waxing on saturday and was very pleased with the service . the new esthetician i had was very pleasant and careful with her waxing . she offered advice and was knowledgeable about waxing . i will definitely return for future services . thank you .	4337
1	finally found my waxing place ! friendly , clean , aesthetically soothing , and just because that 's not enough , the prices are amazingly reasonable and might i say ... inexpensive ! juliana gave me a wonderful treatment : she is so bubbly , professional and knowledgeable in her craft . i did n't hesitate to ask her questions and she certainly knew what she was taking about . also , they offer package deals- so buy in advance and save yourself some cash !	4337
0	the place is clean and staff are friendly . their price is not bad at all . however , i was n't happy with my full body waxing service . the lady did n't do a good job on me . i still can spot some hair left on my skin . it just does n't look good at all .	4337
0	cheap but you get what you pay for . bruised terribly after my brazilian there . i would rather pay a little more and leave with healthy bits .	4337
1	this was my first time here . i was referred over for my fibromyalgia from my primary care doctor . i had such a great experience as i was dealt with dr.khemka . he was just the sweetest . i felt very comfortable expressing myself , and did not feel as if i was being judged for pain meds , as i have in the past with other pain doctors in the valley . i can only hope this time around things will get better , but i feel i 'm in great hands .	4338
1	i normally go to the durango location , but it was urgent , so this is the location that could get me in the same day . dr. baird had the best bedside manner of the four docs i 've worked with through this organization ( it is of note that they all rotate around locations ) . understanding that i was between health insurance , he figured out a plan that kept costs as minimal as possible ( from treatment , to meds he prescribed ) . the front desk girls were friendly .	4338
0	visited the new office on blue diamond and extremely long drive for me , they said all new patients are going here , funny office was empty . receptionist was rude , badly dressed and thought she knew everything . do n't even bother with this place , you will sadly be disappointed , they are all about treating patients like cattle , same treatment for everybody , and not everyone has the same problem . round 'em up and ship them to the injection room , more money , do n't forget the xrays and physical therapy , more money , more money .	4338
0	if you are in a hurry , forget about it at this place . that is all i can say .	4338
1	very professional , first off i would like to say the staff at 20/20image eye center are so welcoming in everyway , i was greeted with a smile and confronted emediately with professional care . shout out to hillary she made an amazing impression on me with swift care in a professional manor with helping out all my needs .	4339
1	carmen was amazing ! she got me into a pair of glasses i would have never picked for myself . its so refreshing to see someone who wants to make you look amazing if you have to wear glasses ! the doctor was easy to talk to and suggested a contact lens that would best fit my lifestyle . plus , the suggestions on eye drops have made an overall difference in the comfort of my eyes ! ! ! i 'm highly satisfied and telling everyone to come here ! ! !	4339
1	dr. shifrin is very warm , welcoming , and professional . the staff is as well , and they 've gone out of their way to help me try new contacts . excellent , thank you !	4339
0	i have been a patient here off and on for years and they treat you like a inconvenience when you are there . they are rude and do n't care about the patient needs/requests ... it 's all business . give a little !	4339
0	sorry , i just ca n't recommend this place . the doctor was great but the staff was awful . like another reviewer mentioned , they seemed to have trouble with my receipt , so i did n't get a chance to see that they ordered two years of contacts instead of one . three weeks later , i was still trying to track down my order . turns out my `` bag '' full of contacts was sitting in the back for a couple of weeks . you 're supposed to guess when your prescription comes in . i hope they read these reviews to find out why the patients do n't return .	4339
0	this gal teena over prices everything and has nothing to show for how she did the math , had to get manager involved ,	4339
1	i work at studio g architecture , a company based out in henderson . i love this company and our current technician chris . he 's quick and polite and when we 're having meetings downstairs he gets the service done without being disruptive . really do n't want to lose our technician as i learned they 'll have a new team strictly doing commercial offices . have yet to see any bugs/insects in our office , very pleased ! !	4340
1	good pest control and because we did monthly never had to worry about bugs they just come and spray and you do n't have to be home or change your schedule . highly recommended ! !	4340
1	i do n't write many reviews , but i feel i must now . ever since michael linton has been our pest control guy , we have n't had any issues at all . with the temperature getting warmer we are planning ahead . his suggestions have been spot on in the past . if you are able to choose an exterminator i suggest michael . he is very thorough and friendly . as we all know , and it seems to be a joke , there are some pretty creepy guys out there .	4340
1	the very best you will find -- knowledgeable , professional and friendly . the price is very affordable . my technician mike took time to answer all my questions . besides having excellent customer service -- they get the job done !	4340
1	my husband and i just moved to the las vegas area and we noticed a few un welcomed bugs in and around our new home . we called las vegas pest control and the lady on the phone was extremely helpful and sent someone out to our house within a week . pete showed up to our home right on time and started working right away . he gave us great advice and seemed to really know what he was doing . we felt very comfortable and reassured . las vegas pest control is so great and we are so lucky to have found them .	4340
1	i have been using las vegas pest control for over 5 years . when i got married and we moved in together i specifically told my new husband he needs to cancel his bug guy because mine is better . in five years i have only had 3 bug guys techs and everyone of them are friendly always give there cell phone number in case i have a problem and it has come in handy when i had scorpions in my house i called robert and he came right away to investigate and solve the problem and tell me what i have to do to help . would n't ever change my service with them they are a great company '	4340
1	we just moved into a house in new development are so i wanted pest control asap . these guys are so nice . the explained everything , and sent out curtis , who was so friendly and nice . they followed up with me to make sure everything was going well and really the best customer service i 've experienced during this whole move where people are late or unfriendly . it was a breath of fresh air . i really like that i can call them anytime and they will come out asap . highly recommend !	4340
0	young man came out and seemed very nice and honorable so i agreed to have them come take care of the problem in the guest bedroom . i was given a guarantee that if i ever have problems they would be right out . well my guest woke with bites all over so i called and told them it 's now been 3 weeks and they still have not lived up to there agreement ! ! avoid avoid avoid	4340
0	do n't do business with this company ! they charge you for services that were never done . how can las vegas pest control spray my house when i 'm not home and the gates are locked . then i call to cancel my service with them they charge me a termination fee . when you do n't pay them send you to collection . be very careful with this company because they take advantage of local hard working people .	4340
0	tried to cancel the service and keep putting me off to the next days . horrible service , do n't choose this company .	4340
0	it 's sad to see that you conduct your business based on responses from your clients versus making sure you take care of their concerns with pest . it 's funny how you `` quoted '' me ... `` you answered oh no , just one scorpion `` to make your selling point to try to upsell me . being in this industry of pest control you would think if somebody says `` one scorpion '' that 's means there are several more . give the customers what they deserve and do n't try to make excuses to charge them more . shame on you !	4340
0	extremely aggressive sales people . i went from being impressed by the lady 's knowledge to wanting to never use this business ! once i told the lady i wanted to check around and discuss with my husband , she was borderline harassing me ! she even called me back even though i had not even given her my number . the price should be up front . i hope her salary is not based on commissions !	4340
0	started service in may of 2014 . it was okay . no bugs in the house . price per month was fine . $ 32 . except after the year was over they stopped coming but still billed us . we moved and they still supposedly serviced the house . they are still charging us 6 months later . i 've already called to stop them from charging us but there it is on my bank statement . $ 64 charge . i 'm going to take a guess that they 're going to tell me the house was serviced when i call them tomorrow .	4340
0	i had the technician came and do an inspection . he walked around the house , kitchen , garage and outside the house and showed me possible ways the pest can get in my house . and that cost 85 dollars . the tech is great , but i dont think it worth it . it felt like you bring your broken car to the shop , and they tell you your car is broken and charged 85 dollars .	4340
1	im from california and this dd 's is great manager is awesome i will be coming back next family trip	4341
1	how can you go wrong ? the store is like you average tj maxx marshall 's . but even cheaper . they have new shipments every day . you ca n't go wrong ! check this place out if you are looking for deep discounts on clothing , bedding , shoes , kids clothes , luggage . you ca n't go wrong .	4341
1	i just want to noticed one of the genial managers of the whole company who too the time to contact me because i was very upset about a couple issues i had when i shop there . i explain all the things that i experience few times and he was really nice about and he said the attitude that some people who works there it was not acceptable and he would make sure that everyone who works there have to be more helpful n nice to all the customers . i shop at this store a lot because they have amazing prices and i bought a lot of things to give a way to people in mexico	4341
0	was rudely turned away for have a starbucks in hand . needless to say we will not be returning	4341
0	was giving my daughter a drink of my soda , twist cap , and accidentally spilled a little . went and let someone know instead of walking away and ignoring it . the lady was very rude and hateful and asked if i had an open container . and then snapped no open bottles , and then announced over the intercom , yet a friend who was with me saw an employee with an red bull walking around . never again am i shopping there , like damn they didnt need to be so rude amd hypocrites	4341
0	horrible stood in line 20 min with one cashier seems like she was the only employee besides loss prevention . line backed up she seemed like she was frustrated which was understandable since no one else came to assist .	4341
1	all the staff takes wonderful care of me . dr. purayil is hands down the best primary dr i have ever had . she listens every time a medical problem comes up . with all my medical issues i have been there a lot and i have never had one bad experience . so thankful to have found her .	4342
1	i had dr. jasper liu for my pcp and he was actually really good . very thorough , personable , and detailed when explaining . i really do n't have anything to complain about , and would n't want any other doctor as my pcp .	4342
0	i would give a 0 if i could ! do not go here if you have high expectations ( as you should ) , in a healthcare provider ! ! ! ! the lack of communication between the dr.s , nurse practitioner & front office staff is mind blowing . i had to constantly follow up on my labs and request a call back . i had labs done weeks ago and barely heard from their office yesterday . only for them to refer me to urgent care .	4342
0	dr bridgett is the worst doctor of all time . will not see me even tho i am having panic attacks . ridiculous service .	4342
1	i 've been coming to this location for a couple of years now . the store has a new manager now with a really great team ! everyone is very helpful . shawn is extremely knowledgeable and such a pleasure to work with ! i will continue to refer all of my friends and neighbors to him ! great staff and clean store !	4343
1	i go out of my way to have my water tested at this location . i live close to bell rd & cotton ln , but the employees of that location have attitude problem . plus they do n't know how to water test accurately . the only guy i liked there was the store manger of 15 years which he 's retiring and he 's gone . robert a . works at reems & grand location is very knowledgeable & very friendly . he 's a good employee . i just hope he does n't quit soon .	4343
0	sales person on phone chatting with another store shooting the shit while 5 customers waiting spend the time with your waiting customers !	4343
0	this is my second time stopping here and staff still spends most of their time chatting on the phone then helping customers in the store ! i 'm not interested in hearing about their upcoming vacation to hawaii ! ! when u have my credit card out i want to buy something	4343
1	this place is a diamond in the rough ! ! they do everything from hair and makeup to waxing , tanning and nails . just make sure you make an appointment . cindy is the owner/manager at this place and she is very personable ! ! you can tell she has high standards for her staff . diana was the girl that did my nails . super super sweet lady . she took her time and did a fantastic job ! ! price was extremely reasonable . i will go back and see these girls .	4344
1	this eclectic little place would never have been one that a picked myself . my friend bought a groupon and we went together and i am so glad that we did ! it was such a wonderful experience ! i really felt like they care about you and you 're not just another wallet walking in their door . i wish this gem was closer to where i live because their customer service is out of this world !	4344
0	horrible . the nail tech is brand new out of school and my french manicure is embarrassing . lines are not straight and sloppy . looks like i could do it myself . do n't come here .	4344
0	my french tip gel nails have already chipped now . it has been less than 6 days . i wanted nice nails for a wedding but will be taking these right off when i get home . my nail tech was sweet but definitely not well experienced . will never be going back .	4344
1	we had a great time ! went with a team of six which was perfect for the room size . the riddles and puzzles were very well thought out and created an enjoyable collaborative experience for our team . highly recommend for a fun friday or saturday night activity . also , we escaped so that made it fun too !	4345
1	i have been wanting to hit this place up for quite a while , and i ca n't believe i waited so long . it was a ton of fun , very challenging , and a great group activity . the fun did n't end after we left the escape room because we ended up talking about the experience for the next hour or so . we 're already talking about when we will return . the only downer is that it is spendy .	4345
0	definitely on the lower end of the escape room scale . unimaginative puzzles , things do n't connect cleverly , anticlimactic finish . save your money .	4345
0	we did the prison one . do n't be fooled by the website at least the one on 569 greenfield ave. homestead , pa . it was kinda ghetto , very confusing . started out good but puzzles half of em did n't make sense . jumped around in one small room split in half . lighting very bad old building felt like it was thrown together.. half of the puzzles did n't make any sense an pattern of the game was bad.. if u do n't wan na take my word for it i believe it was a waste if our $ .. ! it just sucked. ! ! !	4345
1	funny enough this is my neighborhood circle k absolutely no where to park but i find a way to make it work . i enjoy going to this one in particular because of the staff , real cool people considering they have to deal with rich snobs all day long not to mention the fact that it 's alongside my favorite pizza joint tj 's what more can i say ! ! !	4346
1	great prices on gas . but only 4 fuel pumps . sometimes there 's a wait . use your frys fuel points .	4346
1	great prices on gas . but only 4 fuel pumps . sometimes there 's a wait . use your frys fuel points ! parking is a little tight .	4346
0	horrible parking lot . impossible to get gas . never go there . and if u are trying to leave or get gas people are considerate they block u in or do n't give a crap . and they over more then the place off of tatum and bell .	4346
0	no public restroom ... . they do n't get my service . off to qt that provide restrooms . so they will get my money .	4346
0	rude obnoxious inconsistent employees . i was going to attempt to resolve this through the circle k website , but it does not work . so i guess the district office does not care to address customer complaints . gas prices are some of the lowest around , but they have a really bad layout , and it is very difficult to get in line if there are more than two or three vehicles ahead of you .	4346
1	the mayfield store is pretty typical of most other costco stores . always well stocked , outstanding meats , and delicious bakery at great prices . they seriously need to work on the checkout system . it is very slow and inefficient . the dogs and sausages : 6 stars !	4347
1	a standard costco , so just for that it gets 5 stars . parking is easy and ample . it never gets too crowded , although the check-out lines can be long . they sell beer and wine . one time i bought a tree , and it died : ( hint : if you want samples , you 'll have to wait until the afternoon . they do n't even start setting up the carts until late morning .	4347
1	i like costco , but membership is kind of expensive . and prices sometimes not cheap . but if you have a big family , you will save . i bought tires from there . i have every 6k miles rotation and balance .	4347
1	i had costco membership for 5yrs and i can only say that the quality gets better and better . accepts only american express credit cards and debit cards . best price for the best quality .	4347
1	best store for party prep . delicious birthday cakes plus great prices on beverages and ready to eat appetizers and entrees . only challenge is the weekend crowd and long lines	4347
1	cleveland just does not have the variety of good grocery stores that the other big cities in ohio have . costco is a great find and if i lived closer to it , i 'd rely heavily on it . i highly recommend the salmon there as well as the prepared chicken noodle soup sold in large containers near the shrimp cocktail . this also a great place to buy paper goods , toiletries and discounted gift cards . they take credit cards now which is so much more convenient . they do n't bag stuff here so some people use the warehouse boxes to organize their purchases .	4347
0	pharmacy is ridiculous . waited in line 30 minutes and only as they turned off the light they started to take customers off the line . silly us , we try to get there at least 30 minutes before they close . we had to pick up a couple weeks ago and was the same deal . we wanted flu shots , but got ta go to walgreens or cvs . i feel bad for the employees as it appears to be scheduling . however , we pay to spend money here , seems kinda stupid of us .	4347
0	i like costco because i can buy healthy food in bulk for cheap . my problem with this location is that it 's way too packed . if they expanded their hours , it would decrease the congestion . also , i heard an employee make fun of a customer 's accent today . the customer asked , `` do ya 'll have humidifiers ? '' the costco employee responded , `` ya 'll ? ! ya 'll '' so the customer quickly corrected himself and was embarrassed . i thought that was very sad ...	4347
0	i love costco and their products , i really do ! ! however , this particular costco has shown me the worst customer service i 've seen anywhere . racist , discriminatory , ignorant , belittling -- countless times i have had a negative experience , and yet i still come back thinking it 'll be a different story -- nope . i hate that the other costco is 40 minutes away but it 's better than coming back here .	4347
0	i went to cosco 's in mayfield tonight only to renew my membership . i went in the exit door not realizing it was until some lady rudely stopped me and told me several times that i need to walk around and go through the other door . i just had injection shots in my knees so i did not want to go the longer way around . every step counts when your knees are in pain . one other time i dealt with someone at the store that was not customer friendly .	4347
0	wow the lines . midday i readily admit but what a mess . staffing problem may have been just a one day thing - i normally shop west side costco 's but for sure i will think twice about going to mayfield costco . yikes . disappointed	4347
0	customer service , cameron , the worst . rudy , cocky know it all . he degrades his fellow employees and treats guests like he is above them	4347
1	all the associates in this store are extremely friendly . worth to be mentioned is mr. takis . he helped me a lot . he is very patient and professional in giving me suggestions about the pattern of optical frame and sunglasses .	4348
1	the best lenscrafters i have been to . after bringing home my glasses i noticed scratches on the frame and lens brought them back and the sales supervisor gave me a 1 year protection plan and replaced my lenses and frames free of charge would definitely recommend .	4348
0	i found the sales staff to be a bit aggressive . i did n't end up buying anything but felt uncomfortable when they swarmed me at the door . maybe it 's just me .	4348
0	have been going to lenscrafters for years but will not be returning . i think they have gotten rid of their trained staff ( optometrists/ opticians ) and now hire salespeople who know nothing - just interested in the sale who are likely hired at minimum wage + commission . after getting a new pair of glasses the salesperson asked if i would like a trained person to check the fit ! i would have expected this to be de rigeur ! you also have to wait forever for the trained person to come by ( because there are very few of them ) .	4348
1	the staff is warm and friendly . it 's a nice calm office . beach theme which is cool and they have a cool reward system set up which i thought was pretty awesome .	4349
1	this is an excellent practice . all three of my kids have had braces . the office staff and the doctor are wonderful	4349
1	we love green valley orthodontics . so friendly !	4349
0	i have a 2 kids go to this office for braces and both of their teeth have shifted and they both need braces again . they do n't offer the retainers that are permenate like other offices and want to continue care for more money after the 18 months . very disappointed .	4349
0	receptionist had very poor phone etiquette ! and ! was totally rude as soon i mentioned that i was covered through my husbands insurance . no customer service at all and absolutely no aloha .	4349
0	way over priced ! the ortho was nice but his office assistant was snarky and rude to my daughter , made her feel very uncomfortable and insecure .	4349
1	great experience here ! ! although the wait was long they got me in a chair right away . i got an herbal pedicure which lasts about an hour and it was amazing . you get to choose your herb flavor my legs were exfoliated and moisturized and feel great . the nail tech was so great i bought a gift certificate for mother 's day and booked an appointment with him . he was kind enough to run my two transactions and bring my receipt to my chair while my toes dried . i will definitely be back every two weeks as i think this is my new go to nail salon . props to management for hiring such an amazing staff ! !	4350
1	love this place . they do a thorough , professional paint job with regular pedicures and gel manicures . they have the best stuff on the tv - concerts , victoria 's secret fashion shows . the staff is friendly . love it ! keep going back even though i live in cleveland .	4350
1	i had a great experience here ! everyone was friendly and my nails look great . i was n't sure what i should do with my nails and they did n't try to upsell me . i highly recommend .	4350
0	as the employees here are very nice , i will never go back there to get my nails done . i have got my mani pedi from them multiple times . each time the gel nail chips and comes off in less than a week , the polish on my toes comes off . and my latest experience is the way he cut my toe nail it gave me a terrible in grown and infected my toe and i had to go to the doctors for it . i do not recommend this place .	4350
0	i went in a few years ago for a french on my natural nails . i would do my own french pretty well but i wanted to go to a salon to have it even neater for the occasion and so i did n't have to spend a lot of time doing them myself . the guy used such a sheer color as the base and did n't really even shape my nails . the thin white lines were not very neat and i could have and should have actually done my own at that point . it was chipping hours after getting it done and by the next day for prom they did n't look good at all .	4350
0	very dirty nail salon . they have dirt and nail dust still on their stations from the customer before and do n't bother to clean anything . nail polish color very limited and old . they overcharge you and think you wo n't know . very unprofessional discussions between employees . not going back again .	4350
1	office on miles road is friendly and thorough . the dental hygienist answered my questions , and i thought she did a nice job . when she finished , dr. glick checked her work , made small talk and was pleasant . i had new insurance and the front desk person told me about a few services with that insurance . i scheduled my next appointment . very happy .	4351
1	i was in from out of town and had an issue i was very concerned about . the office worked to get me seen the day i called and when i showed up , there was no time wasted in the dr. getting in to see me and resolve the issue . i would definitely go back !	4351
0	had an okay experience here , and would not consider going back . the whole appointment felt rushed . the doctor did n't seem like they wanted to take time to really understand my concerns . the hygienist was not gentle . i do n't expect most dental procedures to be fun and painless , but a little consideration goes a long way . the staff at the front desk had a `` take it or leave it '' attitude and did not seem interested in setting up a new appointment and were pretty brusque .	4351
0	i will never give this group my business again . the last appointment i had there was horrible . the hygienist was very rough with just a general cleaning , and it almost seemed like she took pleasure in watching me squirm from the pain . then when the dentist came in for the end of the appointment , he was extremely rude and insulted me and my family . very unprofessional .	4351
1	we rented a mini van for our trip down south for thanksgiving to visit family . the location was very helpful . the only drawback was i do not use credit cards and planned to pay with a debit card . they had to do a credit check and i had to pay a $ 250 deposit . the deposit was returned to my account 2 days after i returned the rental . i would definitely recommend this location to anyone , but not a fan of enterprise 's debit card policy .	4352
1	i find this location convenient and the staff always excellent . an excellent selection of cars for a non-airport location .	4352
0	i rented a car last weekend and i parked my car inside their gated facility . when i returned the car and went to check my car , i got hit and they ca n't help at all . look like they tried to help by checking on security camera but then say they ca n't give me anything . i understand that it is on my own to park here but a little bit of help would be appreciated . do n't rent and park here .	4352
0	if there was another rental car company as close or slightly further away , i 'd use them instead of the enterprise location on campbell 's run road . my new job/company requires me to rent a car for travel and my first to experiences at enterprise have been trouble some . their customer service representatives have not been in anyway apologetic for delays or the hoops required to get a car with a debit card . and an upgrade to an audi , that i was willing to pay for , turned into a cheap looking and equipped chevy impala .	4352
1	i had been to a couple of furniture stores before going to levin . i was greeted but left alone to browse . it did n't take long for me to find a couch and chair that i loved ! steve helped me with some fabric choices which i was able to sign out to view in my home . i returned the next day and ordered the couch and chair . the prices were so good that i also added on a coffee table . i appreciate the help that i received as well as the great price and free delivery . i ca n't recommend levin enough !	4353
1	worked with their customer service team when trying to replace a broken couch part . they went above and beyond to really help us out even calling a partner company because they discontinued the item . gina and jack both really made working with them wonderful .	4353
1	deb restifo was amazing . we told her what we wanted and she found us the perfect couch that no other furniture store could seem to accommodate . we were in and out in less than 30 minutes ! thank you so much deb ! ! !	4353
1	sales rep , cristina tomon was amazing to work with . i will definitely seek her out again for any of my furniture shopping needs as well as refer friends and famil to her .	4353
0	i just had to update this review . after posting this , one of their sales associates decided to private message me and tell me that i was n't a serious buyer and basically called me out because i left a bad review.. along with assume what i wanted to buy . and yes , we did end up at another levin and found what we were looking for ( and shocker.. bought it ! ) ... but after the message , hearing some interesting stories.. we can take business elsewhere .	4353
0	went in with intent to buy a few couches , i was ignored by sales people four of them in-fact , as they sat on couches and talked to one another about `` getting drinks `` later together . one guy walked right past me and did n't even acknowledge me . i wo n't be back . i 'll take my money to an establishment with actual people who speak with their customers .	4353
0	there sales personel mislead me i asked for 12 months same as cash and purchased the furniture from sales associate mullins , thinking i had 12 months to pay , then i in recieved a call from the finace company telling mei was 2 months behind in payments , i was shocked because i am on a fixed income and this is going to put me in a bind . i purchased windows from a different company and did n't have to make any payments for 1 year and that is what i thought i was getting . be wary of this company and i hope they go out of business , they are trash	4353
0	horrible customer service ! i was quoted a price and put a deposit down on those numbers- i came back to finalize and pay the balance as was then told they accidental gave me two discounts and they could only actually honor one or the other . here is a tip levins- educate your employees or do n't have such complicated sales.. i have an email into corporate not that it will do much ... p.s . the manager steve is awful to deal with !	4353
1	i really like this place . the people all have skills and to top it off they c are all very friendly and happy they just want you to be pleased with your nails . i enjoy getting my mani- pedi ' s here .	4354
1	they are cheap , available at the last minute and clean . i could not ask more for a pedicure ... ..p.s . love that they use clean disposable bags in the foot spas . genius !	4354
0	worst pedicure i 've had in henderson . not only did the nail tech do a poor job painting my nails , he also stopped in the middle of the pedicure to make several phone calls . he tried to paint clear nail polish with one hand . when he was done , he just got up to prep for the next client , did n't mention to me that i was done or if i needed to go under a dryer , i had to flag him down to tell me he was finished . will not be going back to this place .	4354
0	have been to paradise for about 4 months now and was very disappointed that i was turned away for a fill . it was 2pm on friday was told to come back another day , not later but another day . as far as i can see they were not that busy . i wo n't go back . i 'm a good paying customer and i tip graciously . oh well henderson offers more nails shops	4354
1	bought a new chrysler srt through ann at junction and it was an absolutely flawless experience . i also purchased the extended warranty through ray and it was a second great experience . i have been doing business with 3 generations of the junction auto family and i highly recommend this business .	4355
1	i bought a used chrysler crossfire here . the offer and sale experience was top rate . the offers of service ( which i live pretty far in avon are excellent but a bit far for me to use ) . these are thoughtful , fair , direct and quality people . do business here . joe	4355
1	i came in here for a regular oil change the other day . i was in and out in no time . cliff , the gm even offered me some coffee . it 's good to see a family business doing well !	4355
0	my friend took her 2007 chrysler town and country minivan there for warranty work and the service department put on a new brake caliper on the wrong side , instead of replacing the driver side caliper they replaced the passenger side and she almost got into an accident because the bad caliper froze up on her	4355
0	extremely disappointed . brought my vehicle in for service on a friday with no appointment and was told i could wait . sat in the service lounge for hours only to hear they needed me to come back on another day ; i was told to come back at 7:00am on a monday , only to find they do n't open until 7:30am ! junction does n't value my time and i 'm beyond upset . guess i have to drive farther and take my vehicle to a different dealership .	4355
0	i used to be a big fan of this place . i 've purchased three vehicles from then with a smile ! over the last year or two the service department started to really fall apart . twice in the last year they have neglected to close my windows . unfortunately it poured rain and soaked my seats and carpeting . the first time it happened they owned up to it and cleaned it up . this last time the manager asked the lot driver if he left the windows open , in a panic , he said no . the manager backed his employee and said sorry , there must be something wrong with your car . wrong answer ! off to ganley in aurora !	4355
1	scheduled an appointment with karla after i read all the great reviews , and honestly she 's amazing ! she 's been doing this for years and is really good at it ( brazilian wax ) . made me feel so comfortable and was done in 15 mins . everyone was very welcoming and friendly ! i 'll definitely be back : )	4356
1	just went for the first time and karla was fantastic ! the best waxing place i 've ever been to ! it was clean , painless , and great customer service ! also , between 12w-4 it 's happy hour and was just about $ 30 with tax ! will be going again for sure !	4356
1	this place is a gem , so are the two women working here . firstly , the insane proximity to the jane subway station makes it just way too convenient . i walked in to a gorgeous , clean spa . great decor , very chic . soft music , clean facility , rapid and painless waxing . i ca n't express how amazing this place is . i have been a waxing customer at indian salons on and off for 15 years and finally experienced true value , satisfying result - for a very reasonable price . no more driving to brampton !	4356
1	i 've been waxing for over 10 years and i just found the gem ! karla is the best waxing esthetician i ever experienced . price are affordeable and i garantee that full brazilian is less than 10 min ( average 8 min ) .	4356
0	extremely rude service , got lost on the way and still paid for parking to come to my appt only 5 mins late and was told to come back another day cause the lady had to 'go out ' it was barely lunch time at this point of the day . extremely disappointed , definitely will not be rescheduling any appointments here .	4356
0	gave karla a few chances thinking it would be better the next time . very aggressive technique , rips the same piece of skin over and over again until it 's red and raw instead of using tweezers . lots of strays left each time . unfortunate because she 's very sweet and close to home . she was always fair with her pricing and i loved the tea tree oil/cream/hand sanitizer and privacy provided . i will not be returning . brazillians are not supposed to be that painful !	4356
0	receptionist was pretty rude . i went there twice and both occasions were time wasted . first time they had closed the location for the day . second time i went 40 minutes early receptionist was so arrogant i cancelled the appointment	4356
0	my eyebrows got ruined here and i wo n't be returning . my regular salon was fully booked so i came here after reading great reviews . i left with a burn that took a few days to heal and my eyebrows were visibly different shapes . wo n't be back	4356
1	tried the phad thai fries at the acc and they were pretty tasty . loaded with flavour and had a little kick too . the flavours married well and definitely recommended eats for all even those on a cheat day	4357
1	had the pad thai fries and a sandwich both were great . i 'd recommend the fries first just because i have never had fries like these .	4357
0	just tried the pork ribs , being barbecued by fidel himself . i was excited to see him in action and high-fived him when he was preparing my order , but when i tasted the ribs , they were tasteless and undercooked . i 've lived in texas and travelled to louisiana for years , so believe me , i know ribs and i know what i am talking about . i 'm highly disappointed with fidel 's ribs . worst ribs i ever had .	4357
0	i was really excited about this food truck , having heard great things . i got the captain belly and it was really awful - the pork was tasteless and the coleslaw was overpowering and too creamy . the pad thai fries were good - i 'd had them before at lisa marie so i was n't surprised . one of my friends had the pulled pork sandwich with the guacamole and said it was good - so perhaps i just ordered the wrong thing .	4357
1	i had rosy for an 80 minute deep tissue -- great pressure and relaxing pace . i have had massages all over the u.s , mexico , italy , dominican , jamaica ... it was one of the top ten massages i have had , and i 've had many -- at least once a month for the last 18 years ... the price was good compared to the hotel i was staying at and i walked back to the [ aria hotel ] on the strip -- it was a 8 $ cab ride from that end on the way there .	4358
1	i had a 50-minute deep tissue massage- my job requires a lot of stressful physical activity and since all i 've been doing since i got to vegas about 2.5 weeks ago is work this was a perfect idea . i am going back in a few days for more services like the facial and ear candling . i recommend this place for sure : )	4358
1	my wife and i did the couples massage . she fell asleep and i feel great . wish i could take them home to indiana .	4358
1	my friend and i used uber to come to visit this spa last month . patrick was awesome and very relaxing , i did the longest massage they had and really enjoyed the experience . i will return again next time i am there .	4358
0	unfortunately a very weird and average massage . staff and front desk were pleasant but actual massage was sub par relying on elbow pressure and very little actual hand massage . not relaxing therefore a low rating .	4358
0	i do n't know what happend to this place but the quality and skill of the staff and dropped . we visit vegas about 4 or 5 times a year and always visit a touch of las vegas , and have referred several friends . but after spending $ 300 for the worst and most painful experience of my life i will never return . we booked two 100 min swedish massages and it was 100 mins of pain and not relaxing and all ! ! after this experience we will just pay the extra money and go back to the hotel spa .	4358
0	perfectly pleasant lobby and relaxing lounge area . however , failed to honor a reservation that i had even showed up early for . i 'm not sure why a masseuse would unexpectedly stay in an appointment beyond the allotted time , but i could n't wait another 30 minutes for her to be done . all in all an hour wasted .	4358
0	unfortunately , i can not give this business more than 1 star . i went about a week ago for a back wax which i have been doing for years . i wanted to give them a shot as they are close to me . the place is nice and the staff friendly . i think the girl that did my back was sandy ( could be wrong on that name ) she was extremely nice , but did a horrible wax job . the appointment took much longer than usual and she still missed many spots . they are the most expensive waxing i 've received as well . very disappointing .	4358
1	everything about the place is outstanding . i disagree with many of the other users ' gripes about it . from what i 've seen , i get the distinct feeling that many people do n't properly tip the staff . it was spotless , my room was huge and beautiful ( even though i booked through hotwire ) and the staff was first-rate , polite and respectful . it is the best hotel i have ever stayed in , full stop . i 'm staying at another `` four-star '' establishment in montreal this weekend and i will be surprised if it is even half as nice .	4359
1	i had a really nice stay here . the hotel is clean and the rooms are comfortable . the best part of my stay was breakfast in the morning served in the hotel 's restaurant .	4359
1	this is a really solid hotel . clean , modern , with excellent service and a fantastic restaurant .	4359
1	typical westin . great rooms and helpful staff . spg was able to find me a great rate that was n't shown online too .	4359
1	this is a beautiful , modern hotel with clean rooms and friendly staff in a convenient location . there 's not much to share about the rooms , which are standard newer westin , except that i very much liked the walk-in shower with double shower heads . two minor complaints : the bar was a little sleepy and seemed to close early ( i think around 11:30pm ) and my upgraded room , on the top floor , was quite on the small side .	4359
1	i enjoyed my 4 night stay at this hotel . we were treated well during the check-in process and it felt like a nice home-away-from-home . while it was extremely cold outside , it was nice and warm inside . the room was big and we had a decent view of downtown montreal . the location was great since one could walk to most of the downtown attractions and very close to old montreal . i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting montreal .	4359
1	very nice hotel . its in an amazing location very close to downtown and the famous st. catherine street . the rooms are very big and the bathrooms are nice . the hotel also has an indoor swimming pool which is very nice . it 's also very close to the old port .	4359
0	frankly , i was not impressed with the westin montreal at all . the rooms are okay but the hallway on our floor smelled like stinky gym shoes and even at times , poop . the staff was about 50/50 and some of the concierge/ front desk staff were rude and not helpful . and the hotel bar was absurdly expensive ! ! i ordered a kir royal , which cost unbeknownst to me , $ 30 ! ! seriously ? this hotel is mediocre at best .	4359
0	the room was nice and all . the bed was clean and was comfortable . however , when i called housekeeping about the toilet being plugged , they brought me a plunger and told me to fix it myself ... what kind of service is that ? ? ?	4359
0	the keys in hotel never work . i have been through over 15 keys . the pool is cool . but the keys never work . i would much rather stay at any other hotel at this point .	4359
0	one star . rooms are okay if you are n't on the 21 floor with the suite above you . ( 2108 , 2110 ) . loud party above me ( and i mean loud ) in the `` suite '' but they are more important clients as they wo n't ask them to leave . i hope they trash the place before they leave . sounds like a herd of elephants in high heels , dragging furniture around the room . not at all pleased the way the front desk handled the situation . sending up someone to ask them to be quiet is a joke . do yourself a favour and find another hotel !	4359
0	valets put a huge dent in our brand new truck . the hotel said they would pay the damages but when we sent the bill they refused to pay for it . $ 1000 to fix the damage . do not stay here . bunch of crooks . ruined our trip to montreal .	4359
0	hotel set up for confrences . told to take esculators up to elevator , first bank for confrence rooms , two additional towers and poor signage . pool very small . tv very small . nothing like westin in toronto . room nice but so many other options i would expect the franchise to step it up . btw , hotel was not busy .	4359
0	do not stay here ! ! ! my friends and i used points and we got a room right next to the pool , next door to frat boys and a view of a brick wall !	4359
1	the staff here is loving and understanding of my pets needs . they took great care of her while boarding this last weekend . the play area for the dogs is so fantastic . my dog will never go anywhere else .	4360
1	pals inn took in our lost dog tonight and tracy met us after hours to pick up our dog . it is risky to take in a lost dog-we were so grateful . thank you ! ! ! ! !	4360
0	leaving your pet here would be like leaving her at the pound ! it smelled like dog pee ! dogs are constantly barking ! the cages are barred and the dogs are jumping up on them ! loud ! just awful ! we did not leave our dog !	4360
0	i agree , this place is like the pound . i did n't leave my dog either ! looked into daycare and basically your dog sits in a smelly kennel all day and is taken out to an artificial turf yard for 20 minutes and then caged again . how is this daycare and pampering a pet as they claim ? my dog would be traumatized in a smelly dark row of kennels filled with barking dogs . no thanks .	4360
1	this company has made my business what it is - the shows always bring out the best industry professionals and offer all the brides and grooms such a great look at multiple service options at the same time - this is a must attend event every year !	4361
1	bridal spectacular is wonderful . i have gained so much information with them . they make being a bride not as scary ! looking forward to this years show !	4361
0	the show was fine , although a bit intimidating . but a good resource for wedding planning , and lots of discounts/freebies . the main reason i 'm giving this two stars , though , is because i 've been receiving at least 2 emails a day from vendors through the bs mailing list . they state that vendors do not have your actual email address , but vendors are able to email you indirectly through the bs mailing list . i can not figure out a way to unsubscribe from ( or opt out of ) the overall mailing list , so i 've had to unsubscribe from all of the individual emails . very annoying .	4361
0	to all those considering attending the next bridal spectacular convention , be aware that your contact information is dispersed to multiple vendors , even if you do n't give it to them yourself . please read the terms and conditions when you purchase tickets . i will never attend another one of these events because i have been bombarded with emails and harassed with phone calls from sales reps claiming `` i 've won a prize '' i did n't even sign up to win . be careful who you give your information to .	4361
1	the best doctor i have seen in years ! just moved to az and always dread finding a new doctor . glad t his one was my choice . the office staff is wonderful , thanks irene and the rest of the office help . dr. hopkins was wonderful , simple , straight forward doctor who listened and cared ! and his assistant was great .	4362
1	i have seen dr. sturdivant for the last several years . i really like her because she listens carefully to me . i never feel rushed or that she is hurried . my one minor complaint is that it is hard to get an appointment with her and i have had to wait over a week to get in occasionally . when i had a bad cold last winter i ended up at the urgent care because i clearly could n't wait a week to see the doctor .	4362
0	this facility is horrible . you can not call and talk to anyone to make an appointment without waiting at least ten min . then they have no personality when talking to you . you can not make an appointment without waiting at least as week . kind of ironic with how many dr and pa 's they have there . it is almost impossible to see the same person twice so when you do get to go in thee is no relationship because they do n't know you from anyone else . needless to say looking for a new dr .	4362
0	do not use this place unless you want to die ! they have no clue what they are doing nor do they care . i 've been wrongly diagnosed so many times and the last was cancer and they swore it was constipation ! these people should be sued for their practices or lack there of ! ! !	4362
1	cheap gas ! decent beer selection and 2 for $ 3 monster . what more could you ask for . i nearly filled the tank up for $ 25.00 . it has been years since that has happened . this location has a car wash and vacuums to detail your car . it will be easier to access when the lvac is completed and the driveway connecting them opens . when travelling southbound on decatur you have to u turn to get the cheapest gas in lv .	4363
1	a new gas station that opened up in the area a few months ago . bright , clean , large convenience store . right next to target and win co. best part ? coke slushies for cheap !	4363
1	can i say it 's about time a gas station opened up between costco and ann road ? ! a large , cheap convenience store with cheap gas that you do n't need a costco membership for ? i mean , what else could you ask for ! ! it 's probably the nearest gas station near my neighborhood that actually has a pretty big convenience store : ) need to start a road trip with 100s of gas station snacks ? ampm is the place for you : )	4363
1	easy to get in and out location . plenty of pumps , nice car wash and lots of drinks/snacks are available . the staff are usually friendly but there is a pay at the pump feature making it super convenient ! tip ... bring cash unless you want to pay the extra surcharge ! !	4363
0	they pass on the $ .35 debit fee on to their customers , with the amount of volume and sales they have this should be a cost of doing business , 1-star .	4363
0	horrible place . i stop every day to get a steamer at many locations of am pm today i stopped , got my drink , stirred in my sugar and saw something floating . ignored it- just a little bug- then kept stirring and more floated up . told the two ladies -one big black lady ( super nice ) and one bigger white girl ( super rude ) with purple makeup all over her face- and they just looked at me . then i showed them where it was coming from . the blonde one then just shewed me away so i would n't see the entire thing was infested with ants . gross . i will switch my service to 7/11 from now on	4363
0	management should be fired , only am pm in the area i have been to that changes out the money drawers and reboots their credit card machines at 6 in the morning every day . this is rush hour and people have jobs to get to . just poorly managed . i already poured it so i guess i 'll waste 15 minutes of my day waiting to pay for this coffee .	4363
0	i went in to pump gas and get my car washed , i asked for military discount and they only have military discount on mondays , cause the military only serves on mondays smh	4363
1	best bank in town . branches all over , staff are friendly and courteous . highly recommend their services especially for business accounts .	4364
1	came in to open an checking and savings account and maggie was absolutely amazing ! the process for everything was smooth and i was in and out . thank you again maggie !	4364
0	ohhhh my goshhhhhh . are they purposely seeing how slow they can go here ? if 20 people are in line , you should n't as a teller hold full out convos with customers about buying a house ! !	4364
0	i have been cashing checks at wells fargo locations for a while , this is the first time i have ever been told to `` go sit over there '' while they verify my check . you guys should treat your customers like they mean something instead of telling them to `` go sit over there '' and prioritize someone else . i can understand being busy - but thats when you open more windows instead of being rude .	4364
1	enjoyed walking around ladlow 's today with my mom . lots of beautiful items and very unique . customer service was friendly . ended up not purchasing anything due to the items being on the large side ( i 'm looking for stuff for an apartment ) and also the prices . it 's very very pricey .	4365
1	ladlow 's did n't let us down ... the couch arrived right when they said it would ! it took 6 weeks from the date we purchased it till it was in our home . it looks amazing . every stitch is perfect and it looks just like we wanted . the couch is a sectional that seats 7 including the corner piece . it came with 4 accent pillows and we have our own for a touch of color . everything worked out great and the experience was a flawless one . thank you jack and thank you ladlow 's ! : )	4365
1	this is a great furniture store . huge selection and great help . not pushy at all . have been here many times and have purchased quite a bit of furniture from them . from the shopping experience to the purchase and delivery service , it is just terrific . i have had several different sales people and they were all above average . will definitely come back when i need to add to my furniture collection .	4365
1	was very impressed with quality of furniture and found some beautiful pieces for a client that were reasonably priced . had an issue with customer service but i will definitely shop here again ! !	4365
1	we purchased a mattress from them last summer , and it was n't long before it started to cave-in in the middle . it was really uncomfortable to sleep on . ladlows replaced the mattress and box spring free of charge . that 's great customer service !	4365
1	jack saba is an amazing design consultant . he offered my mother & i a drink . quick and easy purchase . explained everything to us . will be back for again & again !	4365
1	i know it 's pricey but i appreciated the quality and the unique pieces they have . my husband and i have been online , in stores across the valley from consignment to upper retail . we finally found a side board for our kitchen that even though is more money than some of the other ones we saw , we know it 's a `` forever '' piece . ask for kay- she was wonderful and very patient ! : )	4365
1	ladlow offers a diverse selection of quality wood furniture at reasonable price . but it 's even better when they are on sale ! hint . hint . last summer we bought a old style heavy wooden desk that was originally priced at $ 1,500 . we eventual got the unit for less then $ 900 . get deal and would recommend them to anyone . they 're nice to boot !	4365
0	so , mother always said if you ca n't say something nice do n't say anything at all . when i finally reached someone at ladlow 's after two unanswered voice messages and an email about a bench ordered in september they were quick to refund my deposit after we determined the bench was n't on order . they blamed it on the manufacturer and slow demand for the piece but the manufacturer said in an email to me they were surprised at that response and could n't find an order from ladlow 's for the item . i was glad they sent the refund check so quickly . that 's as nice as i can be .	4365
0	they deserve zero stars as i received zero service . i went into ladlow 's , was not greeted by either of the two women chatting near the door . i saw at least 4 other salespeople , they turned around , walked the other way or continued to talk amongst themselves . i was in the store measuring sitting in sofas and browsing for over 20 min . not 1 person offered assistance . i have purchased from ladlow 's in the past and was pleased with the purchases . i will never return to ladlow 's . no wonder the store was empty .	4365
0	we went in looking for a table ..woman walks by us and i ask do you work here ? oh yes starts to tell us about the table then another woman walks up ( gloria ) and then she starts to help us.. i didnt know if she was having a bad day or just didnt want to help , , i said , do you have any round dining tables and she said i do n't know we have to look around .. i said you do n't know your stock ? ? so looked around and then went and bought it down the street and it was 400.00 cheaper ! !	4365
0	i have read other reviews and i guess i am the only person who is not impressed with this store . after ordering a high top copper table and high top upholstered chairs , when they arrived , the chairs were short , bar height . instead of doing everything they could to get our chairs right , they did not return calls , after waiting 6 weeks , cancelled the order for the chairs . no-one apologized and after the order was placed it was like the service did too . furniture is gorgeous but the service lacks .	4365
0	unfortunately the furniture did not perform as promised . after months of working with the management team we are simply settling for it . an electric powered piece had a one month battery installed to avoid an unwanted cord with no plug nearby . the battery lasts only about a day because of incompatibility and the options offered void the warranty . i would not buy from them and do n't recommend it for others . there are many nearby options .	4365
0	it 's unfortunate that yelp does n't let you give zero stars ratings , because this place does n't even deserve one star . we are purchasing four hooker office chairs for our two home offices . we went to ladlow 's to see them in person and from what i tell there were about 6 store associates standing around the store . not one of them asked if they could help us . arrogant and classless . if you 're looking to shop here , go in with ( lad ) low customer service expectations .	4365
0	wow.. this place has the most unprofessional staff ever . so rude ! ! ! i would never set foot in here again.. i recommend if you would like to be treated well or even welcomed to a store , look somewhere else ... they can keep their junk and their bad vibe ... no wonder why we were the only people in the giant store ... what a waste of space ...	4365
0	very limited selection nothing extraordinary . same old stuff you see at every other furniture store . they must be pretty proud of it based on their prices . definitely not an outlet store .	4365
1	excellent service , well trained & knowledgeable estheticians . i 've been a loyal client for over 25 years , and wo n't go anywhere else .	4366
1	i love it here . the staff is very professional and educated . i had a facial & manicure/pedicure combo , which i got as a birthday gift . jessica , did my nails & diane did the facial . thank you , ladies ! ! ! ! left feeling like a queen . been to some awful places in the city since , i 've moved here , but my search is finally over . i 've found a spa/studio to call home . thanks again	4366
0	i had the eyelash perm and tint done . it was fine until she went to remove the curlers . she ripped and broke half of my eyelashes out , saying afterwards that my lashes were too weak . she scrubbed my eyes so hard that the tint treatment stung and burned . when i told her this she just laughed it off . i was heartbroken when i finally got to see the results . at checkout she tried to add the $ 95 serum to my bill when i 'd already said no . i 'm so embarrassed to have no more lashes now . going here was a huge mistake !	4366
0	went there for brazilian waxing from living social . that was really bad experience . if i am not mistaken the name of the girl was jessica ( both times unfortunately was the same girl ) . she was very unfriendly but if it was the only minus . the waxing was so painful that i could n't imagine it could be so . i 've been doing brazilian for a year and been to couple places but this was horrible . moreover the girl was n't precise and did n't remove all the hair . during the procedure she did n't say even a single word . i would never recommend people go there for waxing .	4366
1	i loved my gel mani . owner was super fun to talk to , and she made me a nice cup of cardamom tea . super cool staff and a nice relaxing environment !	4367
1	my friend i went here for a morning of pampering with a spa pedi and gel mani . it was a beautiful atmosphere and carlitta ( the owner ) was so nice to talk to and did a great job . i would definitely go back to this salon again . thanks for such pretty nails !	4367
1	carlitta and staff do it all : mani 's , pedi 's , facials , massage , you name it , and do it very well . she listened to how i liked my hair cut and was attentive to what i wanted . plus it 's a fun atmosphere . my daughter recommended it and i will be back .	4367
1	this place is very welcoming ! i went for a massage and the owner of the salon was the one that did it . she did an amazing job , i had a lot of knots that she was able to work out . i highly recommend la saj salon !	4367
1	i always feel relaxed here , and rejuvenated here ! ! best spa pedicure in a while ! i love carlitta & her daughter so much ! loved popping by on my way into work to say hello as well ! smiley faces positive vibes .	4367
1	great atmosphere ! my sons purchased me a massage and facial . awesome experience ! greeted by friendly attentive staff . i really enjoyed . i will be returning !	4367
1	beautiful spa and great atmosphere as soon as you walk in the door ! also , the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable . all natural products and services , and competitive prices . carlita is the mvp ! she is very informed with holistic/natural beauty and nutrition . amazing overall experience , and will definitely be a repeat customer . thanks la'saj spa !	4367
0	truly i do n't even know how they can still be in business ? run far away from ever entering this establishment . rude and vulgar help with zero talent . forget professionalism , i am certain that this is something that are not capable of .	4367
0	this salon is horrible . the owner is the most rude person ive ever met and dresses way to skimpy for her age . her daughter runs around like she has no manners and the mother does nothing about it . she treats her employees horribly making rude remarks while i was there . so if you want to pay high prices for service my 2 year old could do then be my guess . you will leave extreamly annoyed ! wish i could guve them a negative 5 star	4367
0	service- couples massage the worst experience we have both had . the massage therapist are not trained . i wanted to have the therapist stop the massage the first 5 minutes into the massage after being giving indian burn on my arms bc not enough lotion was not used . frank sinatra was lasting over the speakers , along with the salon owners talk show blasting from the front desk computer . this is a joke of a salon . very unprofessional in every aspect . i have nothing good to say about our experience . i would love a refund honestly .	4367
0	this the worst..i came in the get a massage and the owner talked my ear off ! i wanted to relax and that was the last thing i got ! over payed for no reason . also super rough with the massage and do n't care how you feel about she do n't ask how you want it or anything this a big no go ! do n't waste your money ! you can talk her ass of only thing that can make it better if she quit !	4367
0	do n't do it ! ! bought this on groupon ( pedicure only ) and completely forgot to yelp the salon first . first , horrible selection of colors . maybe 10 , at the most ! she has a dog running thru the salon and only her young daughter working their with her . she 's very pushy and nosey . very inappropriate conversation . she does not clear your toenail or cuticles . she saw add the nail bed with a filer . there was n't anything added to pedicure bowl . just hot water . this was one of the worst pedicures i 've experienced . google had even more horrid reviews . do not go here . you will be disappointed .	4367
0	i had a groupon for this place . i was getting a pedicure . i was totally unhappy with my experience . during my pedicure . the owner , who was doing my service , talked on her cellphone , fixed her young daughter 's hair , and touted the other businesses she is involved in . i maybe got 10 minutes of her time . the pedicure was substandard . i would not recommend this place .	4367
0	this was the worst `` spa '' i 've ever experienced . i had a pedicure ... if you want to call it that . the owner of this establishment was giving me my pedi as she talked on the phone the whole time . she did tell me how wonderful she treated clients , but her actions proved otherwise . terrible . absolutely the worst .	4367
1	always friendly staff and very helpful . the new bottles for the juices though are awful . please go back to the other bottles for the juices .	4368
1	love this place ! the staff are always fun and helpful and they have the best e-juices , flavors , and vaporizer products you can ask for . the business is clean and has a great personality-it 's a nice place to hang out at their tasting bar and taste all of the different flavors they offer .	4368
1	best vape shop in town ! so friendly , wonderful selection of juices ! the staff is amazing , i would highly recommend them ! i do n't go anywhere else but pink spot ( southwest location ) ! i love you guys ! ! my only spot	4368
1	it 's been a couple years since i 've been here . shane helped me out , and i 'm literally just blown away about how knowledgeable and nice he was . he definitely locked me in and i 'm going to make this my go to vape shop from now . thanks shane youre the best ! ! !	4368
1	these guys are the best ! always super friendly and helpful . very knowledgeable about the products and they have a killer juice selection .	4368
1	i 've been using a vape for about three years and i finally found the best place in town . the staff is very helpful , knowledgable and friendly . their e-juices are the best i 've ever had and i do n't think i 'll be switching for awhile .	4368
1	the folks at pink spot vapors are knowledgable and extremely helpful ! highly recommend ! ! !	4368
1	my last post was 1 and 1/2 years ago , and i 've gotten nothing but the absolute best service at pink spot ! my one year anniversary of quitting cigarettes was 2 days ago . every sales associate is friendly and extremely knowledgable . i encourage anyone that is considering quitting smoking to go to pink spot . you certainly wo n't regret it .	4368
1	i just met the nicest group of guys . thank you for your time and patiences ben ! got to really taste everything with no judgement when i made faces . although i must say the best flavors are pink spot flavors . xanadew is honeydew at its best . isaac thank you again for recoiling my piece . it vapors like no other . try genius . definitely a must every-time i 'm in vegas ! ca n't wait to try the other location next time i 'm in town and have some custom mixes .	4368
1	went in for the first time despite reading reviews . the 2 employees there were n't rude or not willing to help . super nice and inviting . got what i needed quickly .	4368
1	i love this place . they are very friendly and helpful with all your vaping needs . i wish they had this store in san diego . i would visit this place again next time im in vegas .	4368
1	i absolutely love this place . being very new to vaping , i have a ton of questions . they are always very informative and professional . they 're starting to recognize me when i walk in which i really appreciate . great customer service . i 've never had a bad experience in either of their stores in the valley . of course you can find the things they sell for a bit less online , but they 're top-notch service and high-quality juices make this the only place i will spend my vaping money . the juice selection is huge and they 'll spend all day with you at the tester counter . truly a great store .	4368
1	i walked in and they are amazingballs shaine walked me through everything and hooked me up ! ! ! why would complain when they are here to walk you through this whole process . thank you pink spot ! !	4368
1	i think these guys rock ! i do n't live in the state and use the website . the site is easy to use , quick and the fast delivery is the best . i started vaping with pink spot usa blend . the one vape store that carries it is great but not easy for me to get too . finding the website was great . no more wasted time driving around . i do n't want to vape watermelon or banana cream pie so pink spot tobacco line is good for me . i 've had no problems and will continue to order	4368
0	horrible customer service . rude management and sales people . consistently inconsistent liquids . been buying here for three years and lately they just ca n't get it right . instead of fixing an issue they would rather tell you to go somewhere else . really ? you have highly overpriced liquid and you want to treat your overpaying customers that way ? ! my pleasure to go elsewhere , you 're not the only rodeo in town .	4368
0	their attitude is just horrible . they behave like its a privilege for you to shop there and that they are the best . never again	4368
0	bought some juice a while back in a desperate situation . e-liquid quality is absolute shit . you can taste the chemicals they use in their juices and i do n't even want to know what 's used as a coloring . hardware is mediocre and over priced . juice is an absolute rip-off . the only reason these guys still exist is because of a heavy marketing budget before vaping blew . a terrible representation of the vaping community . save you money and go to blue diamond vapors , puff vapors , or the vapery down the street instead .	4368
0	walked in the shop because i wanted to replace my vape . the sales person was so rude , basically berated me because i did n't know what type of itaste i have at home . i have n't use it in months and wanted to give another shot at vaping so i can quit smoking . we left within a minute . so disappointed .	4368
0	pretty disappointed . i walk in with problems with my tank and mod and they `` tried everything '' . but nothing has changed it still spits in my throat and still does n't seem to act right . it 's unfair to spend a lot of money on these mod 's and yet they do n't really help me .	4368
0	here 's a tip : go . to . puff . we came in today to check it out again while waiting for game stop to open and never again . the customer service is just so cold and unwelcoming . the juices are flavorless and their juice bar is n't self help so it made us feel like we were bothering the girl with every one we asked to try . overall the experience was just subpar and we are definitely sticking to puff .	4368
0	not very friendly . there is selection is n't very great either . it was very awkward being in the shop .	4368
0	probably the worst juices i 've tried from any vapor shop . the flavors i sampled had a bitter aftertaste that i have n't experienced from other stores . plus the sales guy seemed like he did n't want to be there .	4368
0	this place is a joke . the staff are too busy talking to each other and when they finally get around to assisting you , they show no patience , knowledge of their products or interest in making a sale .	4368
0	visiting local vapor stores has become a recent habit of mine when i travel . this past weekend i thought i 'd visit pink spot vapors while i was in vegas . girl that assisted me acted as if i was bothering her by asking questions and my wanting to try various flavors . perhaps she did n't like helping me nice i was n't a local . the juice i got was okay but i certainly would n't mail order it but it was n't bad . the places attitude towards customers was unimpressive . like i say perhaps they do n't like dealing with out of towners .	4368
0	i 'm electing to give pink spot , 1 star for their horrible customer service . i received a text message from their automated system , congratulating me on being the winner of a $ 100 dollar pink spot gift card . upon arriving to their location i was told that the text message was a mistake , and even thought i came all the way from across town , that they did n't have to honor it what a joke of a business .	4368
0	there juice is too expensive and customer service is horrible . they seem to not know products very well . on to the next shop .	4368
0	pink spot ... ..very dissatisfied with the juice . over priced and under flavored . the lack of flavor and itchy throat makes me believe they are taking short cuts and cheating customers . are they adding rubbing alcohol ?	4368
0	juice quality is terrible . only reason i went back was because i got there useless automated text messages for a free juice . thier juices look like water .	4368
1	not an artisan coffee shop but they serve fresh , strong coffee with ample breakfast/snack items -- some are even healthy ! certainly a mississagua java joint worth your time .	4369
1	service is always super great here and coffee is the best . try the vanilla bean latte with the chocolate curls its oh so yummy . this location has lots of seating with bright windows for the sun to come in . also they have plenty of yummy treats if coffee is not really your thing . go and i 'm sure you 'll enjoy !	4369
1	i like the service and friendly employees . great location . also , seating arrangement is good for small circle of friends . keep up the good work : )	4369
0	atmosphere is great . clean shop . bad service . asked for a butter pecan perfect cup during a working day and was rejected because `` it 's too much work '' . this is during non rush-hour time and no lineup . upon further questioning she also started to give me attitude .	4369
0	four stars for the atmosphere , 1 star for the beverage . i 'm kind of torn because the space was really nice , the washroom was decently clean and they had some great outdoor seating . but the apple cider i ordered tasted like hot apple water and had a thick layer of apple cider silt on the bottom , which only somewhat improved the taste when i stirred it around halfway through my cup . in the end , the quality of the product is what matters . maybe next time i 'm in the area and i want to have a nice drink on the patio , i 'll get something from the subway next door .	4369
0	this second cup is alright . it was fairly slow when i came in and the selection of desserts were n't to die for ! standard fare for a second cup and as i am not a regular did n't really feel the customer service i do at my local one . internet , as always was free .	4369
1	it 's your average walgreens . they had what we needed . it 's clean , well lit . staff was friendly . this location is 24 hours .	4370
1	i prefer this walgreens because of the friendly and knowledgeable staff . the pharmacy is helpful . but there is too much turnover in staff , however	4370
0	despite being listed as a 24 hour pharmacy , this is not , as i called at 3 am and the message said they were closed . i have not observed them being open at anytime in the morning after working night shift , the last 3 weeks of being here . it 's very unfortunate for them , as this appears to be a very busy intersection .	4370
0	i hate this walgreens pharmacy ! ! ! slow , rude pharmacy techs ! and there 's always a long `` a '' line . im thinking of calling my refills to the other one waaaaay across town . cause i really do n't like this one . corner of happy and healthy my ass !	4370
1	service was extremely quick and professional ! gary did everything he could to try and help me after my car broke down . best experience i 've had with any tow truck company	4371
1	gary was great ! i was in a hurry to catch a flight and had to get the car to the mechanic quickly . they were prompt , as promised , and very professional . i have a lowered sports car and gary was very careful getting the car on the flatbed .	4371
0	their driver caused a fatal accident on the i17 southbound out of flaggstaff on sunday june 19 .	4371
0	the previous review 14 days ago is incorrect . it was not this towing company , it was 1st class auto transport .	4371
1	great service and fair price . we received several quotes for our tree , some almost double what aron charged . he recommended we take down the tree since it was a hazard and from start to clean up they took down a 20 ft tree in 40 min .	4372
1	aron 's tree service did a great job for me this morning . they showed up on time , trimmed all trees as requested , cleaned up the mess and price was the same as quoted ! what more can you ask for ? i will definitely use them again .	4372
0	do not trust these people ! jennifer ur horrible at ur job ! ! ! u quote people over a picture ( even though we asked u `` are u sure u dont wan na see it first ? `` ) ..then run away from the job as when ur people are about to cut it ! ... and not answer ur phone ? ? ? ? ? very unprofessional and i hope u get blacklisted ! ! ! 0 out of 5 stars , not 1 ( but i had to put a star to send this so no other people can be ur victim ) ! ! ! ! ! !	4372
0	the business owner wrote back about being truthful ? how funny that a business who quote one price + turn around and double that price , the day of service . in the consumer world it 's call ( switch and bait ) then have the nerve to reply to a review talking about being truthful . lmao . whose lying ? what should i do , embarrass them by posting our conversation and the pricing of the competitor ?	4372
1	i feel like sharing wax stories online is a bit revealing but ... bare with me ! this was my first time ( getting waxed ) and i could n't have been more surprised ! painless obviously it is n't , they are in the business of pulling hair here , but one small breath and it 's nothing ! quick and easy . the reason i did n't give this place a full 5 stars is the sales driven approach . i 'm all for employees getting a percentage of what they help sell but whoa , a bit overboard . that said , i will be back !	4373
1	awesome manager and staff . i rudely forgot the ladies name but thankfully they save all that ahahha . ive gone to a different location before but not any more . this one is fantastic .	4373
1	let just start off saying linzy was amazing ! she did an awesome job on my brows . looking forward to my next appointment ! ( :	4373
1	sandra is the best wax specialist i have ever been to ! she is extremely fast and efficient ! never felt so smooth in my life : )	4373
1	i go to linzy for my brows and brazilian , she is amazing ! ! she 's so professional and makes my brows look exactly how i like them !	4373
1	i like this place as it 's convenient and the girls are friendly and attentive . i 've used different ones and i 'm happy with the resold . i even bought one of their package .	4373
1	rachel is my tech , and she is amazing ! ! i recommend everyone to give her a try . she 's extremely professional and makes you feel comfortable ! !	4373
1	came and got a brazilian . i got a good deal for a first time client . while they did try to sell me some of the stuff that they used , when i declined , they did n't seem to push it . they also use the wax that does n't require strips which makes it quicker and less `` sticky '' afterward . plus , there are sanitary ( which you got ta appreciate when they are spreading wax over your nether regions ) . no double-dipping of a stick into the wax- i always prefer when they do that . i 'll be back .	4373
0	first time being to this location . great personality from my waxer ( amazing woman ) but my brows are uneven . such a cold greeting from the receptionist as well . would n't recommend anyone if they want to go there for facial waxing . go to tempe location .	4373
0	i 'm not going to say much other than the front desk lady was completely rude , i felt like she was yelling at me and not to mention she never gave me my 5 points for my referral that my wax specialist specifically asked for her to do . i think name was brianna . i do n't remember , i will not be coming back fo this location .	4373
0	so i went in with my mom for her appointment and i was sitting by the front desk . the next thing i hear is continuous foul language from the lady at the desk screaming at her computer ! not appropriate for the business !	4373
0	i am very disappointed with the brazilian i received today . when i got home i noticed there were several patches of hair still there . i feel like i wasted $ 50 , and am now embarrassed by how it looks down there . again , very disappointed .	4373
0	i used to come here all the time only because my sisters and mother and i would come here to see evelyn . if evelyn was n't at this location we would of stopped coming ! the people are rude up front . i 've gotten my eyebrows waxed by others before and these girls should n't be trusted with tweezers or scissors . when evelyn left the staff would n't refund us for anything even though we were unhappy with our wax services . nobody told us where evelyn went and told us she left the company and ca n't say where she went ... i go to a different ewc now and they are phenomenal ! avoid this location at all cost !	4373
0	i 've gone here 4-5 times as a back up from when my regular esty is on vacation or unavailable and never had a 100 % satisfied visit ... uneven brows today ... so frustrating..	4373
0	do n't enjoy going here . office lady is kind of rude to say the least . never satisfied with my eyebrows after .	4373
0	i want to note i did get a refund on my wax pass , and on the services i had for that day but only for my lip . unfortunately for me i suffer with acne and when i have a break out i scar . i now have several scars on my upper lip and my eye brow areas . i am so devastated by this . my skin was just starting to clear up and these will take weeks to fade ... .	4373
1	dominic gives great customer service . broke my phone face glass . dreaded having to replace it as i thought i would have to leave it behind for hours . not with dominic on the job ! he replaced the glass while i was in the shop in 10 minutes . now i 'm back on my way lickety split . glad i bought my phone here within 4 miles of my home . go wireless !	4374
1	i came in looking for an upgrade on my iphone 6s . not knowing what to do and stuff ... dominic came in and took care of me . walked me through the whole upgrade process and it was fast and painless . i would definitely recommend dominic if you decide to come into this location .	4374
1	i have been to this location a couple of times . there is hardly ever a wait to speak to someone . i recently upgraded my phone . david was a huge help . the staff has always been very professional and courtious . thanks for the excellent service . i highly recommend this store !	4374
1	i have come into this location a few times and each time michael has helped resolve my issues with my phones . michael always has a smile on his face and finds a solution quickly . i like that he is honest with me ... if he does n't know the answer he will find out . michael is my families go to verizon guy ! !	4374
0	the workers rather socialize than help customers let alone acknowledge them . poor customer service .	4374
0	worst customer service ever . the clerk was very rude and would not help solve the problem . just want me to spend more money on things i did not need .	4374
0	the staff here are rude right off the back . i 'd avoid coming to an authorized retail store and just go to a verizon store . bought a phone and i returned . they never gave me back my upgrade and so i have a same phone that i ca n't get my upgrade back on . avoid this place .	4374
0	pretty upset . i 've been having problems with people having a hard time hearing me on my phone . the guy suggested a new sim card but said i needed to pay for one . i asked , if that was n't the problem was i going to be reimbursed ? no , of course not , and the problem on my phone was not fixed . was not until a couple hours later we talked to an employee at an actual verizon store that said we had been got . sim cards are free . avoid this place .	4374
1	xoxoxo woohoo ! as good as it gets ! xoxoxo	4375
1	thrilled with the choices and prices of the swim suits . customer service between fitting room and cashier was top notch - attentive , helpful , friendly and very service oriented . prices on items was the frosting on the cake . highly recommend .	4375
0	good store , great deals but there can be more on the sales floor . the staff can be a little more friendly . seems like you disturbed their day . i asked a few ladies for help and the attitude was like ughh . the men are gentlemen .	4375
0	i have always been a fan of burlington 's deals , however i will not be shopping at this one again . i went to return a belt ... pretty simple . instead , i stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of burlington buying/putting things on layaway . it took three other staff to help her out . there were no words said to me except `` hold on '' . i was pissed . when the lady was finally done , the employee at the service asked `` what do you want ? '' serious help is needed there ! if you work in the area of `` customer service '' i think you should have some .	4375
1	i have conducted business transactions inside and out over the last few months . everyone has been courteous , knowledgeable and friendly each time . big thumbs up . p.s . the only time i had a bad experience is when some lady was blocking me and another customer from getting to the drivethru with her big ol ' suv ... .idk what she was doing , but we both were honking for at least 2-3 minutes before she would outta the way ... but this was not the fault of chase so did not deduct any stars .	4376
1	this bank is the best one i 've been too ever ! the customer service is spectacular ! the bankers are so friendly and will help you with whatever you need ! i recommend christian if you need help with banking or anything that comes to mind !	4376
0	low staff ! ! ! ! every time i come in i waste 45 minutes to an hour trying to do something that should only take no more than 5 minutes ! sometimes only one teller while the other one is counting money and 13 people in line . really ?	4376
0	i have a couple of accounts with this bank . of the branches close to me this one seems to have the shortest waits . the lines for the tellers do n't seem too bad but most transactions involving bankers still seem to take forever . sort of a 2.5 . and not worthy of a round up .	4376
1	this is a really good walgreens . it is very large , wide open floor layout . they have a great selection of items as compared to some of the other walgreens stores in central phoenix and south scottsdale . good selection of frozen items , liquor , stationary & cards , as well as household and seasonal items . worth the extra few miles to a walgreens if you are in the vicinity !	4377
1	the walgreens pharmacy manager , elaine , is excellent and helped me with insurance issues when i was on cobra coverage . she went above and beyond when no other pharmacy would help me . great make up consultant at this walgreens also .	4377
0	update : i have pnuemonia and they 've screwed up my prescriptions again . never . ever . again .	4377
0	pharmacy staff here was incredibly rude . i 've been going to different walgreens pharmacies for years . the gentleman must have felt `` safe '' from behind his glass window . i have never been treated so poorly by a pharmacy staff before .	4377
1	so excited about this store opening up right by my neighborhood . everyone here is so friendly . they always have plenty of registers open . the parking spots are huge . what 's not to love about this place ! ? i 've always been a teeter fan but i might have switched over now ... ?	4378
1	very clean store and everyone is helpful . p.s . you can get any flavor publix ice cream made into a cake	4378
0	beautiful store nice layout but they are higher on every item . i have been in many timed and there is only a hand full of customers . i really hope they can complete here .	4378
0	unless you 're interested in food poisoning , you may want to avoid this new location . just threw out $ 40 worth of wraps and chicken strips that were raw - not undercooked but raw - inside . disgusting !	4378
1	this place is dark , divey , cash only , and most importantly walking distance from my house . the drinks are cheap , and well made , i agree with the posts about aurora , shes the lady , but all of the bartenders i 've met so far are great . there are hand written signs all over the bar , there pool , tiny bathrooms , and when i 'm hungry i can walk over to fry bread house and grab a bite to bring back with me . and there a juke box . i 'm a sucker for a juke box .	4379
1	this is a quintessential local dive bar with cheap beer and cheap pool . the locals are all friendly . it is dark and dim inside . perfect for escaping the sun during the day for a quick drink . be careful , you may end up chatting the day away and come out at night !	4379
1	i love this bar ! such a nice break from all the over priced places that have popped up all over central phoenix . just a fun place to go !	4379
0	place has not been cleaned since 1972 . decore from the same era . full of drunken slobs . smells terrible .	4379
0	this is the worst dive bar in phoenix . smells like a sewer ! so , you can imagine where the ice comes from . native american owned , it as the same owners as the fry bread company . patrons are non native trailer park trash patrons who are rude and trouble makers . do not go here unless you are with a police officer .	4379
0	dark , smelly hole in the wall . no windows , not clean . would not recommend . seems like it 's dragging down the neighborhood .	4379
1	i have seen dr. ackerman for several years and i have always been pleased with dr.ackerman and her staff . as a physician , i can be very critical of my own profession . dr. ackerman passes my tests with honors . she is direct yet compassionate . she has always been prompt and efficient . yet she is also thorough and she listens attentively . she answers questions without hedging if she knows the answer , yet is not afraid to say , `` i do n't know , but i will find out '' if she does n't . all of that builds confidence and trust . trust is what i require of my physicians and she has earned it .	4380
1	dr. li is great ! he was very thorough , and took the time to answer all of my questions and address all of my concerns . the staff was also very friendly and accommodating , and the wait time was minimal . overall a very good experience ! definitely recommend !	4380
0	dr. ackerman seems knowledgable yet uninterested . the whole office staff seems to have a poor attitude . i believe that comes from the top down . not the way to do things for sure .	4380
0	i really love dr kessler , but the office staff is always so rude we 've decided to not go there anymore . they act like it 's an inconvenience to even schedule an appointment , so better to go where they at least act like they care .	4380
1	awesome venue ! small enough that no matter where u r standing u have a decent view of stage/performance . saw the english beat here and we loved it . servers are all beautiful young girls , bring your a game and your confidence with you ladies	4381
1	this is a pretty awesome new venue . i 've been a few times just for drinks and i also went to see steve aoki in february for his neon future experience tour . drinks are reasonably priced . i like that the bar is floating instead of backed up against a well . allows for faster service time ! the lights and sound system are pretty killer . the venue definitely did n't skimp and rely on acts bringing in their own stuff . awesome for a show !	4381
1	this is a great live music venue with amazing . acoustics and sound systems . it has two floors with an upper patio area . staff and security are helpful and friendly . the bathrooms have an attendant , an interesting scottsdale touch . drink prices are spending though . $ 8/beer . saw the english beat , great 80s band . they had two opening bands so it was a while for the headliner but the openers were good as well . i ca n't wait to come here again .	4381
1	saw a concert here . great concept for a venue in the middle of scottsdale . the staff is extremely friendly . drinks were easy to get . the bar tenders are fabulous and fast . the set up of the stage was perfect so was n't hard at all to see from any seat in the house .	4381
1	this is the guy ... .. meet george harbison ... this security guard is so accommodating , respectful and i would trust him to look after my teenage daughter attending concerts at the live wire in scottsdale az . best security guard ever ! ! ! thank you george . you really made our concerts so much better . i ca n't believe you always remember us . unbelievable ! ! !	4381
1	we enjoyed a great concert last night at livewire . livewire is in busy , beautiful old town scottsdale . the area has many clubs and restaurants within walking distance . prepare to walk if you do n't find a spot across the block like we did . the id takers at the front were friendly . we had a beer from the bar and watched the concert in a dance floor setting . the sound system is very nice . there are tables and seating up top too . april is our celebration of love month for our birthdays and our wedding anniversary . you can bet y & t is playing somewhere in arizona ! ! what a great show !	4381
1	la la love this spot for live music and networking events . came here to watch the black bottom lighters . service is amazing even during a crazy concert and drinks were reasonable . tons of space to get your groove on , i highly recommend getting a table so you get the best view on the second floor overlooking the crowd . love the decor and definitely would be back for another event !	4381
1	i experienced this place for the first time last week and it 's a very cute little club . the layout is similar to the marquee but a fair bit smaller and definitely more stylish ( check out the guitar chandelier over the bar near the front door ) . drinks were what you expect at concert venues and my double was definitely a generous pour . as it 's old town , parking is a little hairy but i recommend parking in the galleria garage . it 's quite close and beats playing chicken with other concert-goers trying to find parking too .	4381
1	had a blast with my wife . drinks are pricy but they do n't shy away from what they 're pouring ! ! ! dj flavor got everyone going and the hype man had fun with it . saw lyfe jennings and it was a blast . great venue . plan on coming back soon	4381
1	actually quite impressed with this place . went on a friday night to see testament . i was appreciative that the bouncers did n't act stupid and shove people around for moshing at a thrash show . the bartenders were all nice , it was way easy to get a drink , the bathrooms are well kept , with attendants in them to provide shit . the place has multiple walk up bars , and hardwood floors . the stage was a decent size and the sound was killer , very new !	4381
1	unlike the idiot who wrote the first review . i 've actually been to livewire . went for the opening night az foothills party . amazing ! ! ! simply a game changer in scottsdale . lighting and sound like nothing you 've ever seen with a warm vintage welcoming decor .	4381
1	this concept was needed in downtown scottsdale . the layout , decor , sound and staff are amazing . we are very excited that they are booking acts from all genres . they already have had great acts like jared and the mill , jeff bridges and the english beat . a ton more have already been announced . this venue will bring a whole new demographic of people to the area that will experience the great nightclubs and eateries in the area that they would not normally be exposed to . great job !	4381
1	this is an amazing venue . i wish there were more like it in the metro phoenix area . the sound was amazing . great drinks , reasonable prices . very excited to see more shows here !	4381
1	my only experience here was in february of 2016 when i went with some friends to see steel panther . the venue itself is fine . it 's rather small and cozy . the sound is pretty good as well considering we were seeing a band like steel panther . there are two levels and both levels have a bar . we sat in the upper level in a `` private '' booth and it was perfect . its location is good in terms of being in the heart of old town but parking sucks . if you are considering seeing a band you like here , i say go for it !	4381
1	they have a huge dance floor , attentive bartenders , and a lively crowd . : ) it 's two stories with vip booths on both levels and the dance floor on the first . the bathrooms were nice and clean and the bar is a wrap around and pretty large . the crowd on the saturday night we were there was in their early 20 's with some in their 30 's and 40 's . there was no cover charge for us two ladies . so all in all , no complaints . 4 stars because it does n't have that wow factor that mint or maya has . : /	4381
1	this place understands how to make a nice concert venue . the building was well unkept this included bathrooms and the room in general . there truly is not a bad seat in the house if your favorite band comes here you wo n't be disappointed sound and acoustic quality were good and tickets were not overpriced . the only challenge with the venue is parking . prepare to search for street parking or to go to one of the close by garages .	4381
1	my first time here was halloween 2016 with party favors playing . this is absolutely the place to be ! live music , tons of people , beautiful women and the energy is great ! huge twist on the normal old town spots and will definitely be a repeat customer !	4381
1	cool venue for sure . the middle is open and their are couches and tables on the side . they ave a vip section upstairs . we had a blast at the uso heroes jam . drinks are expensive though and for some weird reason the women 's bathroom stalls are built in such a way you can not exit the stall . i ca n't imagine what this looks like with ladies who have had a few too many . they must find a lot of cell phones flushed down the toilet . ha ! rock on !	4381
1	went here last night to watch the national championship game ( go buckeyes ! ) very spacious and it 's connected to bottled blonde next door . their tv was huge and had the clearest picture the sound system was booming and there are 2 bars on each side of the building and they have a balcony with tables and seating as well . it was a really nice venue that i had no clue was there . definitely will check more events that go on here .	4381
1	one of the better local venues - new , nice , clean and not a dump ( whose idea was it that music venues had to be dumps ) . the sound is great . lights are great . the stage is high enough everyone can see . lounge areas as well as the floor . the couches are a nice touch , but who wants to sit when the band is rockin ' ? the only drawback is parking . it 's in the middle of the night clubs so you are competing with that scene .	4381
1	went to my first show at this place ( steel panther ) and it 's a great spot for music . setup really good ! acoustics are great and it is an intimate venue where you really feel up close to the performance ! definitely worth checking out . only knock i have is they only serve rock star energy drinks vs. red bull .	4381
1	we had a party of 12 in the the vip section for the nf therapy tour . great seats . every single employee there was absolutely amazing . so nice and respectful , they went above and beyond . thank you . definitely will be back .	4381
1	went there for nye . great club with plenty of space for dancing , mingling , and lounging . i liked the stage and lighting . music was very good . i would definitely go there again .	4381
0	live wire refuses to serve water to its patrons . they only offer bottled water for $ 5 . this seems like a dangerous and awful policy where people are consuming alcohol and dancing . arizona requires venues to serve free water if they also serve liquor . i 'm not sure if this applies to clubs ( i 'm sure it does ) ... .so they 're probably breaking the law also . i was disappointed with this venue and wo n't be returning .	4381
0	nice place but they did n't give me a glass of water when we asked for one . they sell bottles for $ 5 but no glass of water . that 's bullshit . if someone was the dd and wanted water , nope . got ta buy it . if someone is very thirsty because arizona is very hot ! nope sorry you got ta buy a bottle for $ 5 . if some one is drunk and wants to sober up , and wants some water , sry ! got ta pay ! ! i guess that is scottsdale for ya !	4381
0	this is my first time today in this club , i have been here fore i ver three years in america i have never faced a racist comment or a racist act but in this club it showed me how racist people can be . this is unfortunately ridiculous i 'll never ever go there again ! ! ! ! the body guards and the people who work there are so racist be careful ! ! ! !	4381
0	complaint ... i overheard the manager , tyler is his name , speaking very poorly to his employees . i do n't think he noticed that a customer was nearby listening in on how disrespectfully the manager was talking to his security member . no manager should ever have to scream and curse at an employee the way he did , escpecially when a customer is standing right by you . how unprofessional.. to make matters worse , my friend had said she saw two girls doing cocaine in the bathroom stall !	4381
0	just went here on 4/2/15 to see puddle of mudd . paid $ 15 extra to have balcony access vip . what a waste ! people in the boxes stand in front of you and you can not see a thing ! ! ! had to go downstairs in the 'cheap ' seats just to see the show . to top it off , they played 5 songs and walked off . do n't waste your time or money here .	4381
0	i have not reviewed any place on yelp before , but felt this place deserved it . seeing the two other people who have posted negatively about their experience at this venue last night reinforced my decision . terrible bar service , even when it was slow . got blatantly ignored several times by bartenders who were hanging out with their friends instead of working . finally got the drinks and they were a bad pour . refused to serve water . was shocked . who does that ? ! ? will not return , nor will my friends ...	4381
0	security was a joke . the bouncers were awful . i 'm done going to this club .	4381
0	the venue itself is pretty nice ... but ... after spending $ 40 to get in , who knows how much on drinks , they would n't serve me a glass of water . they only have bottled water for $ 6/each , which is pretty ridiculous when a mixed drink is $ 7 . when i asked the bartender why , she said `` it 's part of our contract , we can only sell water . '' it 's a shame because the venue is very nice , but the service is definitely poor .	4381
0	what kind of bar wo n't serve you water it 120 degrees outside ... . this place should get shutdown ... . i spent $ 100 and they wo n't give me water to sober up	4381
0	terrible service . went for a charity event . staff was rude . would not recommend for any event . could not even get one drink after 30 mins of waiting . zero stars	4381
0	the good 1 ) it 's a beautiful room 2 ) the sound is great 3 ) the sight lines are unimpeded ( even at the bar ! ) . the bad 1 ) why are the bartendresses forced to dress in extremely exploitative attire ? ( pro tip : this is not conducive to actual/real rock and roll ) 2 ) you 're in scottsdale so you 're about 10 miles from anyone who actually `` rocks '' 3 ) the booking is meh at best	4381
0	these people are cheap . i spent 200 dollars and they refuse to give me a water . natalie especially would not give me water . i hopec they rot in hell .	4381
0	i ordered $ 18 worth of drinks and asked for a glass of water because it was over 110 degrees outside . it turns out that they wo n't give out glasses of water at this bar -- even if you are buying $ 18 of ( watered down ) drinks -- and will only sell you a bottle of fiji water for $ 5 . fuckers	4381
0	they refused to give me a glass of free water . i went there for a concert of my favorite band , screamed my head off , and got super thirsty at the end ... as any normal person would . being a concert venue , i would think it would be a priority to keep people hydrated . in my opinion , that is horrible customer service and a greedy way to get money for something that people need at a concert . i 'll never go here again if i have a choice . and i hope the band i saw considers a chiller venue next time .	4381
0	this has consistently been the worst place to see a concert in the entire state . so bad , in fact , that after only 2 years , they have had to close their doors . good riddance !	4381
0	update : that they try to remove posts which negatively effect their rating . they refuse to serve water here , which is ridiculous , and i see lots of people complain and then their post gets removed .	4381
0	security very very rude . the manager was nice but unfortunately the security was so horrible it completely ruined my experience . they were very strict and rude about it	4381
0	when you get denied for a cup of water because they 're a `` concert venue '' and you are required to buy a bottle of water ... . after getting profiled by the bartender . she looked me up and down and immediately said no . not cool .	4381
0	horrible experience was in line for concert at 6 when doors were . suppose to open the line didnt start moving till 7:15 , an explanation as to why we were standing in 95 degree temperature would have been nice . i asked to go to the bathroom and was told no . you truly lost my business .	4381
0	this place sucked . my husband and i came here to see bone thugs-n-harmony . we waited outside for 45 minutes after the ticket said the doors were open . then listen to the stupid groups . we paid to see bone thugs . there was no mention of these other groups on the tickets . then waited 1 hour till bone actually showed up on stage . wo n't ever come back to this place to see a concert or party here at all . i really wish i could leave 0 stars . i would not recommend this place to any of my friends .	4381
0	over 300 people are standing online waiting to get in . i think part of the excitement is having people to wait in line for an hour after the time on the tickets . ticket time says 6 but they are not opening the door until 7pm . so many unhappy people in line standing . it would have been nice to go in and at least buy a drink instead of standing in 95 degree heat . so if you come to this venue . call ahead and confirm the time the concert starts so you do n't have to suffer like everyone here is doing tonight ... .	4381
0	if i could give less than a one star review i would . but that 's not an option . the amount of disrespect and degrading of a woman i have felt from this establishment is embarrassing . the security laughed in my face , and joked about how we had no authority , even though we planned the entire event of sammy adams coming to scottsdale	4381
0	arrived at venue around 5:30 for brian culbertson concert and doors were to open at 6:00pm and did not open until 7 : 15 which is ridiculous . an announcement are something should have been made but will not be back and will not recommend to anyone .	4381
1	best coffee and the best customer service i 've ever seen . they had me taste my coffee to make sure they got it sweet enough and that i liked the new flavor i was trying . service was quick and super friendly . and the coffee beats the hell out of any coffee chain . my new go-to .	4382
1	kona is a great neighborhood coffee spot ! from frozen flavored drinks to a black drip coffee , everything i 've had here has been wonderful . it 's cheap and the employees will always take the time to help you decide on something if you 're unsure . my favorite is a toddy ( cold brewed coffee ) that is vanilla macadamia flavor . both drive through and walking in have been short wait times . i highly recommend this coffee shop .	4382
1	the coffee here was so yummy ! ! i 've been back twice now . the staff was super friendly and sweet . definitely recommend this cute little coffee shop ! also convenient that they have a drive thru !	4382
1	this is a great neighborhood coffee place . my baby and i cruise through the drive thru on a regular basis and the coffee is great . however the young people who take my order are fantastic- friendly , enthusiastic and always courteous . hoping to see this place around for a while !	4382
1	great mom n pop coffee shop ! great prices , good coffee and very friendly service . the drive-thru is a plus !	4382
1	love love love this little place . the drinks are a great treat . i did n't get the gals name but she was super helpful and friendly . rare to find awesome customer service these days and she was wonderful ! love the hawaii vibes	4382
0	afternoon coffee - staff went to the refrigerator , pulled out some pre-made coffee from the morning , reheated it using the frothing wand , and presented it as hot coffee to go . she actually did this . she actually did this . she actually did this . turns out it is not her idea but that of the owner . this speaks volumes about what sort of coffee shop this is . on top of that , there is virtually no seating here . only one employee working , so things move slowly . and they did n't have kona coffee to drink on my visit , as it is only served occasionally - at kona 13 .	4382
0	the service was fast , but i have to be honest , the tea was horrible . i asked a lot of questions about the coffee , flavors and teas and decided the tea would be best to try . it tasted like lipton , which is garbage . it was not good . maybe the coffee is better . i love kona coffee and was quite disappointed .	4382
0	drinks are really good , i 've had smoothies and coffees here . good variety of flavors to choose from . service during the week is great , the young man that works there is friendly , smiles and is a people person . today was a different story . the young lady was very close to being rude . not friendly , did n't smile at all and acted like i was bothering her . she will be the reason i do n't come back . for the same amount of money i can go to starbucks and get great service . who cares if the wait is longer .	4382
0	we love local coffee shops and we , but we wont be back . the kona coffee tasted like really bad gas station coffee . i would prefer a cappuccino from qt than what we received . we ordered a large coffee with macadamia syrup on the recommendation of the woman taking our order . the coffee may be good kona but it wont taste good if you dont know how to make it . and from watching them work , it looks like they need more instruction . now to find some gum to take away this foul taste .	4382
0	i paid over $ 4 for warm cream ... i could not taste the flavoring , and definitely not the coffee . i went home and brewed my own coffee to pour into it just to make it drinkable . i wo n't risk wasting time and money there again .	4382
0	overpriced , overpriced , overpriced . i use to go to the one in tempe . i later realized that they 're drinks are overpriced . the price you pay for an energy drink is way too much. $ 6 for an energy is too expensive . the same energy drink they give you ; you can get from circle k or walmart . ( i 'll insert a picture below . ) also their lemonade you can simply make at home . ( i 'll insert the pictures below ) .	4382
1	tyler sheehy was awesome ! ! i went to the store on friday with my laptop that had frozen without a reservation . i did not have to wait more then 3 minutes and tyler resolved my issue and taught me a few things ! ! ! what an awesome store and employee ! ! !	4383
1	been here twice in the last month , first time with out an appointment , second time with an appointment scheduled before hand . both experiences were great . employees are upfront and clear about everything , you know exactly what your options are , no `` maybe '' or `` should be '' like when you go to your cellular carrier . with apple you get what you pay for so the service is worth the wait ! go get some pizza at sbarro & watch a movie at amc : )	4383
1	apple store in northlake is now open ! was so much fun to be a part of the grand opening this morning !	4383
1	i came into this apple store after having made a genius bar appt . to have my iphone six plus looked at/fixed as it had been screwing up , upon entering the store i was greeted almost immediately , i told them my appointment name and time and was very quickly helped . the associate that helped me was great , very kinda , and very very helpful . he acknowledged my issues and they replaced my iphone as there was no in-store solution to my issue . i am overall highly pleased with my experience .	4383
1	standard apple customer experience . happy people greeting you , asking if you need help and not being in your face or hanging on unless you need it . the store was clean , stylish and consistent across all other apple stores .	4383
1	the apple store in north lake was very helpful to get my iphone out of lost mode . wait time was not bad at all even though it 's was crowded . thank you to the apple store for all your help you did .	4383
1	each and every experience i 've had with the staff of the northlake apple store has been extraordinary . the first macbook pro i purchase was a `` i need it now '' issue . they stayed with me 45mins past closing to get the right setup for me . now , they are giving me the best support of any computer company i 've ever worked with . so grateful to the staff of northlake apple store .	4383
1	service could always be better when i go into this location but today i received exceptional customer service from jason , very glad he was able to assist me	4383
1	if you 're going make an appointment here , i definitely recommend asking for daniel ! i came in with no appointment but he was able to fit me in and assist me with my macbook . he was working on 3 ( including me ) other people at the same time ( which did not bother me because i did n't have an appointment ) and was still very patient and friendly while helping me . daniel definitely knows what he 's doing here and i will for sure ask for him in the near future if it has anything to deal with my apple products !	4383
1	love this store so much . the employees are all so amazing ! it 's amazing how many people are staffed at one point . i ca n't imagine what it 's like during an iphone or product launch . must be nuts !	4383
1	recently had the logic board on my 2012 macbook pro go out . called tech support on friday evening , they scheduled me with an appointment at this store for sunday morning . had not visited this location before . was pleasantly surprised at the prompt and timely service . even though the store was busy , the appointment time was on the mark . the computer was inspected and the repair was completed by thursday night ... picked up on friday . everyone from phone service to in store was very professional and nice . i would wholeheartedly recommend this store . great experience .	4383
1	in customer service industry , if someone is friendly & helpful , they will attract customers . in this high tech stuff , i rather have a good teacher than a good worker . thanks to braulio & sly for their professional assistance , extra friendly & patience when handling our adult customers . keep up your good work . indeed this apple store is full of apple friendly staff . they do work as a team to help when others are busy . btw , sorry keep coming back to this store because they are so helpful .	4383
1	i had to stand there waiting for service for several minutes , but everyone was busy with customers . i took my new trackpad i purchased with my imac and the replaced it with a magic mouse because i did n't like the track pad . good service .	4383
1	awesome did n't have an appointment but got in to see an associate fast ! she did say it was the best time of day to stop in ! resolved my issue quickly and on my way . make the drive it 's not far from south park ! will return to this location ! !	4383
1	i have been to many apple stores over the years . from new york on down the east coast . the staff in the northlake mall apple store are the greatest . they are friendly and responsive . it is a great experience for me every time i go to the genius bar or go for my one-on-one . the products and knowledge are the same in most apple stores but the service is exemplary in northlake mall , charlotte .	4383
1	what is the point in requiring customers to make an appointment if you ca n't schedule effectively to stay on schedule..	4383
1	bryn and braulio gave us the best customer service you could ask for . my mom 's phone 's screen was broke . she needed to back it up . they did everything in their power to try to back it up without having to fix the screen . no luck . the screen did get fixed and comped . these 2 gentlemen are really great guys and a real valuable asset to apple .	4383
1	excellent service , genius bar is very helpful . nothing but respect for the guys and gals at apple .	4383
1	location , location , location . and what a difference square footage can make to a shopping experience . now i do n't have to drive 20+ miles to get to southpark from lake norman . once you get there you 're greeted with a zoo of gawkers and an understaffed store . no problems here at northlake . excellent customer service and plenty of breathing room for the gawkers and customers . depending on your technological background , you may find the specialists lacking in their product info . no matter how your feelings are about apple products , you can be assured that you will receive excellent customer service even if you 're gawking .	4383
1	this time was fast service usually even with an appointment you have to wait 30-60 min	4383
1	i am grateful to have an apple store in the north of charlotte . i went in , had the associate answer my questions , and provide the corporate discount so that i could purchase my mac right then and there . setup assistance was a bit slow , as it seems one person was working with at least four customers . the store needs to step up on this end as many have questions about their new devices . this was a great experience and the store was not overly crowded on the saturday that i visited .	4383
0	this place is awful . not just because its a terrible company but i tried to buy a battery for a macbook and they told me i need to make an appointment in advance ! an appointment to order a battery ! are you serious ? i knew the exact model , probably the most common model that should be kept on hand buy the `` genius '' squad . worst company ever	4383
0	so to exchange an extension cord that stopped working , it talk 45-1 hour to replace one if you have a warranty . very frustrating . i should of been in and out in 5-10 mins tops . apple store need a better system .	4383
0	not a very impressive location . apple should send a secret shopper here . the store was a mess and we had 3 people approach us . we told them that we were there to buy a computer . asked a few basic questions , which no one could answer . an employee at one point blurted out `` my best advice is to just get whatever you want . '' my wife started laughing so we left .	4383
0	after hearing that apple has screwed it 's battery and would replace it , i went to the apple store ( not a third party facility ) to get the battery replaced . was told they had would have to order it an it would be in about a week after 2 weeks we went back and now they say it 's going to be another 2 week before it would be in . boy the androids are looking better every day .	4383
0	the hosts are terrible at signing people in . rude and arrogant . the fat guy in glasses and the prissy blonde hair african kid need a lesson in customer service .	4383
0	had an extremely unpleasant time following initial entrance to the store . was kindly greeted at the door which was followed by rude service from the staff while trying to purchase airpods . did not want to use apple pay and was extremely difficult trying to use regular debit card . ordered online from in the store and chose to wait versus buying then due to the rude nature of the individual helping me .	4383
0	the stores extremely crowded and slow . people will not weigh on you . they wo n't even look at you . i count at least 20 workers on the floor and they do n't pay attention to anyone . the worst customer service you 'll ever get will be at an apple store	4383
0	really awful service . waited and waited and waited . an hour and a half . even when they were n't busy we still could n't be helped . awful .	4383
0	came to the store today at 2:40pm to get a pair of powerbeats looked at ... put my name on the list . got a text at 3:30 saying they were almost ready for me . it 's now almost 5pm and i finally went up to the manager or at least the guy taking names and told them i had gotten a text well over an hour ago . he told me `` sorry , '' i had `` slipped through the cracks '' and they lost my reservation . so now i 'm supposed to be next up but regardless , horrible customer service .	4383
0	this apple store is located in a mall that is totally unsafe for the family . i finally made it in just to be hassled with there inefficient and poorly thought out scheduling system . very inconvenient the apple store will gladly take up half of your day .	4383
0	possibly the worst customer service i 've ever experienced . there were lots of free employees but they were directing everyone to one person . after explaining the problem , i was looked at like i was stupid because my phone was frozen . i asked for a factory reset and was told a technician could help me in two and a half hours . i got a cord and fixed my phone myself . i hope i never have to go back to the apple store .	4383
0	ordered a battery from this location and was told it would take 3 days . 3 weeks later i receive a phone call from an apple representative in texas saying it was never processed because the store did n't enter my phone information . the more i read the reviews from this location , i see its become a trend . this is not an employee issue , this is a management and leadership issue . zero accountability and full of excuses .	4383
0	the worse customer service i have seen from apple in quite some time . i was told i would have a 20 minute wait to buy a new iphone but after about 45 minutes the lady i met with was rude as fuck to my mom was there to buy a new iphone . my mom told her that she wanted a 4.7 inch iphone 8 and tried to sell her a 7 . she was rude during the whole icloud process set up and once we got home my mom had realized she was given a 7 and not an 8 like she asked . i will definitely request someone else besides her if i have to ever come back .	4383
0	this place makes you want to toss your apple device and declare team samsung . there is always unhelpful customer service reps and long # fillintheblank wait times for actually help . for screen repair please make this place your last resort or any other repair ; if so i highly recommend coming here just as they open at 10am . this was my second attempt to get my battery replace and was unsuccessful due to the overwhelming long wait times . sometime the most popular device is not the best device in the long run .	4383
0	ok , i love apple products but when i go onto a store and am told i can not buy their products their and have to go home and order it order it there , what is with that . why have a store . then the next couple who were a different ethnic background , were told '' oh we can order it for you in the store , would you like help over here on our computer `` ? '' ... while i am still standing there ... .well that is nuts . apple you need to work on customer service	4383
0	my wife came in to get someone to look at her phone for water damage . they told her the phone was shot and shooed her away . luckily the at & t store was more willing to help . phones fine .	4383
0	terrible costumer service . was given conflicting information by several different employees . wasted 3 hours there today and 2 hours there on friday .	4383
0	not friendly and very slow service process . the one in south park mall is better . this store does n't deserve one star .	4383
0	this place sucks . $ 1100 computer . it lasted 8 months . it 's under warranty . they refused to fix it . go to f'ing he11 .	4383
0	i know it 's busy here , but all i want to do is buy a macbook air and get out of here . unfortunately i 'm waiting here 20 minutes while all the `` genius ' '' stand around watching their clients play . am i the only one wanting to buy here and they are too busy or me ? poor service..	4383
0	terrible service , store was empty maybe 5 customers and maybe about 11 employees some where just standing around talking to each other , and they said they could not help me until next week . like seriously ! i would understand if it was busy but it was n't apple needs to do something about helping their clients who bought their products .	4383
1	great ice cream . excellent cookies n cream ! the specially made waffle cones highly recommended . friendly staff . negative ; bit pricey . would go more often if priced differently..	4384
1	their ice-cream is one of the best ones i 've ever tried . the chocolate and sweets are amazing , too - i love their dark chocolate almond clusters with dried cherries ( or cranberries ? .. ) but i 'd caution against ordering a coffee or anything from their menu like waffles unless you are in no hurry . it takes them at least 5 minutes to make 1 cup of coffee . the slowest latte services i have ever encountered . very festive-looking for each holidays . green chocolates , anyone ? : ) love this place .	4384
1	awesome variety of ice-cream flavors . a good selection of chocolate too . very helpful staff , olenka being one of them . i guess the older lady is her . there are few tables inside of you want to sit and enjoy your ice-cream . highly recommended !	4384
1	i love the ice cream bars and sandwiches here . i have only had the vegan ones but jesus lord they are great . they are so creamy that i gave one to an unsuspecting friend and he loved it and could n't tell that it was vegan ( ha , mission accomplished ) . their cakesters always look so adorable too , i ca n't wait to try more items !	4384
0	the ice cream is outstanding but the service is consistently poor . one person to run the whole operation- scoop ice cream and check out customers the end result is long wait times despite the line only being a few people deep .	4384
0	the locations all offer vegan and gluten-free ice creams , i picked up some `` vegan '' coconut ice cream at the mimico location a while back , the staff seemed pretty scattered and long story short the ice cream was most definitely not vegan and made me very ill ( being a very lactose intolerant person ) and i 've got to say i do n't think i 'll ever put full trust in vegan ice cream at an ice cream parlour again : (	4384
0	i 've never been to an ice cream parlour where they give you attitude if you ask to try more than two flavours , i was even told off by the lady behind the counter that i 'm not suppose to have more than two tries and she said it in such a belittling tone as if i was going to try the whole place empty ... to me that 's ridiculous and this could easy be solved by hiring better servers and letting your customers try more than two flavour ... their ice cream is good ( some are too sweet for my taste ) but it 's not really worth it if i ca n't even try the damn flavours ...	4384
0	my husband and i always try to support local businesses and sometimes pay a premium to do so . i was very disappointed with the service i received last time i was at sweet olenkas . i asked the sales lady if she could add some ribbon to the boxed cake i had just bought since we were taking it over for thanksgiving dinner at friends and the answer was simply `` no '' despite a wall of ribbon behind her . so disappointing . wo n't be going back . funny thing is ... sprucing up the packaging would have only helped to draw more attention to the cake ( equating to more business ) ah well . we wo n't be recommending them	4384
1	the service dept was super efficient for my oil change , and the waiting area is very comfortable . i was able to get some work done while i waited . also , neat little area with jeep retail items .	4385
1	heggs is amazing for buying a car and service . they will my family 's business for many years to come ! ! always attentive and prompt attention ! !	4385
0	hello jeremy , i know the msrp is displayed . your finance guy started at $ 5,000 over msrp on the vehicle before applying the rebates . he was trying to price gouge a customer assuming i did n't know how to do some basic research ! you could have had a customer for life had you guys just been honest .	4385
0	rip off company traded a truck in 3 mo ago , they never have paid it off , the repo guy just showed up at my house looking for it , i have called several times and let them know that i am getting letters from finance company . left messages with fiance and sales mgr with no return calls .	4385
1	i was contacting by management at culligan total water and they quickly resolved my issue . i would still strongly discourage working with the salesman , but i have the utmost respect for the management team 's quick resolution .	4386
1	our solar start up has worked with several service vendors and suppliers over the past year , most of whom have been referred to us by other small businesses . every time i hang up with total water , i say out loud , `` they have the best customer service i 've ever experienced ! '' my coworkers piped up , `` do n't keep telling us , put a recommendation online for them ! '' i highly recommend culligan total water in madison , wi . everyone i 've talked with : sales , fulfillment ordering , delivery , collections and upper management have all been fantastic . we aspire to provide this level of customer service for our clients .	4386
1	knowledgeable , friendly technicians assisted me in choosing the best products for my water . my water went from almost undrinkable with minerals that stained my laundry to clear and drinkable straight from the tap	4386
0	had a culligan water softner & reverse osmosis system in our house for many years . we recently had to replace both . although they may sell a good product , they are way overpriced . the prices they charge for replacement filters for the osmosis system are outrageous . the replacement cost for a new osmosis system was hundreds of dollars more than top of the line systems from other companies . shop around , they are really money hungry .	4386
0	took 2 empty culligan jugs there to get filled/exchanged they said because it 's from a different culligan ( same jug ) that i would have to open an account and pay deposit on there jugs ... . i 'll have to take to walmart and fill them	4386
0	stopped in this afternoon to buy a refill for the five gallon jug i purchased from them . customer service was pitiful . plan to return to doing business with fox water on sherman ave. even thou it is a little less convenient location wise .	4386
1	staff is great ! it 's dq soft serve so expect that . it 's an older store and could use some remodeling but fancy decor does n't change the taste of the treats . enjoy .	4387
1	we got our blizzards fast and the service was good . we had a lady with black basketball shorts on and she was delightful . i also really enjoyed my peanut butter cookie dough blizzard .	4387
1	that girl did n't skimp on my pecans and the blizzard was perfectly mixed . plus the people working there were genuinely friendly and having fun together . i will definitely be back with friends !	4387
0	why is that i can never get a blizzard with enough reese 's cup in it ? it does n't matter what dairy queen i go to , it 's the same thing . i think i need to give up and move on .	4387
0	paid for double chocolate chip cookie dough in my blizzard . did n't even get enough toppings to consider it a normal blizzard . eff this place . never will i return . i should 've expected this from a dq in the ghetto town of coraopolis .	4387
0	i was never a big dq fan to begin with , but on a hot summer day driving around the suburbs we thought `` why not ? '' unfortunately , this particular location lacked a few things that most of the newer locations have : a dining room/seating area . so we stood around the small soft serve spot with our cups and cones as we tried to enjoy the overly sweet and seemingly toxic blizzards that we ordered . sure , they 've got more bang for your buck , but it 's the quality of the product that is lacking .	4387
1	my father needed to use this a product that valley respiratory provides and he said the process was smooth and the rep was very helpful .	4388
1	have been extremely satisfied with the service and professionalism my family and i have received at valley . ryan is always a pleasure to work with and has been there to go above and beyond many times when needed . thank you !	4388
1	my father had oxygen from valley respiratory services during his treatment and they were tremendous to work with . he mentioned everyone was very easy to work with and they took care of him from the beginning to ending . the customer service team , reps , and everyone else gets a+++++ .	4388
1	excellant service with super kind and caring staff . i 'm vacationing in scottsdale and upon arriving i realized i forgot a hose swivel for my cpap mask . i called every respiratory/cpap supplier in the area and no facility was able to help me , they required that i purchase an entire mask . very discouraged i made one last call to valley respiratory in mesa and they got me the piece i needed . so happy with their service and the way they treated me with such kindness . thank you nicole and staff , i appreciate you so much . lynn schindler	4388
1	i got excellent service from valley respiratory services . they ( two different technicians ) did great work for me when i needed it . vrs are trusted by my doctor , who is excellent . i will continue getting my supplies here . bad reviews are a way to punish a business and should not be done lightly . then we lose neighborhood services that we need and are excellent .	4388
0	i thought i would support a local company and by replacement parts from valley respiratory only to be told that need an new prescription for plastic parts that you can buy anywhere without a prescription . company policy .	4388
0	this company treats their employees like slaves . beware if any of this companies employees become temporarily disabled and when the employee finally gets cured the company fires that employee . was there almost 5 years and saw so much bad that patients beware before you choose them . they should of been shut down years ago .	4388
0	they : do n't answer the phone , do n't return phone calls timely , do n't seem to know procedures necessary to get the equipment , have no sense of customer service or sense of urgency . other than that , they are absolutely terrific .	4388
0	when another company from out of state bought my cpap supply company , my pulmonologist suggested valley respiratory . the first order took longer than expected , and my second order arrived with one less nasal pillow , although they billed my insurance company for two . my pulmonologist gave me a name to contact to help resolve the problem , but it 's been a month , and nothing . this month has been difficult because i am using only used and wore out nasal pillows and they are leaking and causing sleeping issues . so far , i can not recommend this company and if the next order is untimely or incomplete , it will be my last from them .	4388
0	terrible customer service ! ! ! ! they say patients are a priority but that is a joke ! my husband has been trying for months to replace a broken c-pap machine and has had to follow-up with them over and over and over again . they do n't seem to care at all nor have any sense of urgency ! ! ! ! it 's ridiculous ! do not use this service . you will regret it !	4388
1	shauna is the person i always go to and she is amazing ! very talented : ) so nice and friendly ! she matched a picture of a design i brought to her . i love coming to this place . love how they have so many designs as you walk in the door . i have been to so many nail salons but this one is by far the best one ! i 'm so glad i do n't have to change to a different one and once again shauna is wonderful !	4389
1	omg the best pedicure i 've ever had in my life ! ! it is on the pricier side for everything but well worth it . shauna did my nails perfect . showed her the design and it was done exactly like the picture . super happy . will be back for sure .	4389
1	everything is so clean . staff are professional and courteous . i live in cali , but look forward to coming here when i 'm in town . in fact , my dh persuades me to go to vegas by offering to get me a pedicure . my experience has been consistent , even though i 've been serviced by different staff members .	4389
1	shauna is amazing . so talented and patient . she takes her time with each customer . although you may be waiting for a while , the wait is worth it . i love that there are so many colors choose from . i 've lived here for 5 years and out of all the places i 've been to , this place is the best . with great reasonable prices as well . thank you guys for your service !	4389
1	the afternoon was the best time to be seen . i had my nails manicured and painted exactly how i wanted . i highly recommend this place !	4389
1	thank you kim for the good and relaxing spa pedicure.. the use of hot stones when my legs/feet were being massaged felt good too even though different.. and they were friendly too.. will definitely go back ! : )	4389
1	shauna is amazing ! i like nail art and so i find a design i like and bring it in with me . shauna has been able to match it every time ! i get the gel manicure and it will usually lasts at least 2 weeks ( i had worn them for 3 before ) . i always leave there completely in love with my nails ! make sure to call for an appointment though - it is a small shop and if they are busy they will turn customers away ( which i think is much nicer than having a customer sit down and wait indefinitely ) .	4389
1	wow the previous reviews are all spot on ! this place is a gem ! one if the fastest and best pedicures i have ever had . very detailed and they really do a lot of massage with the orange scrub then again with the hot stones which was amazing . plus it was also very affordable . they did n't try to up sell me on any thing like some if the other salons , they just did it as part of the basic price ( $ 25 ) . amazing ! ! i will be back and often !	4389
1	i ca n't believe i 've never been to ruby nails being that it 's so close to home . came here because of the ratings on yelp and i must say i left here completely satisfied . better yet the service was fast and the people here are super friendly and great at what they do . my gel full set came out so nice and i could n't be happier . i 'll definitely come back here !	4389
1	again clean and organized . this is my regular mail place and i 'll never go anywhere else again ! !	4389
1	i was worried about the pricing when i came in after reading all these reviews but they proved me wrong . it was absolutely amazing . 50 for gel/acrylic set with her beautiful handmade designs . shauna was so sweet and made me feel right at home . and she was fast ! i was a walk-in on sunday morning and she got me right in and out in well under an hour . i only wish i lived here to keep coming back ! they have a ton of instagram-worthy samples for gel manis to pick from . i 'm so blown away with this place . thanks shauna !	4389
1	been in las vegas for almost 3 years now and have n't ever visited the same nail shop twice ! this place was clean , had options and did n't rush me ... they took time to help me design what i wanted , and my nails looked fabulous ! it 's been 2 weeks and they 're still amazing !	4389
1	best pedicure i 've ever had . i do n't want to go anywhere else . the only tiny comment i have is that there was n't any music playing in the salon so it was strangely quiet but i still recommend this place to all my friends .	4389
1	great customer service ! so many designs to choose from and they are all unique ! shawna is the best she knows how to revamp anyone 's nails ! thanks love the design	4389
1	great experience here . very friendly to walk-ins . the deluxe pedicure is fantastic and includes sugar scrub , hot stone massage & mud treatment . i recommend it & will be back ! ! !	4389
1	first time here ... love the place . very clean and everyone is professional . i used to go to other places , but they 've forgotten why they are in business . last few times there i was not impressed and the place was filthy . so my wonderful niece told me about ruby nails , she comes here .	4389
1	love this place ! they are extremely friendly , kind and professional . i wanted a specific color and design and they went above and beyond to accommodate my request . the best pedicure i 've ever received . this has turned into my favorite , go-to nail spot .	4389
1	i got the deluxe pedi and thought they did a great job ! i did n't feel like she rushed and the hot stone massage was great !	4389
1	base on nail place i 'm so picky , but thanks i found the perfect and amazing person `` shauna '' she 's the best i really love the way she did my nails , not only she 's nice every time i shows any design i want she can do it and turn to beautiful that 's why i always want to come @ ruby nails ... also everyone are so nice ... absolutely i can recommend this place and shauna to my friends ...	4389
1	was in town and wanted , needed a pedi ... .saw the reviews and decided this was within reason for travel time and it received fairly good reviews ... .i was not disappointed with the service , although i thought it was a bit pricey . it was clean and comfortable and they were able to get me in without an appointment . would go again if i am in town and need the same service .	4389
1	love , love , love this place ! they are under new ownership and they definitely know how to take care of their customers . be good to them and they will be good to you ! gel mani and deluxe pedi ! i will get all gel next time for sure ! ! !	4389
1	i went for a spa pedicure & it was amazing ! the best ! cute salon & techs have great customer service . shona is wonderful ! ! !	4389

1	ive had the pleasure of one nail tech at ruby nails for the past year . i have found a lil piece of heaven ! everyone in the shop are always coutetious and give me the service i request and more . the art work they have displayed is way more then the norm . i wish i would have found them yrs ago.i bring my friends and fam and they luv it too . i am one satisfied customer everytime i visit !	4389
1	i needed a quick pedicure and `` b '' did an amazing job ! i was very satisfy with the service . i will be going back for sure .	4389
1	have n't done a review in a while but as always i love to see shauna as she takes wonderful care of my nails ! ! see my updated pic with chevron design today : ) great service every time i come , i recommend an appointment so you can be seen as quickly as possible !	4389
1	i love ruby nails especially because of shawna . she is awesome . i 'll show her what i want and she does it perfectly .	4389
1	this place is good . i walked in and it was nice and clean i mean really clean . costumer service was great , friendly & comfy . i got the gel deluxe pedicure & gel full set . this was one of the best pedicures i 've had in a while . they take their time , use really good products , and hot stones ! massaging chairs are fantastic . my full set came out super cute . love my nails definitely a must go to place .	4389
0	very rude ! ! ! ! i cancelled my appointment cuz my grandma sick.. shan said u have to come in do n't cancel its ok if u have emergency ... . so i told her `` what if u have emergency come up and u have appointment u will not going to call and cancel ... she said no it 's never happen to me ... . story short i will never come back this place ... . thank u	4389
0	i opted for the $ 25 spa pedi . she literally rubbed the rocks once down my legs , put on an orange lotion that burned my skin and rushed the nail painting to the point it streaked . the salon only had one other patron so i i 'm not sure what the hurry was ... . ? sorry , i ca n't recommend nor will i be back .	4389
0	fungus was growing under all my nails after i had them done here .. i wo n't be returning here .. also the fact you have to pay before you service makes me not want to come back either	4389
0	they now make you pay up front , before beginning any work . you have to choose everything ( colors , designs , shape of nail , etc ) & pay before you even sit down . i do n't know what happens if you change your mind before any designs are done , etc . but i have never run into the whole pay up front thing before . they did so-so work , not work the money that i paid . it 's not often that i decide to treat myself so it really sucks not having a good experience when i do .	4389
0	rude customer service , i would n't recommend this place . we left immediately went to another establishment a few blocks ways and were very pleased .	4389
0	i showed up at 6 and sign says they do n't close till 7 . she asked what i needed and i said a fill . she spoke whatever language with the other lady and said we are closed . but there sign was on . horrible ! they close at 6 everyone !	4389
0	`` rude '' is the first word of every one star review if you want them to talk crap about you in vietnamese go to this place instead of apologizing they instead wanted to play victim and try degrade me with their poor english and rudely message me on here . worst experience of my life i 'll be finishing my review later in the evening ! i 'm full vietnamese be careful next time around buddy .	4389
0	read the good reviews decided to try it . i was a walk in friendly helped right away ( it was early morning ) any ways she did n't know how to do the shape i wanted i settled for a pointed almond . it cost extra for that do n't know why ... they were to thin and 2 days later it looked like i needed a fill . plus it took her over an hour to do . i spent 35 with tip plus i brought my own polish so it really was n't worth it ... .i 'll go else where next time	4389
0	walked in at 103 walked out at 1:25 . was asked to pay ahead of time for a 25 $ pedicure ! then after paying and needing to use the restroom was told the bathroom was not working and asked to go next door ! quickest pedicure i ever received . will never go back ! i was so ready to go that i also ended up leaving before my feet were completely dry , bumping my parking break and messing up my polish . thanks for nothing ruby nails .	4389
0	awful made an appointment and was not honored since i was 5 min late wtf there place was hard to find i said okay since i was gon na do manicure and pedicure can i do 1 thing she said no are you serious you dull bitc # i have money i 'm usto paying 100 dlls for my nails glad i did n't get them done here . customer service is bad	4389
0	the worst customer service ! ! ! i had an appointment with shauna , i get there 10 minutes early ! i wait and then she tells me 5 minutes after my scheduled appointment someone else will have to do my pedicure because she has another customer ! i told her i made my appointment two weeks ago and she said i know but he will do your pedicure ! i told her i no thank you and i will never be back !	4389
0	i never write bad reviews but this place is just horrible . they did n't even do my nails right but i had to run out that place . i 'm a cosmetologist myself so i too $ 15 plus every time i get my nails done but i just could n't . i 'm sorry i 'll never recommend this place ever . i should of figured it was bad cause it was so empty . now i have to go get my nails fixed	4389
0	i called days ahead and made a pedicure appt for my husband 's surprise birthday present , but ( unfortunately ) did n't get the name of the person taking my info , and then when we arrived , , they said , `` we do n't have no appointment , and we already are booked up . '' i was sooooo disappointed ! i 'll never go back ! !	4389
0	terrible work , terrible service ! i asked to have my gel manicure like the picture i had showed them . the guy did my manicure and it looked hideous . i tried to be ok with it but i really could n't stand it . i went back the next day to ask if they could redo the manicure or give me a refund and take them off . they said no refunds and would charge me $ 20 for the redo . i had already paid $ 62 ( $ 25 pedicure , $ 30 gel , and $ 7 design ) yesterday . they would not even lower the redo price to $ 15 . see the pictures , it explains it all .	4389
0	i attempted to get a pedicure here . called an hour in advance and the girl who barely spoke english could n't even give me their location ... when i arrived i was asked to come back in a couple hours as they were all busy ... there were 3 techs and one customer . so rude and definitely not a place i 'll return to .	4389
0	i 've been coming for a long time , but i will never come again ! ! my husband , daughter and i went in for several services . i ended up not getting anything done because it was so over priced . my husband was not allowed to use restroom . they got so upset that they even put the candy dish away after my daughter grabbed one piece ! they are so pathetic ! ! ! !	4389
0	i liked the service they were very nice , however their gel nail work is horrible i got mine done today and they look a week old , i liked how they did my eyebrows but that was about it..	4389
0	both of my middle nails were crooked and the guy who did my nails was not very thorough . he did n't even finish up , he passed me to another girl so she could paint my nails .	4389
0	they charge you prior to your service not knowing if you 're going to like their work which by the way is very basic nothing out of the ordinary i had brought my daughter in to get her nails done she is 8 years old and has gotten gel nails in the past , as soon as i walked in the lady said `` oh no we do n't do nails for little girls '' . not kid friendly .	4389
0	came at 5:55 , sign says open till 7:00 . they turned me away saying they were closed ! i said your sign says 7:00pm.. they all simultaneously looked back down at the same time going back to doing whatever they were doing with no response.. really ? poor business practice-wo n't be returning .	4389
0	absolutely terrible . they had no interaction with me . i asked for a specific nail design and the lady told me no because she could n't do it , like i was not paying for the services . they could not even slide my card properly , it took them 45 minutes to process my payment . also , they have a very limited staff . when i went they had three people running around helping 5 plus . my pedicure was very relaxing though , and for a manicure and pedicure it was a very reasonable price of $ 40 .	4389
0	walked in , they asked what can they help me with today . only two people in the shop and they do n't close for an hour and a half . i told them i need a fill and they said they do n't have time . really ? why would you even ask me what i needed done today if you did n't have time ? then they laughed . so unprofessional . never coming here again .	4389
0	like 5 of my nails came out crooked . i wanted them coffin shape and while the man was filing them to make a coffin shaped , he broke two of them because of how rough he was being with the nails and then accused me of breaking it myself . on top of that , they make you pay before they get started on your nails . i am not coming here again . very rude and poor job .	4389
0	rude customer service . the employee hung up on me while i was trying to make an appointment because she was not able to understand my question .	4389
0	very disappointed ! on yelp and on their door it says they are open until 7:00 pm . i arrived at 6:25 and they had a closed sign up by the door and they were trying to tell me through the door that they close at 6:00 even though everything points otherwise . i was bummed because they do a nice job . i drove 20 minutes just to get there ! my business will go elsewhere now .	4389
0	they make you pay before you sit . that is not ok. not how its done ! and has nothing to do with race . im white . there is a rude older woman at the front . they lie and say the gel nails they do is powered.. and it gels . no that not true just do n't go here !	4389
0	horrible customer service ! have been trying to make an appointment and they always tell me no to the time i want . i ask if i can come in as a walk-in they tell me come next week . they never take anyone after 6 6:30 even if they 're available even tho it says they close at 7 and walk-ins are welcomed . sometimes they even close earlier then the time there suppose to .	4389
0	it was terrible experience . i walked in and they said ca n't wait sorry . there was one person waiting . what is going on really ? sorry you just lost business	4389
1	we just recently came to ea in search of a new kitchen table . we were greeted warmly by dj who went above and beyond to answer our questions and offer advice . we ultimately did not purchase the table but were very pleased with the help we received . the show room is beautifully decorated .	4390
1	the quality of this furniture is amazing . greeted by a professional design person . jill workman quickly helped us at the design center . after identifying some of our needs , she set an in home visit to get a better feel for the design . at no cost . the entire process was smooth and of the highest level . thank you ethan alien for a great product and thank you jill for your dedication to design . until next time .	4390
0	their furniture is well made but their return policy is poor . they would not let me return a dining room table . i called about a month or so after the delivery and continued to talk to the design consultant as well as the manager . no one made any attempt to help me negotiate any type of resolution . i offered to pay a restocking fee or the designers commission if that would help . i thought they might give me store credit , but no . the table is in perfect condition so i could n't understand why they would n't take it back . i 'm not so sure i 'll shop there again .	4390
0	i almost feel bad giving ethan allen a single star but it is well deserved . the furniture is super nice no doubt but for the money and the customer service no way . i paid full price for my bedroom furniture 6k and was so frustrated was the horrendous service . i am a young girl granted but i am convinced they thought i was broke just not a good experience and would never go back too bad because they do have potential ... . would probably do crate and barrel or pottery or a local place .	4390
1	really really enjoyed the mousse drinks . ordered the lychee black tea with mousse & my best friend ordered the oolong black tea with mousse . it was my first time trying the cheese foam and i can not wait to go back ! thick and creamy , i wish i could buy a bucket of these and take it home with me . plenty of spaces and the reasonable prices , will definitely be back soon to their other drinks !	4391
1	downtown的royaltea比较易走过，因为门口系负一层，系cic银行隔离，推门进店原来不少年轻顾客帮衬。饮品菜单都贴左收银位右边的墙上，喜茶和喜茶当季新品、royaltea的菜单清楚列出，选择不少，考到选择困难症的朋友了。客座都几多，感觉整个店铺无finch店甘大，free wifi好像都连唔到。	4391
1	the honeydew mousse is good ! i ordered with half sugar , the cheese cream on top is a bit salty , tastes so good when it mixed with the honeydew juice . the mango one is a bit sour at this season tho . i came in at a weekday around 9pm , the line is short , it took me 10 minutes to get my drink which is ok .	4391
1	the drinks here so great , and also diversity then u have many choices . i really like the mango here , but i dont know why then they always tell me no more mango : ( ( ( ( . about the waffle , u have to wait around 15mn but for me , it deserves to wait lol . be careful if u wait too long , 1 time they forgot mine . i dont like the customer service here too much bc when u order sth , they repeat by chinese , and all of them talk together by chinese , u can not understand what is happening .	4391
0	asked for large taro milk tea with tapioca and regular size rose oolong tea with durian mousse , the cashier completely messed up my order , give me both regular size drinks , on top of that when i took it home and saw , taro milk tea with mousse and no tapioca , and rose oolong tea with tapioca ‍that cashier just so careless no customer service whatsoever ; will not go back again	4391
0	we only tried the hong kong waffle with ice cream because i was already inside but the service is lacking . another person came in after me but basically cut in line because they spoke the same language as the cashier . other than that , the food we tried was fine .	4391
0	let me first say , the bbt is really good but the service is so bad and rude and unbearable that i am boycotting this place until new people are hired or the workers learn some manners . no place is worth this much anxiety and to feel like you 're a burden for even being in there . apparently this is a common complaint for both locations and i am another person here to add my two cents to the extremely poor service . no one smiles here..there are like 10 other locations i can go to and feel welcomed .	4391
0	the tea here is strong and the pearls were all clumped together . service was okay - they were patient and helpful when my son spilled his drink . all of that said , none of us liked our drinks . i drank it all because ... it was a $ 6 drink .	4391
1	lookin ' for a place that 's half bakery and half deli ? somewhere where you can purchase a combination of healthy treats , cookies , bread , fresh bagels , deli items and custom designed wedding cakes ? well , you 've come to the right place : hunterhorn bakery . specifically knowledgeable in baking allergy-free foods , hunterhorn is a true gem that can be found inside of hunterhorn plaza . and just a helpful hint : their coconut buns are to die for . they are crunchy , sweet balls of goodness and at ~.80 cents a bun , you ca n't help but have a couple : )	4392
1	good prices . nice staples in an asian bakery . and ... they have pretty decent vietnamese subs .	4392
0	used to order birthday cakes from here before but quality has gone downhill.. not moist and dry . i have not gone back for this reason as this happened twice . maybe change in recipe ... t & t mango cakes are better .	4392
0	i visited this bakery based solely on yelp reviews . not bad but not delicious . we bought marble cookies , cream puff , cream eclair and french bread . cream puff was fresh and tasty says 12 yo . eclair tasted old . french bread was nice . but no better than $ 1 loaves at superstore . marble cookies were fine . it was n't terrible but i wo n't go back .	4392
1	this store always has friendly and fast customer service . they go above and beyond to provide a positive customer experience . thank you !	4393
1	i went to get jumper cables . manager there was very polite and informative . if i 'm in the area will definitely stop by again .	4393
0	the majority of the staff here have no idea what they are talking about . i have asked for several simple items , like plastguage , an oil pump primer shaft , ect , and all i got were blank stares . i special ordered starter bolts from another store , and the girl at the counter had no idea where they were when they arrived . unless you are mexican , avoid this place , there is a reason it has the nickname vatozone , they do n't offer much help if you actually speak english !	4393
0	just looking for the temperature gun that you said you had on the phone and waited in line for 20 minutes while people cut in front of me . do n't know if i am completely done with autozone but i can tell you i wo n't be back to this location . still do n't have a temp gun . management should know how bad you guys did ! ! !	4393
1	we decided to go to studio vino for a birthday celebration . since there were 10 of us , we booked a private event , so we had the place to ourselves . the atmosphere is very relaxed , yet sophisticated . kari made us feel at home . we sampled 10 different wines along with snacks . we then were off to make our own wine , which was a blast . this was an unforgettable experience ! we get to return in a few months to bottle our wine . i 'm sure there will be more tasting then .	4395
1	i started going to studio vino last summer - i actually stumbled upon studio vino since it 's next to the bikram yoga studio . after a few visits some friends and i decided to bottle wine . we started the wine making process in october and bottled in march . it was an absolute blast . once i finished the wine i made , i plan on going through the wine making process again . kari , the owner , has been an absolute delight . i enjoy going to studio vino so much , i am now a sv member . the wine is young but good -	4395
1	two years ago , i walked into studio vino on a lark . i sat down and was greeted immediately by the owner kari and the barkeep caylan . i was made to feel welcome , and i had such an awesome time that i came back the next week . that night , kari served myself and the lovely lady sitting to my left some great wines at great prices . we talked and laughed late into the night . that lovely lady who was on my left was tricia and she is now my girlfriend . i love this place .	4395
1	great experience for fund raising . a complete az wine experience .	4395
0	what a great idea-what a poor way to run a business . part of the experience of wine tasting is the fun of conversing and discussing wine with the proprietors . in my case , this not only did not occur , but we felt like we were an annoyance for asking questions . it is unfortunate that the attitude was `` i am in the business to make money '' -even if you are , your clients should never get the feeling that that is the only reason you are in the business . a little personal attention and kindness go a very long way-this was not what was felt by myself nor those in my party .	4395
0	hours on the door say 12noon- ..well , who cares . we were there at noon on a saturday to pick up our wine after months of it `` not being ready '' . talked to the owner , left messages , etc etc.. it was finally ready and here we are ! ! ! doors locked . these people suck . they eventually agreed to drop off our wine for us at our house and they did . the end- finally	4395
0	customer service was horrible . trying to get them on the phone was next to impossible . in having to make a `` reservation '' got a very limited selection of times available . be surprised if they make it another year .	4395
0	i would n't go back ! got a groupon for a tasting- not worth it at all ! $ 39 for 3 small swallows of wine , small app plate and some truffles- and taxes are not included in the groupon so we got a tab for that at the end of tasting which was an additional $ 8 . the staff was not friendly at all and i felt rushed ! honestly do n't waste you time or money here !	4395
1	the staff here is amazing thank you amy , and there is a gentleman there that always helps me as well ! always informative !	4396
1	love this store . nice selection of diamond jewelry , especially rings . salespeople have always been friendly and professional .	4396
1	have been here multiple times and i have been absolutely thrilled with the level of excellent service each and every time ! a big thank you to lee who helped my fiance surprise me with the most beautiful , unique engagement ring . it was more stunning than i ever couldve imagined and it is absolutely perfect ! i cant wait to come here with my fiance this time so we can look for his ring and my wedding band together . thank you all so much for making this experience so incredibly special for both of us !	4396
1	took a while to get some help , but it was all good , we were able to look around without anyone bothering us . so we picked a few pieces that we really liked.. we finally got some help ( i ca n't remember the young girls name ) but she was very helpful . she said they can make almost any thing we liked work within our price range . yes there pieces were nice , but ... .i just wanted something i could walk out the door with . they do have a little sales pressure on you there . we thought we were going to come back , we ended up buying some where else .	4396
1	came in twice , once to drop some rings off to get resized and back again to pick them up . as soon as i walked in i was greeted with a smile and helped promptly . my nephew especially liked their kids play area .	4396
0	two stars only because i 'm happy with my purchase . although lady said she would run a soft credit check on myself and my boyfriend to see who would qualify for a better credit card limit . we chose to go with my boyfriends . she ran a hard check on both of us and we both got a credit card in the mail . without my consent . very upset . manager was barely apologetic . not ok to mess with someone 's credit so easily . she should be fired .	4396
0	i have always had the worst customer service at this location . i keep giving them second and third and fourth chances but its always the same bad service ! !	4396
0	we 've been to this jared 's location several times as this was the location we 've made our purchses . usually when we return to get our rings and necklace inspected the customer service staff was satisfactory ! however , today 's visit was a different story the women was rude and abrupt . while i was waiting i went to use the restroom . now i 'm wondering how is one suppose to clean their hands without a cold water handle ? ! ? ! yuck ! ! and , to top it off there 's no seat covers come on , get your restroom in order .	4396
0	very unfortunate , anyone reading this should steer clear of jared 's galleria . did a custom order for a platinum ring received white gold . no time frame on turn around replacement . had my wife 's engagement ring rounded and sized to come back unpolished , with amateur quality . the ring had to be worked on 4 different times just to come out round . if you are in the market for sentimental jewelry , you should look somewhere else . once the sale is made you simply become a number and your possessions treated with no respect . very disheartening coming here . please save yourselves the disappointment and find a jeweler that cares , because you wo n't find it here .	4396
0	had one of the worst experiences of my life at this store . was told they understood why i was upset and knew i would n't ever come back but they could n't address the issue . when i told their corporate customer service they said sorry , but we ca n't help you and were not worried about losing a customer . went to `` the jewelers '' on eastern and they were awesome . told them what happened at jared and they honored the jared rewards that jared would n't . plus their diamonds were better quality and better priced !	4396
1	i 've used this business several times now , and had great service ! they fit me right in , and mike at the front desk , ( i believe he owns the business ) is always very informative and helpful . they are always busy , so if you do n't want to wait , call the day before you need something done .	4397
1	the service was the best and saved me money . i thought i needed a new tire they was about to spend $ 104 but there where able to patched it and plugged it . the cost $ 29 what a saving	4397
1	i was worried about having my brakes done at tuffy after reading the negative reviews from fellow yelpers . while i waited for my quote , i spoke to a woman in the waiting room , who was a repeat and happy customer . the quote came back and was affordable , and they promised i 'd be done in 90 minutes . 90 minutes later ( almost to the minute ) , my car was done , and i was on my way . sometimes you got ta take a chance on a business that does n't have shininig reviews . i 'm glad i did .	4397
0	terrible customer service with uncompetitive prices . they tell you to bring your car in for service , then when you drive to get there , they tell you that they do n't have time to see you . on top of that , they are rude and overpriced . a simple synthetic oil change and tire rotation is $ 40 more here than anywhere else in the area . do yourself a favor and drive a few minutes into harrisburg and go to pepboys .	4397
0	i came into this shop because my car was making a strange clunking sound from the front . it turned out to be the axle , but they said my wheels were aftermarket steel rims and were dangerous to drive on . being naive at the time , i told them to replace them . it took 3 days to get me stock rims . ended up spending $ 600 when it should have cost $ 300 . stay away !	4397
0	worst customer service ever . stay away ! save yourself the headache ! every time i 've come here , the guy at the front has been beyond rude to me , as if i 'm an inconvenience . my last oil change there took 2 hours to complete !	4397
1	cheap and awesome place to catch the movies you missed ! management is awesome and new snacks in the lobby	4398
1	i really enjoy coming to this movie theater​ . the prices are very reasonable ( $ 3-5 ) . the snacks are a little expensive , but you do get refills on the popcorn and soda.there is a game room there to help pass the time while waiting for your movie to start . the staff is very friendly , and the bathrooms are decent . i highly recommend this movie theater whether you are on a budget or not .	4398
1	this place is n't as bad as people say . i go their frequently and it is really fun ! especially if you are a student like me . yes it is sketchy at times , but it is cheap and always has some good movies !	4398
0	we went to auditorium 2 . very ordinary seats which resembled me of theatres 20 years ago . the most horrible part was the overpowering smell due to non-maintenance and probably bedbugs . may not be going again .	4398
0	trash ! horrible sound system throughout the movie theater , awkward/outdated seating , and the arm rests do n't move ... to end on a positive note , i paid $ 6 for two adult tickets . thats about the only good thing i could say .	4398
0	if they actually did research on thier special needs employees and cared then i probably would put a 5 star rating but like every other shtty movie theater the management does not .	4398
1	we had a group event . we were the only ones there . staff was friendly . we did not like bowling in darkness . and they did turn up the lights . we had their flat breads . ehi h was thin a d crispy and loaded with cheese . everything was nice and fresh . place was . clean . much better experience	4399
1	really enjoyed this place . went with a large group on sunday at noon . the party package was perfect . two hours of bowling , unlimited pizza and drinks and gift cards for the arcade . the facility is nice , the staff were friendly and helpful and everyone had a great time . the music videos playing above the lanes was nice . only thing that could have been better is if each bowler could choose to have bumpers or not instead of the whole lane having to agree .	4399
1	i was there with friends last night and it was great . i wish i would have gotten the name if the gentleman who checked us in . he was very nice , professional , and informative . i was alone waiting for my group and he made sure he held our lanes until our group arrived . a lot of places would n't do that . he anticipated our needs with kids . the only thing i did not like is that there was no snack counter . i get that you have servers to enhance the experience , and make it a little `` fancier '' , but sometimes it 's easier to walk over and get a soda . overall , great experience .	4399
1	this is a fun place to go and the environment is second to none ! a little on the pricey end but well worth is !	4399
1	clean and modern bowling ! daily specials . beers on tap . great pricing for air conditioned fun : - )	4399
1	super fun for family fun or date night ! i was n't expecting it to be so updated inside definitely old school vibe with a new school feel ! they had food drinks and fun what more could you ask for there 's also several nightly themed events promotion specials whatever you want to call it that were budget-friendly !	4399
0	cedrick was extremely rude and told my table to hurry up because he had other people to serve . if he ca n't do well serving at a bowling ally then i really do n't think he 's going to do very well in life . when i complained to the person checking us out she told me that was just his attitude . i would n't hire someone like him and i certainly would n't keep him if you know whats best for your business .	4399
0	can i give this place a negative 1 ? they try to pretend they 're super busy so they can over charge you ! do n't fall for it !	4399
0	20 minutes in line on a sunday . the birthday party will be over soon and my seven year old is still waiting for shoes . as if we needed a reminder of why nobody bowls anymore .	4399
0	in three games this week , the pins reset incorrectly 5 times . the food service was terrible as it took over 30 minutes to receive beverages and after delivered the waitress never returned . save your money and go elsewhere .	4399
0	went here with a group of colleagues . left credit card at the bar to keep my tab open . when we left i thought my husband picked up the card and closed our tab ... turns out he did n't so i went back the next day to pick up my card and found out more than $ 30 in charges that were not ours . just hoping the bartender 's regulars enjoyed a few pops on my dime .	4399
0	first of all , when we started to bowl the score keeping was n't working , so we wasted 15 minutes of our time trying to get it corrected . the bowling alley has a distinct urine smell and it 's not cool at all inside . it 's musty , sticky and moist . we bowled one game and left as i could not take the smell of urine anymore . definitely wo n't be returning to this location again .	4399
1	great market with lots of organic options . the prices are competitive and they often do markdowns of older stock . i love having a smiths near my house . they hire friendly helpful employees .	4400
1	i love this store everyone is very sweet but that drake looking like fellow annoyed me . other than that i love this place everyone 's nice welcoming and food is always fresh	4400
1	i prefer this location over the other 2 i pass on my way home from work , because the staff here is the best ! they have cashiers to ring me up , even after 9pm . they do n't forget to use my bags & give me bag points . they also have what i buy in stock , 99 % of the time . i 've never waited more than a few minutes to be checked out .	4400
1	yes ! smith 's is the place , `` why ? '' you ask ... i will tell u why ! ! ! 1 . original low prices 2 . the sales ! ! ! 3 . smith 's club ( earn point 's for shopping ) 4 . the set up and products this location is great because it is farrrrr away from much of the chaos , tucked away in the beautiful south/west part of the city . very clean store !	4400
1	maria was very pleasant & signed me up & explained the member rewards program to me with less than 10 mins before closing . she was very more than happy to help me regardless that it was only a few minutes away from closing & the end of her shift . i 've been to many other locations & never was asked . points to save on gas ? ! ? who would n't love that ! thank you maria	4400
1	dayum . some people hatin ' on this smith 's . oh well . i had a very different experience . the place is hella large and has everything you are looking for from a standard supermarket plus a nice liquor section , a pharmacy and a small hardware aisle . i picked up everything on my grocery list and more . the only negative about this particular store is the small fruits/veggies aisle , but the organic aisle attached to it made up for that . need groceries ? come on over here . huge bonus : large selection of boar 's head meats and cheeses at the deli counter	4400
1	had an awesome experience , waited for 20mins for a florist , then aj and frank from produce help us and made our shopping expeirence amazing thanks guys your awesome ! ! !	4400
1	this is my favorite smith 's location . there are other smith 's locations closer to me but this location , which is still close by is my favorite one to go to . tiffanie is such a great cashier and is one of the best . keep up the great job tiffanie . everyone else in the store is great too . it is so easy to find things in this smith 's and they have a great selection . they also have a very nice natural supplements and vitamins sections and carry some natural food products too .	4400
1	i seriously do n't know what these low reviews are from 5 years ago -- lol . well it 's 2014 , i 'm going to write an awesome review because for the well deserved staff and service for the last five years have been amazing . friendly and helpful , clean and always stocked with fresh , great quality produce and meats . every time i walk in i am remembered and greeted . it 's seriously your sweet , neighborhood grocery store .	4400
1	celena was amazing at the service deli . totally coming back because of her . super friendly and adjusted the thickness for are ham 4 times and did n't complain once and genuinely cared if we were happy with are cut	4400
1	celena was amazing at the service deli . totally coming back because of her . super friendly and adjusted the thickness for are ham 4 times and did n't complain once and genuinely cared if we were happy with are cut .	4400
1	95 % of the time this store is tops . it 's convenient and the employees are helpful . there is a good selection of products too . once in awhile i 'll pick up something and realize the expiration date has already passed when i get home . that 's a real bummer . they could be better at checking those i suppose . having said that though , i am glad they 're here . i do love their digital coupons too .	4400
0	they never have enough lanes open for a speedy checkout . it 's also not very clean . albertsons on durango is a much nicer store .	4400
0	unfortunately i 've seen this smith 's go way downhill over the past decade . it used to be clean and have a great variety of organic/natural/vegetarian food . now it 's dingy and the natural foods section is half the size it used to be . i give it three stars because there are occasionally good manager deals there that are n't at other smith 's location . i got a bunch of bags of vegan cheese last week for a third of what they usually cost . update : always long lines ( especially at customer service ) and stuff out of stock . updating my review to one star to reflect that .	4400
0	this was the smiths where i always shopped . they have changed managers and the store is n't that great anymore . this evening i went to the deli to get lunch meat . i was the only one at the counter , but a worker kept us waiting for quite awhile . finally , i ordered sliced ham . she put the meat on a dirty slicer that looked as if it had n't been cleaned all day . it contained different meats previously cut . i did n't take the lunch meat , it made me queasy just knowing it was sliced on a dirty slicer . i 'm not shopping at smiths anymore .	4400
0	i used to shop at this store on a daily basis however , due to the lack of checkers on duty and the refusal of management to remove those stupid self serve check outs i refuse to spend another dime here . the store is small compared to others and the employees are generally unenthused and unhappy except the lady in the courtesy booth . it 's a drag when i 'm trying to shop for dinner and i 'm approached by an employee who is being discriminated against and demoted .	4400
0	this location is beat . old and worn down . the layout is all weird . only one ( slow ) person working the deli section with a line of customers 6 deep . there 's a plastic bin with sandwich rolls where customers can grab their own bread and stick them in a plastic bag . i saw a lady stick her dirty hands in there , move around the bread she did n't like until finding just the right ones . sans tissue paper . needless to say i did n't buy my rolls there .	4400
0	worst check out experience with lilly ever ! ! she only rang up half of my items when i told her i had more than just 2 items . she also forgot to ask for my smith 's card which made me forget i had one until after the transaction . when i asked her about it she looked at me as if she did n't know what i was talking about ! she was just useless . next time i will make it a point to stave a little further to the flamingo & fort apache smiths ! my experience here really sucked .	4400
0	this smith 's location is in desperate need of a remodel . the store is outdated in many ways , the store has a consistant and distinct smell that turns me off . this store has some really nice employees though , too bad the store is not as nice or clean as other smith 's . the registers and counters are old fashioned and awkward if you have a lot of groceries . come on smith 's , if this store is not as profitable as the others than close it , no more excuses .	4400
0	i stopped going to the smith 's store on south las vegas blvd . because of regular over charging at the register . i have been shopping at the store on windmill and eastern for months and same thing ! not random , but every trip there are errors . this company is consistently over charging ! 99 cent oranges cost me $ 1.99 . 88 cent each avocado rang up at 3 for $ 5.00 . the week before an ad item rang up regular price . i caught it at checkout and it took 10 minutes to try and change it .	4400
0	good staff but the store manager charles is rude and not nice to his staff at all . i 'm not shopping here anymore because of him . rude to customers and his own workers .	4400
0	this store is further away from my home but decided to do some shopping here since i was in the area . the layout of the store is just like any other smiths store . i was however surprised that the cashier judy slammed all my groceries after she rang me up as if she was ticked off . even a family member that was with me made a comment about it and since she normally shops elsewhere she was nice enough to bag the groceries for judy . we were very nice so even if you are having a bad day you do not treat customers or anyone like this .	4400
0	just say `` no ! '' to this store . it is filthy and smells . it looks like a government surplus store and the prices are not all that great . 1 star is too generous .	4400
0	this company is dog friendly if you have a pet you could probably bring them to the store since your management do n't care . however they are not handicap friendly their vendors actually discriminate against handicapped people if you 're physically impaired you probably should rethink where you shopping these stores put profits in front of people .	4400
1	great place to shop at . clean store , friendly staff . great parking . i would love for them to make this a market district giant eagle because i think the location would be perfect !	4401
1	i like their dvd selection , they have a better selection then at borders and barnes and noble at crocker park . i only get their food when their are specials going on .	4401
1	amazing place , lots of good deals ! and during halloween u can trick or treat in the plaza ! ! ! beware of the zombies tjough ... .	4401
0	needed to fill a prescription and this was the closest pharmacy . unfortunately they close at 5pm on saturday ! how disappointing .	4401
0	dirty dirty dirty and more dirty ! they should be ashamed at how dirty most of the store has become . the main dirty areas are around the prepared foods , coffee/soda fountain , and area with the tables . i almost throw up every time i walk around to this part of the grocery store , too bad grocery stores are legalized monopolies like cable companies . also , all of the prepared food is ridiculously overpriced and looks like its been sitting out for days . thank god for heinens ! skip this giant eagle if you can !	4401
0	i try to avoid this place as much as possible . aside from a decent layout and a good selection of items , there is really not much you can say about this location . prices are high , the value is low and the employees ( especially on the night shift ) can be downright belligerent . there are three other grocery stores in the immediate area ( aldi , marc 's and trader joe 's ) and its worth making more than one stop for everything you need if it means avoiding the giant migraine that is giant eagle .	4401
1	we love this store ! they do a great job grooming our golden retriever , ace . they have good quality food and our puppy loves their treats . we just came in for a grooming and they gave him some treats for free which made ace 's day ! thanks for taking care of our boy !	4402
1	took my dog here for his first groom since adoption . he loved it and he looked amazing . michelle did a fantastic job . she even let my dog text me to tell me he was done . ; ) the selection of products is pretty impressive , too . if you 're looking for something and ca n't find it at petsmart/petco ? it 's probably here . it 's a little bit out of the way for me , but if you 're in henderson/green valley , i ca n't recommend them enough .	4402
1	friendly and helpful staff . the owner throws great events at the store . everything from parties to adoptions .	4402
0	we stopped going here ! they were so rude to me ! i forgot that i raved about them after my first visit . the women who work there are snooty with a capital snoot ! once they have you as a customer , they seem to think they can treat you however they want . they are too big for their britches and we will not be back ! : (	4402
0	ya know , i 've been in three times so far because i was so excited about the products they carry . however , the three times i 've been in , i 've gotten the crappiest customer service . either they 're too busy or they just do n't care . whatever the reason is , i 'm conflicted about giving them my business , i 'm stoked about how close they are to my house but hate not being treated well . i 'll ponder it , we 'll see . so disappointing ! ! ! : (	4402
0	we just found out that someone else brought their golden retriever to at your service for a bath . the so called `` groomer '' shaved the dog 's back ! ! ! ! what kind of idiot shaves the back of a golden ? did she mistake the word `` bath '' with `` back ? '' what really bothers me is that the management keeps incompetent groomers . these poor dogs !	4402
1	went to dsw today looking for some shoes . the shoes in my size was out of stock but elaina hope me order a pair online i went to use my 10 off coupon but soon learned that it had expired , she had a manager come by to see if they could do anything in the end she did get me a discount , she was very helpful and friendly .	4403
1	huge lot of shoes to pick from and great prices . i 've bought a few pairs of shoes here and will probably buy a few more as long as i live in the area .	4403
1	dsw has shoes . lots of shoes . sandals , boots , sneakers , lady gaga-esque monstrosities , and in a wide variety of prices . well-organized , too , with lots of available sizes for each style . ya need shoes ? you 'll find 'em here . unfortunately for me , they do n't sell feet . i need feet ! ! then i can buy shoes here , just like every other red-blooded , wallet-clutching american woman . and then i 'll give them five stars .	4403
1	my husband forgot to pack light colored shoes for our trip so we came here to get him a pair . store is big , clean , and well organized . we were in and out in no time . staff was very helpful !	4403
0	they try to make you think they are a discount store . fact is their prices are equal or more than their competitors . this place is a joke	4403
0	alana and kailey are selling worn shoes for full price at there store.. would n't even offer me 10 % or nothing . no smiles or good customer service .	4403
0	a store full of hundreds and hundreds of shoes , you 'd think you can find what you need ... .wrong . this store is a fail in the area of carrying wide width women 's shoes . sure the staff says they can order them online , free shipping , but that means another trip back to the store . why ca n't i try on shoes before i buy them like everyone else . at least they could carry a decent amount of wide width . my advice , look somewhere else if that 's what you need .	4403
0	i go in and pull up retail me not . there 's a deal a free blanket or a free virtual toy with purchase . i buy a $ 60.00 pair of shoes . i ask if there are any deals . jocelyn without even looking up says nope . i pull up my app and ask for free blanket . jocelyn rudely says without looking at me . we do n't have it . then i say how about the other thing . nope . i will not be back	4403
1	walked by after having dinner and spotted a pair of heels in the window , of course i had to stop . friendly ladies working the counter plus they suggested take advantage of the sale buy one get second for 50 % off which i did . ca n't go wrong in steve madden !	4404
1	the new manager here is simply amazing . i believe her name is libertie . i came in to exchange a pair of shoes and she was all smiles when it came to helping me . i usually hate shopping but to be honest i actually look forward being able to go back for my next pair of shoes . without a doubt this is a place to stop by if you are in town square and need a pair of shoes . high quality and low price ... add the insanely kind service of libertie and it 's a definite .	4404
0	buyer beware - this store has the worst return policy ever . if you pay with cash or a debit card they mail you a check . the manager `` amy '' was really rude . plenty of other places in town to buy shoes - i wo n't be coming back here .	4404
0	called over the phone to see if they had some sandals in stock.. the girl named keone or whatever does n't even know her product . she kept me on hold for more than 5 mins and then asks someone while on the phone with me if they had the sandals or not . the one at fashion show mall has better customer service .	4404
1	reminds me of the well stocked blue goose market near my hometown in st charles , il , a well curated upscale grocery , in that it stocks many of the regional favorites of the upper midwest , and quite a few other regions as well -- was able to get beecher 's cheese from seattle here , palacios chorizo from spain , magnotta cab franc & riesling icewine from the niagara region -- have never seen this outside a lcbo -- and they also carry nueske 's bacon ( ! ! ! ) , as well as other items from them . open extremely early at 0600 . service is fantastic .	4405
1	the place holds up to it 's name with fine foods . the customer service and employee knowledge is also exemplary .	4405
1	this place is great for out of the ordinary food items , and they have a good selection of wine . they also have some of the most beautiful flowers ( take note , boys ) . however , i usually come for the dessert . they have a little bakery section with absolutely amazing desserts . i just wish this place was n't so pricey , but , sometimes it is worth the splurge for the high end food and classy atmosphere . so much better than sterile aisles packed with cans and boxes and being checked out by lackluster cashiers . if i were rich , this would be my grocery store of choice , no doubt .	4405
1	does anyone else use aj 's salad bar and beautiful patio for lunch or dinner as often as i do ? i love the fresh salad bar ! they have great iced tea and if your in the mood for soup , voila ' . their bistro has a full selection of hot meals as well . i just love a full salad bar at my disposal . if it 's sweets you desire , you wo n't find a bigger selection . fast friendly service and you can always pick an item or two up on your list for dinner tonight .	4405
1	i have to give anderson the cashier 5 stars ! what a wonderful person that young man is ! amazing customer service ! !	4405
1	some of the best quality meats and seafood you will find anywhere ! of course it 's pricey , but then your paying for a much higher quality then fry 's or safeway ! great deli selection ! one of the negatives is some of the fresh fruit they have to offer . the berries are always scarce , and not all that good ... .not to mention the price ! most of the time the employees are friendly and helpful , but occasionally you get one that is less then happy to wait on you ... .i guess they get tired of dealing with overly demanding people . i have had several of the pre-made dinners available ... ..fantastic food !	4405
1	great place to come and sit outside for an after meal dessert with coffee/tea -- or your morning coffee/tea and pastry . there is something for everyone . fruit tarts , brownies and pretzel bread are my personal faves . my kids get a free cookie when they come with me ! coffee and tea is full-service and the staff are always accomodating for special requests . patio is lovely ; service ( counter only ) is efficient and amiable .	4405
1	aj 's has become my quick grab & go over the past 2 years , whether it 's a premade breakfast parfait or make it yourself salad bar , i am rarely let down . my husband is a fan of their breakfast burritos , although we suggest bringing your own hot sauce . try to make it for dinner on taco tuesdays , but always call ahead to confirm it will be set up . this place is great for some solo time or with a group of 10 because they have a huge assortment of options . definitely try their prickly pear iced tea with an orange !	4405
1	best place to buy affordable but delicious cakes ! love that they have so many different cultures over there and their desserts always look amazing ! ! !	4405
0	i live right next to this store so i frequent here . more because it is convenient though . the store is beautiful . but the customer service is consistently very disappointing . the employees are grumpy and curt with customers . the prices are high but that 's aj 's for you . recently went to the aj 's in scottsdale and they had `` over the top '' customer service . that 's what you should expect from a store this beautiful with high prices . good management = happy workers = happy customers . management check yourselves .	4405
0	bashas owned aj 's fine foods caught cheating customers by mislabeling meats . i always supported bashas since they were a locally owned company and i respected mr eddie basha . i also frequented aj 's . no more for me . i will drive the extra distance to whole foods . eddie basha must be turning over in his grave , rip . here is the link to the article : http : //www.examiner.com/article/bashas-inc-enters-non-prosecution-agreement-over-meat-mislabeling	4405
0	not much to say ... i came in expecting to find a stand out floral arrangement to share for a special occasion ( last minute ) and nothing was fresh . everything looked wilted and the choices for any type of arrangements did n't come close . in the past i 've had success with the bakery and deli when looking for something `` above the norm '' for a special occasion . not the case this time around ... when i spoke with the florist in the area and described what i was looking for they also implied that the floral selection was not good . # floralfail .	4405
0	the food at this a.j.s , is usually fantastic but tonight it 's very bad . the salmon was cold , the mashed potatoes were mushy and tasteless , and the vegetables were overcooked i got no receipt from the cashier but did call the manager and they will replace it on my next visit i hope they get it together for next time . i can hope that food is better . a.js is one of my favorite places normally 5 stars ... . but not tonight stay away from the sam and everyone	4405
0	we had been to the one in phoenix and the cuban sandwich was awesome . so we tried the one from here in chandler . and honestly i do n't think ill do that again . the lady that took our order was really unusually slow ... two people got served before she was done with our order . the sandwich itself left much to be desired of . thanks but no thanks .	4405
0	wow , super rude at the coffee counter ! i went in to grab a coffee and was completely ignored by the ladies behind the counter . they even helped the people behind me instead of asking what i needed . for being the higher end chain of bashas and food city , ajs makes sure to act superior and ends up being pretentious in the end . what a shame .	4405
0	tried one of their soups the other day and it was hideous . stay away from the bacon potato soup because the chef put a ton of dill in it and that is all the soup tasted like - a bowl of dill soup . also tried a brownie ( not everything is made in-house ) and that was over-iced , but otherwise decent enough . found prickly pear bbq sauce and prickly pear jelly so that is good news . the parmesan pasta in the display case had some moments , but needed salt and pepper .	4405
0	this place is overpriced and has horrible customer service . do n't waste your time and/or money . if i could 've given it 0 stars i would 've .	4405
0	aj 's eclairs / napoleons are terrible ! if you 're looking for french pastry -- keep looking . i have had better cream filling in circle k donuts the puff pastry in the eclair is flat . in the napoleon it was droopy . in both , the cream filling is pasty not creamy , and bland . the prices are exorbitant for bad pastry . you are much better off going to cripsy cream and getting a chocolate cream donut	4405
1	full disclosure : i am not a quilter . i know nothing about quilting , but i have been in many a quilting/fabric store . this is how 35th ave sew and vac stands out : - large & well-lit - organized fabric - helpful staff - a large selection of new & used sewing and quilting machines	4406
1	very fun shop for my needs . sewing , quilting , learning . the fabric selection is amazing . and they have a variety of sewing , quilting , and embroidery machines . i like to see the new models in person . overall , this is a fun , inspiring shop . and there are discounts and coupon specials to help keep it affordable .	4406
1	nice ! wish i had a million dollars and a huge area to keep all the machines and awesome sewing tables , drool examining the machines & tables & everyone has always been very nice & helpful .	4406
0	not a welcoming place ! cons : never a greeting or an offer to help . a huge store to shop in . a former goodwill store , stained floors and all , located in a iffy shopping mall . a powerwashing of the outside walkway would help . only one cashier . quilting fabrics are overpriced , almost $ 12/yard for most . high priced sewing machines . congested areas showing gaudy themed quilts . i used to like browsing there but no more . pros : designer fabric . for friendly helpful service try mulqueens in glendale that offers classes too .	4406
0	i will never shop at this place again this guy is reall mean . rude from the get go . i will never do business with ever !	4406
0	beware ... all sales are final for machines ( vacuum and sewing ) ! it 's printed on the receipt ( and then it 's too late ) but no where else . the gentleman that is supposed to know the vacuums like the `` back of his hand '' really does n't and is not patient in explaining the product . they do n't point out the necessary gadgets you need to buy to make the vacuum effective ... they just want to sell you a product . it was an expensive mistake to buy our vacuum at the chandler location .	4406
1	i had my carpets cleaned a couple weeks ago . it was free and he did such a good job . he upgraded me for free to the super cleaner ! ! ! super nice guy too . i love that durango canyon provides us with a free carpet cleaning	4407
1	since i 've lived here its been it 's quite and calm and if i need something done they 're on top of it ! im enjoying my stay here at durango canyon !	4407
1	i had just received my full cash deposit . i 'm leaving this positive review , due to the amazing friendly staff at durango canyon . it was great living there . i enjoyed every moment , but it 's time to move . i want to thank terri , david and ida for doing a great job . i highly recommend this rental property .	4407
1	i believe this community deserves 5 stars . the move in process was easy and affordable . the unit itself is beautiful and modern . sure there are a few dings here and there but nothing that takes away comfort and safety . if you want an upgraded apartment that has a nice staff , cheap utilities , tons of parking , and great location then look no further . i 'm writing this review to help boost the poor reviews on here . terri is the best btw .	4407
1	i 've been living here , for more than two years , and i must say , that terri , one of the leasing office employees , has been doing a great job . i can always count on terri , to complete the job . if i have a maintenance issue , she 'll solve it as fast as possible , and she follows up to see that it 's done . every time i walk into the office she greets with a smile , and takes care of me . the maintenance people are great too . i should mention eida too , she 's been very helpful , and does her best to keep me as a resident .	4407
1	love this place . professional staff including maintenance crew . bryan in the office is super nice guy . gym , sauna , tennis courts everything is here . all entrances are private , feels like live in a house . each buildings are designed not to face each other with big space in between . best thing about this place is amount of grass and trees . you wo n't believe you are in vegas . and dog area is awesome , my dog was so happy , he just go out and come back on his own . place is gated and so safe , nothing to worry about . i lived on north side though , south side looks little noisy .	4407
1	i moved out and a month later i got my check back from office . i barely paid any deposit since they offer $ 99 move-in promotion so i was expecting them to take it away , instead i got $ 40 back . yes , we did break the door so it was very reasonable . nothing else , they are really awesome . when i moved in , everything was super clean including carpet . they do take care of the property with pride . i miss durango and my strip view .	4407
1	i have been looking for an apartment for my mom for a while now . i found durango canyon by driving by and was pleasantly surprised . simone greeted me as soon as i walked in and was very knowledgable while showing us the models and explaining the application process . we rented the same day . floor plans are nice and cozy . if you rent there ask for simone she knows her stuff	4407
1	i love living here . maintenance is friendly and fast . my water heater broke the other day . i called the office , within 5 minutes there we here to check it and another 20 minutes i had a new water heater . the office staff is always nice and easy to deal with . i just got my carpet cleaned for free by the hi tech company they use . awesome job .	4407
1	do n't see why all the negative reviews . i love living here . layout of rooms are great , great kitchen amenities , great staff . talk to teri her name is . she 's the best one in the office imo . maintenance guys are slow that 's the only thing i got ta say but they get the job done rite and are always friendly . lived here for a year and probably a few more . new management recently but they are all about the people here from what i notice .	4407
1	terri is amazing , she 's so helpful and genuinely cares about the tenants ! if you visit durango canyon , ask for her !	4407
0	still a shit and slum lords own and run this property the pool has been completely disgusting looks like a swamp the hot tub at all pools have been broken all summer and incompetent staff have no idea how to be professional basically former criminals and if they are lucky middle school drop outs not an oz of common sense maintenence workers parking in handicapped spots wearing mud caked boots in apts to do work work orders are never done in timely manner i have notified the better business bureau the las vegas police and american with disabilities all 3 say that this company is well known for its shady practices and just straight up disrespectful of our laws	4407
0	horrible apartment complex . takes forever to get any kind of maintenance taken care of . it 's dog friendly and the entire complex is covered in dog shit . they have a dog park and you ca n't even see the fake grass because it 's covered in shit . the pools look like they have n't been cleaned in weeks . the trash cans are constantly over flowing with garbage . they have assigned parking and they allow anyone to park in the spots making it inconvenient for the actual renters . two shootings in 3 months . ca n't wait for my lease to be over	4407
0	to add to my recent review . went back to the apartment today to retrieve a few things we had left behind . because of the crime we left immediately and i 'm so grateful that we did because look what we returned to . office does n't even show any remorse . katie has the absolute worst attitude i have ever encountered . i felt like i was working with a snotty teenager . clean up your act durango canyon	4407
0	what a complete shit hole might as well be section 8 garbage everywhere , broken down cars , doors kicked , in none of amenities are working let alone clean we had water heater explode and they took a month to fix the damage then want to charge us for damage	4407
0	vandalisim on property weekly ... burned out lights all over property ... broken front and back gates ... . rotten gardeners ... trash , , . bugs ... ants ... maintenance , well good luck . 2-6 weeks before anyone shows up ... no return phone calls and of course , indifferent staff , could care less . been a huge disappointment ... mgr brian was fired because they suck ... 3 different managers in one year ... constant employee turnover ... pool closed for 2 months ... they do not take care of the property with pride ... beware	4407
0	no change still filthy . clients are getting more getto everyday . you have to lock everything with multiple locks . and block doors atnight . there have been some chsnges in office staff . the new staff seemd nice to date . i just call it like i see it . if its bad its bad if its good i will tell you .	4407
0	more water leaks fot an extended time . about a month near as i can tell from when the lawn guys were digging stumps . probably 2 gallons a minute .	4407
0	if i could give this place zero stars i would ! this place has gone way down hill . it has been nothing but trouble since i moved in here . the just increased our rent because they need to cover the cost of the ugly rocks that they put in . do n't move in here you will regret it day 1 ! !	4407
0	what a shitty management they hire ignorant workers who do as they please i have a maintenance guy who lives in my building and thay think its ok to park in handicapped spots with no reason except being lazy and ignorant management has been notified of this situation for 4 months and yet they have done nothing also do no park on property as cars are regularly broken into	4407
0	11 days later they come to fix garbage disposal but 1st the jackass maintenance guys try to walk in our place with mud and oil covered and i ask to take off shoes before coming in since they were nasty and the one said he would not take them off same maintenance guy who parks illegally in handicapped spots for a little help do n't hire these jackass maintenance guys they are coming into our homes have some respect remember we pay the bills and without the residents you would have nothing try a liitle respect and common courtesy american with disabilities says this is a horrible business so does better business bureau	4407
0	the worse place to live in . if upper management ever sees this . they should let unhappy families move out without breaking the lease . how many more complaints do you need to realize this place is horrible ? stop embarrassing your company and do something about it . i do n't even need to explain all the issues i 've experienced . so if there is a possibility to get out of this lease please let me know . why keep paying a place rent that makes you miserable ?	4407
1	these guys were awesome ! sharply dressed , funny , and extremely helpful and professional . perhaps one of the most fun shopping experiences i 've ever had . picked up an awesome , navy three-piece slim fit suit ! next time i 'm in vegas , i 'll definitely come back to shop here .	4408
1	great service . andrew ramos helped me with everything and anything i needed . above and beyond what i would expect . walked in with a deadpool t-shirt on and he did n't even blink and helped me the same as i would expect him to a high roller . would highly suggest !	4408
0	i walk i this store picked out 2 dress shirts and 2 ties for work lady was real nice to me , my wife walked in with my 2 kids and older daughter my daughter took a bite out of her pretzel the man behind the counter heals at her in the store saying mam you can not eat in this store she apologize right away and he said to a young lady no class any more ! the lady worker asked me if i was ready to check out ! really they just lost $ 400 dollars ... .. i will never return and tell all my friends and co workers about the bad service ... ..	4408
0	if you do n't mind being looked at like a criminal by some stuffy suited workers , that you 're not exactly sure are workers , whispering towards your direction and ignoring you ... .. then come here . once you want to purchase a $ 150 shirt they 're nice though .	4408
1	having been going to the joint at several locations throughout the valley i have found that each doctor is an individual and has there own style . no complaints over all . this location i have been using the last month . dr has been working out the stiffness in my back no issues or complaints . i did buy a plan and have been going weekly . i would recommend if your in need of chiropractic service give in them a try . dr kalish is dedicated to his profession and highly recommend .	4409
1	been coming here for over a year now . dr clark is amazing . neck and back adjustments .	4409
1	quick , friendly and informative . my first time ever receiving chiropractic service & i felt relieved after my alignment but was told i 'd feel a little sore the next day . i will be back	4409
0	wish i could get my money back , left worse than i went in . tried 2nd time and left without any relief . purchased a month of visits . my other chiropractor helps but not open on weekends so thought i would try this one .	4409
0	cancelled membership . enough said ... .go to another location unless you enjoy wasting money . location bounced chiropractors for several weeks and now they have a front end person that should be bounced .	4409
0	this place is a complete joke . i went in because i had a pain in my neck . the guy proceeds give me a 15 minute speech about how essential it is to get adjusted regularly . he then adjusts my back and hips , not once touching my neck . he finished by trying to sell me a package for 20 follow up visits . thanks for absolutely nothing .	4409
1	i only go to pueblo for all my imaging . this location is super busy , but they go through the patients quickly . they are open on saturdays too , which is a bonus . they give you your cd of your images at your appointment , if you request it . i would like to see more seating , but there is limited space . like i said , they move through the patients quickly , so it 's not a major issue .	4410
1	i had to get an mri scan . came 15 minutes early . checked in and was seen within 5 minutes . mri tech , jimmy was great took me into the mri room and i went through a tube for the scanning which was n't too bad ... just loud . it was scanned through radio frequency .	4410
0	they schedule you to come in early and still make you wait over an hour for your procedure . only came her because this is the only place my doctor refers ( i do n't know why ? ) all they had to do was call and let us know they were running behind ( is that really so hard ? ) seriously	4410
0	first time here and the service was poor . our appointment was for 4pm and we were seen at 5:05 once we went up to the counter and asked what the hold up was . whooops was the response . it took another 15 mins before we were called back . no apologizes , no nothing . the people seem to just hate their jobs here . will not be coming back .	4410
1	good quality and competitively priced products ! they are always honest about their recommendations . they have a really big selection of products to choose from and have always been wonderful to do business with . they are my go to for all my cellphone accessories needs .	4411
1	if you ever needed anything for cellphone accessories at wholesale prices , these are the guys to be with .	4411
0	stolen thousands of dollars from me . sold us garbage products and refuses to refund or return . do not buy !	4411
0	unfortunately we have attempted to do business with this business . from multiple and common `` misunderstandings '' to items consistently being mailed to the wrong address to this business refusing to take back defective displays after only 3 days of use . i would love to give them a 5 star review but they are refusing to stand behind their products . very disappointed with these guys and how they handle their business . spent over $ 10,000 with this business and have multiple open paypal disputes with them . beware	4411
1	i am a fan of espres salon . i originally found this salon through a groupon two years ago . i highly recommend asking and scheduling with lisa . . . she has been there since the early days of this eye appealing , clean and welcoming salon . i 'm not sure of all of her services , but i am sure of pedicures , nails and waxing . she brings a great comfort level to the venue . also , i recommend take a look-see on their website for any coupons or monthly pricing specials . enjoy yourself , we deserve it ! !	4412
1	i really love this place . my mom and i did a mother daughter spa day and we got signature mani pedis . i love the options for the herbal scrubs . i 've come here three times and i always leave happy . service is great and the prices are fair for the time they spend on you . and my pedicures last forever ! if i ever need my nails done , i 'd rather come here .	4412
1	my sister and i both had a very pleasant experience . i got a facial , and she got a pedicure . the staff was friendly and the owner was a good guy .	4412
1	stopped in for walk in pedicure with my daughter . kids pedicure a little pricey $ 25.00 . she was done in 10 minutes . would not recommend . melissa did my classic pedicure . she did a great job . i would recommend her . adult pedicure was worth the price .	4412
1	had a great experience at espres nails ... . 5 of us came in for bridal party manicures and pedicures . great service , everyone was happy with their feels and pedicures . plus the owner was really sweet ... and wanted to make sure we were all happy with the service we received !	4412
1	this place is super noice . the girls are very nice and the work they do is very good . honestly could n't want to go anywhere else with my business	4412
0	i got a bad vibe from the start when i walked in ... i live in the area and it 's convenient for me to come here so i 'm going to give it another try.. and hope it 's a better experience	4412
0	the owner mistreats and demeans his employees . he is cruel and heartless . all he cares about is how much he is going to make at the end of the day . i ca n't judge the quality of this place , but if you have a conscious and care about the way people are treated , do n't patronise his establishment . shame on you frank huang you need to learn some human kindness .	4412
0	the owner was not nice to me at all . he kept yelling at me to pick a nail polish faster . i spent about a minutes or two looking and apparently that was too long for him . my nail tech was friendly and did a great job but i would n't go back after the guy at the register yelled at me . he was more focused on getting me in and out than anything else . i 'm giving 2 stars instead of one because the nail tech was good .	4412
0	i liked the girl who did my nails and she did a nice job , however i feel like it was rushed . there was nothing relaxing about this place . they want people in and out , and for the prices they charge they should slow down . you can tell the manager only cares about making a ton of money fast and is very pushy up selling . you can tell that the staff has zero respect for the manager . the way he runs the place and treats his `` girls '' is very odd . i can not support a place like this .	4412
0	we waited 40 minutes for a simple manicure . we were told we were next- considering we were the only ones there . a few minutes later two customers walked in and were serviced before us . the owner was rude , unprofessional and just a jerk . we will never go back .	4412
0	unprofessional , over priced , not relaxing ! do n't go here unless you want to hear employees arguing , throwing tantrums , and paying $ 117 for a shellac mani/pedi . go to vega nails or royal nails , much better environment and prices ! !	4412
1	everyone is helpful , always get everything i need the first time i go in for it . to top it all off the staff is always friendly and help as much as i need . highly suggest pep boys to military folks as well because they honor us for our service , great people !	4413
1	always come here for quick friendly service . never disappointed with their work . the reason for 4 out of 5 stars is because the prices of the parts and service are quite a bit higher than the other part stores in the immediate area . for the service i am willing to pay for the additional cost , however , for the parts i try not too . deb the manager is awesome to work with !	4413
1	i always have pretty good experiences here . and i almost always take my car here for service , with the pep boys rewards , it definitely makes it worth it . i 've found the mechanics here to be honest about what service is needed , they do n't try to rake you over the coals and get you to do a bunch of unnecessary stuff . and there are usually good coupons online for whatever you need done that make the prices reasonable .	4413
1	pepboys are the best ! outstanding and unbeatable pricing ! friendly , fast and efficient staff , and very thorough . where everyone elae charges $ 397+ just for a part . the guys , and gals at pepboys are charging less than $ 2o0 for the same parts and include labor ! deb , youre the best too by the way ... am the warramties and extra assistance you all throw in is unbelievable ! love love love you all ! see u soon !	4413
1	they did a great job taking care of my car and what i needed . even went above and beyond to find me an antenna at the dealership .	4413
1	had a pair of 18 '' tires from tirerack mounted and balanced for $ 35.40 -- better than discount tire 's $ 50 price . after a short discussion , they even hand tightened the lug nuts , aka no air wrench tightening ( to reduce/prevent warping of the brake rotors ) . they were nice , helpful , relatively quick and did well with this task , as well as with other questions/issues that i had . i would come here again . and recommend to my friends/family .	4413
1	my car was giving my issues on a sunday , and pep boys was about the only place that was open . the sales people were very helpful and efficient , and my car was fixed very rapidly . i had the battery replaced , the oil changed and new wipers put on the car . i ca n't recommend them highly enough .	4413
1	does n't rain in too much in arizona but today it did . my wipers were in tatters on the verge of shredding off , popped in in a sunday to this place i honestly did n't even know was there . guided immediately into a bay then into the store to buy the wipers . helped outside and in by two uber-pleasant men . paid for the blades and they were installed in 2 minutes . i swear from entering to exit i was there less than 5 minutes . talk about great service !	4413
0	i came in for oil change . i have an appointment at 11am . service guys informed me it 'll take like an hour to do it . so , i 'm fine with it . it has been 1 hour and 30 min and my car is still not done and still in the garage . if i knew this will take this long , then i should 've cancelled or went on a different day . i 'm kinda frustrated and hungry at this point . oil change does n't take this friggin long . sorry not a happy customer .	4413
0	they suck , i ordered rims online for my car and the expected time of arrival was 2 days from when i ordered them . no biggie but after 3 days i called to get a update on my rims and the lady that answered said it would be 3 weeks . so i cancelled my order and the very next day they called and told me they were ready for pick up . i will never use pep boys for anything .	4413
0	i 'm not sure of the guys name that checked us in but his coustomer service skills are weak . he was very short and unprofessional . i work in the customer service field and would never treat a coustomer the way he did . we made our appointment yesterday for two today and they still have n't gotten to me car and are taken cars still from yesterday . wo n't be back .	4413
0	2 hours for an oil change . i was given no indication beforehand that there would be an extended wait . i had an appointment but still had to wait 2 hours .	4413
0	been here many tea , lots of employees , but i am never greeted or asked if i need any help finding anything . i 'm going elsewhere .	4413
0	they are crminal con artists , if it a simple problem , they wont tell you , .they will tell you they have to check this and that and charging you all the way , dont go here , they will screw you without the ky	4413
0	this place is extremely slow ! ! ! ! an hour and a half for a simple oil change . the car was up on the lift for almost an hour as the tech walked back and forth like he had all day to get done . not ever going back to this place .	4413
0	i had a 3 a clock appointment for a service that should take 30 min or less maybe an hour on a busy day . i came in for an oil change and tire balance and was quoted 2 hours ! and the reason why it took 2 hours you ask ? i was literally sitting in the waiting area watching not 1 or 2 but 3 techs standing around ! i understand people have certain things they focus on but every tech knows how to do an oil change and balance and if you are just standing there talking then pep boys need to figure out a better system .	4413
1	i had fletcher door and trim remodel my house , from baseboards to new new cabinets and granite . they did great work and were very professional . they showed up when they said they were going to , and completed the work on time.. i recommend them to my family and friends..	4414
1	jack was wonderful to work with ... we hired him to do baseboards and casing around windows and arches based on his yelp reviews , and we were happy we did . we learned that jack can do anything and everything ... sorry we did n't know that before ! but if we need anything done in our home , jack is 1st on our list . thanks , jack ! ! !	4414
0	i texted jack for a couple of estimates . never heard back . ran into him as he was doing work for a neighbor and asked again about getting an estimate . said he 'd gotten the text but was busy and he 'd come by in the next couple days . again nothing . no show or call or text . ran into him at home depot weeks later . asked one last time . gave me the same speech that he was well going to come by in the next couple days as he was working in the area . again no contact . my advice is contact someone else for any work you need done .	4414
0	do n't waste your time calling them . talked & texts about having some work done . waited at home all day on a day off . 5:30pm they text they are too busy & want to reschedule . told them it will be next week before i can get off work again . never got any response . unprofessional .	4414
1	definitely one of my favorite places to stay in lv . there 's no smoking in this hotel ! great pools and really good blue crap eggs benedict at the cafe .	4415
1	great hotel , good restaurants and a fun pool . very disappointed that the adult pool has been closed . it as been a fun tradition since it opened a few years ago .	4415
1	enjoyed my stay very much ! smoking rooms were not that bad as people make them out to be . do not use the coffee machine in the room they charge you 4 $ for it and i suggest checking in earlier than 3pm ,	4415
1	still like the hotel at mandalay bay . great rooms , very comfortable and relaxing . i like the soak-er tub , separate shower , tv in the bathroom ( so you can soak in your bubble bath and watch tv at the same time ) . hey a hard night partying and drinking and a little r and r is needed ... . rooms can be had at discounted rates and its nice to have a nice place to crash after enjoying the sites of vegas .	4415
1	i love this hotel ! i think it 's my favorite hotel in vegas . i 've stayed at quite a few including mgm , bellagio , mirage , palms place , and the four seasons . for a weekend of partying it 's my favorite . if i want peace and quiet i 'll take the four seasons or palms place . it 's really modern , relatively inexpensive for my tastes , separate bedroom , and 1 1/2 bath . that 's really convenient when one of my cheap friends needs a place to crash and i do n't want to be disturbed . hey it 's vegas , you never know when you may have an unexpected overnight guest .	4415
1	i loved this hotel . the rooms were comfortable , stylish and clean . the bath products in the rooms were awesome too . its a bit of a walk to the pool from this section of mandalay bay but thats ok. im sad thehotel is being converted into the delano .	4415
1	god i love this place , second time staying here , smoke free , everything is dark wood and large crystals for decor . it smells of coconut and burnt brown sugar . the rooms have a nice living room area and super large flat screen , bath and a half , and i love their lotion .	4415
1	the only reason i am not giving this hotel 5 stars is because of the smell in the hallways and the fact it is n't as contemporary of decor that i usually like . the guy at the front desk went above & beyond ! i had lost my debit card & he allowed me to block the incidentals . i told him i was celebrating my birthday and the weekend was kind of rough so he upgraded me to a king suite with a jacuzzi tub ! the service at this hotel is amazing and i really like their casino as well .	4415
1	love this place . if you want great service no interruptions , this is the place to stay . enjoyed dancing all night at the mix lounge . if you want to dance till you ca n't anymore this is the place to go to . the mix lounge is in the hotel . it closes until 4am . it 's great . the only thing i disliked about my room was that it was to dark , so if your curtains were closed you totally felt like you were in a dungeon .	4415
1	a little different from your usual casino hotel - there is no casino . this is an extension of the mandalay bay and is a lot calmer and reserved than the usual high passed atmospheres of other las vegas hotels . the beauty of this place is the private exclusive entrance that gives taxis a quick and easy drop off to the lobby which is steps away from the lifts to your room . a huge bonus is the room design . they have a separate living from from the bedrooms and two restrooms . the decor looks lovely but tarnished up close . a negative is the distance from the the strip it self - could be a positive depending on who you are !	4415
1	i 'd say this is 4.5 stars . i was very impressed by the suites of hotel at mandalay and the lcd tvs throughout the suite were a big plus for when i needed to relax after my gambling losses . ( sigh ) i 'm not sure how these compare to those at the wynn or venetian but it 's still pretty posh imo . there is n't much else special about thehotel except that it 's a separate tower away from the main casino area and they have mix which is a nice bar alternative with a spectacular view from the 50thish floor . that was cool . so for nicer accomodations while staying at mandalay otherwise i think the regular rooms are fine .	4415
1	very modern , clean , and innovative . nice spacious suites . away from mandalay but still walkable to the casino . has it 's own entrance so you do n't have to walk far to get in and out of the hotel . a small feature that i thought was cool was the do not disturb sign is digitally controlled by a button with a light up led in front .	4415
1	place was awesome great pool and the staff was great only reason i gave 4 and not 5 was because it is towards the end of the strip	4415
1	the pictures are right on . wave pool is awesome . price is not bad . 2 bathrooms is a def plus . there was never a wait in line for a cab . room has a huge tv and a dvd player . definite top 5 hotel in vegas and one of my favorite . could possibly have put a nicer sofa in the room .	4415
1	ok , have now had the pleasure staying at this hotel two times . pros : all suites separate reservation counter from the mandalay bay ( not as crowded ) you do n't even have to walk through or into the casino if you choose not too . comfortable beds big , spacious shower and tub two bathrooms cons : the rooms are nice and well appointed could use some updating however overall i like this place and will be back for sure .	4415
1	i checked in to this hotel recently and it was a pleasant one . its a short walk from the main main mandalay bay resort . rooms are big and nice decorated . i just wish the wall colors to be a little brighter because its very dark in there . the most fun was the beach with waves as well as the lazy river . lots of fine dine restaurant but choose wisely . not all fine dines are good . took my daughter to shark reef and she was truly amazed by it .	4415
1	love this side of the mandalay ! all brand new beautiful suites . loved our suite and all the new decor . so clean and pretty . pool is great for kids !	4415
1	this is the place to stay if you 're in vegas , no casino smelling like cigarettes , and absolutely beautiful . i loved it . i 've been to lv a couple of times before and stayed in the typical casino hotels , but if you want a nice classy hotel which reminds you of an upscale hotel in nyc , this is the place to stay . we stayed in the junior suite ... absolutely beautiful ... definitely worth the price . definitely .	4415
1	i always stay at the hotel..this time i went allout and did the huge penthouse suite 61st floor ... amazing sq footage..tons of big screens..3 bathrooms..jacquizzi..etc..the pools were fun..i just dont like paying $ 26 for a strawberry and rum iced drink by pool . each day by pool i spent about $ 200 bucks drinks and burgers/sandwiches . the casino is always super clean and fresh air . buffet a steal at $ 17.00 in am..late nite buffet prime rib shrimp cocktail n more amazing . its a 9 star not 5 star rating	4415
1	ein schönes hotel zum relaxen in der poollandschaft oder zum schlemmen in den zahlreichen restaurants . die zimmer sind super , geräumig und sauber . die minibar lässt keinen wunsch offen . das personal ist höflich und hilfsbereit .	4415
1	the best place to stay in vegas , period . can not wait to go back in december . all rooms are large suites . mine had wet bar and awesome view of downtown .	4415
1	vegas ... oh baby ... where the dark side in people come out to play . remember , what happens in vegas ... never happened . that said , the hotel at mandalay bay is the new hotel connected via the casino . all the rooms are suites and much higher in quality and much more impressive in decadence . i 've gone several times and have not been disappointed in the rooms . i highly recommend the hotel over mandalay if you can afford the difference in room charges .	4415
1	quick update to note that the hotel contacted me directly , addressed my concerns , and made me confident that another stay there would not have the same issues !	4415
1	las vegas & 3 flat screens in einer suite lage : direkt neben dem mandalay bay am südlichen ende des strip . bahn bis zum excalibur , taxi oder bus zur fortbewegung . nobody walks in las vegas , zumindest im sommer . einrichtung : modern , neuwertig , gemütlich essen : - nicht in anspruch genommen - personal : sehr freundlich , der sterneanzahl angemessen fazit : super , aber in las vegas ist abwechslung gefragt . nächstes mal ist ein anderes hotel dran .	4415
1	we did n't stay at a hotel in vegas , we stayed at thehotel at mandalay bay . ok , i wonder how many other people said that ? excellent hotel which heightened the experience of vegas . the rooms were modern and very comfortable . one of the highlights of the place was the awesome pool they had there . so many hot babes there , it was unbelievable . zipzap zubidy bop !	4415
1	would be five stars if it was n't attached to the lackluster mandalay bay , where the pools close way too early to actually visit and the casino is sad and boring . the hotel rooms at thehotel though - spectacular ! i stayed at mandalay last time and it was subpar . these were all suites , with a half bath in the front room . awesome for having people over just to hang out without having to be at a loud bar or smelly casino . lovely decorating , tons of space , comfy bed . i was here four nights and enjoyed it a ton .	4415
1	i like this hotel for two reasons : mix lounge on the 64th floor ( amazing views ) and fleur by hubert keller , the french tapas place ( delicious ) . i have n't stayed here so i ca n't comment on the rooms , but if you 're looking for a place to stay , you 'll be definitely be surrounded by good places to hang out and eat .	4415
1	the whole hotel smelled like a spa . this was an awesome hotel experience and i will definitely be returning . be sure to go to the burger bar .	4415
1	this place reminded me of chic nyc apartment decor.. you know , that friend who has furniture that all matches and is modern but not overly so ? love the plasmas too.. risk : it 's still in vegas reward : and you 're proximate to the mandalay pool !	4415
1	i got upgraded to this hotel from mandalay bay for my birthday ! ! the wonderful staff upgraded me to a 1 bedroom suite ! i must say out of all the hotels i have stayed at this was by far the best one . the suites are great ! ! i also loved the wonderful michael jackson tribute and pictures they had in the show area very nice ! however there is a funny smell in the elevator area and in the hallways . smells like a sewer ! ! but after so many drinks lol i didnt even notice anymore . thats why i give 5 stars ! !	4415
1	i love this place and due to a `` hook up '' have stayed in a penthouse suite the last two visits . awesome - amazing steam shower - great toiletries - stellar customer service - the view from the 61st floor un-cool - no coffee makers - no mp3 player hookups or place for an axillary cord in the penthouses so i could n't jam to my tunes .	4415
1	i stayed at the hotel june 20th in an h suite . i paid about $ 145 for a sunday night . the room was in the corner facing the luxor , and was clean and spacious . the hotel was experiencing elevator problems , and it took about 45 min from check in to room . i love this hotel . pool is best in vegas . do n't be cheap , upgrade to all suite hotel ... worth every penny .	4415
1	one of the best rooms ive stayed in . the hotel front desk were great , they treated me like i was a multi millionaire . the hotel is clean and it smells clean . i love the little restaurants downstairs . it was classy and can you imagine i just sat there with this girl and drank wine all night . the spa was great too . this hotel was made for the single individual who likes some of the finer things in life .	4415
1	stayed here on our birthday weekend and overall it was a nice room . for the price and suite size , it was a good deal . it had 2 bathrooms , one for the living room area and a master . bed was comfy , and bathroom was nice with a huge oversized soaking tub and a flat-screen tv in there to watch while showering , etc . one downer was it 's at the extreme end of the vegas strip , but other than that it was a nice hotel . overall , nice hotel/room , okay price , okay service .	4415
1	loved the hotel . great rooms . smells amazing . best pool in vegas ! will return again !	4415
0	just stayed last 2 nights . been there 3 years in a row . ( barrett jackson ) hotel cutting back . coffee in room $ 4.00 a cup- joke . burn hole in comforter and ripped bed skirt no turndown service any more , service at pool slow and pool so over crowded . this is my first review , but felt people should know the rooms were $ 500 night on 8 th floor over hvac units . service at front desk and concierge was also not helpful . overall there must be better hotels and service in vegas . too bad as we have always enjoyed this property	4415
0	how could a resort go so bad so fast . soiled linen and poor maid service would normally turn me off . however from august 28 to september 3 , 2013 the smell of raw sewerage emanating throughout the elevators , lobby and up to our 8th floor was outright disgusting . throw in my casino host and hotel manager saying they did n't smell it was the last straw . i am out never coming here again : (	4415
0	so , i actually got a very nice response ( not like the form letter above ) , where they acknowledged `` their bad '' and and offered a comped room for one night 's stay good for year . oh , but i am required to still pay the `` resort fee '' - i 'm sorry , that 's f* # ( ing insulting and a scam .	4415
0	very disappointed with the valet and room service . i had to unload my own car at valet and i never received my room service . all they did was cancel my room-service order when it was going to arrive over an hour late and did n't even appologize ! i want to change resorts immediately ! i 've worked in the hotel industry and this is no way to treat a guest ! especially when your not sold out . -room 3916	4415
0	a group of us checked in and had had an amazing experience ... until we arrived at the the hotel . steve at the front desk was full of attitude when we checked in , and was n't willing to honor the rewards that we were told we could have honored . he was not apologetic or polite , and unbending in his feeling that he was right- not exactly customer service oriented . he did n't exactly reaffirm that we were at the hotel . i kind of felt like we were at do n't hotel . the rooms are pretty and they let us check in early . steve needs improvement .	4415
0	good hotel . bad location if you plan being on strip . hotel is at end of strip and slighty behind strip.check in was quick process . resort fee aweful , didnt even get a daily newspaper which i paid for in resort fee . clean hotel .	4415
0	the hotel itself is beautiful , but way too big . there is always a conference of some sort going on , so be prepared to wait 10-20 minutes for an elevator . not very efficient . it 's also very loud . excellent pool though .	4415
0	messed up the reservation and made condescending effort to fix it . horrible place . mgm group is the worst .	4415
0	i used to love staying at this place . my mistake in booking i was not aware of the construction , but i was given a renovated room . it was so new the couch was too stiff to sit on comfortably and the pillows were like sleeping on a curb they were a foot thick and hard . i slept on my arm for comfort . at 5 am i was awoke by construction hammering in the room above me , however when i called down it stopped 5 minutes later . the staff was rude as well . not sure i 'll come back to this place ever again or recommend it .	4415
0	if i could give these guys a -10 i totally would . horrible service , horrible experience . my fiancé and i usually stay at the wynn so maybe my expectations were a little too high .	4415
0	my wedding band was stolen from my room here and security sucked no help at all ! loved this hotel till then . was married there too . so sad	4415
0	worst hotel . tv in my room is from the 90 's and makes a radiating noise . they call this room a suite ... .	4415
0	robbed while asleep at `` the hotel '' security did not want to make a report . they wanted it swept under the carpet . the person came into our room while we were there and sleeping . you would think that they would care- but they did not .	4415
0	this is our third day here and we 've received room service once . and when they did come service the room , all they did was make the beds , they did not touch the bathroom . consequently , we had to call for towels , it took three phone calls to housekeeping to receive them . also , the hallway smells really bad , have n't figured out what the smell is yet . we 're here for another night so hopefully things will improve .	4415
0	the suites here are fairly spacious and would be pretty nice if only they were cleaned adequately . the housekeeping staff seems to spend most of its time talking in the hallways rather than actually cleaning . there were leftover clothing items in our room and the front desk staff was n't too apologetic . i 'm not sure what plans the delano has for fixing this place , but it should probably start with the staff .	4415
0	stayed here for the second time this weekend , and the hotel is a disaster . service at guest services is dreadful , from your room , it takes more than 6 minutes for anyone at the front desk to answer a phone . most of the building is under construction , switching from thehotel to delano and all of the grounds are limited since construction is underway . the floors where rooms are located smell like heavy cigarettes , and the overall staff ( with the exception of housekeeping which was phenomenally helpful ) was unhelpful . amenities in this building were not available , and we had to use those in mandalay bay which although connected , was very far away .	4415
0	from the looks , this hotel rock ... but do n't be fooled , it 's a shit hotel made to look nice from the outside . i 'm on floor 5 and can hear every sound from the club below . the walls are paper thin and i wo n't be ever staying here again . make up on a huge pig .	4415
0	this hotel smells like a dirty bar that has n't cleaned their pipes in years ! for the amount of money this place makes they can at least make it smell nice . the only thing that saved this place for me was the house of blues and the foundation room .	4415
0	well . this was the 24 hours to stay in this hotel . at first i get room floor 14 it was smelly and noisy . than they transfer me to floor 3 , but it still smelly and noisy . than they transfer me to 20 floor that was only noisy . than i left this poor place to other hotel . and i feel great ! ! !	4415
0	perfect hotel if you prefer horrible service . want a coffee or newspaper in the morning ? you only have to wait an hour . turndown service ? forget it . lunch at the restaurant that is empty ? sorry for the 30 minute wait but we have no servers ( they are on break at 12:30 )	4415
0	check in process takes over 3 hours . connected to mandalay bay , where you ca n't get a good meal at any price . rooms are large but poorly maintained . left feeling nickered and dimed at every turn . $ 25.00 to purchase a inter tube to use the `` lazy river '' , they do n't rent . assaulted by marketing even in the elevators . $ 12.00 for a pack of smokes . no relaxing pool side as pop music is blaring all day long . never , never again . just a big glizzy shithole	4415
0	hoped for the best , got 'meh ' . pros : quiet , 2 toliet rooms , linens were luxurious , bed was very comfortable , very clean and smelled fresh , mini shoe polish sponge was unique and useful , customer service . cons : room was dark ; dark furnishings , dark paint , low light . no mini fridge for use , no shower gel/bath bubble just soap , plasma tv really ? ( no ) , $ 8 for in-room coffee , room not cleaned until we called , $ 25 per day resort fee . with so many places to choose from in vegas , we will not stay here again . would stay @ mandalay bay side again though .	4415
0	i like how the people that give the hotel the 5 stars..awwmygod thats awesome !	4415
0	thought i would give them another try . this visit was no better . no coffee . no newspaper . no turndown service . no bellman . but alarm clock works great . goes off all night without even setting it !	4415
0	the rooms are nice , bed is comfy , tub is huge , 2 bathrooms one with a double sink , stylish . the room is really noisy . we had a corner room with a nice view but we can hear music bumping on the 20th floor , probably coming through the vents . there 's some weird rattling noise and some other noise ( maybe the elevators ? ) going on all the time , really annoying . the housekeeping has been pretty ridiculous , 1 day out of 4 they came to clean the room without me asking 5 times . overall i 'd stay somewhere else .	4415
0	it smelled like toilet in the lobby and the room we got was really small . their room service food was not good at all . i know that room service is pricey anywhere but if i order a berry shake , please do n't give me berry soup . the bathroom was nice but i think all bathrooms in vegas are nice . it was a place to crash and convenient too since we went to light and daylight but i think i 'd trade in the convenience for a nicer room .	4415
0	i will never stay here again ! ! hire some housekeepers that can clean . our suite is dirty & dusty .	4415
0	very disappointed . never , ever again . no attention to detail . bathroom fixtures falling off . room was dirty . linen was stained with what looked like rust . casino was crowded and smokey . pool was dirty with a million people in it . lazy river was at a stand still because there were too many people in it . next time , only the wynn !	4415
0	we did get contacted by mandalay bay and got some money back . nice of them but do n't think we 'll stay there ever again . all the issues could of should of been addressed at the time .	4415
0	called to find out how much to get a suit pressed - it was like pulling teeth to get the info . they kept referring to alterations , just on pants , etc . how much to press a two piece suit ? restaurant could n't seem to understand the request for cocktail sauce with oysters . they brought ketchup . the mini-bars are notorious for having magnets or weight sensors , so if you touch anything it might appear on your bill .	4415
0	we have stayed here many times . always been huge fans and even paid for others to visit a few times . but the last trip was a bummer . the place is starting to show its age and the staff is rude . i can deal with the aging rooms if they would smile and treat people like they appreciated the business . but we are not going back any time soon . i think we 'll head mid strip for a while .	4415
0	gave me a handicap room when i did n't order one . said they do n't gurantee me a room unless i pay a fee . ridiculous and stupid ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : - (	4415
0	i wish i 'd read the reviews on yelp before booking a room here . it really is a 1-2 star hotel hiding behind the mandalay bay facade . multiple issues . first , booked mandalay bay and ended up here . second , tiny , room on the other side of the complex . third , it 's just lacking a lot of really basic amenities and services . while superficially high-end the experience is like staying in a freeway-side motel where you pay in cash . unfortunately the booking rate is the same as the mandalay . my advice is stay away unless you like the feeling of being fleeced .	4415
0	my wife and i stayed here for four days on the second night i notice our bag was opened and went through . i called the front desk and they basically laughed at it like it was nothing . on the last night we were there we arrived back at our hotel room to find our stuff all over the room and many items stolen . the staff still did n't seem to care and said that this kind of thing never happens i call b.s . on that one because reading other reviews tells me otherwise . stay away from this place ! !	4415
0	very disappointing . the view from 4-914 is of nothing . the room is old , the tv is from 1998 , the furniture is falling apart and the rug is a new level of nasty that i have not seen in a while . and i got to pay extra for this upgrade ! not to mention that i just got a 120 volt shock from the light switch on the wall . that was a nice surprise . needless to say , i will not be coming back anymore or recommending this place to anyone .	4415
1	the original roofing company met a few challenges as they planned , staffed , and completed my roofing job . the work is spot on , and any issues i am sure will be taken care of as professionally as they handled my project . in today 's construction workplace specialty contractors must meet daily staffing challenges , they must deal with unknowns , and they are charged with pleasing the client . i am happy to say that the original roofing company did what every contractor should do , and performed their contract . hat 's off to toni lumpkin for outstanding customer service , and help along the way .	4416
1	it has been almost a year since we had our existing roof replaced and we are happy to report that we have no leaks ! we would highly recommend the original roofing company as our experience with this company was exceptional from beginning to end . from the first phone call to our appointment and proposal to the actual work , cleanup and inspection everyone we dealt with was extremely professional . we wish we could remember everyone 's name but kyle was the estimator and bill did the final inspection . a job well done at a fair price ! mr. & mrs. geers	4416
1	we had a very good experience with this company . they did everything they said they would plus more . we felt they were reasonable and gave us a better recommendation for what needed to be done than the two other companies we contacted .	4416
0	do n't waste your time if you are a single home owner . we contacted them and asked for an estimate and never received one . they came out and told us they would send us one in 24/48 hours . they did n't follow through . we called the office and the first question was `` is this residential or commercial ? '' once we responded residential , the manager had no time for us . we were told we could have one if we wanted . hmmm ... i called for an estimate but no thank you now . definitely went with someone else .	4416
0	should have read the yelp reviews before i called this roofing company . i received a text message that tony the estimator would be out at the scheduled time the night before and a text message the day of the appointment . did tony ever show up ? no . what a waste of time . the girl in the office apologized and said she could not get a hold of tony . i asked for a call back and did i get that ? no .	4416
0	i went on these guy 's website and filled out the form to request an estimate several weeks ago . i was never contacted by anyone at the company to schedule an appointment , but now i receive spam email from them . like other reviewers have said , they probably just were n't interested in my one residential job , but did n't hesitate to put me on their spam email list . what they did n't know was that i own multiple houses in vegas . guess who will definitely never work on any of them ...	4416
1	dr. schulman removed a tumor from my little toe last august . the first and second days after surgery , i only took aleve ... ..a little throbbing , but certainly not oxycontin worthy . today i went back for my 6 mo checkup ... ... you ca n't see where the incision was and there is no scar ! ! this dr. is so nice and obviously very good ! i 'm extremely pleased and will highly recommend dr. schulman in the future .	4417
1	dr. schulman has been my podiatrist and foot surgeon for more than 10 years . i have seen him for various concerns including custom orthotics , plantar fasciitis , treatment of gout and most recently , surgery for a great toe cheilectomy and a plantar fasciotomy on the same foot and at the same time . the surgery went great and exactly as he described . healed quickly . the concern and professionalism he shows his patients is remarkable . easy to get in for appointments and typically runs on time . i would highly recommend dr. schulman for any podiatry needs and have done so many times over the years .	4417
0	i have had toenail fungus issues for years and believed that the `` fda approved '' laser treatment would help . it did not and they only thing i got from this medical office was `` there is no guarantee '' but after $ 750 and no improvement at all i have to believe that this treatment is as big a scam as the unapproved treatments .	4417
0	was told my walking boot would be zero dollars with my treatment as there was one on amazon for $ 80 . i was assured it would be free . it was $ 210 and i 'm being harassed by their billing department . get everything in writing . these people are full on scam artists .	4417
1	just moved to brentwood and right down the road was this bar . exactly what a great dive bar is . great bartender . ca n't wait to go again .	4418
1	the bar staff is awesome and very attentive to my needs every time i 'm here . they offer $ 2 you call it happy hour every day from 4-6 and all day sunday 's ! ! ! ! ! ! ! monday nights they have a wing special $ .25 from 6-10 , tuesday 's is $ 1 1/4 # burger nights . i love it and we continue going there . also there are open from noon to 2 am everyday and are open every holiday with modified hours	4418
0	new in town and my boss ( of a reputable local establishment ) recommends i go here for a drink and some good time . i go to order a drink they card me fine , but turned away because of a out of state license . see ya later theme . ridiculous ! ! ! the state store was happy to take my money . call and they say it 's just a policy . wow . what kind of business turns away people like that . needles to say , my boss will no longer recommend them to anyone .	4418

1	went yesterday and bought macaroons , chocolate triomphe , and le bonbon . high quality and wonderful taste . very beautiful pastries ! employee was very pleasant to talk with . authentic french pastries . we will return !	4419
1	absolutely amazing ! highly recommend ! outstanding atmosphere and incredible food/drinks ! !	4419
1	we would go again if in the area and had time to kill but felt like everything was average from the service to the decor to the pastries . we liked the lemon citron but the chocolate dessert was average . tea and coffee were good but pricey . it might be best to share a pot of coffee or tea . it 's a cute , neat place to go once , but i would n't go all of the time .	4419
1	a charming little place with a fantastic coffee service , served in a french press on a glittering tray . and they have almond milk . my only complaint is that the counter looks cluttered , and the refrigerated space look like storage , with lots of boxes stacked inside .	4419
1	lovely little patisserie . my french press was delicious as were the macarons . the macaron choices were unfortunately slim to none ... i could only get two and they were n't flavors i would usually go for .	4419
1	i wanted to purchase some macarons for my dear friend in kirtland , ohio . after searching the web , i found coquette patisserie . i emailed britt-marie if she could mail the cookies to my friend if i paid for the shipping costs . britt said for a small fee she would have them delivered to my friend 's home . i live in fort worth , texas and we just do n't not have this kind of customer service at all . britt has gone above and beyond to make this experience special for me and my friend . i highly recommend this bakery for any of your needs . i ca n't wait to visit in person when i am in cleveland .	4419
1	the most lovely service was had at this establishment . i stopped in to decompress a bit following an interview near by and enjoyed a pot of green tea . i felt welcomed and my questions were answered , i was able to make change for the parking meter no problem , and i was n't made to feel bad to use the bathroom and get settled before ordering . the space is really calming and several people were there working . i would likely spend a good amount of time in this spot if i was local , the pastries looked great and the cheese and charcuterie boards , as well as wine and beer options also sounded great .	4419
1	this place is darling and the girls are so sweet . it 's a treat place so do n't come here hungry . sometimes the music is loud if you 're visiting with a beau but it 's always fun romantic old stuff . ambiance charming . i came for the macarons but it 's the champagne and triumph dessert i enjoy best . french press coffee will give you life , i promise .	4419
1	the best macarons my family has had- just as good as those in paris . when was the last time you ordered 8 flavors of an item , and all were winners ? that happened to us today .	4419
0	i was looking forward to visiting this place based on the reviews . it sounded like such a cute place with great treats and a cozy atmosphere . i was extremely disappointed . the staff was rude beyond belief , acted like i was an inconvenience to serve and we were the only people in the place . the food was even worse . i had the quiche and got food poisoning from it . do n't go here ! !	4419
0	if you go to their website they have a ton of different macaron and pastry options . but when you walk in you feel you 've entered a coffee shop that has a few snacks to choose from . i knew that they would n't have all options available but i thought there would be more than 5 macaons on display . i was looking for a pastry shop and walked into a coffee shop .	4419
0	we went at night on a weekday . the server forgot 1 out of 2 orders . we ordered desserts . they tasted as if they were there for a very long time . it was also very cold ; and nobody cared to close the door .	4419
0	so disappointed ! i ordered cheesecake and tiramisu . cheesecake is salty and had a funny taste without any crunchy crust ... tiramisu is more like a chocolate cake without any indication of coffee flavors ... and i even find a piece of hair in my takeout box ... . i guess i will stick to the cake royale in west side market then ... .	4419
0	over priced tarts , ordered something for thanksgiving and spent more than $ 80 on two tarts and both were not edible ( chocolate and pecan/mixed but tart ) , we ended up tossing it . the main thing this place is nice for is ambience and a quick `` french-cliche '' fix . the place during the day is filled with stay at home moms -- night is filled with college students looking for a sophisticated break . the place is a nice contrast to chain pastry shops , so i do recommend supporting this business , but no impressed . over priced without much to the pastries , desserts and especially the inedible tarts .	4419
0	did n't love the macarons . i was very excited as i had read some reviews , and the flavors listed were pretty awesome . however they were quite dry and the service had a very `` serve and leave '' attitude . the flavors made me want to try another in case it was just the one i had but i did n't have time and do n't feel like coming back when i am in town .	4419
0	the shelves were half empty and the macaroons were very stale . the coffee was good , but did not save our experience here . i would suggest that they keep the sugar bowl filled .	4419
0	i travel often for work and have made a commitment to buy local when possible . stopping here feels like this is a bad decision . the girl behind the counter seemed disoriented and was not very helpful in helping me decide on what i wanted . she assukedbi wanted coffee when all i wanted was coffee and a pastry . next time i 'm in cleveland i will skip this place	4419
0	nice atmosphere but our desert was sub-par and the selection was scarce . willing to give it another try .	4419
1	i called to make a same day appointment and was serviced by lisa . she was fantastic and gave great recommendations . i booked a mani pedi with the retreat . i could n't decide on bail colours and she showed me four different colours on my nails to help me decide . very professional and very clean . great service and great addition to the area ! will definitely be back .	4420
1	just had the best nail experience i 've had in over a year . i had an appointment with lisa who did an amazing job with everything i asked of her ( which was a lot ) . we sat together for about 4 hours and she sweet and detail oriented the entire time . the salon is very clean and all i the girls were very nice and friendly . for the first time in a long time i am excited for my next nail appointment .	4420
1	this place is amazing ! showed the lady a photo of what i wanted , and she did it exactly as shown . very clean space and kind staff . i am definitely coming back here regularly for my manicures .	4420
0	although this place is very clean and nice looking . my nails lasted 3 days . had to return to get them redone . then they lasted another 3 . poor quality . very expensive . will not be returning . ca n't comment on other services . but their gel shellac manicure was terrible .	4420
0	we received shellac manicures and had tips added to some of the nails . the tips were uneven and the lengths did not match with the rest of the nails . one nail was filed round on one side and square on the other . while the atmosphere , staff and space is beautiful , the quality of the services are subpar . unfortunately , would not go back for nails .	4420
0	i 'm a person who do n't usually complain but i just want to air out what 's on my mind . for me , it the worst massage i have ever experienced ! i think the masseuse does n't even know what she was doing ! and the worst part was that she was on the phone during the massage and facial . i felt that happy hour promotion was not worth it !	4420
1	i bring my adult developmentally disabled daughter here and they are phenomenal , professional , timely and knowledgeable . we have always had great service . we have seen a number of doctors . they return calls promptly and are very helpful .	4421
1	i love dr. donald c. i went to another doctor because she was closer and ended up in the hospital because the new doctor thought i had a brain bleed . i had a migraine . 5k later i went back to cunningham . he knows medicine and has become a trusted doctor for me . the front office has had it 's ups and downs over the years but i love all of them now and dr. c 's assistant val is the best shot giver ever ! i 've been a patient for over 10 years and know where they were and where they are now . it 's so much better ! will drive the 23 miles . he is worth it .	4421
1	this place is awesome ! ! i felt so cared for and well taken care of . mrs. lamendola is the best very knowledgeable she listened to me and answered all my questions ; also her assistant is awesome very upbeat and friendly .	4421
1	dr cunningham has been my family physician for 15 years . he is always pleasant to see and is respectful of my time . no complaints here , just courteous medical care by a great office . thank you !	4421
1	i 've been coming here for years . i have only seen dr kareus and he does an excellent job . he is very concerned about your health and well being also a very knowledgeable doctor . if you come here see him .	4421
1	i had to write a review due to the lack of stars ! ! i was a new patient here . i had an amazing experience with each appt i had . dr.cunningham is the best doctor i 've ever seen ! he actually cares about your health . my appointments are always on time and the staff is very friendly . being new here to arizona i 'm grateful i have found my primary doctor . this office is also very easy to find !	4421
1	i had zero issues , new patient , complete work-up , nice staff in and out within 45 minutes . only complaint was my referrals took several weeks and a few phone calls . i can write off 2 weeks due to insurance but after that i was a bit disappointed that i had to call and leave messages for couple more weeks . overall , i will see how things go , hopefully that was a one time mishap . # bepositive ( my family physician went to `` teaching '' so completely bummed about that and pueblo is only a hop , skip and jump away . )	4421
1	dr cunningham has been my family physician for 15 years . he is always pleasant to see and is respectful of my time . no complaints here , just courteous medical care by a great office . thank you !	4421
1	i have been going here for years and the entire team has held my hand and guided me through many health concerns more so than any physicians office anywhere . they are good about scheduling me in asap and the staff is warm , friendly and most importantly professional . they have always been incredibly kind in taking time with me to explain the importance of this and that regarding any health concerns . they do n't just treat an ailment but show concern in keeping me on track physically . i would highly recommend if you want to be more than just a number ... . call pueblo !	4421
0	yep this practice is horrible . always wait 30 minutes past appt time , constant turnover . front staff is clueless , never follow up . weeks to get referrals , etc . run do n't walk away from this place .	4421
0	worst experience , constant turnover , always rushing to find out the best way they can make money off of you and if they ca n't - they will try to sneak out of your appointment . shameful treatment of people seeking healthcare , especially adam schwarz , what a jerk ...	4421
0	awful experience . after putting up with rude front desk staff and inaccurate lab results i finally left . every time you go they will take your blood from their in house lab . it 's not necessary and they 've misread the results . the front desk staff is the most unfriendly i 've ever encountered and if you need test results for another doctor good luck getting them to provide the right results for the current year . how hard is that ? turn over of pa and np is high -- do you blame them for leaving ? like i said , i left and i 'm a lot happier !	4421
0	i have been going to dr. kareus for years . in his absence i have had to go to the senior dr. cummingham . he is rude , rushes through the exam , does not listen to his patients , and had a pain doctor call me for an appointment rather than allowing me to choose my own . he , also , put me through a series of tests and has not called to give me the results as dr. kareus always did . not knowing if dr. kareus is coming back is why i have endured this arrogant doctor but after my last visit i will not return .	4421
0	i 've been a patient of pueblo family physicians for 8 years , however , no more . vey bad treatment from the front desk girl mary ann . unprofessional and dangerous . re-think .	4421
0	ugh ! ! the staff is horrible and not professional at all , very rude , never pleasant , almost as if they all give you an attitude , the only reason i come over is because is near my house , otherwise , i would never come again ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4421
0	dr. cunningham is great ( at least in my experience with him ) . however , the office staff is a joke ! not organized at all ... and no concern for their patients . do yourself a favor and locate an office that will actually put your needs first ; because this one will not .	4421
0	absolutely horrible staff . not one doctor is able to sit and talk for 5 minutes . they make you go through so many tests so they get money from the insurance companies . on top of that they almost never get your prescription refilled easy . they never respond if you leave a message with the triage . by far the most stressful place to get medical help .	4421
0	if this is what healthcare is becoming , we are doomed . i went to this practice because my new insurance prevents me from seeing my regular dr. by reading the other review , it is obvious that this practice is going down . it is impossible to talk to anyone else but the receptionist , she then refers me to a voice mail they call it triage . i left 3 messages over 2 days and no one ever called back .	4421
1	thus far , i have had nothing but a pleasant experience at this home depot ! friendly employees and they offer military and i believe veterans discounts .	4422
1	love home depot ! the staff are amazing and super helpful , and the place is very well organized !	4422
1	i bought most of my material here to redo my townhouse . they are very helpful . if you ask for something you can not find , they will lead you to it and hang around to answer questions and be even more helpful . i purchased a product that they sell . rejuvenate . excellent product . i have used the grout cleaner , floor restorer and soap scum cleaner . all 3 products worked and did what they said they would do ! ! thank you hd for selling it .	4422
1	home depot just returned an item with no receipt and no rag . the gave me credit and the plumbing rep offered to help me with the issue i was having . excellent service ! !	4422
1	thank you bill for your help last night and today for your humor ! it is critical we keep our sense of humor while doing a home project . this location has been great all along	4422
1	i had a bad first experience with paint so i went back spoke with warren he took the time to explain everything to me . he also replaced my paint and brushes and set me up for success . the next time i need paint i will definitely come see him .	4422
1	love this home depot . basically live there . great people , especially in plumbing and hardware !	4422
1	these guys are good . i go into at least two different home depots a day this one by far is the best . sharon near the pro check out always has a smile on her face does n't matter what time of day it is . i go out of my way to go to the store when i can .	4422
1	i have always hated shopping at home depot but had the best experience at this location . i needed nails , screws , a level , a stud finder , a bathtub plug and a blacklight . i found an employee , rose , who turned into my personal shopper . she explained what nails would work best for my project . she took me from aisle to aisle filling my cart with the best priced version of the items i needed . rose was amazing !	4422
0	sucks . i 'm there trying to buy texture for paint and four guys in that department are all busy bullshitting , except for the black man that is there to work and help people . also , i bought a toilet a month ago and they said someone would contact me in two days . a little over two weeks after my son and i ended up installing it they called . one star because i had too .	4422
0	my husband and i came to this home depot to buy a french door patio door . when we asked for help the female clerk in the door area told us that the doors were on `` such and such '' row and `` if you need any help just holler '' . really ? very poor customer service .	4422
0	counted 19 people in line for self check no registers open . and when asked to open another register that said they do n't do that any more .	4422
0	experience review- i picked up a can of clear spray paint and red paint came out , ruining a project that took several hours and materials exceeding $ 50 , all for a mislabeled $ 4 paint can . phil replaced the spray paint can but would n't do a thing about the rest . my day off is screwed and all i get is yet another orange apron walking away from me . i hope i never need their services again . otherwise the store is stocked with things i buy , so why bother with 1 star when at least most of the place is adequate . it 's just a damn box store .	4422
0	if you need to get locks rekeyed that were n't purchased here do n't go to this location , only the home depot on crismon and southern still does that . the hardware associate went so far as to tell me it was `` unlawful '' for them to do so..	4422
0	people that are working in the blind apartment or some the most inapt incompetent people i have ever dealt with did nothing but waste my time and money the customer service at home depot is getting worse and it is at walmart this fucking sad	4422
0	shopping today at this branch on way home from work , appalled at the argumentative indifference displayed by a cashier to an az state armed forces veteran 's id . quoted 1-800 homedepot phone number stating this depot would no longer honor the valid dd214 az state driver 's identification . last visit at this location .	4422
0	super rude not friendly staff . kinda yelled at me on the phone and did n't even really help my situation .	4422
0	if you are a veteran , avoid this home depot . many of the home depots in the valley give all veterans a 10 % discount , but not this one . well i guess it is off to lowe 's for this purchase or amazon .	4422
1	my hubby and i decided to go to nc music factory for our friday night date nights over the summer . we always had a blast ! music was great , and we always went over to the saloon to eat afterward . they have really good food . friday night quickly became my favorite night of the week !	4423
1	a fine group of places to see shows and a welcome addition to charlotte . i do n't really go to places like these to plan on eating/drinking but to listen to music and be entertained and i always have been when attending shows at any of the venues . just reviewed twc amphitheatre after attending the smashing pumpkins show this week and it 's just one more piece of a well constructed puzzle .	4423
1	friday night live concerts are a great excuse to go uptown to the nc music factory . you can rent a table at osso or just take your chances hanging out in front of the stage . it is nice to have so many options for dining & drinks . we always stop by vbgb after the concert , and if it is a long night , drop into mattie 's for a late night bite to eat .	4423
0	parked my car with valet , while wet willies was fine . my car was gone through by one of the valets and things were stolen ameripark will do nothing about this because i did not search my car before i left . if you want to go here i suggest you expect one of there valets to dig through the stuff in your car and take what they like ameripark will do nothing they clearly support the drug addict thieves they have working for them . i will not go back .	4423
0	the price for up front seats was absurd at 700. and 14.00 for a beer ? .. are they f-ing kidding the bathrooms a mile away other wise the earth wind & fire show was pretty good.however there are alot of other shows that are free the kannapolis ampher theater venue was a real nice show no pretensiosness just a great time , show , fireworks , and the concessions didnt epty our pockets we saw the little river band what a show and did i mention it was f r e e !	4423
0	potential to be a great concert venue . inconsistent enforcement of rules for tailgating , lawn chairs and parking resulted in altercations that i do n't want my family exposed to .	4423
1	my daughter is getting her hair done and jannette is doing an amazing job ! thank you ! must come here to get ur hair done lady 's !	4424
1	they have a very friendly staff . i 've had multiple hair cuts as well as hair extensions by fabiola . the extentions were done using the micro loop technique which lasted a long and and were very comfortable , not to mention how full and amazing my hair looked . i love this salon my family comes here even though we live quite a few miles away . they do amazing hair color and cuts . we have been customers here for 5 years and my family and i love the results every time .	4424
0	i went there for a nice style with layers . the stylist chopped it up like crazy . all i can do is where a hat until it grows out .	4424
0	all i wanted was a haircut and style my hair for my b-day . my hairstylist was not happy she had to take me instead of her friend . then the whole time they were chatting while cutting my hair right next to me . the hairstylist was in a rush to get me out , did a poor job in styling my hair . no hairspray or anything extra , only blowed dried . i could of done a better job myself .	4424
1	nice course . definitely over priced . fairways are wide . rough is generous . greens are very challenging but well cared for . staff is nice too .	4425
1	great course at a great price . interspersed within a residential community , this arnold palmer designed course is a great challenge , and well taken care of . it will be even better as the months go . they have great practice facilities and a wonderful staff to make your experience enjoyable . one negative comment ... if you are a brat connossieur , i would advise against choosing the grille 's .	4425
1	this is great course to improve your game . it will eat your lunch and diner if you do n't pay attention to its lay out . besides the course , staffs are always professional & accommodating .	4425
1	played early , 6:48 , to beat the heat . did n't help . 108 when we finished at 11:15 . off season price is amazing , $ 21 for 18 with cart . a lot more water on course than i would have imagined in the desert . some tight fairways through the houses and interesting , undulating greens . great staff from the club house , to snack bar , to cart barn and on the course drink cart . wonderful experience .	4425
0	how did this place get two stars ? this is one of the worst golf courses i have played . sand , sand and more sand witch in it 's self is n't bad if only they maintain it . try and roll a put on what they call greens greens are full of weeds and in need of cutting . please go any were but here . i will never go back .	4425
0	do n't wast your money ! the course is a mess . greens were all chewed up , the fairways were like playing out of the rough . 5 hour round . goose crap all over the course.no yardage markers ? ? no food with cart person and no food at half way house . will never go back .	4425
0	first of all , the guy who checked us in was very rude . it seemed as they did not want our business or we were not good enough to golf there . the girls in the hamburger shop did not seem like they wanted to work or help any of the customers in there . secondly , the course was dirty with goose poop all over . we will not golf at that course ever again . we can golf at much nicer courses with better customer service than at this golf course for the money we paid .	4425
0	one of the worst experiences i have ever had at a course . course layout is nice however starter was downright pretentious about getting to tee before tee time . kept up with group in front of us while playing from two different tees and he rudely warned us to speed things up . no full liquor license however sold premade liquor drinks anyways . goose feces all over the facility . being a former pga staff member myself i can honestly say i will never be a patron to this facility again . very disappointed .	4425
1	my previous groomer ( michelle ) moved away . i was sad about that - she was so good with my pups ( brother and sister 2.5 year old poddle/bichons . i got referred to diggin ' the dog and am so grateful that i tried them . michelle is the consummate professional while at the same time being very friendly and caring . my pups look amazing - better than previously1 . finding an amazing groomer is `` priceless ! '' ( fyi diggin ' the dog is very reasonable )	4426
1	i had a bad first experience here . the groomers did n't groom my dog like i had asked . i usually go to the canine social company but they had a plumbing issue this weekend so they transferred to their sister groomer . however i spoke to amber over the phone and told her about my bad experience and she gave me a full refund back . it certainly took away the bitterness i felt from coming here . it 's just great knowing how much they care about their customers . thank you !	4426
0	i 've been taking my dogs here for a while in the beginning the service was good but the last couple of times my dog seemed really hesitant to go with the groomer also owner . i got a really bad vibe this morning so i think after today i 'll be looking for another groomer .	4426
0	the location and cleanliness of this salon is commendable but the owner is very unpredictable , moody and so unprofessional.. because of this i will not be bringing my two dogs back there .	4426
1	excellent driver who was friendly and interesting . showed up early for the 5-15 min pick up estimate and got us to the airport fast . will use them again .	4427
1	great service . fare was fair . still if you have the time , try madison metro instead . for the cab , it is a four dollar drop fee plus one dollar airport surcharge to take them from the airport.compared to most cities , madison has great taxi service.i do n't get the negative reviews . yes is is pricey.but the service is much better and i have never had a bad driver . plus i have had better on time experience with madison taxi .	4427
1	punctual , clean , and friendly ! we got a madison taxi from the airport and later reserved one back to the airport . they showed up early and the driver was very friendly . last year we made a reservation with another company and they did not show up- when we called them to find out what was happening they told us they were busy and could not get us to the airport in time for our flight . we will continue to use madison taxi cab and recommend our parents use them . it is good to know you do n't have to take the first taxi in line from the airport- choose the one you want .	4427
1	i woke up an hour before my flight on new year 's day and rushed to call a cab . every company said it was a 30 min wait for a car but madison taxi got me one in five minutes . my driver was amazing . he got me to the airport safely and fast . and i made my flight ! !	4427
0	the dispatcher lady deserves negative stars for her attitude . i missed my appointment because she does not know how to tell time . i was very clear that i needed to be picked up by because i had an appointment i could not miss . after they were way beyond late and i had even given myself an extra half hour to get there i call back for a third time and then she got really snotty ! move along this place is not worth the headache ! welcome to madison uber !	4427
0	i als got a ride home from the dane county airport with madison taxi . our flight was so late that there were no taxis at the airport and there was a line waiting for taxis so the guy said he could take 5 of us to where we needed to go . i thought we 'd share the fare with 5 passengers instead of one . but we were each charged full price - $ 29 for me - i got dropped off first . other than that the driver was nice , he did a good job driving in fresh snow and the cab was clean .	4427
0	it typically costs us around $ 15 to get home to the west side from downtown , but with madison taxi it cost us $ 25 ! avoid this company , call badger or green cab instead ! we will never ride with them again .	4427
0	so , so terrible . expensive and unreliable just like the rest of them .	4427
1	i was very pleased with my two visits . they very nicely followed up with phone calls and explained everything including the costs before agreeing !	4428
1	just finished my second appointment with dr. farrell and his assistant liz . they are a great team , and i feel comfortable with everything they do . dr. farrell is personable and makes sure everything is done right before he sends you home . liz is a great compliment to him , and is funny while still being professional . they both answer every question you may have , without making you feel bad for asking , and make a 2 hour appointment easy . i am new to the phoenix area , and feel so lucky to have found these two ! ! i have much work still needed , and i will want them for every step of the way !	4428
1	it 's unheard of to be in the presence of amazing dentists without feeling like you 're getting pocket raped . i started coming here about a year and a half ago and would n't change it for the world . extremely gentle and honest about what you need . there are a few different dentists in the office , but all have a great sense of humor and make your stay a bit more comfortable . sheila is a great hygienist , and dr. van and dr. farrell go above and beyond for patients .	4428
0	please see my reviews from october 2013 . guess what i just received ... over a year after waking out of this office . a bill for my $ 5 office visit . i politely called , explained my concern , was told i would receive a callback . no surprise that i have n't . i will be checking to be sure they do n't mess with my credit .	4428
0	if i could give less than 1 star i would . i walked out and drove across town to go back to my old dentist . these people are thieves !	4428
0	apparently the review i wrote on 10/11/13 was deleted ? ? ? would rate them 0 if i could . they have an `` f '' rating by the bbb ... tells you something , huh ?	4428
1	visiting from hawaii . first time at the shop . really great selection from mods , starter kits & ejuice . parking was n't bad at all . they have tanks were you can try out the flavors but if your dripping they 'll let you sample it which is great ! good vibes and customer service . recommend 10/10 !	4429
1	omg ! ! ! great customer service . i 've been ordering my supplies from vs for over a year now . the last order was incorrect and i reached out to them . their customer service dept was awesome . they made it right . it is rare to have an online company that actually takes care of their customers . good shit vs ! ! !	4429
0	i 've been coming here for a few years just to buy juice recently purchased a couple mods from there in the past 3-4 months i had to come back at least every other week because there was always a problem with the mods . i recommend just buying juice .	4429
0	worst customer service i 've ever received . they sold me a smoke vape that has been nothing but a piece of crap that has now caught fire and wo n't replace it . i asked for manager he ( jed ) told me he was n't answering and to call one of the other shops . jed also refused to have a manager to call me or give me the manager or owners name . will never spend another cent in this business if owners want to contact me they 're more than welcome to at ddequine @ icloud.com and discuss the issue	4429
1	i would like to tbank those who leave reviews for business . reading the reviews made my decision making a lot eaiser . when you arrive do n't be discouraged . the horses were calm , friendly . the ride was slow and steady and the view was priceless . when/if i go back , i must do again	4430
1	we really enjoyed the trail ride with bernie . we were a family of 3 and did a private trail ride . it was all that i wished it to be .	4430
1	had a great time . i would definitely do this again ! our tour guide was awesome ! i completely recommend this to anyone thinking of wanting to go horseback riding .	4430
1	5 stars is n't enough for the amazing experience and ride we had ! ! ! ! bought it through livingsocial without any problems , we got an amazing deal for an amazing ride . the staff are super friendly and our guide ayla was amazing ! ! ! the horses are very friendly and gave us a ride i 'll never forget , ca n't wait to come back and visit again . i highly recommend experiencing vegas horseback riding .	4430
1	super surprised of past reviews . my husband and i booked this through groupon and everything went super smooth ! the gentlemen that met us were sooo nice ! this was a beautiful area to ride too ! we would certainly book through them again ! the horses were great too . we even met another couple on our ride that were also celebrating their wedding anniversary like we were ! i would highly recommend ! ! ! !	4430
1	awesome experience ! the tour guide was thorough and informative and interacting with the horses and seeing their different personalities was priceless !	4430
1	we had an amazing ride ! the staff was super friendly and all the animals were great ! ! we got our deal off livingsocial and it went off without a hitch ! purchased online , followed the easy instructions , and got a confirmation email quickly . i decided to change my time , and they accommodated us without any problems . the horses were fantastic and so gentle ! we had a mini scare with my horse taking me off the path and straight down the hill ! ! it was scary but she had great balance and i survived . lol we definitely want to return again ! !	4430
1	bought three trail ride passes for my daughters 11th birthday . she could n't of had a better time ! guide was knowledgeable and patient . the trail starts out on a road and leads to a trail with excellent views . if you 're looking to ride a horse this is your spot . if you 're looking for a true nature trail ride.. ( not sure those exist in vegas or henderson ) then best bet would be to go to mt . charleston . the website as a bit cumbersome but if you text the number on their website they text right back and get you set up in no time . would highly recommend to anyone !	4430
1	this was a good experience overall . we had some trouble with the groupon vouchers but they proactively reached out and sorted through it for us . i was nervous about riding and they gave me a horse that was good for me to ride . this is a small business , my advice is to go with the flow and be patient with them . bring sunscreen ! !	4430
1	enjoyed a wonderful sunset ride . the entire experience was perfect from start to finish . the guide was very friendly and extremely informative . they made sure that each horse was suited to the experience of the rider . i would recommend this ride to anyone	4430
1	great service ! very friendly people ! the horses were great ! i recommend it 's an experience .	4430
1	excellent time with my daughter and our tour guide was wonderful . the horses were very gentle and easy to ride .	4430
1	i had the amazon locals vouchers and it was an amazing experience . ayla , our guide was as cool as they come.. very friendly and down to earth . horses ( hero & candy ) were really nice too . the whole experience was amazing . we were scheduled for an hour and a half but it took an extra 15 minutes since we stopped for pictures . i received an email that requested to confirm appointment . also instructions when to arrive , where to park , and where to meet the staff . thumbs up.. i 'll definitely will bring more friends to experience this .	4430
0	my wife purchased tickets to this through groupon for our honeymoon in las vegas . their site said that they would email us within 24 hours of booking along with dates to choose from . we followed all the directions as they were stated on their website . two days had passed with no response whatsoever . when we tried calling them , an automated message said that they do not accept phone calls for booking . what kind of business does not accept phone calls ? thankfully , we were able to receive our money back through groupon .	4430
0	i want to echo other reviews ... i should have checked first ! ! terribly unprofessional communications , cancelled our original ride 1.5 hours before we were scheduled - i find it hard to believe their guide is `` sick '' this often ! re-scheduled for the next day and found we were walking in to a total dump ! charlie , the guide , was friendly and the horses were quite docile but that is the best i can say ! pay more for another trail ride experience !	4430
0	do not buy from this vendor - no email confirmations , no phone calls answered , no emails returned . this `` business '' is a scam . bought a travel zoo voucher - entered my credit card information ( regrettably ) , and still no response . it has been 1 month since i completed a reservation - still nothing . buyer beware ! !	4430
0	organization is lacking . put a credit card on to book reservation and they charged me on it and did n't use my groupon and now are not responding to me . we literally were on the street 92 % of the ride , walking on the horses the whole time . it was all bullshi* honestly . our tour guide was super nice though : )	4430
0	i 'm not even going to book a ride . for my 50th birthday my daughter bought a livingsocial voucher , 90 minute ride for 2 , but when i try to book a time to ride they are asking for credit card info and are tacking on extra fees per rider . and the voucher pushes gratuity in addition to the fees . so , we are going to get credit for the voucher and not even go .	4430
0	this company has been messaging people and threatening them to take down their reviews , if they are less than 5 stars . `` consumer review freedom act '' protects you , so if it happens.. stand your ground . i was extremely disappointed with my experience , and i hope people read all reviews before booking this expierence .	4430
0	warning ! i made reservations for 2 and they never sent the address of where to go for the ride . then they fraudulently charged my credit card which they still have not reimbursed 6 weeks later . stay away !	4430
0	wanted to go here during our trip to vegas this christmas . confirmed by email that they would be giving rides around christmas . then bought the living social , filled out the booking request form on their website , then ... nothing ! no confirmation . after several unanswered emails , i called living social for a refund . turns out , the business had already marked my voucher as 'redeemed ' even though i have not yet been to las vegas . note : it is their policy to not answer phone calls/return messages . in my case , apparently , it 's their policy to not respond to emails either .	4430
0	i ordered a groupon and they told me that on top of the groupon because they did not have enough people in the group i had to pay $ 30 . so i cancelled my groupon and the moment that email came through they billed my credit card for $ 25.00 in fees - with no explanations . so i am going to dispute the transactions . just trying to get in tough with them is difficult and it took me a whole day to figure out they were going to charge extra fees onto of the groupon . they will only respond by text message . i would say beware also they threatened me with legal action if i posted bad reviews of their company .	4430
0	what a farce . the silverline location is a road and address that exists in the middle of nowhere literally . after booking one is to receive a destination email with directions which never occurred . no phone number to follow up with and the number on this page was never answered . this is a scam . i do not recommend this outfit ! !	4430
0	very bad experience . i would never go back nor recommend to anyone . dont even bother . lots of extra stupid charges . mandatory tip of $ 25 to be expected despite service . very bad or nonexistent post customer service . we paid for 90 mins experience . the whole experience lasted no more than 45 mins . the 'sunset ride ' was literally up the asphalt road and back . we did a 3 min loop in the dessert . i could have driven up the road in my car and got the exact same experience for free .	4430
0	i would not give this even one star . booked this thru living social . it said to meet up at the `` ranch '' which was pretty much a junk yard . used the restroom which could be part of a horror movie . my horse was good . but there was no `` trail ride '' ! we rode up a paved street amongst houses then back down the same paved street ( about 5 minutes was on dirt ) . good views of las vegas but that was it . i am very surprised living social even offer this voucher . it was not a good deal at any price .	4430
0	i contacted them regarding the amazon special ... they said they would offer the price without purchasing it thru amazon . i made a reservation , had an email back confirming it , then never heard from them again ! ! ! i emailed three times the week before my reservation to confirm , and also left a voicemail . no response ... .and therefore no traiil ride ! ! i had booked it to take people who were in town visiting . i will never trust this place again ... i would not recommend buying their coupon . so disappointing .	4430
1	excellent service . reliable , trustworthy , prompt , thorough , highly efficient and extremely courteous . very fair pricing too .	4431
1	i see a lot of older reviews here and i am not sure when the company changed hands , but i believe it did ... . in any event , i just used them and they did a great job on my home -- and i am extremely particular ! the team of 2 scrubbed every visible ( and some not ) area , but were respectful of the wood floors , furniture and trim and polished all that should not be scrubbed . they cleaned quickly yet thoroughly and i have nary a complaint , which is rare for me . i hesitate to give them such a glowing review , because i hope they will be available when i need them . : )	4431
0	this company came recommended by the prior owner of our house . the team that arrived had cleaned the home before . and they were very nice . but they did n't do a great job cleaning . my first appointment was for 4 hours . i really could n't tell what they had done after they left . nothing felt super clean . the carpets were still dirty , the cabinets had not been cleaned , nothing looked dusted . it was disappointing .	4431
0	avoid this place . you have to pitch a fit to speak to someone on the phone . the schedule their cleaning staff back and forth all over town resulting in missing the 2 hour window you 're given for your cleaning . office staff provide conflicting information and , since you ca n't talk to anyone , it gets very confusing . i was told to call to provide payment info by one and told to enter online by another . one staff person said my appointment was canceled but the cleaning people were on their way , just late . too bad because the cleaners themselves are amazing . find someone else .	4431
1	my daughter and i went here for pedicures earlier this week and had a wonderful time . rita and bella were so attentive and we truly felt pampered . our toes are beautiful and our feet feel wonderful ! i will be switching to millennium for my acrylic nails next time i need a fill as well . thank you ladies !	4432
1	my hair girl deanna is the best ! ! ! she works limited hours but her hilite treatment is the most even hilite i have ever had ! ! ! if you want blond hilites go see my girl ! ! !	4432
0	can i give this spa and salon zero stars ? ! ? i walked-in to inquire about a hair-cut and found the people to be very unaccommodating , as if the salon is too good for new customers . secondly , i called to schedule a mani/pedi and received the exact same treatment by phone . por favor people , i 'll go someplace else !	4432
0	i received great service while i was there for a cut and partial highlight with deanna . however , when i got home i realized half of my very healthy hair had been completely fried ! ! i tried to contact them and have received no call back . steer clear for highlights .	4432
1	i absolutely love living here at san milan ! the apartment complex is like a resort ! the amenities are amazing ! i can not say enough good things about living here . the office staff are wonderful and very professional . they are always going out of their way to be helpful . i could not have picked a better place to stay .	4433
1	i just moved into my apartment a month or so ago , but i have been nothing but impressed ! the apartments are beautiful , the pool and other amenities are wonderful , and all of the employees that i have met so far have been super friendly and helpful ! ! ! i am very happy to be living here ! ! : - )	4433
1	we lived at san milan for two years and only moved out because we purchased a home . living at san milan is like living in a resort . the pool is absolutely beautiful , as are the surrounding grounds of the whole complex . the maintenance staff does an impeccable job keeping the grounds clean and beautiful , they are also incredibly friendly . if there was ever something that needed to be repaired in our apartment , someone was there to fix it usually within an hour . san milan is an awesome place to live ! ! !	4433
0	the latest from san milan ... when i say noisy i 'm not kidding . this is at all hours of the day with no intervention from management . please believe me i 'm not a complainer or hard to live with type of person but this `` community '' is ridiculous	4433
0	extremely loud noisy and trashy tenants a dead body was taken out across the hallway from my unit . drunken wmo golf bums parked in the spots for the tenants and walked without any security from the management . will be thrilled when my lease is up . too bad there is n't competent management here as the apartments themselves are beautiful and brand new	4433
0	i assure you that the issue with the dog park has n't been solved . still has water backing up and it 's nasty ! i 'll never understand the need to water a dog park so much . the dryer the better . i get you want green grass for your sales pictures but it 's an environment for dogs and you 've made it unsafe and undesirable !	4433
1	excellent service ! i loved my gel manicure and my daughter and her friend were thrilled with their pedicures . the customer service is top notch and the salon is extremely clean and inviting . both my daughter and i signed up for the membership ( what a great idea ! ) . we are looking forward to our monthly visits to prose .	4434
1	was a little nervous as a man going in . wife suggested a manicure said i would love it . lead artist brittany was awesome . would definitely suggest using her . made it a overall great experience will be returning monthly .	4434
1	the lead artist brittany is amazing ! ! ! usually i find something wrong with my nails but they are perfect and last a long time . she was so kind and funny , made me feel very comfortable !	4434
1	prose management called after my last review and was very interested in my concerns and invited me back in . my second experience was much better than the first and i found the technician to be much more on top of things than the first . i was also impressed by their knowledge of immediately knowing their colours . everyone is super friendly and my tech commented how she liked how everyone got along- which you could see with their interactions . i get that there can be kinks in opening a new store- and glad that they were on top of things to work through them . 4.5 stars	4434
1	i typically visit the lower end nail salons and decided to treat myself . it was well worth it as the salon is very clean and service is exceptional . they charged my phone and offered beverages which was nice . the product is high end and my nails so far are looking amazing in day 3 . i would recommend this nail salon .	4434
1	great experience tonight at prose with danielle , katie and jessica . all outstanding and friendly . beautiful salon , lovely service and unique products . a high quality experience . the phone chargers and jewelry cleaning is a nice touch ,	4434
1	i tried prose on a whim and am so glad that i did ! the staff and service were above and beyond , and the setting is gorgeous ! very excited for my new membership .	4434
1	visited prose today after stalking the space for a while . loved their concept and their services . and katie ! prices are high , but a monthly membership is $ 135 for three services a month and can be cancelled at any time . additionally , services can be gifted or rolled over . was offered water ( sparkling or still ) and botanical tea . check in process is done on an ipad . polishes are deborah lipmann , vinulux ( no up charge ) and shellac ( + $ 10 ) . would love to see gellish in the future ! one of the best parts is that they are open until nine ( 6 on sundays ) .	4434
0	need to remove `` walk ins welcome '' . i 've tried three times ( different days of the week/times ) with no success but instead a response of `` we prefer appointments '' .	4434
0	the space is beautiful and the concept is great . however , my nails were a mess after - red polish everywhere , not cleaned off at all and stained skin . i got them re-done the next day at my usual nail salon . i will not be back .	4434
0	the ambiance of this place is really great , but other than that i was pretty disappointed . the gel manicure lasted two days and has almost completely peeled off after a week . the pedicure has spots where the top coat was n't used and to top it off , they do n't provide flip flops so you have to use theirs and bring them right back . i probably wo n't be back after my experience . i think it depends on who your nail technician is ...	4434
0	pros : beautiful salon , friendly and attentive staff , the vibe of the nail salon , the chairs etc . are all so luxurious . cons : the actual manicure is one of the worst i 've received , i also did the $ 50 mani/pedi with upgrade to gels ( with 4 friends ) . my nails started chipping and peeling immediately and it 's been less than a week and almost every nail is chipped . not what i expect from a salon that seems so high end , i 've emailed them but have yet to hear a response .	4434
0	i was very excited to come to my first appointment at prose to get my nails done . unfortunately , the team refused to see me ( despite my 30 minute drive and appointment ) because i had told them i had gel nails and not `` sns '' when scheduling . apparently sns takes much longer to remove . i understand that i should have known the difference , but i felt the staff handled it rudely , debating my appointment as if i was not in the room and ultimately being unwilling to accommodate .	4434
0	i booked 5 days ahead of time & they called me the day of my appointment and canceled it ! ! ! ! ! not to mention i booked for sunday do you know how hard it is to find a salon even open on a sunday let alone last minute ? ! ? ! ! ! never in my life had a salon cancel on me so unprofessional . i just got back from camping so i feel dirty af & was looking forward to this mani pedi sooooo bad is why i 'm the most upset thanks for nothing jerks ! ! ! !	4434
0	was not impressed , will not be returning . the aesthetic and the location of the place itself is nice , but otherwise i was wildly underwhelmed . i got a gel mani pedi and it looks fine but there are obvious imperfections . customer service was satisfactory .	4434
0	salon gorgeous but nail tech 's are weak . im not sure where they got their training but i was not happy at all with the quality of the massage and the quality of the cuticle trim the nails were filed crooked my daughters toenail got infected after it was cut the wrong way even after advising the girl to be extra careful . i have been to two locations and both were dissatisfactory i 'm sorry to leave such a negative review but i have to be honest about this place i brought my complaint to the managers and advise them that they need to hire better nail technicians until then i 'm not going back .	4434
1	i love their coupons , but you have to remember to remind the cashiers to use them . they will usually never bring them up . i 've had $ 60 worth of stuff & only paid $ 30 . the only thing that frustrates me is that sometimes things are n't fully stocked , but it 's great other than that .	4435
1	friendly service ! idk why it has so many bad reviews . i 've always been greeted when i arrive and leave .	4435
1	every time i walk in i am greeted by a friendly staff member . the store has most anything in it . cosmetics , food snacks , liquor , gifts , pet items . photo developing . i have n't used the pharmacy yet but plan on it soon . fyi there is a drive thru .	4435
1	dean was so helpful i need a picture done fast and he was awesome lol when it come to anything computers i 'm lost ! ! ! ! hahah very nice guy ! ! ! !	4435
0	some staff is friendly but theres this lady there that acts like shes the owner and is very rude and incompetent seems like a control freak or is juat miserable everytime ive gone i see her being rude with sarcasm with customers	4435
0	cash pharmacy customers beware ! i have been gouged on more than one occasion on pricing at this unscrupulous location . prices significantly lower at the walgreens just a block or two down the street .	4435
0	the workers here are not friendly or helpful at all . would n't recommend this location to anyone . called on different locations asking if they carried certain things & every one i spoke to always answered `` i dont know . '' you dont know ? why would i want to waste my time coming into the store to look for something if even the workers dont know if they carry my items ? frustrating	4435
0	i 'm waiting at drop off in pharmacy while the pharmacist is two feet away talking on the phone about store staffing and who is getting let go-or moved to other stores -- -and who is paid more of the employees -- -very unprofessional -- still have n't been helped !	4435
1	have been living here for a couple months , and must say that we love this place . everyone is friendly & such a great sense of community .	4436
1	i moved here from michigan fourteen years ago and have enjoyed my living at cheyenne villa apt . the staff is nice and i love the community . and i would highly recommend this area for anyone who is looking for a good place to live .	4436
0	very rude stuff , racists and providing false information and when you ask for a manager is never available , they lie about things that they do n't know and say that they never said it .very disappointed	4436
0	these apartments are horrible ! there are rocks under the carpet and the flooring due to them laying it out and cutting it in the parking lot outside . in addition to numerous complaints that i have my most current complaint is that i told them my air was out more than 20 days ago and it still has not been addressed . i am currently 8 months pregnant and very hot and when i call to the front office they have the nerve to get attitude with me . i am currently trying to find their corporate office number so that i can file a formal complaint about them and i will be contacting the bbb ! this place sucks ! !	4436
1	awesome massage . punctual . listens to what my discomforts are and gives me the best massage tailored to me . highly recommend . thanks kevin !	4438
1	kevin is amazing . highly recommend his massage services . the location is convenient and easy to find .	4438
0	do n't bother . no ability to book . no response to multiple calls for booking . look elsewhere for a groupon massage .	4438
0	i have been trying to this place for over a month now and no one answers the phone can someone please let me know if they even exist .. just do n't make since they never answer phone or text messages	4438
1	julius photography said these guys are amazing and we should work with them . julius photography created some amazing images at our wedding and many of my friends . the view was beautiful and the staff was great . i loved that julius took that scenery and helped create incredible images only by julius ! i loved that julius recommended them and several other key people for the wedding !	4439
1	i got married her january 6 , 2012 . it was perfect ! the coordinators are wonderful and help you plan out every little detail for the big day . the catering staff and chef are amazing . the food was sooo good ! i would recommend this venue to anyone and everyone !	4439
0	i have tried on 4 different occasions to contact someone at ashley manor . i have called 4 times over 3 weeks during their business hours and left messages and no one has called me back . i am very sad because it looked beautiful in the pictures and i was hoping to have my wedding there . but if i ca n't even get someone to return my call for over a month i certainly wont trust them with something as important as my wedding !	4439
0	the outdoor area was beautiful . the indoor as well but the indoor acoustics were so bad i could n't understand the toasters or the music . the acoustics were bad because there was nothing to absorb the noises . by the tlme everything reached my ear it was a mishmash of echos . the water glasses had floaties like i have never seen before . it was like a an appetizer before the meal . my table was nervously playing with them by swirling them around our glasses like snow globes .	4439
1	great home depot here in bainbridge . perfectly located between aurora and the chagrin valley so it is easy to access . friendly people in terms of staff and as in typical home depot fashion , great selection and prices on many things to assist with any and all diy projects- which i am a bit fan of doing . the best thing , to me , is that they will cut wood for me ! such a bonus when i do n't feel like dragging home tree size pieces of wood for projects . and , with spring coming , great deals on herbs and veggies .	4440
1	i just spoke with nate in the window/door department of the bainbridge , ohio home depot . i can not tell you what a joy it is to speak with and experienced , knowledgeable person who truly knows their industry . everyone complains about poor customer service these days for good reason . nate is the exception to that rule ! he knows his field , and he does hi job very well .	4440
1	one of the nicer home depot stores that i 've been to . every employee is extremely nice and helpful . the store is always organized and the employees are knowledgeable about where products are which is helpful when you 're in a hurry !	4440
0	this store is the worst . what a nightmare . nothing is in stock , no coupons apparently work except for in store purchases , yet they stock nothing . total nightmare .	4440
0	this has to be one of the worst h.d . stores in the country . always a bad attitude when you call with questions , ask for help or are checking out . go to lowe 's .	4440
0	you better know what you need and where it is before entering the store . not a helpful staff at all . when we did ask a question it was like we were bothering the person . i would much rather pay a little more and shop local and receive service and get my questions answered .	4440
1	i am so happy with dr. a. i recently moved here and feel so blessed to have found a dr. who listens and really cares about her patients . her staff is great too . never have to wait more than a few minutes . nancy bryant	4441
1	i was randomly googling a doctor 's office in the goodyear area and found this one . their office is very clean and nice . front staff was very friendly as well . they also take walk-in appointments . they were very fast and the doctor was very nice and took his time with me . i did not feel rushed at all . i will definitely come back !	4441
1	i have been seeing dr. agnieszka and dr. greg for over 10 years . they have been nothing but professional with all my medical care . they are always smiling and caring to all my concerns and always take the time to address my questions . i always feel welcome by the front desk in the office and by the medical assistants . i hope to continue to be their patient for many years to come .	4441
1	i love goodyear 's family medicine ! my whole family goes here ! great staff at the goodyear office ! !	4441
0	they are inconsiderate and have no compassion this is the worst doctors office i have been to would not recommend this to no one	4441
0	aurora at the front office is so terrible - very rude and should not be working in an office environment . the office overall fails to follow up which created an even larger medical problem . i 'm moving all my stuff to another provider .	4441
0	horrible customer/patient service . back office is great . trying to get through on the phone or even talking to front office staff is definitely negative stars	4441
0	flouts the law that prevents treatment discrimination against medical marijuana patients . if you need pain management in addiction to your mmj , the doctors will not prescribe anything stronger than an ibuprofen . do n't mention your mmj use or card when visiting them if you must go here because otherwise be prepared to be condescended to and patronized like a damn heroin addict .	4441
1	very happy with my service here . coming from a horrible pharmacy on dysart , this location is heaven sent . come here , it 's worth the extra drive .	4442
1	where walgreens at mcdowell & indian school on 107th ave did n't have cvs did and great customer service and lower prices . goodbye walgreens & hello cvs .	4442
1	cool staff , very clean and well run . i 've had a good experience anytime i 've been here so no complaints from me . just wish they carried liquor . on the other hand , no worried cuz i can just go to luke afb and get all the liquor i want , tax free and 24 hours a day !	4442
1	great staff very friendly . close to the dodgers ballpark	4442
1	this place has everything i need ! great place to stop by . the employees are nice , and one of the supervisors is always so helpful ! ! i see he 's always busy , but takes the time with each customer to find what they need ! great job guys !	4442
0	worst cvs i have ever walked into . my son has a double ear infection and came here to get his antibiotic filled . clearly , it 's more important to be on your phone texting than helping your customers . what 's even sadder is that the pharmacist made eye contact with me then turned her back . looks like i 'll have to take my business back to walgreens . learn some basic customer service skills . why pay all that money for a sad excuse of a pharmacist and a pharmacist assistant . pathetic .	4442
0	store is always slow pretty gross i thought they had spider webs because it 's almost october until you realize that it 's just poor house keeping !	4442
0	this place takes forever ! ! always has our prescriptions ready so there 's no reason to take 20 minutes to just give it to us .	4442
0	the pharmacy staff could n't be bothered to tell me while i sat and waited for four prescriptions to be filled , that one of them tasted horrible and typically gets flavoring added to it . so unwittingly i became committed to taking three doses of terrible medication before the store reopened and i could return to have the issue fixed . go to a pharmacy that is compassionate towards your comfort .	4442
0	they never have sale items on stock ! ! they also never post their sale prices . which forces me to grab the items one by one and take them to price checker to make sure its the right product !	4442
1	if you need your nails done fast this is the place to go they were quick and professional and i love the look of my new nails	4443
1	this place is the best ! friendly staff , i have always just done walks in and they get you in right away ! clean and pretty space . best pedicures in town !	4443
1	clean salon that provides great services . my no-chip manicures always last at least three weeks . i like to make appointments to avoid waiting but they do take walk-ins as well . i like that they take their time as well . i have never left disappointed .	4443
1	wow . my mom and i got pedicures here in late june and they still look perfect today ... three months later ! am impressed . you can go to this place get a pedicure and it will last you all summer . my mom and i will be back there for sure .	4443
1	just left after getting a mani pedi , both gel . the girls who worked on me were very nice . i would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice , clean , moderately priced treat ! will be going back !	4443
1	i 've been going here on and off for a couple years , and thought they did the best no chip manicure ! today i went in and noticed a new staff , which was surprising ? there were a few changes in the process , and she was not as detailed as they were before . time will tell on how long it will last ? curious to know what happened to dan and his wife , and what others think of the change ? it was always very busy with many people there , and i as the only one there the whole time i was there ?	4443
1	this is a reasonably priced , clean , friendly nail salon . i had a gel manicure and it looks wonderful . had tons of compliments on it already . i went back and had a pedicure and was very happy with that also . they have been very busy both times i was there , but they work efficiently and keep things moving along . the price seems reasonable to me - $ 35 for the gels that last 2-3 weeks and $ 30 for a very nice pedicure . she spent lots of time on my feet . i will definitely go back .	4443
1	excellent customer service , friendly staff and very clean environment . thoroughly enjoyed my manicure and pedicure and would highly recommend this place to anyone .	4443
1	super happy with my pedi . very thorough , gentle , not at all rushed , great massage . i walked in without an appt . at 10am no problem getting in . i do n't live here , but would definitely stop in again nexr time i 'm in town .	4443
1	a great new clean nail spa ! beautiful interior and great spa chairs . tons of colors and the service was excellent . $ 30 for spa pedicure and $ 40 for gellish nails . a bit pricey but i will pay for the excellent service , clean spa and to have tons of opi , axxium and gelish colors .	4443
1	i 'm giving 5 star because i did n't make appointment , and they were n't booked up ! ! ! ! ! i 'm off work today so i 'm treating myself . that and its sandal seasons and i 'm way past due . went with a basic pedi ( no designs ) just cute opi black . they are super fast , the place is very clean ! ! ! ! i usually do my own manis n pedis . but i suck and nail polish more on skin than nails / : excited to break out my peep toe heels ! ! ! ! !	4443
0	horrible . went in for a mani/pedi . young guy asked to do my mani & the same time a lady was doing my pedi . completely unrelaxing . nails look horrible . they have bumps and paint on my skin . he rushed my manicure so that he could sit in a pedicure chair and play on his phone . strongly recommend going somewhere else .	4443
0	got a pedicure done here recently . this was the second pedicure i had done there . the first one was great however , the person doing my pedicre the second time around was too agreesive and rough . he was scrubbing my big toe really hard with the pumice stone , it slipped and took a big piece of skin out of my foot ! it did n't seem that bad in the store , but it is still healing and may take several more day to heal . i would n't recommend this place to anyone at this point . my relaxing pedicure experience was ruined because of this man not paying attention .	4443
0	this place is under new ownership , and that is too bad ! it is no longer as clean , they rush you and they even told me i had no appointment when i had called and made one . they also do nothing to your cuticles when you have a manicure . since when is this not included ? i would much rather have them do that then put some cheap lotion on my arms and rub it in and call it a massage . disappointed with the new owners .	4443
0	so shitty . i just tried to walk in with my friend for both of us to get out eyebrows done . there were three employees in there and one customer and they said they were too busy . they directed us to the brow place next door , which only does threading ( which i hate ) . will never come back here . rude and completely unnecessary .	4443
0	worst manicure ever ! i did n't even get my nails painted i asked them to take off the paint . horrible ! ! had two stylists paint my nails . very sad .	4443
0	its simple ... this nail salon moves too slowly . who has over 2 hours for a pedicure ? ! the constant double booking to fit everybody in is too much . im moving on..	4443
0	bottom line ? i was served by a women who did great job . my wife however - was treated by the man and ... .. she will have to go back today as the lacquer / paint lost within less than 24 hrs ... . return next day ? not good news . not at all	4443
0	my daughter and her 2 friends went there tonight . i had called and asked the prices , $ 45 for a mani-pedi and $ 60 for french tips . they were each charged $ 70 for a mani - pedi . also the staff used overheated towels on the girls . my daughter 's hands were red and painful when she got home and finally she clicked my daughter 's cuticles to the quick and it started bleeding . so end of the day all three girls ripped off financially to the tune of $ 45 shellac was used though not asked for and their nails are all smudged . plus the girls tipped the staff $ 30 hopefully the staff will return my call .	4443
0	my daughter and i went for pedicures . they completely mangled my daughter 's toe when they were buffing the nail . they had a hard time controlling the bleeding . ever apologized and we had to pay for it . it is extremely painful and now infected.it has been a traumatic experience for her . she will have to go to a doctor . avoid this place ! the picture is 3 days after the incident .	4443
0	if i could give zero stars i would . i had an horrible experience here . my friend and i came here she asked for a mani-pedi while i got a pedicure . we arrived around 5:30 and it was obvious they techs were trying to get us out so they could close . my pedicure was very lumpy and i had polish on my cuticles . if you like bad service and horrible nails you 'll love it here .	4443
0	i want to support a local business , but the service is not consistent nor worth the price . 1 ) did n't get polish on sides of 3 toenails . 2 ) polish applied on acrylic nails had bubbles in it . 3 ) had to wait 30 minutes for service despite having an appointment .	4443
1	this place is next to my work so it 's convenient . the staff is friendly and always willing to help . definitely recommend this place	4444
1	love the vibe here . i love the people that work in the kids club they 're very nice to the kids office staff and everybody here is very casual easy going it 's a lot of fun to work out here this is the best location in phoenix	4444
1	what can i say ? i love this gym . paid for 3 years at a time , now i am grandfathered in to pay a whopping $ 59 a year . yay me ! the facilities are always clean , and the trainers ( so far ) top notch .	4444
1	i love 24 hour fitness ! we prefer the 43rd ave & bell location and when they close early on the weekends we go to the metro center location which is open daily 24 hrs . why we like 24 hour fitness : friendly & cheerful staff great kids center always clean private showers jacuzzi always clean & hot pool is huge members & atmosphere laid back plenty of equipment workers are always cleaning and finally i can work out at 1am !	4444
0	i come here when i am in town and see how this place has gone down hill . i get on 3 treadmills and all 3 do n't work that 's insane . buttons broken on equipment . i mean really 24 hour with the competition out there you would think you would fix equipment . let 's get it together .	4444
0	decent gym but way too much white trash and thugs ruining a nice place . not as bad as the one by metro center , but still noticeable . i had my had car window smashed and items stolen , which is n't the fault of this gym , but it shows you who comes here . if you 're looking for a decent gym , it 's better than average . but 2 years from now , it could be all be ghettoville . oh , and there 's rarely ever hot women here . just like almost every other bar , gym or store in glentucky .	4444
0	we were looking to join a gym recently , but when we showed up to talk to someone and get a tour , they wanted us to fill out these liability release forms and sign them . why do we have to divulge all of our personal information including our date of birth and sign a liability release form just to get a tour ? we walked out . that seemed like a red flag . a sneaky way to get us on some kind of spam mailing list or something . no thanks ! we went straight to la fitness and they were happy to give us a tour right when we walked in .	4444
0	i 've belonged to this gym since it opened . i do n't know if it 's because of a recent change in management , but it appears they are not paying attention to maintanence of the cardio machines . many of the treadmills have a sqeaking noise to them like the belts need attention and the heart rate monitor does not work on most of them . also , they are a bit stingy with the air conditioner , in my opinion . overall.. looking worn down . thinking of making a change .	4444
1	you do n't get ur stupid ass seats clean with a platinum wash that 's why they have seat cleaning service if the platinum came with seat cleaning they would n't offer that service stupid bitch 2 ) if you do n't like the way the car was clean there a car wash near you that 's named do it your fuken self it 's really cheap to	4445
1	they do an amazing job cleaning my car . i always get a full shampoo and upholstery cleaning from them and the car always looks brand new !	4445
1	every staff member that helped me ( both inside and outside of the place ) was incredible nice and helpful and my car came out looking wonderful . i was unfortunately cut in line at the register by a self-important jerk of a customer who proceeded to berate the cashier for not giving him a deal . the poor register girl did a wonderful job of dealing with this jerk and then was able to switch gears and return to business when i got my turn to pay . so , even more kudos to the business and its employees for not letting mean people affect their customer service .	4445
0	i hate to be critical , but i ca n't help it in this case . this is a broken down facility , understaffed and very slow . the car wash was so bad that when the car came out it needed to be washed .	4445
0	frustrating experience here . the guy sold me hard on a detail service , so i took it . he said it would take 40-45minutes . after an hour and a half , i insisted on leaving because i was already very late to take my child to an appointment . i plan on calling to ask for a refund since they did n't finish the detailing . beware , they sell you hard and over-promise . they are paid on commission obviously ...	4445
0	all 3 locations abruptly closed , phones turned off , signs saying closed . when open did excellent car wash and detailing .	4445
1	super comfy beds , more than enough pillows , and the ongoing renovations are looking great . this is easy to get to from phx , and our very late check-in ( around midnight ) was quick and efficient . bonus points for the small shop at the front desk where we got cold water when checking in .	4446
1	nice , clean hotel in tolleson az . this area has built up over the past couple years and is close to my company location . staff is friendly . breakfast that you have to pay for is irritating , which is why i do n't stay with courtyard that much . if embassy suites and other mid-tier hotels can do free breakfast , so can courtyard . room rates are a bit on the high side . not really sure what is driving this for the area .	4446
1	izel ( hazel ? ) was super duper nice helping me use the business computer and checking out ! ! thank you ! ! room was comfy and clean . bistro had nice late night options . i got brussels sprouts , yummy ! taking down a star because i 'm here on business and was hoping for shopping options to be closer , but the outlets are near and if you want quiet this place works . also , maybe giving everyone water when you check in or have it in rooms to buy since it 's phx .	4446
0	horrible business practices at this hotel . they over booked their rooms , so when we showed up our reservations meant nothing . booked online and then the day before our arrival called just to make sure all was good . they offered to look around town to find us a room . thought that was the point of making reservations . i 'm sure if we had n't shown up they would have still charged the credit card used to make the reservation .	4446
0	*****beware***** do not stay here ! ! ! our escalade got stolen while staying here , and they did nothing to help us . i would not be surprised if this was an inside job . came in after finding we had no car in the parking lot and they were not sympathetic or helpful . and of course no cameras .	4446
0	the facility is really nice , but apparently cars get broken into and stolen from the parking lot frequently . the police or the hotel do not have extra patrols for some reason . nice place to stay if you do n't have to park .	4446
1	dr. santos yu is the most caring neurologist i have ever been to ! he gave me nerve blocks and did n't want me to leave his office without resting first . this was out of genuine concern ! ! he walked me to the waiting room himself to make sure i was n't too dizzy . he truly cares about his patients .	4447
1	idk what people are talking about . place was clean , everyone i talked to was nice and helpful . yes my apt was late but the dr actually spent time with me . over 45min . my last dr had me waiting for 2 hrs and only spoke withme for 3min.. ill wait .	4447
1	dr. knirk is awesome ! ! hardly any wait , staff is friendly !	4447
1	very busy place . i have been here twice . both times they were within 15 minutes of my appointment time getting me in . dr. knirk pays close attention . she asks many questions . is obsessed with the patient , not the clock . i found her to be caring and thorough . front office folks were okay . i am pleased with my doctor here and my level of care . i hope my next visits go as well . i am still a bit skeptical about this place outside of dr. knirk . as long as she is there , i will continue to see her .	4447
1	not too bad as far as a busy office goes . wait times are not too bad . the dr is friendly and knowledgable . staff seem friendly . i will be a repeat patient .	4447
1	i ca n't thank dr. anna fermin enough for the comfort she has given me . for the center itself , there is usually a long wait , and the front desk staff is n't particularly pleasant , but the nurses are very thorough and caring and dr. fermin is an outstanding specialist who really takes her time discussing both treatments and results . i 'm so grateful that i had her while i was undergoing a very scary time in my life . i recommend her and trust her implicitly .	4447
1	dr. yu really cares about his patients . yes , he often runs very late , and yes he has an accent , but he spends time with you and really knows his specialty . the front office staff is friendly .	4447
0	dr. knirk is completely incompetent . accuses patients of faking . lies right to your face . throws you to pain management that does spine blocking , which has nothing to do with headaches or neurology . i honestly have no idea how this `` doctor '' has n't had her license revoked . avoid at all costs .	4447
0	after my last post , i got an automated call saying i had missed a scheduled appointment ( wut ? lol ) got a call today saying my insurance flat out denied my botox coverage . i was referred to their assistance program since i ca n't afford to pay the cash price of $ 1000 every 12 weeks . thanks for stringing me along another week guys ! guess it 's really time for a new office now .	4447
0	atrocious front office staff . extremely unprofessional and need training . twice i 've shown up with my elderly father , who is in a wheelchair and needs lots of physical help to move around , so that i can walk up to the front reception and told the appointments were cancelled . on both occasions i was told that i was called and that they left a message . not true . no message to be found . i used time off from work for these appointments , do you think they care . they could care less . please please please avoid this place at all cost ! ! !	4447
0	my wife had an appointment for 5:15 today and the front office called and said can you please come at 4:30 ? my wife is now being seen at 5:45 and no one has an explanation . i think that anyone who runs an office this way and inconveniences their clients to the point that the majority of yelp reviews are a 1 star out of 29 reviews is bad . this is n't the first time we have waited forever at this office . anyone reading this review before using this clinic should shop around because you 've been warned by a 1 star majority ...	4447
0	dr. yu is pretty bad as a dr . he 's a poor listener and does n't really respond to direct questions . the wait at this office is the worst . i waited over 1.5 hours to get in and i had an appt . then waited another 30 minutes after they took me back i 'm going to find a new neurologist	4447
0	if you are in pain like myself , you do n't want to come here . i called to obtain information from dr. yu 's assistant , left a voicemail and never heard from anyone . cvs pharmacist called and no return call but i 'm in serious pain . i called the office and was hung up on twice . it was a friday and i guess the staff on the counter did not care to be bothered . my first appointment i arrived at 1:15pm and i was not seen until 5:00pm . sorry , i had to write this review but this is not good healthcare !	4447
0	if possible to find another neurology center , i would recommend doing so . extremely slow , not particularly friendly , and not willing to help with specific concerns . i was diagnosed with sleep apnea years ago . i need a cpap machine . i started the process with them in march . it is now july , and i still have weeks more to wait . very inefficient office . they seem more concerned with scheduling more appointments ( and thus getting paid ) than offering care .	4447
1	love this place . very professional and clean . my nail tech lowe is wonderful . his technique is great . love my nails . color and shape on point . this is a great place to get ur nails done in a professional way .	4448
1	my new favorite nail salon ! the salon is very clean and super cute , not like your typical nail salon . they do an amazing job at gel manicures and they spend time making sure you have the exact color you want for your nails !	4448
1	great places . love the people that work there . dania , kate and brittany are all great and do a great job !	4448
1	professional , super clean and high-quality gel manicure ! claire was great and the entire staff was welcoming and fun . will definitely be back for more services . i walked in early in the day , but they do highly recommend appointments over walk-ins . this place is worth the few extra dollars for high quality and long-lasting work .	4448
1	ambiance is amazing & with the island music playing you truly feel like you 're on vacation . jessica was so unbelievably patient while we figured out a color combination that would be perfect ! ! ! she truly went out of her way to make sure i was happy with the final product ... and i am ! ! zena was so welcoming & made my regular nail appointment into a lovely little getaway .	4448
1	today was my first time being in this nail salon all i can say it it was amazing the staff was very nice , called this morning to make an appointment got me right in . i will be going back to this nail salon , i 'll be telling my friends to go here from now on .	4448
0	decided to check this place out , since it 's close by raw fitness and portion control , which i go to regularly . after standing directly in front of reception and waiting patiently for no less than 10 minutes , i walked out . two other guests in front of me received full on attention . i was not even acknowledged with a greeting . i did not have an appt , but the door stated they take walk ins . disappointing .	4448
0	`` walk in welcome '' on the window . bs ! never ! ! welcome to let them tell you no every time ! i understand you guys are busy , just do n't try to let people think your place is the best one in town that 's why you can talk to people with that kind of attitude ! there are so many good places out there ! ! p.s . took a long time to find the parking ! and had to walk a loooooooong way to get to the door !	4448
0	so i 'm very particular about my eye brows , hence them having so much new growth . i have n't had them done since i moved here . i make an appointment and i tell the lady i do n't like my eye brows thin and if she could just clean them up . my eye brows came out extremely thin . now it 's going to be a long time before i 'm able to get them to grow back thick and properly . i seriously wanted to cry . i schedule a pedicure so hopefully it 's a better job than how my eye brows came out . overall the receptionist was very friendly and the place was nice .	4448
0	1 star as this is no longer nohea nails . the website needs to be shut down . i made an appointment for this morning . received a confirmation email . i arrive this morning , to all new people , all new pedicure chairs , and to be told i had no appointment . this is by no means meant to speak ill of the new owners . however , someone needs to update the information on the website ! ! ! i could have saved myself a trip and my time .	4448
0	i got a regular basic mani and pedi , everything was bad and i will not be returning . they did my manicure while they were doing my pedicure and it was a poor job . barely touched my cuticles which is the main reason i get a manicure . cashier also took forever and no one was friendly .	4448
0	called the other day to find out how much a refill acrylic with gel polish the lady who answered the phone stayed to me at first $ 65 then suddenly she tells never mind it will be $ 50 . i mean $ 50 ! ? just for an acrylic refill with gel polish that 's beyond crazy most nail salons charge $ 35 for an acrylic refill with gel polish . would never come here to get my nails done	4448
1	elizabeth at this store was super helpful and efficient . she had her a game on with us and our 3 kids . i 've had some not so good experiences before at att stores but she turned our views around . thank you !	4449
1	ray is awesome ! i come here for my business cell phones and am beyond pleased with the quality & service of this store and its products .	4449
1	i had a problem where i lost my lte symbol from my iphone 6+ and could n't text or browse the internet . brandon waited in me immediately upon arriving and worked hard to find and fix the problem , even calling at & t corporate service for help . with his help , the problem was identified and fixed without charge . i 'm extremely pleased with the service level and assistance at this store .	4449
0	at & t is horrible all they do is lie to you .reps in person are even horrible as well there not even professional . i feel all they want is your money they always try to talk you into something totally different then what you want .	4449
0	after waiting an hour and being second on the list now i was told the person that had an appointment got to be ahead of us also and their appointment was over an hour away . their customer service is horrible they really need to find out how to be faster and more efficient with their customers so people can get in and out . all i needed was a sim card and i 'm still here waiting . i would hate to be the 7th guy on the list they are going to spend their entire saturday here . will be finding a new at & t store to go to	4449
0	the wait for something quick was brutal . i was not advised about the wait when greeted and signed up , just `` we will be with you shortly '' and it took 1 hour to be helped . i feel if the wait is long like that i should have been warned . also my phone was about to die , i asked for a charger and was told by staff they did n't have any iphone charger ... seriously ? super frustrated customer .	4449
1	such a warm welcoming from the moment you walk in .. i dont agree with this being any less stars . management has improved tremendously in the past few years . the staff is new with very respectful receptionists who make you feel comfortable as can be even over the phone ; i came to get my hair done by a junior and i am more then thrilled i definitely recommend this to all my friends thankyou ninos you gained a new client	4450
1	since i started going to gio i 've been getting more compliments on my haircuts than ever before . very happy with his work ! i go about once every six weeks , it 's affordable and he let 's me come in to get one free touch-up between visits . go with him , trust me , you wo n't be disappointed !	4450
1	just got my face waxed here , i was really nervous due to a bad waxing experience i had in the past at another place . marina , was so nice and put my fears at ease . i would definitely come back here again !	4450
0	out of control prices . i went for a trim and was charged almost $ 100 . make sure you ask for prices before sitting down . out of control prices . the service was awful . i felt really uncomfortable with the hairdresser who was making me feel awkward . the lady at the desk was also on her phone the entire time and took her a minute to greet me once she looked up from her phone and noticed i was standing there .	4450
0	worst haircut of my life . hairdresser seemed rushed . uneven cut , did n't listen to instructions . never again	4450
0	yes , i have to totally agree with liz t. i had the same experience ... i came in for a trim and the stylist suggested *some* foils . sure .. what i did n't expect was the the overpriced $ 185 bill . horrible experience , bitchy staff , never again .	4450
1	this is a truly great dd ! the crew there is very professional , kind , and competent ! they deserve the highest accolades . i still think dd coffee is the absolute best tasting ! it sure beats the stratospherically priced starbucks blend down the street . and i love their muffins too ! you just ca n't go wrong with this classic place !	4451
1	the coffee is good and the service is prompt . the only issue is there is no drive thru which makes this location a little less convenient than others . that being said , i still find myself here quite often .	4451
1	this is my favorite dd . i do n't know why , but the managers special donut here is better than all the other locations . i 've been to the fairview park dd , the avon dd , and the lorain rd locations , and for some reason the donuts just are n't as good as this one . now granted , i 'm only talking about the managers special , but if you 're a cream filled donut lover , you know that some are just better than others .	4451
1	typical dunkin donuts where it takes a little too long to get your items and parking can be incredibly scarce at times . munchkins are of course the bomb and you can buy them individually for 30 cents a piece which they do n't tell you . good for the kiddos .	4451
1	if i do n't start my day here the rest of my day sucks , mona sheryl and mary are the best . too many new employees who do n't focus on the regulars .	4451
0	this place employs racist people who treat u like crap . my friend recently was treated poorly on a visit . the worker pretended to forget to make their drink and after 15 minutes of waiting they asked about their drinks instead of fixing the problem the lady got an attitude giving them their drink eventually ( which was incorrect ) and instead of handing it to her she set it on the counter purposely . i never apologized for any inconvenience do not recommend this location	4451
0	parking is horrible at any time of day ! horrible ! never once have they made my mocha iced coffee right , to much chocolate or the coffee is old . i have since started driving to the fairview dd where they make it perfect ! nothing ruins my morning like lousy coffe . also , fairview 's coffee is cheaper and they have a drive thru !	4451
0	used to be the best place for coffee until about september last year . i 'd rather spend double at starbucks and have coffee that 's acceptable	4451
0	the morning crew is rude , negative and angry ! girl with hoop nose ring is nasty ! she is mean , plain and simple ! she needs to loose her disgusting attitude at the door ! makes me cringe !	4451
0	i 've yet to taste a fresh donut . they are always stale . i 'm sure they 're better in the morning hours but this is a donut shop if i 'm correct . so i know i should n't expect the best tasting donuts at 8 pm but it 's sad that i have to go to giant eagle for donuts . which by the way are amazing . lol	4451
1	this show was fun ! when you first walk in you get to pick up a `` rock of ages '' lighter to sway in the air	4452
1	excellent performances by the cast , band , crew , light/sound technicians , and stage management ! if you love 80 's hair bands and musical theatre comedy , this will be a hilarious trip down memory lane ! ( and bravo to this production for deciding to go union , actors ' equity association , last year ! )	4452
1	haiku review : get ready to rock - this one 's about fun , not plot . a real party show . i 'll take eighties rock over thumpy club music any day . rock out ! i did n't care for '' sixties berkley hippie . '' kind of annoying . it 's about big hair , big voices , big hearts , makeup on gross chiseled men	4452
1	great show ! went with some girl friends and it was a blast . the jokes were great from the narrator , the songs were rad , and the story was fun . if you love big hair 80 's rock music ... this is your show ! ! after the show head over to the bourbon room , which is the 80 's vj bar , the wait staff are all decked out in 80 's gear and the vj is hilllllarious . bonus is you get a free shot if you came from the show ! !	4452
1	i do n't understand how this show could be rated less than 4 stars , but i guess you ca n't please everyone . i agree with another reviewer , you have to like musicals and 80 's rock to really enjoy it . the show was awesome and worth every penny . we sat in section 1 , row n close to the isle which was perfect .	4452
1	very good singers and dancers that make you happy to relive the 80 's , they play the songs perfect into their skits . high energy , they even give you a 7 minute whizz break in the middle of the show which was quite funny , also had servers selling beer seat to seat pretty awesome	4452
1	this was one of the funniest , most entertaining live acts i 've ever seen . if you have ever done a rocky horror picture show on a hallowe'en you understand the audience participation fun ! loved it . if i had a girlfriend party going to las vegas , i 'd go see this again .	4452
1	this is one of the best shows i 've seen ... i grew up in the 80 , s and love the music ... rock of ages is a must see ... you 'll love it ... .you will be singing along with the music ...	4452
1	we went to vegas in feb 2015 to get married . this was the only show we saw . after doing one of those time share things , we got to see it for free . it was well worth the agonizing 2-3 hrs listening to them try to sell us a time share . joey fatone was starring in the show and it was a lively entertaining performance . even if we had paid for it , it would have been worth it . i 'd definitely go again .	4452
1	amazing show ! best musical in las vegas . some adult content , but this is vegas and you should expect that .	4452
1	was a great show but i expected more music . it was a sitcom with music weaved into it . i would rather just have the music . the stage set up was great and looked like a hollywood rock club . i sat on the right end so i was unable to see the stairs on the right side of the stage when the cast were on them . so make sure to stay away from end seats next to wall . was very entertaining and identical to the movie . in the middle of the performance they give a 7 minute intermission . for this performance you will get to sit all through it so that was good .	4452
1	saw the show with my wife and loved it , come ready to rock out with your sock out : )	4452
1	i liked this musical very much . the price was fair and the seating was great . this is more a satire then a true love story . great music selection and the lady 's definitely show off their skills . the narrator was very funny and kept the crowd engaged . the clientele was a mostly baby boomers . i would recommend this show .	4452
1	this show is great ! deducting one star simply because of the staff outside the show . you can not enter the theater with drinks , no problem , so we stood by the table they asked us to until we finished , after 5 min the staff came up to us and said we could no longer stand there . we were not drunk , loud , or inappropriate , we were standing where we were asked and the show still had 10 min before it started . the ladies were just rude , we are on vegas , pull the stick out if your ass and have fun rio staff . i wish the show would go to a better hotel .	4452
1	this show is the complete opposite of everything the venetian and palazzo market themselves to be . it 's a contradiction i 'm grateful for but still very confused on . the show is fantastic ! it 's a guaranteed great time . if you love the 80 's be prepared to sing your heart out to the great classic rock that made that era ! ! ! ! the cast members were amazing and did a superb job on the story delivery . the stage was built to near perfection . i have n't seen the movie but the show was a definite winner ! ! !	4452
1	that was a really fun couple of hours . funny , irreverent and perfectly accurate to the 80 's . having watched the motion picture it was hard not to think of tom cruise , russell brand and alec baldwin in their roles . the narrator stole the show , the guy was seriously good at his job .	4452
1	are you ready to rock ? you better be when you come to see this show ! i did n't really know what to expect from the show . i have n't watched the movie , but was excited to see what was in store for us . the show is so much fun and hilarious . so many great rock songs from the 80 's are showcased in this show and all the characters are a blast . they have great voices and even better comic timing . there is n't a slow moment in the show and they keep it rocking the entire time . i 'm a big fan and i ca n't wait to have the opportunity to see it again .	4452
1	it was a good show and the staff was great . we went on a saturday night and the venue was only half full ! i would recommend it to friends and visitors . it was fun to sing and dance along to the music and the actors were great at keeping the audience involved .	4452
1	this show was awesome ! we all had a great time and went on a day when they were n't too busy so we got free upgraded seats . the venue is on the smaller side , so there are n't really any bad seats . the cast was great and the show is funny . it 's a cool experience .	4452
1	myself and 3 friends / family saw the show on feb 26th . we had a blast ! it was super entertaining , fun to sing along to , and i got glitter bombed by joey fatone . i highly recommend seeing this show !	4452
1	my husband and i saw this at rio casino in las vegas . we enjoy theater and musicals and since we are in our mid-forties we naturally gravitated towards the theme of rock of ages . the music and score did not disappoint . the music is familiar and there is a live band performing all the numbers . many of the song arrangements were medleys put together to fit the context of the narrative ; a story which is simple , predictable and formulaic , but the performers do a top notch job ! this is a very high energy show that 's a lot if fun . a solid four star performance .	4452
0	terrible service at ticket counter , a friend bought complimentary tickets for me and they would not provide because i was not the same person who purchased them so i had to cancel the order and put them on my credit card . employees terribly rude and unhelpful and made me late for show . the show was good if you can avoid the terrible service issues .	4452
0	my husband and i have seen this show 6 times , 4 in vegas , 1 in seattle & 1 in new york . now obviously we love 80 's music but i have to say when the show was at the venetian seating was great as it was theatre style so everyone could easily see the show . i 'm giving this 2 stars as seating sucks at the rio . we will be going to vegas again this year and sadly as long as the show is at the rio we will not be going . the show itself is great & fun but not when you ca n't see it .	4452
0	way , way , too loud , and no point to the story . bored in the first few minutes . there was n't anything to it .	4452
0	very poorly organized-ended up being forced to let others with ga rickets in front of us . they acted like this multi-year running show was opening night . the only redeeming factor was that the music was really good . the ticket says 5+ years-do n't bring a young child .	4452
0	should be called porn of ages with a little bit of rock . terrible show	4452
0	if you like glee and/or musicals than you 'll probably love this show . if you do n't and your a big 80 's fan , then you 'll be disappointed , as i was . to sum it up it 's like an 80 's glee on steroids . not so great acting . one of the main characters is a girl and she has to sing these great big classics which just do n't suit her voice . songs like 'every rose has it 's thorn ' should be sung by a guy with a rocker voice and not sung by a woman like it 's straight out of west-side story !	4452
0	roa was an absolute let down . i was so excited to rock out to classic 80 's music but five minutes into the show it was evident that the creators/writers/producers are far more interested about making the show about sex than any other aspect of the 80 's . the constant sexual references and gestures were exhausting and after an hour i left with the five other people in my group . $ 600 down the drain and we could n't even endure the whole show . i was hoping for a fun show but this inappropriate , disgusting , crude production left me with nothing but disappointment and an empty wallet . absolutely do not take your kids to this ! !	4452
0	loved the artists on stage but we had less than a great experience with staff who mishandled a situation with a wedding party .	4452
0	ticket ordering is very confusing in las vegas . ticket prices can largely range . we sat on the main floor ( all seats level ) . therefore , you tend to be sitting looking at a tall person 's head -- -we 'd of been better off in more comfortable seats around the parameter of the room . main floor seats were conference room `` type '' and uncomfortable . good talent , but i was expecting more of a rock show . they sing a number of old hits but it is more of a theatre production . would not be my top pick of shows in the city for the price .	4452
0	firstly i need to say the actors were very talented and all 2 stars are for them . but the over the top and disgusting toilet humor and perverted sex jokes in this play made it unbearable ... .. i could n't wait to get out of there ! ! a note to the actors ... . you are all so talented dont pimp out your superb talent ... hold out for something more worthy of your skills .	4452
0	i 've seen alot of shows at el dorado theater that i 've really enjoyed . however , rock of ages was a disappointment . my friends and i thought the storyline was cheesy , distasteful and the show was close to 2 hours long . i give credit to the cast for their talent but would n't agree with them to say this show has turned timeless music into a new classic .	4452
0	i just do n't know about this show . the majority of the cast with the exception of the lead male character did not sing well . although i like that type of music and enjoyed rock of ages the movie very much , i could n't get into the show . i did n't find the narrator/comedian guy funny at all and fell asleep during the 2nd half ( and that was actually the better half ) . a lady in the same row as me was also sleeping so i was n't alone . the theater was half empty .	4452
0	i 'm not sure why this show has such a high rating ... i felt the show was really nothing special , i would n't go if they gave me free tickets . the humor was juvenile and the music was ok but not up to jersey boys standards . go to jersey boys or absenthe they are 5 star shows and they cost about the same price .	4452
0	for nearly 11 months , i 've been attempting to express in words the amount of suckiness that is involved in rock of ages . the urge to avoid a whitesnake reference in my yelp ! review probably sucked up 9 of my lost months . i tried . i really , really tried . please do n't pay for this show . go sell yourself next to the fremont hotel . you 'll feel better in the morning .	4452
0	loved the incredible music and talented singers . hated the frequent sexual innuendos and overt sexual references ( including a couple `` doing it '' in a bathroom stall ) . too much crude humor and playing to the lowest common denominator this overshadowed for me what could have been an awesome trip down my own 80 's memory lane . was embarrassed that i took my wife to see this , and we left at intermission .	4452
0	i would leave no stars if possible . i was looking around the audience to see if i was the only one in dismay at how horrible this show was . the music was off , singers could n't sing , not funny at all and just low class . i really expected more from the venetian and wish i could get my $ 70 back .	4452
0	the first act was a sleeper unfortunately . after the intermission it did pick up more . not worth the money spent ... perhaps it 's burnt out and the reason why the show is finishing at the end of the year .	4452
0	this was the most god awful musical i 've ever seen . we left after 10 min because we could n't take it any longer . do not waste your money .	4452
0	did n't like the show although i 'm from the 80s era . i thought it was written poorly although the male lead actor was great . the acting was mediocre ... not sure if i would like to pay the price of $ 62 from the half price tickets for the entire experience even . just my 2 cents .	4452
0	if you love 80 's rock do not go to this show ! they butcher every song they sing . and only play half of the songs . then they try an act for ten minutes in between songs . i am an 80 's rock fanatic and i walked out of this show . the only good music was before the show and at intermission . a complete waste of money . terrible voices and they have the chicks singing the majority of the songs . if you pay more than $ 5 a ticket your a sucker . they are leaving the venetian for good reason , they suck !	4452
0	not amazing and not first rate . mixing today 's thrusting grinding hips with yesterday 's music in a r-ish rated high school musical kind of way , only not as entertaining or cohesive . what a waste of money and the possibility of seeing a great show in vegas . seemed like everyone around us were trying to get into it but it lacked momentum in trying to have a story .	4452
1	excellent service , knowledge , helpful , - this whole practice gives hope for wellness . dr amy is professional and intent in her role of helping you achieve the best you can be . to work as a partner with a health care profressional is so rare - i have been a patient for almost a year and the difference is amazing . of course , you have to participate in your wellness program . she can only lead the path , and pave the way . wellness is our responsibilty .	4453
1	dr. sparks is a great doctor . i highly recommend her . she is current and well versed in lyme disease .	4453
1	dr. amy is the best ! . pay no attention to the negative review below . dr. sparks is perhaps the most intuitive physician i have ever visited . my family and i have been patients of hers for several years . her insight and expertise have helped me far beyond what i would have expected . her ability to size up the situation and suggest proper treatment options is right on the money . my health has improved tremendously over the last five years and a huge part of that is due to my association with dr. sparks . if i could give her 10 stars , i would . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4453
1	i usually see maureen parker , who i am grateful to for practically saving my life ! i 've only seen dr sparks once but i like her too . this has been the best doctors office i 've ever been too . the waits can be a bit long but i expect they are giving other people the detail care they are giving me so i do n't mind waiting .	4453
1	dr. sparks was my family primary care doctor for over 18 years . she took great care of my kids , always took her time and diagnosed a few tricky conditions over the years . she did n't just stop and treat the easiest diagnosis ... she ran tests , asked so many questions ... occasionally pulled out her little book in her pocket and really took time to figure things out . i stayed with her till the day i moved away from las vegas and i highly recommend her . only a few times i had to see other docs in her practice , but over the years i would usually wait to see her personally .	4453
0	place seems like a serious scam ! i called to ask how long of a wait there is for a new patient . i was told they only accept new `` functional medicine clients . '' i would need to pay $ 250 to get started and a crazy quarterly fee as well . besides the fees they would bill my insurance . mind you i never even said what my problem was that i was calling for . what a joke ! ! ! craziest first phone call i 've ever had to a `` professional doctors office ''	4453
0	i was excited when i found a doctor with lyme disease experience and who took my insurance . unfortunately , her outrageous charges prevented me from even booking an appointment . before you can be seen for an initial visit , you have to pay a new patient fee and a quarterly fee . i think it was around $ 600 , and your insurance wo n't pay for it . that is ridiculous . if you start out charging that , i ca n't imagine what fees you will pay if she becomes your doctor . no thanks .	4453
0	practice was fine when i began 8 years ago - i was actually able to see the doctor . as time went on doctor was too busy to see me , staff became increasingly rude and having prescriptions called in to the pharmacy was a trial . when i became ill last year and asked for an appointment with the doctor , i faced a 5 month wait and went to another practice , which saved my life . repeated complaints caused teachers health trust to drop amy sparks from its list of providers in july 2015 . patient care is not a priority here .	4453
0	this is a late post , but necessary . i had an appt with pa jay because other pa left . he was very rude and will never see him again . i started to ask questions pertaining to my health and was told that i could n't talk , he would be doing the talking . i was concerned about rashes on my legs and he blew me off ... saying , oh it must be eczema and did n't want to discuss it further . i am very disappointed in dr sparks ' decision to have him join her staff . he 's rude , nonprofessional and does n't represent the medical profession in a positive way . stay away from him ! ! !	4453
0	do n't even bother to go there the worst costumer service in town every stuff the think he have power to speak with u like a little shit . time is never issue there u always been sees 2 hours after your time	4453
1	my pool motor was out of warranty . shasta was very expensive , double the service charge compared to aaron 's . stetson came over and inspected our problem . he was polite and professional . he fixed our issue and then said he noticed a small leak and would need to return later with a new part . an hour later he was back with daniel . they took about a half hour and now everything works great . total charge was $ 150.00 . eureka , i have found my pool company for life . you can trust this company . ask for stetsen . thank you stetsen and daniel , great job . sincerely bob and maria atanasio	4454
1	stetson is the best pool tech ! ! ! he came on time and fixed the problem within 15 minutes . aaron pool is sent to me by the warranty company . but i always make sure i ask for him . he is extremely knowledgably and courteous . you can ask him anything , and he does n't mind you standing over his shoulder asking questions ! !	4454
1	mike came out in response to my home warrant call . i was contacted by the company right away and mike was even running ahead of schedule ! he was incredibly knowledgeable , able to correctly predict was was wrong simply by looking at my pool . it turned out that my issue was not covered by the home warranty and was about to cost me . however , mike found the exact part i needed without replacing an entire section , and so i only had to pay the basic call fee . all the while , he explained everything that was going on and answered all of my questions . what a positive experience !	4454
1	so strange to see all of these comments . my experience with aaron pools has been spectacular . i have been using their service now for over six years in both repairs and for cleaning services . the technicians that have serviced my pool equipment have always dressed professionally and have been extremely knowledgeable in explaining repairs . thanks for your service . i 'd like to personally thank stephanie for being so friendly and fitting me into the schedule .	4454
1	aaron pools did a great job for my home warranty fix . they called me quickly and the tech andrew they sent out was very knowledgeable and even helped with another issue my pool was having .	4454
1	aaron pools has been out to my house twice and i was very happy with their work both times ! aj came out here the first time to replace my sand filter for my pool and he did a wonderful job and was very nice ! and recently mike and aj came out to my house to install a grab bar hand rail for my pool . they did a wonderful job and cleaned up the area fantastic ! the cost was very fair and was half of what another company quoted me and i knew that they were trying to rip me off ... . i would refer my friends and family to aaron pools anytime ... . thank you !	4454
1	mike , the owner , personally came out to address a spa light issue that ended up just being a bad bulb . he changed the bulb out as a favor , even though we were outside of our warranty period . thank you , mike , for your customer service !	4454
1	aaron pools was assigned by my home warranty company as the service provider for my pool pump , which was leaking . i was contacted by aaron pools very quickly after placing my service order online with the warranty company . they were able to schedule a technician ( aj ) the next day . aj showed up on time , diagnosed the problem , and came back within a couple of hours with the needed parts . i am very happy with the service provided by aj and aaron pools .	4454
1	my pool timer went bad and aaron pools came out same day pin pointed problem and installed timer at a very reasonable cost . then about 6 months later my pool cleaner died . i contacted aaron pools for recommendation on replacement . again they came out and replaced old with new at a very reasonable cost . they also replaced my backwash hose at no cost . my pool looks great and is problem free . i would definetly recommend aaron pools for any large or small problem .	4454
1	my pool looked terrible and was in need of an acid wash. alex from aaron pools arrived on time , set the pump to drain the pool , returned the next day and completed the acid wash . pool looks fantastic ! thanks , guys !	4454
1	aaron pools has been out 3 times this season for unrelated issues . each time i was consistently greeted with professionalism throughout the process from the office scheduling to the technician calling me when on his way . being a new pool owner i was completely clueless . mike gave me some valuable maintenance tips to help prevent future service calls . it was a good experience every time !	4454
1	mike has always been quick to respond and competitively priced in the service he has provided over the years . i always know he has my back !	4454
1	i went through home warranty to get my spa fixed - it continued to trip my breaker . the technician was very knowledgeable and let me know immediately what the issue was . there was replacement parts required and i was quoted a fair price and quick turnaround time . aj was my technician , the company gave me a reminder call the day before the appointment with a 2 hour window . aj called at the front end of that window the day of the appointment and let me know he was 20 minutes out . he was great to work with and showed me more about my spa than what i knew . very good service .	4454
1	i have dealt with this company twice now . both times excellent service both on the phone and the repair person . he fixed the issue in no time . excellent service ! !	4454
1	contacted aaron pools per my home warranty . receptionist was very pleasant scheduling an appointment . service technician a.j . did a great job . fixed the leaks in my system and my pump is now running great . lucky everything was covered in the warranty .	4454
1	aj did an exceptional job repairing our pool pump and filter . he was professional and had everything running quickly . aj replaced the piston , valve and made certain that everything was working properly before he left . thank you for the great service	4454
1	i was a little worried when the technician came out and did n't fix my pump that sounded like a jet engine . we called the office and they were great ! they apologized and even went way above and beyond what they had too . highly recommend them ! ! !	4454
1	andrew was at my home today because my pool filter was not working . he came right on time , diagnosed the problem and fixed it within 15 minutes . he was very knowledgeable and friendly . i will definitely be using them in the future .	4454
1	i have been using aaron pools for 1 year and have received outstanding service . it is a pleasure to speak with this team of professionals . from the time i dial and speak with the customer service representative until the work on my pool is completed , i have received world class support . mike and his team know pool equipment better than anyone i have ever utilized . they come prepared , are meticulous as they service equipment and the work is done correctly the first time . i highly recommend this pool service corporation , you will not be disappointed ! ! ! thank you aaron pool	4454
1	aaron pools is a good company that tried to make things right . i would say there is no reason you would not get great service with them . american home shield should be avoided like the plague if your getting a house warranty .	4454
0	...	4454
0	i had them scheduled to come through my home owners insurance and they showed up 2 weeks later . the front desk girl is lying about calling 7 times and leaving messages . no one called .	4454
0	terrible company . they do not listen to their messages or call you back when you leave a message . they came to my house to replace my pool motor and it leaked worse when they left .	4454
0	horrible customer service . aaron pools was `` assigned '' to my home warranty pool issue . i called them on a thursday after receiving the work order # from my warranty company . they stated that they had 48 hours to call me and schedule a visit , and they would call me back . i finally received a call from them the following monday , 47 business hours from when i started the claim . they obviously do n't care about customer service . do n't give them your business !	4454
0	a rip off . they actually called me up and scolded me for not cleaning my pool . at one point they left a paper bag at the bottom of the pool for over three weeks . we left it there to see how long it would take them to remove it and they never did . new technicians all the time , only one was good . our pool never looked so bad as while they were servicing it . each tech had different things they did/did not do . they back washed once a month to start then stopped doing it altogether . very dissatisfied .	4454
0	i really want to like aaron pools . i 've been with them for a long time but enough is enough . the quality of their cleaning and maintenance is shoddy and lazy in my opinion . i watched their techs stay for no more than 5 minutes . the bottom of my pool floor had visible dirt and the water was cloudy . there has been a lot of turnover in terms of their pool boys . with rare exception , most have been less than stellar . their front office can be difficult to deal with . i can echo the experiences others have had with the manager and owner . i can not recommend them .	4454
0	extremely poor customer service . aaron was sent by home warranty co to repair our spa . they showed up unexpectedly without scheduling . woman answering phone in office was apathetic and then defensive and extremely rude ( she hung up on us ! ) . technician was condescending and curt , and was not interested in helping or answering questions . when we lodged a complaint with our home warranty company , aaron said they refused to return because things were thrown at the technician and profanities were screamed at the secretary ( all absolute lies ) . unless you enjoy incompetence , lies and aggravation , avoid this place at all costs !	4454
0	they service the pool in the house we lease . they replaced a previous , incompetent , pool company . they originally came out to do warranty work on the pump , and they talked themselves up so much we hired them to do our weekly maintenance . i now know it was all talk . they are very inconsistent in their service . this is the second time now that we ca n't even use the pool because it 's all messed up ! and then they do n't show up to make the repairs . horrible !	4454
0	not sure what pool service should entail but i get inconsistent service . sometimes they add chlorine tabs , sometimes not , sometimes they sweep , sometimes not . this is a rental house where i hired a professional to maintain my equipment and relieve my tenants of the burden but there is a lack of communication somewhere . water level dropped to point that it burned up my motor and then they explained their policy about not filling the pool to run up my bill . the expensive repair on that could have bought about 50,000 extra gallons : (	4454
0	home warranty company has sent them out multiple times to replace my booster pump . each time they write down parts numbers , but my booster pump has not been replaced or even repaired . job is marked in their system as complete . what a joke . update : aaron pools has called twice within the past 24 hours to ask my husband to make me take down this review . somehow the person on the phone managed to deliver even worse customer service than the rude technician who came to my house .	4454
0	i would have to agree with the rest of the reviews on here . aaron pools came out and said my motor was covered in leaves and that is what caused the motor to heat up and shut down . there were no leaves around the pool pump and one week later the same problem occurred and they told me it would be a week before they could come back out . i understand that home warranty companies hire the cheapest and by the looks of it the worst companies they can find so i am not surprised and i will be canceling my home warranty and will not have aaron pools back to my house .	4454
0	terrible service . a tech came out 3 times to fix a leak and low pressure in the filter . each time i had to call the office to figure out what the techs did and kept telling them the leak was worse than before . now the filter is n't working at all anymore and i had to sit on the phone with my home warrenty company to request another pool service company come out and repair their fuck ups . i would avoid this company at all costs .	4454
0	terrible service . we 've been using aaron pools for several months and our pool is infested with algae and is super filthy . went out to check the chlorine tablets and it was completely empty . i thought the point of having a pool cleaning service was to actually clean your pool . we tried to call them to fix this and they just kept skipping appointments and brushed us off . called a new company and they were out the same day and we now have a clean pool !	4454
0	these people are straight up fraudsters . they replied to the ag by sending a doctored quote , this time adding $ 76 for `` freight '' , deducting the $ 65 they claim was never a security deposit , and then writing in a balance due of $ 11 . this is crazy . please beware of these people .	4454
0	wow bad customer service on front line . horrible need to have your first person be a lot more professional ca n't understand her voice and asking to repeat rude . canceled after several attempts to get them at my house called warenty company and asked them to look at all reviews . do not waist your time and money with the company .	4454
0	tech sent had to come back and fix his work . both times the same tech was a total schmuck to my wife . condescending , not very good at quality ... mostly if they replaced the dirtbag late 80 's ex rocker for a tech , i could deal with the work . but until they get rid of the singular tech that is running their company into the ground , their review will not improve . after investing thousands with this company , i would never return to them again . lesson = learned .	4454
0	company was sent out through home warranty and they did a horrible job . i was worried as i saw all the other reviews confirming my concern . they did n't repair the job and then made it worse we had to call another pool company to fix their problem .	4454
0	if your home warranty company refers you to aaron pools for service do yourself a huge favor and ask for someone else for service . someone things that were working just fine all of a sudden do n't when they leave . his response `` bad luck '' . when the technician calls back he is rude and talks over you while raising his voice and acts like he was doing us a favor by fixing what he was contracted to do through the warranty company .	4454
0	awful company , awful service and crappy attitude . they made wrong diagnosis and caused more issues with the pool . i would n't hire them . simply awful .	4454
0	called home warranty company about a pool issue - they sent aaron pools out . a part was installed backwards causing a significant loss of water - they came out and fixed the problem but we had to refill a portion of the pool . they refused to pay the difference in our water bill due to their mistake . will never use this company again and may re-think home warranty company american home shield .	4454
1	cara was amazballs ! ! ! ! i 'm from out of state and my charger stopped working that i bought in ca . she replaced it , no hassle knowing she would n't even be making a commission.. make sure you ask for her	4455
1	this review is more for taylor who works at this store . she went above and beyond what she was obligated to do for me . she 's super polite , professional and is very knowledgeable when it vines to all the plans and whay would be better for you as a customer . she helped me save some coins on my t-mobile plan ! who does n't love saving money ! ? ! i was vey happy when i left the store and grateful i she helped me , because trust me ... dealing with customer service reps etc at the phone companies is n't always the most joyful experience . this was a breath of fresh air !	4455
1	my husband and i have been going to this location for several years and the staff have always been friendly , helpful and able to assist us . they are well staffed and have gone out of their way to provide great customer service .	4455
1	to shayne and taylor , thank you for your help and patience . great customer service and team work .	4455
0	pretty poor customer service and rude staff . went in there to exchange a phone case and screen protector because the associate mistakenly gave the wrong one and they were less than helpful . i guess they only appear nice and willing to help when you are buying something or signing up .	4455
0	poor customer service . i asked a question over the phone and explained it , and only got a response `` i do n't understand '' . i then asked to talk to some one else who might be able to or would try to understand my question ; the lady on the other end said `` i am the manager here '' . so i did n't get my question answered and they did n't get my business .	4455
0	they are very dishonest do n't go to that tmobile location . all they want is commission . they add stuff to your account without your permission .	4455
0	i 've been here twice . both times terrible customer service . very rude , poor knowledge , angry staff members . bri was one of those staff members .	4455
1	3rd time to this salon and their services are great ! everyone is friendly and they have created a beautiful & relaxing environment !	4456
1	i started going to moderns nails and spa when my sister-in-law was getting married . they were so accommodating for the 8 of us that came in , we got our nails done quickly and everyone was friendly . i kept going in , because the owner , danielle , is always friendly and she does my pink and white powder nails perfectly every single time . my sister gets her nails done here as well . anytime my friends need their nails done , i recommend moderns nails and spa !	4456
1	first time here today , i got a gel fill . the girl i had was rather quiet , bland not very friendly and not happy to be there it seemed . i think the employees of nail salons really make or break the experience . the gel polish is n't very shiny ... . which i 've never experienced before , although i do like the color . it was affordable $ 30 gel fill , the place was clean and modern . overall ... ... have n't decided if i will return . if i do return i will update .	4456
1	this is a great nail salon and spa . i got my nails done today and they look great . there is a bit of a wait for acrylics but it 's worth the wait i promise ! i love my nails- they look great ! will be back . : )	4456
1	love danielle ! she does my gel manicure and always takes great care of me and my nails ! i have had almost everyone for a pedicure and always nice and relaxing . danielle remembers almost everyone who comes in and works to make sure your experience is a good one . staff is always friendly and it 's a beautiful new space .	4456
1	i love moderns nail and spa . david is amazing , a pure professional.angie does a fab pedi.the best i have ever had , they are so polite..and clean.when you make an appointment , you are taken on time.i have been to many nail salons and would rate them the best ...	4456
1	love coming here ! ! i am the pickiest person when it comes to getting my nails done but kelly kills it every time ! she is by far the best nail technician i have had in arizona . it is always clean and the people are so welcoming and friendly ! great prices and great environment . go see kelly and tell her i sent you !	4456
1	my mom , sister and i all go here when we need our nails done . i love how welcoming they are and helpful when it comes to choosing our colors . the owners are always friendly and will make sure my family leave satisfied . i get the dip powder now and the owner does an exceptional job . there is n't ever a rush to get it done . my sister never can choose a color and the owner is patient with her and helps her too . my mom goes to nancy who never disappoints . i highly recommend this location for the good prices and amazing customer care . the owners are very passionate people and only want the best !	4456
1	i have been here 3 times since it opened love my pedicure they definitely took their time , and it does n't hurt that i found my favorite nail technician danielle .	4456
1	this place is best , period ! ! i have lived in the valley for 15 years and gone to nail salons all over town . this place honestly just does a better job than the other salons . it 's clean ( most importantly ) , decorated nicely and their technicians do a wonderful job . i was actually surprised at their attention to detail ! they are always friendly and fast to get me in . if you want to treat yourself , do the pedicure that includes the paraffin wax and orange slices treatment . it 's worth it ! ! : )	4456
0	never a consistent price . you think you are going to pay one price and they gouge you when you go to check out . never going back .	4456
0	never a consistent price . you think you are going to pay one price and they gouge you when you go to check out . never going back . well , decided to go back and same thing happened . $ 30 for a gel color change ? you better get your price in writing before you let them start . definitely not giving it a third try	4456
0	i must tell you about the salon the first time i was here i had a pedicure and tommy did a very good job i was quite pleased however the gentleman next to him took out his nail instruments . that we 're not sterilized ( i watched him take it from his cart from the previous customer ) so today is my second time in this salon just to have a gel manicure removed and i have to say it is a very somber salon not at inviting or friendly the staff does n't even speak english they do n't even pretend to know what you 're saying it 's actually too bad because it 's in a great location .	4456
0	this place is gross . after scrubbing my feet ( callus removal ) , the nail tech shook the towel out over the floor to get the skin off ! he also just dipped the cheese grater thing they use in the water my feet were sitting in and then put it back on his cart . as if it had been cleaned . my pedicure was only 25 minutes and he was so rough that it was painful ! never again .	4456
0	poor service . not customer sensitive . i would not recommend giving this shop your business .	4456
0	never a consistent price . you think you are going to pay one price and they gouge you when you go to check out . never going back . well , decided to go back and same thing happened . $ 30 for a gel color change ? you better get your price in writing before you let them start . definitely not giving it a third try .	4456
0	this is a beautiful salon and based on the other reviews on yelp i thought i 'd give them a try . unfortunately , i was left disappointed . the staff was not welcoming at this establishment . it is unacceptable to not acknowledge a customer that walked in and waited several minutes for service . i will be taking my business elsewhere .	4456
0	i went in for a simple color change today , and was greeted in a friendly manner . unfortunately , the attendant did n't completely remove the existing nail polish , nor did she clean up the edges she painted . i saw other people leaving with full sets that looked nice , so i know they can do better . that said , i would never recommend this place for a simple color change .	4456
0	i 'm always so pleased by the outcome of my nails but there is a older gentleman that works there ( i believe is the owner ) and he 's is always so rude when i get him and has been rude to other customers in front of everyone . besides him i love everyone there and they always do such a great job !	4456
0	i was really disappointed with my pedicure . it 's was rushed and not at all relaxing . she basically rubbed lotion on my legs , cool i can do that at home . i can also cut my toenails too . everyone knows the best part of a pedicure is the massage . she did n't even rub my feet . i really wish i had the same experience as all the reviewers had .	4456
1	this is the best y in charlotte and that is saying something considering it 's age . every group class under the sun , loads of cardio equipment , great basketball in the gym and a helpful staff all make working out a little easier .	4457
1	just moved to clt and joined the ymca . it 's been recently renovated and it looks great . i prefer the workout classes , my favorite is athletic conditioning on the rooftop . it 's a difficult workout out but you get an awesome view of the city ! the entire gym is almost always packed and it can be tricky to lift due to the volume of people working out . i would recommend this y due to amount of workout space ( tho crowed ) and the selection on workout classes , plus they have daycare if you have children !	4457
1	this is one of the largest gyms i have lifted in . it has a large weight room area , racquetball courts ( although they have a line for the tin if you want to play squash ) , two pools , 4 basketball courts , and a ton of cardio equipment . the staff is extremely nice and will always provide a spot if needed .	4457
1	i just joined this about 3 weeks ago ... the thing i love about this y is that there are a ton of classes all throughout the day so i can find classes to go to before work or after work . they have a variety of classes and there is something for everyone . i love the roc-it class , it is a cardio and weight machines which is a great combo . the only downfall is how expensive it it , i know they base it on your salary but it still is pretty expensive for a gym	4457
1	let me start off by saying josh at the front desk is the bomb . from the moment my husband and i walked through the door on our first day he made us feel like we were the only people in the gym . on my third day , i forgot my headphones . josh let me borrow his beats . like , what ? ! i 've lived in charlotte now for 2 1/2 years and have worked out at quite a few gyms , but have never felt more welcomed at the dowd . the people are great , the facilities are clean and i could n't imagine ever leaving ! give me dowd or give me death .	4457
1	great and comfortable place to workout . i go to the pool a lot and there 's always a chance to hop in when i 'm there . i would try and avoid going at peak hours as the cardio equipment upstairs is hard to come by as well as a parking spot if you drive .	4457
0	wait 20 mins to get a parking spot then wait 15 for a machine no thanks . just cancelled and move to fitness connection for $ 10 bucks a month . for that price i can go to a swanky yoga studio on the weekends and still be cheaper than the y . this place is seriously over sold . stop selling more memberships when you do n't have enough space or equipment to accommodate current members . serious over crowding issue .	4457
0	love this gym but my god it 's a problem getting in there , this is now the 10 time this year that my account has been deleted or stopped or some shit , and every time they fix it and the apologize for the system and bla bla bla ... . fix it ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4457
0	crime is a problem ! i had my phone and keys stolen from me while i was in the pool at dowd . my babysitter had her car broken into in the dowd parking lot as well . both of these events took place within the last 2 months . it is not worth working out at a place where you and your property are unsafe .	4457
0	it 's a decent gym but the parking situation is horrible , and has been for months . it will take on average 20 minutes to find parking in the 5:30-7 pm timeframe . the gym suggested you avoid peak hours ( before work and after work ) but that is difficult because , like most people , i work during business hours . unless you qualify for a reduced rate based on your income , it is hardly inexpensive . i 'm glad they 're doing something to fix the parking now , but the reality is it should have been fixed years ago .	4457
0	the renovations are now impacting the quality of my ymca membership . there is no classes between 12:30 and 4 pm ? what a joke ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i 'm about to cancel my membership . this is garbage	4457
0	very disappointed in the staff at the ymca . front desk staff denied my guest pass as it was a sunday and it 's members only . i advised i had to use the restroom and staff ran after my guest and i in the bathroom scolding us for bad behavior of going to the bathroom without permission ! ! i have been a member for 15 years and have never felt so disrespected . my guest is immediately turned off to the idea of joining a facility like this one .	4457
1	bought a groupon , called in and got a same day reservation . was worried that they 'd be booked up on a weekend . we did wait a bit , but i did n't mind . there were a lot of things to look at in the waiting area , plus you can watch people shoot off the 50cal . the girls at the desk were really helpful . our 'instructor ' was zach . he was super sweet and did not rush us at all . *must* : you have to shoot the 50cal while you 're there ! ! ! what an experience !	4458
1	awesome experience ! karl and jonathan were informative and fun to work with . will definitely take visitors here on the regular !	4458
1	great staff very friendly and helpful and kick ass , felt really safe shooting and very comfortable . 20 out of ten	4458
1	awesome experience . girls were hotter than the guns ! lol . highly recommend for a great shooting experience and all around best customer service at any gun range in vegas . i actually bought my first gun here the prices were cheaper than the discount store . 5 stars !	4458
1	staff , facility , and experience first class . say goodbye to sleazy gun stores and say hello to g & a !	4458
1	purchased a firearm on 1/3/16 the salesman was both knowledgeable and professional . not a wide selection of ammo though . heading back to shoot today .	4458
1	these guys are best in town ! great customer service and very knowledgeable staff . lots of guns and gear in stock and shooting range where you can rent to shoot many pistols and rifles .	4458
1	i brought in a bcg to them on a sunday after my new lmt ar-15 kept blowing it 's gas rings . they were very concerned and gave me a lot attention to attempt a fix . they believed it was a manufacturing defect . i ended up purchasing a replacement bcg and the firearm worked fine . the service level here was impressive .	4458
1	just an overall great experience . the staff is very knowledgeable about all the firearms available which surprised me since they were also some of the more attractive women i 've seen in vegas . my instructor was an ex-marine and provide excellent instruction for each of the 4 firearms i shot . ca n't wait to do this again .	4458
1	really cool fun . staff was great and very attentive . great selection of guns to shoot . plenty of package options ( got a deal on groupon ) . would definitely recommend to any one interested	4458
1	the people here were so friendly and helpful . the gun range was very clean and respectful . they were constantly cleaning the floors of shells keeping them out of our way and to keep us safe . the observation lobby was convenient and comfortable for the people in our party . they had a large gun selection . i do n't like guns very much but i was very comfortable here .	4458
1	they knew i was there just to requalify and yet they treated me as if i was a high spending customer . the entire staff was very friendly and personable . they facility was the cleanest i 've ever seen in a gun range/store . knowledgeable helpful staff . would be a great place for first-time and veteran shooters alike . i strongly recommend checking this place out .	4458
1	the ladies at the gun garage were awesome and very attentive . theresa made the experience safe and enjoyable for my husband , brother , and father . all three had a great time . it was the highlight of our trip in las vegas . thank you !	4458
1	the staff is super nice and as tourist oriented this is , i like that they keep lanes open for locals too !	4458
1	had a great experience here . ed was very helpful and friendly . i ca n't wait until i can come back	4458
1	i went early - to avoid congestion . i was first guy in . had great help at the desk and 2 instructors . fired 3 fully auto machine guns ... added a pistol for practice 159.99 plus tax and tip . loved it . i took my time and was there 45minutes .	4458
0	gun range closed . all the signs and advertisements we saw said open 7 days a week 9am-7pm . wasted lyft ride and an hour . disappointed , employees just cleaning , no one available to give us a ride . sad	4458
0	beware , the gun garage has changed ownership and it is upside down . the girls are gone and there are two kids running things . they are about 15 years old . it took me fifteen minutes to get checked into the range . there was no air conditioning in the building . i know this because the crack of my ass was dripping with sweat as well as my forehead . the kid on the cash register does not know how to use it . there was one person in front of me and i waited twenty three minutes to get checked out and pay . it was a very poor experience and i was very upset .	4458
0	not too impressed . unless you 're a tourist ... it 's not really worth the time and money .	4458
0	i was excited after purchasing and scheduling an experience for my husband 's birthday . the day before , i called to make sure i knew the right location , and there was a message that the location is closed for an indefinite amount of time and everyone should request refunds . despite having all of my contact information , nobody from the business called me to let me know , and i 'm glad we were n't standing outside our hotel the next morning , waiting for the pickup !	4458
0	anyone looking for a real range should look elsewhere . this is simply a tourist trap ! ! i went to another local range and paid $ 10 and they rent guns for $ 6 . this is a rip joint where someone who does n't know better gets screwed ! ! they wo n't let you bring in ammo that you can get at walmart for $ 11 . they want $ 30 a box ! ! your gon na walk out with a $ 150 bill . most other places your paying under $ 30 for a rental , range ammo etc .	4458
0	avoid this place if you can . and do not buy the magtech ammo they sell . it is very poor quality , but very expensive . it 's slightly insulting that they charge such high prices for garbage ammo , and then lie to your face and tell you it 's high quality ammo . i will never return to this range .	4458
0	bait and switch on gun sales . they 've had a glock 21 advertised online and have it in their case . i took a look at it and told the man at the counter i wanted to buy it . he said it 's on a 30 day metro hold so i ca n't buy it , but i can buy the same gun new for a chunk more money . so ... why are you advertising a gun that you ca n't legally sell ?	4458
0	do not go to there next location horrible un professional racst group they hold you when you go to shoot there guns an dont let you in if your brwn	4458
0	come here if you want to be talked down to like a child . the eye candy behind the counters are obviously there for looks and not because of their extensive knowledge of firearms ( but that 's okay ... .just do n't come expecting very much help ) . overall ... ..very very poor customer service . wish i could leave a negative star rating .	4458
0	terrible place bad service bad people . over all bad everything horrible prices . owner abuses animals . would never put money in this d bags pocket .	4458
0	called for a reservation the day before . get there and they say all of their belt fed guns are down . i asked if they knew that when i called to make the reservation the day before and they said yes . why the heck would n't you disclose that . that 's bs . they want me to still pay $ 160 to send .223 and 9mm down range ? i do n't think so . go to battlefield vegas . we did and had a great time shooting the m249 .	4458
0	`` counter commandos '' at their finest , avoid this place if you can . asked if they had something thats pretty common in stock and received a look as if i was borderline retarded and told it was n't `` their thing '' . the thing is , i purchased 2 of this said item at the very same store previously . normally id just brush something like this off but since the guy behind the counter had an extra heir of douchetivity about him . i decided to warn the other faithful to avoid this place like the plague .	4458
0	i went here for my bachelor party and bought a 4 gun package . i went through 7 guns and all but 1 jammed . i had fun shooting automatics , but i was thoroughly disappointed . i got one extra clip ( as a consolation ) but the condition of the guns was sad ... it was not worth the money . free t-shirt ? who cares ! lame .	4458
0	hard to find , dingy , in a bad neighborhood and when we walked in one employee completely ignored us and the second addressed us in a somewhat annoyed fashion . also they did n't have hardly any selection and are a little pricy .	4458
0	over priced and unfriendly unless you 're a tourist coming in to over pay you 're not go in to get any attention . in a tacky attempt to attempt to get more tips they have hired an arsenal of attractive women to work the range ... if you 're a serious or semi serious gun person avoid this place !	4458
0	i stop by looking for parts . i asked the girl on the counter what caliber can be shot at the range , she said pistol caliber , so i said i can shoot a 22 long riffle . she replied pistol only . she probably did not understand i wanted to shoot a 22 lr buckmark .	4458
1	they were quick to schedule and quick to install . they did a great job ! they made color recommendations on our new pool fence and we are greatful . very easy to do business with .	4459
1	argus custom iron was great . came to my home and gave me a written quote and showed up exactly when he said he would . they were able to install the fence even sooner than they told us they could . day of install has been amazing . both of the guys were friendly went over everything with us . our new pool fence looks great and they cleaned up everything so our backyard looks great . we got a great company a great fence a great price and great customer service !	4459
0	they did n't show up for scheduled appointments at two locations to add locks to the gates . if you do n't want the business then just say so up front and do n't waste our time	4459
0	if your time is valuable do not call argus . two weeks ago , friday may 6th , nason met at my property , he seemed eager to listen to my request for the scope of the work . one werk later i had not heard anything , so i followef up with him on may 13th . he told be he would start working on it the 16th or 17th . i followed up on the 19th of june and he said i would have it the next day . today is the 21st and no response and no proposal . save yourself the frustration and call someone else .	4459
1	mahdi is amazing ! go see him for great deals on tablets and phone service , he wo n't let you down ! he is super friendly and always does whatever he can to help .	4460
1	mahdi is awesome ! he was very helpfull today ! although my problem was not fixed , due to the call center refusing to help me out , he did everything he could to try . i strongly recommend that u ask for mahdi if you come to this store .	4460
0	vick is a horrible salesman man and he 's a liar ! ! ! ! do not deal with him he told us what our bill would be and we got screwed and he has no professionalism .	4460
0	20 minute wait for service only to be told to they could connect me with customer service over the phone to get my problem resolved . they had no professionalism or knowledge of their products or how to assist me so i stood at the counter on the phone for 30 minutes with a very helpful customer service rep to get my issue resolved . i no longer recommend this location . the staff seemed totally uninterested in helping me out .	4460
1	non members can makes use of the facility and special events by asking the great front desk staff . my son loved his recent visit to a dive in movie and pizza night - float around while watching a movie ! life guard was very present during event . summer camp weeks are nice as well - staff worked with me for care and special pick up . outdoor pool is zero entry and fun during summer months .	4461
1	i am a huge fan of lifecenter plus because of its variety of class offerings . for someone like me who feels more motivated when working out with others , the classes here are great . 20/20/20 , kickboxing , circuit training , pilates , and yoga are just some of their many classes . i also love the fact that some take place at 5:30 and 6:30 to cater to the work crowd and noon for those who want to get a quick class in during their lunch break .	4461
0	mold all in the women 's shower room , when i mentioned this to one of the ladies at the front desk she had an attitude ...	4461
0	was a member here for about 3.5 years . my contract was only 12 months but continued to use the gym . we cancelled when we switched our billing and they did not accept amex . then about 3 months later i get a letter saying we owed them about $ 400 , now today i get a letter from a collection agency saying we owe almost $ 800 . the gym was purchased out of bankruptcy and there was always issues . you could count on the steam room and the hot tub to be down at least once a week and after a flood , there was always a mildew smell . they seem desperate for money now .	4461
1	very cool place . i always find what i 'm looking for here . i like to research things online before hand , then check out their online store , then drop in to see the product . the staff are also always ready to help . much better staffed than bestbuy and other large places .	4462
1	i 'm not a techy but i do have a compooter and when my geek friends ( and boyfriend ) need computer parts , they go to canada computers . the place is slightly cluttered but if you know what the heck it is you 're looking for you will find it with great speed and accuracy and the price point for this place is phenomenally good . you can also get memory cards for your digital camera at a much much better price than at camera stores . grab a geeky friend and go !	4462
1	really knowledgeable staff and ready to help . they wo n't steer you down the wrong path just to make a few extra bucks , they 'll set you up with what you need and nothing more . no sales pressure . i find them to be a little higher priced than what i would like but over-all they provide good value for the quality products they sell .	4462
0	you have to pay service charge to return your item ! that sucks ! !	4462
0	staff are very quick to give you the wrong ink cartridge for your printer , knowing full that with their no refund or exchange policy they 've just made some easy cash . when calling they 'll also try to confuse you with the which store question , pretending that there are actually 2 college street locations , one on the north and the other on the south side .	4462
0	usually i would give this place four stars but today i got someone who hates his job , hates customers or hates everything . i just needed a cable but he was singularly uninformed or unwilling to share his information . he was unhelpful to the max ! after he went to the back , i asked someone else and whereas this guy was happy to send me home with a $ 30 cable that would n't work , the next guy sent me home with a $ 9.99 cable that works perfectly . so go here , just avoid the redheaded guy with glasses and you 'll have a good experience .	4462
1	canadian tire has stepped up their game when it comes to customer service . two years ago i came here and could n't find a customer service rep without a serious search . this week i returned and my expectations were far surpassed when two staff members helped me find what i was looking for ( one helped me confirm it was the right product for my needs ) . i 'm really impressed . their prices are not the cheapest , but they tend to carry a lot of stock and a wide variety of products .	4463
1	well , all these negative reviews definitely did not fall on deaf ears . this store has now become a monument to efficiency , with a hefty team of eager attendants guiding you to the appropriate aisle with surgical precision .	4463
1	a little frustrating to navigate with the two floors and not really sure if you can bring your stuff , plus staff seemed too busy to really help ( not their fault it was very busy ) , but they had everything i needed which is more than i can say for many other of these sort of general stores that have a little of everything but not always what you need .	4463
1	love the canadian tire . i enjoy purchasing their products when i have an opportunity to visit . better than walmart , i think .	4463
1	i usually have bad experiences with canadian tire because their customer service is so bad , nobody knows where anything is . only went here once , but not only did they know where to find the item i was looking for , but they were able to recommend different options to me based on the household problem i described to them . maybe i was just lucky and got the best employee in the store , but i was really impressed with him , super helpful .	4463
1	wowza , there was a staff member every few aisles ready to help , direct , and answer any questions ! i think this is the most staffed canadian tire that i have ever seen . not sure if this is a regular thing or if there 's something special going on today . ..	4463
1	great customer service . was just helped out by the most wonderful employee ever in purchasing my heater . super sweet lady . i will be back !	4463
1	i like that there is a downtown store but this location is hit or miss with having stuff in stock . my client bought a little boom box and luckily he decided not to take the box and as he was taking the item out of the box we discovered it was missing the power plug and the lid on the cd would n't close . luckily they were able to find another one with everything intact . i bought a sound system for my iphone . so far so good with my purchase . the staff were okay , not very personable .	4463
1	canadian tire is your one-stop go-to place for almost everything . the one at dundas is very clean and organized , and they have staff around every aisle ( not sure if they 're assigned to an aisle , or if they 're just hanging around there ) , which is super convenient . unless other companies can beat canadian tire 's prices , i 'm never buying home related items / equipment anywhere else again !	4463
1	amazing customer service by nathan the sale trainee in the bicycle department ... also thanks to ryan the manager	4463
0	the staff are nice but management needs to get its act together . lower level big neon sign pointing to cash checkouts that are all closed ! upstairs only 1 lane open except for self serve and we have hardly moved in 10 mins . terrible and frustrating setup . and good luck finding an associate to help .	4463
0	went to this location today and wanted to pay for all the stuff i have spent an hour collecting and find out that they had no one at cash . i asked the security guard for a cashier and he told me to use the self check out which i refuse to use as why should i ring threw my myself . i am not being paid to do this . i look over and two cashiers are just standing and chatting not far from the cash desk . i just dropped all the items and left . will give my business to a company that offer customer service ! i will never shop at ct ever again .	4463
0	so stupid me decides to go back to canadian tire on dundas to get some 3m picture hangers and got the same rotten service as last time . 4 staff members standing at the self check out and not one on cash . why do they have 4 people standing their having fun chatting while i am doing their work ? ? ? i just placed the items on the self check out counter and walked out . that is my last time ! i thought i would give it another try , but now i will never shop at that zero customer service store ! the manger of this location should be fired .	4463
0	smelly bathroom grossed me out really badly cleaned . i 'm very disappointed because hygiene is everything .	4463
0	i bought some plastic outdoor furniture at the suggestion of their `` seasonal '' department expert . the furniture cracked into pieces within the first month . there is often nobody on cash . instead , there is one person to supervise people doing the self check out . when you do get a checkout , note that they will often not tell you that they only give canadian tire money if you use debit or cash , but not credit card . and its rare if they ever even ask if i have canadian tire money before presenting the total for me to pay .	4463
0	this is the worst fucken store i have ever been in period , all the employes are useless , the last 3 times i have been in there i walked out empty handed because what i wanted was locked in a cabinet i get some assholes attention and wait and wait and wait and after 45 mins to an hour i say fuck it and leave , what kind of service is that , i live at young and dundas so you would think this location would be convenient but i have to travel half way across the city to get decent service and be able to walk out of the store with what i wanted , this store is pathetic and so i the staff	4463
0	it 's nice having a canadian tire downtown , but this location is n't the greatest . the space seems much too small -- everything is super cramped and it 's really difficult trying to locate what you 're looking for . tracking down an employee for help is n't an easy task either . there 's been many times i 've come in to grab something and there 's no one around to help . i 'll still drop by for the odd thing here and there , but there 's definitely much better canadian tire locations around the downtown core .	4463
0	terrible customer service . many times i come here after work ( late hours ) and it 's been nothing but a constant struggle to get help . i 'm not sure who is in charge of hiring the staff but he/she needs to be fired ! when i finally get a chance to find an employee ( usually a young kid standing in an isle talking to another co- worker ) they do n't know much about the products in store ! this place sucks ! !	4463
0	the customer service desk is generally poor . the lady manager there gives customer a tremendous hard time when returning products .	4463
0	this location should get -10 stars . there is this irish girl who works in customer service who should be fired immediately . i 've had her twice and she is always so rude and always yells at the customers . she 's so useless . the other employees are not as bad , however , it just takes one bad apple to make everyone else look bad . she can lick my a $ $ crack	4463
1	i do n't think me and my fiancé have been to this location , but we went to the tempe market place and walked through all the stores , and i wound up buying quite a bit for my family for christmas from here ! there is a ton of cool stuff to go through . you really need to take your time in order to cover everything . we still have two small jam jars that we have yet to eat from when we discovered this place . i 'm really hoping i 'll be able to get back in this year !	4464
1	always love this place ...	4464
0	i have to provide an update on the quality of the products we purchased . we paid about $ 1000 for our dining table and chairs . the table wood has started to lift and warp . you put a hot dinner plate on the table and it turns the wood white . the 2 end chairs that are cushioned are now very springy . you feel the springs in the chairs . we 've only had the set since march ( about 5 months ) . i 'd highly advise to stay away from their products . terrible quality .	4464
0	i dated a woman who loved world market so i have been dragged to quite a few in my day and they are all the same . tacky , gaudy , and brassy home goods is primarily what they sell and that is not my thing . however , they do have some good/funny greeting cards , and on occasion you can score some really good artisan chocolate . other than that i think they are overpriced for the junk they sell .	4464
1	az landscaping co came out to my house again for a 2nd job . dave emailed me back right away and scheduled the service . they showed up on time as expected , did everything promised and even went above and beyond by taking out a pile of palm leaves that i had on the side of my house ( waiting until garbage day ) .	4465
1	these guys did 2 paver jobs for me , we did most of our own landscape installation at our homes but i would rather hire someone to do the pavers and these guys did a fantastic job for a great price . i was able to get ahold of dave right away and his bid came a few days after he met with me . he mostly works out of the east valley and completes his jobs in a timely manner .	4465
0	i found this company on yelp and because of the high scores contacted them to get a bid on landscaping my back yard . we had a meeting scheduled for 8 monday morning and the owner , dave never showed or called . he finally called me back after i had left him several messages . he met me the next day and said he 'd send me a quote by the end of the week . i called and left him a message , but have never heard back from him . it 's been almost 3 weeks . horrible customer service . be forwarned ! ! !	4465
0	they auto debited my card for the month on the same day my hoa sent a letter about the weeds in my front yard , and when i called and left a message asking if they were coming to finish my yard they sent me an email stating their business is now closed due to medical issues . all i want is a company that provides the services i 've paid them to perform .	4465
1	love this place for alterations ! ! kim is adorable and she does excellent work . i was able to get it done in a reasonable time frame and very happy with the work that she has done ! ! thank you kim ! ! i will definitely be back to this business again and i highly recommend everyone coming here too ! !	4466
1	kim 's is beyond fantastic , the service , the price , and the meticulous concentration to detail is a all i have been looking for in a tailor in the south chandler area . i have used kim 's service multiple times now , and each experience is better than the last , she actually listens to my wants , and provides inside knowledge of what works best for my body type .	4466
0	i went there with my own fabric , asking her to make some curtains for my girls ' room . the dimensions were small 2 windows at 20 in x 20 in , and 3 at 16 in x 16 in . she quoted me at $ 500 . ha ha ha good one ! that 's crazy ! i do n't care how good she is , that 's ludicrous ! i found someone on craigslist who did same work for $ 60 .	4466
0	over the past few years i 've put up with their terrible service . they are rude , do n't finish on time and charge way to much . it 's convenient and they did a good job . i just picked up a jacket where they were suppose to put in a couple hooks and tighten up the buttons . i paid a lot of more and the buttons were not done and she wanted $ 2 . more per button ! ! ! i will not come here or recommend them again .	4466
1	the woman who owns this shop is so friendly and helpful . she 's great to work with and was able to create an amazing arrangement for me . i wanted something fun for a halloween party i was having and she came through big time ! i will definitely be using her services again , the next chance i get ! ! !	4467
1	on a recent trip to visit family in youngtown , i decided to purchase a little `` thank-you '' gift for them since i stayed in their home during my trip . i came across the happy tortoise flower shop and am so glad i did ! the owner was absolutely marvelous and set up a gorgeous floral arrangement for me . the store itself was very welcoming and beautifully decorated . i ca n't say enough positive things about the woman who helped me ; she was a delight and wanted nothing more than to create the perfect arrangement for me . i wish we had florist shops like this in alexandria ; it would make holidays so much easier .	4467
0	my husband ordered flowers for my mother in laws wake . they hand wrote mom with a marker on the ribbon . looked like a child wrote it . how awful and tacky for such a solemn occasion . see review from wgh regarding delivery issues with this place . would not recommend at all .	4467
0	what kind of florist does not deliver 1/2 hr . away for my mother 's wake ? they called 1 hour before . i had them deliver the flowers to my father 's house so i can take the flowers and my grieving father to the wake . . very bad , i would not recommend them .	4467
1	no complaints here . updated appartment and nice staff . a few months ago my front door handle was badly busted as if someone tried to break in- we contacted the office and they were there in minutes to replace the locks .	4468
1	i have lived at montego bag for about a month now and i can say that i love it so far here . the neighborhood is nice and its quiet . i just dislike the fact that the apartments do n't have assigned parking , girls do n't want to park ways down from their apartment in the middle of the night and walk , especially since i have noticed a few cars have gotten damaged ( some cars got keyed , or tires were punctured ) . moving in was easy and the front office employee 's are really great and have all been very helpful . ( : i would recommend this complex to any of my friends and family !	4468
0	area was decent but the apartments are outdated . thin walls , cheap wooden doors have about an inch and half open area from the bottom when they are closed . do n't get an upstairs apt that has vaulted ceilings with glass windows because it gets so hot in the summer time that your ac will never shut off and your apt will never cool off . the sun is literally blazing in your eyes . be prepared to get charged an arm and a leg when you leave . do n't nail anything into the wall unless you want a huge bill mailed to you when you 're long gone .	4468
0	if i could give this place 0 stars i would . when we moved in there were so many things not working , work orders take weeks . carla in the front office is rude and not professional at all . when we moved out they charged us a fortune that was total crap , do not live here , it 's honestly a hell hole of crap !	4468
1	company sells decent product as auction from jewelry to toys to furniture good stuff .	4469
1	great place to bid and get the best stuff . all day long i 'd spend my money with these guys . everything from couches to gold rings . ca n't go wrong . i have made quadruple my money and that 's putting it lightly . do n't miss the action and auctions !	4469
1	i purchase from here all of the time ... service is great and the products work well for my families needs . i purchase everything from art to furniture . to date , i have n't been disappointed . i will continue to buy form them online ... its easy , convenient and cheap ! the shipping from their other locations has worked well too ... recently i had several purchases shipped from tucson and abq . keep up the good work , i will continue to spread the word about you !	4469
1	auction nation is my favorite auction house ... so many different types of things and sometimes super awesome deals . the staff here has always been excellent to deal with for me and i use them a lot ! check them out !	4469
1	they called me at my photography studio to let me know that there was another studio closing down and they invited me to check out their inventory . it was easy to bid , pay online and also finding my way around . after the sales were finalized i drove down and picked up my item easily . i did n't really have to call their customer service or anything because the process is pretty self-explanatory . i still go online to check out what they have going on . the price i got was reasonable and i keep an eye for their auctions every here and then .	4469
1	great people to work with , i have found some great items , a vehicle at auction nation and even a snow blower . i will continue to bid with them	4469
1	auction nation is great very nice staff and great products , if you have a problem they will help you i have dealt with quite a few auction like cunningham 's never go to them worst ever and they sell junk ! and they wo n't help if you have a trouble . now auction nation i have spent 1000 's and have been very pleased thanks guys ! ! ! ! ! ! and gals ; )	4469
1	this is my new favorite place ... . the staff is extremely helpful , super friendly and easy to deal with . i just love this concept and the products are good quality . this is a great idea , i just wish i thought of it ! ; )	4469
0	horrible horrible experience ! ! most of the merchandise they sell are returns they buy in lot quarantines from retailers and the vehicles , well let 's just say if you buy a car and the engine falls out on the way out of the parking lot ohh well you bought it . so remember when you bid on a car that you ca n't test drive ! ! it might start and maybe even sound good but you never know . also check the positive reviews and the people who post them funny .	4469
0	this place will take your money gladly , not have what you bought , sell what you bought to others , and keep your money because they do not listen to messages or answer the phone , or read email . i have been cheated out of alot of money here , at no fault of my own , with zero help from auction nation , if you have money to give away , then by all means use them .	4469
0	way over priced , might as well go to outlets and buying a vehicle forget about it they take months to get you the title ! go elsewhere	4469
0	i started out really liking this auction site but after changes in the logistics and awful customer service particularly with this location i am no longer a customer .	4469
0	this bidding process is extremely poor when compared to companies like ebay . their countdown to an auction ending is not correct . i bid in the last 10-20 seconds on items and my bid went in before the item ended . as soon as i clicked submit , the refreshed page said the bidding ended and did n't take my bid . highly unprofessional practice in my book and will not be using this company ever again .	4469
0	i 've bought a few things at auction nation . the last was a `` set '' of drums a couple of months ago . the kid was closing so he unlocked the door and we got them in my car . when i got home to put them together nothing fit . the hardware was n't there , nothing fit together . i emailed a couple of times with no response.the listings have gotten less and less detailed ( for clothing , no sizes . for jewelry , very little detail , etc . ) i still watch their auctions but probably wo n't buy there again .	4469
0	customer service is very up and down . just drove 90 mins to have an employee go out of their way to close the door in my face at 401pm . there were even customers still inside . i bought a lot there this year . all done , thanks vera !	4469
0	at first i got great deals , but lately everything i have been purchasing has failed within a week . this includes a kitchen faucet that started leaking after a week and destroyed my cabinet , and shower facet that completely snapped and a sump pump that stopped after 10 minutes . with their great 24 hour warranty it does n't help much .	4469
1	stopped in first time today for an ear infection - in and out in under 20 minutes with no wait . will highly recommend and use again	4470
1	they are generally a walk-in clinic , but i am seeing dr yang as a primary care physician . i have never had an issue getting an appointment . dr yang and the other staff are super nice . easy going clinic .	4470
1	i recently changed my primary care physician to dr. yang and am very impressed . i do n't have to wait long and the staff is very professional and friendly . the ease of getting blood drawn at the same time of an office visit is so helpful when you have a busy schedule . kudos to dr yang and her team !	4470
1	i have always experienced great service here . the staff is polite and efficient . the doctors are awesome ! they give very personalized attention and have never rushed through an appointment with me . i would definitely recommend this clinic .	4470
0	so , if i had written this review yesterday , i would have given the place 5 stars . i was treated for a leg wound by a wonderful pa , misty . however , today i had some questions about the wound dressing . i called and was told that misty was n't on call today but that the on-call doc or pa would call me back . that was over 5 hours ago . they close at 6 . so i called back . and was told that he was `` too busy '' to talk to me . really ? i will call back and talk to misty tomorrow . i know she will call me back .	4470
0	i came here because i have been having severe leg cramps for several days . i did some research online about that and the advice is to stretch , drink lots of water , etc . if all else fails try a muscle relaxer . so still with leg cramps.. severe.. i came in and saw the dr.. which isnt free ... and she says drink water im not giving you muscle relaxers . no kidding dr.. i got that from google search too . what a rip off . if you want urgent relief do not go here !	4470
0	for a routine annual physical , we had to wait an hour after the initial paperwork was done . that when we had already booked our appointment ( though zocdoc.com ) & showed up right on time . very irritating experience . also , the front desk person asked us to fill up the form , even though we had already submitted all our information in zocdoc registration . we had to tell her this & avoid re-filling patient information .	4470
0	they charged me $ 212 for a follow-up on my physical ( claimed they needed to talk to me about my test results ) . what was i charged for ? 5 minutes with dr. yang where she told me my results were completely normal . scammers .	4470
1	i have been to this branch a few times . it 's nice enough for what it is . not too large and not too small . staff is friendly enough and always serve with a smile . the parking lot asphalt is not in the greatest condition . i try to avoid here because it 's right next door to rainbow doughnuts .	4471
1	rayni helped me at this location and it 's the best customer service i have received on this side of town ever thank you ! !	4471
1	this banker kenneth is gold ! thank you for making my name change so smooth and an enjoyable process ! you 're a gem !	4471
0	staff here are slow . if you bank here on a daily bases , they 'll recognize you . you have yo repeat yourself several times before they get what you are trying to do . no more business teller , makes it difficult for business owners to do banking . bankers are rude & never follow up on any disputes .	4471

0	so i went to this bank to withdraw money and this seating window branch manager helped me out . i asked for large denominations and she said they do n't have enough and need to be ordered in advance . i asked if she can use machine to double count the bills due to previous bad experience of short changing and she said she counts better than the machine since she has 20 years of bank experience . lazy customer service ! ! ! !	4471
1	the two men who came to my 3rd story apartment were courteous and polite , always using yes ma'am . they showed up perfectly on time and began the process immediately . they wrapped my furniture securely , protected my hardwood floors and placed my furniture exactly where i needed it in each room . since the move was in may the company brought mattress covers for free , huge help ! this is the third move i 've chosen two men & a truck for and i would recommend them to anyone looking for an easy going , smooth move !	4472
1	we could not have asked better movers ! this was our second time using two men and a truck and we were very impressed with how efficient , courteous , and professional our crew was each time . if we ever move again , choosing a movers will be and easy decision .	4472
1	i hired these guys a couple times and even referred them to some friends who had to make a move . the three times we used them the service was what i would call acceptable . they showed up on time and if we had any quirky requests about what could be moved and where the drivers were happy to help accommodate . the price was reasonable as well and i would recommend them to anyone having to make a local move in charlotte .	4472
1	i had a great experience with two men & a truck for me recent move . the office staff was nice , the estimate was on target and they worked with us on the times we needed . the three guys did a great job packing and moving our home . they were friendly and happy to do all we asked . i would recommend this company to anybody in the charlotte area .	4472
0	awful ! slowest non caring movers ever . i my new home was less than 1/2 mile from my old home , but it took them 45 minutes to get there . it took them 5 hours to move a studio apartment to a second floor one bedroom . when i called to complain , they never followed up . i will never use them again . they also broke my favorite plant . : (	4472
0	hi monika , as of today , tim haines ( hanes ? ) has still not processed the claim for the damaged oil painting . is there someone else at two men and a truck in charlotte that we can reach out to ? how about the owner ... .. ? can you please have someone besides tim contact my sister or me to resolve these issues ? thank you kindly .	4472
0	updated , 7/31 : i was contacted by two men and a truck recently , and a reimbursement of my washer repair bill was proposed . i accepted , and received a check of $ 150 from the company a few days ago . i take this as an acceptance of accountability , though protracted , and have moved on .	4472
0	i am not sure who your management is working with but it is not me . an insurance adjuster reached out once but that ws the only contact we have had and as far as i can tell the claim has not been addressed .	4472
1	i 've been checking out some local gyms and walked into this one for a tour . it was around noon and the place was pretty empty . matt was the sales associate who helped me and i thought he was really honest and helpful . did n't lay on any purchase pressure , just answered all my questions : ) i have my first day tomorrow and will return to update my rating once i spend some time there . i have to say , i was hesitant to visit this gym bc of the poor yelp reviews . i even told matt this . but i was presently surprised once i was there .	4473
1	this location holds the most well deserved 5 star review . as someone who travels across the us and goes to many gyms . this one has the greatest , most fit members i 've seen . the locker room and sauna area could use some improvement , mainly the miniature sauna . during the busy hours , you will almost find people sitting on each others laps , in both the women 's and the men 's . equipment wise , this facility covers everything . multiple squat racks , benches , machines , cables , and cardio equipment . if you cant find a machine to fulfill your workout in this gym , you do n't belong in there .	4473
1	my daughter belongs to this gym and i came into town and we wanted to work out together . she got me a guest pass . then at check in the girl at the desk was not very helpful she was actually coming up with all the reasons why we would have to pay . then derek rochna an employee sitting at his desk over heard the conversation . he called us over and was super helpful . on our way out i asked him for his card so i could post a review and add his name . turns out he is the assistant manager : ) i give hm 5 stars ! thank you speed of the leader speed of the team !	4473
1	wow what a great experience ! i was looking for a local gym and when i walked in the sales staff was personable and accommodating . they set me up with a membership person and he showed me around -gave me a tour . very nice . he answered all of my questions . i also got a good deal when signing up . he sauna is nice as well and i like that it is n't overly busy on the weekends ! definitely recommend . also nice that they offer a free personal training session when you sign up .	4473
1	my favorite gym to go to when visiting family from pittsburgh ! the staff is friendly and helpful , facility is clean . best gym hands down that i 've been to.. thank you mia and trevor for your patience and help with me . highly recommend this la fitness to anyone in the area .	4473
1	first came in and was greeted by staff then escorted to joey who was most helpful . joey help my sister and i find the right plan that saved us money ! ! ! be sure to ask for him if you consider joining .	4473
1	my home gym is in rochester , ny . when i visit pitt i always go to this location and love it here ! very clean and friendly service . i love the layout of the gym the best .	4473
1	one of the best gyms i 've been to . always clean and has a great assortment of equipment ! the staff is very friendly and helpful .	4473
1	do n't know what the problem is , staff was great , gym was clean , i get a great workout in , no problems . what more do you need ? i guess some folks want the staff to lift the weights too .	4473
1	if you 're someone who goes to the gym to actually workout then there is nothing wrong with this well i do agree the locker rooms are not the cleanest they could be , i know that can be pretty unappealing to some people . plus most of the trainers walk around with some sort of chip on their shoulder , for what reason i do n't know . but regardless if you 're someone who goes to the gym to train then suck it up , put in your headphones , and go train and not worry about dirty bathrooms	4473
0	the gym is nice and the people are friendly but the women 's bathroom is disgusting . i have been in cleaner rest stop bathrooms . there is never toilet paper , always feces on the toilet seats , garbage can is always over flowing with dirty paper towels . it is just gross . i called and reported it but it has yet to get better .	4473
0	la fitness just stole my money yet again ... they give you a big lie when you start then trick you at the end of your membership and say you never canceled ... they do zero customer service ... la fitness sucks and they are thieves ! ! do n't go to # lafitness southside la fitness is dirty and they are money hungry .	4473
0	do not give your information to this gym ! i signed up for a free trial but ended up being harassed by phone calls from the gym ! i kept complaining and the manager would just say he 's `` passionate '' about helping me get fit . i ended up blocking his number , and then he called from a different number !	4473
0	hours are terrible . if you work 9-5 then this gym probably fits your needs . however i work in retail full time and i attend college full time . considering as i pay $ 32 a month it would be amazing if the gym was open 24/7 . that would make this a 5 star review . overall , there are other gyms in pittsburgh and some of which are in fact open 24/7 . there are also other gyms in the southside , i would recommend everyone looks at those first to see if you 'll enjoy those .	4473
0	dirty filthy gym that things go down and they dont fix them . people rob your car and i ve seen police there .	4473
0	i would n't sign up at this facility . it 's currently 66 degrees outside and 86 degrees inside this club . i 've been to la fitness facilities in florida in the middle of august , and i 've never been to a gym as poorly ventilated as this franchise . every other la fitness franchise in pittsburgh is run better than this one . bathrooms are always disgusting . whoever the manager is should be fired immediately . or taught where the switch to the ac is . total incompetence .	4473
0	nice place if you like bo and dirty restrooms .	4473
0	the gym itself is really nice . the sales team is a bit to pushy for me . went in to try it out and within 8 hours they were calling asking about membership ... not my cup of tea .	4473
0	i have gone to la fitness on 3 different occasions this month for a cycle class , the room is dark and no instructor . front desk staff is less than helpful , giving no explanation or even being aware that class was cancelled or the instructor did not show . there is no accountability .	4473
0	the gym is very average . the equipment is more updated than some . my biggest complaint is that the ac is not on very high , if at all.. and do n't give them your friends names and phone numbers for `` a free week pass '' .. they will keep calling and leaving voicemails . not cool .	4473
1	colin was very nice and helpful in making my copies fast this morning ! online ordering would have taken a couple of hours , but a quick stop in the store was fast and easy . thanks !	4474
1	not the fastest in the world but always get straight to business and help me get done . never rude and very patient .	4474
1	very nice and helpful staff . had trouble with the computers at the store but the staff helped me print and cut my flyers . i 'll be returning to this location because their service was so good .	4474
1	i went to kinko 's 45 minutes before an interview - i had a jump drive and resume paper in hand and needed to print off copies of my resume . since i do n't have to do this often i went to the customer service desk and gloria was there and ready to help . we quickly found out that the easy way was n't going to work and she took me to a computer figured a way to get my resume printed and i was off - if i tried to do this myself it would have taken me extra time and added stress when i needed to be calm . thank you gloria for taking time to help me !	4474
1	i do n't know what all these reviews with bad customer service came from . i came in to ship a big package and the people there were polite and accommodating . i ca n't speak from the printing side of things , but everyone there was courteous and professional and even offered us alternatives to get my stuff shipped that would be cheaper than what i had originally envisioned .	4474
1	we love this fedex ! my business drops off at least 15 packages a week and they 're always super friendly and incredibly helpful . if the copies we make do n't turn out as well as we 've hoped , they take them behind the counter to improve the quality . a manager helped me ship something overseas last week and it was a breeze ! ! they do get super busy , but everyone we 've worked with has been great !	4474
0	most inept , lazy , carefree employees ever ! 50 perfect of the time they mess up the print job . open file , click print ... how hard can that be . take some pride in your job ! kept trying to give them a chance but way too much a waste of time - time to buy a large format printer . suggest going elsewhere for your printing needs .	4474
0	i thought this place was a rip-off . i spent ten plus dollars on a little over fifteen minutes on a computer . then when i printed my pages it turned out to be like close to fifty cents a page . it is convenient that they are open 24 hours , but they realize that they have trapped you when you come inside . i would only go here for extreme emergencies . visit a library instead .	4474
0	came here to scan a large document for a home loan . they have printers ( the same kind i have at my office ) that should be perfectly capable of quickly scanning a stack of papers easily . instead , that capability is not accessible , and they force you to rent a computer by the minute and scan each page in individually . it 's hard to imagine that a fedex office did n't do this intentionally . the lady was nice enough , she did n't control that . she earned the extra star .	4474
0	i 'd have to agree that it is a little pricey but the location is good and when you are in a pinch and you are close , they have what you need to get the job done . i 'll go back if i need to and i 'm in the area .	4474
0	two bucks to send a fax . and 22 cents per page to print a simple two-sided b/w text manuscript ? ! plus the staff go out of their way not to look at you . next time i 'll take garrett 's advice and only visit in an emergency .	4474
0	awful service . 3 times in two weeks the same person at the pack n ship station failed to work through a line of 4 people in less than 20 minutes . they should call it the wait n ' and eventually ship station . last time i come to this location . it 's faster to drive my package somewhere then mail it here . sorry i mean attempt to mail it .	4474
1	this is my favorite dunkin donuts location . the staff is friendly and the coffee is delicious . my son goes to school nearby , so i am frequent at the drive thru . i appreciate the staff ( especially devin ) and their always friendly smile . keep up the great work .	4475
1	my favorite dd . the one by my house has terrible customer service , but i 'm never disappointed here ! i come consistently before school and it 's nice to start my day off with their employees , they 're always so kind . they 've only ever messed up my order once ( in two years ) and they have no problem fixing it if you call in !	4475
1	great friendly staff..food and drink always delivers ! i like their iced and hot coffees and wake up wraps ! !	4475
1	iced caramel mocha coffee was good and the new oreo iced coffee was okay could of been more coffee than whip cream/ice . but was still good the staff was good and even making conversation with us till our order was up .	4475
1	friendly staff , and convenient location with drive through . i usually go for coffee , but the bagels are very good . feels like a real home town dunkin '	4475
1	we come here regularly . coffee is good and orders are correct . staff is very friendly and polite . the only thing keeping it from being a 5 star is we regularly order hash browns and they are very inconsistent ; sometimes they are super hot , sometimes cold and sometimes over done/ burnt . but other than that we like this location and come here regularly .	4475
1	we stop into this location about twice a week for their iced coffee . i like the heath flavor , in particular . service has always been very good , and this location is very clean . i do n't buy the doughnuts much anymore , as i found out they are sent to the stores pre-made and frozen . but the iced coffee is excellent , and the price is right .	4475
1	great friendly staff..food and drink always delivers ! i like their iced and hot coffees and wake up wraps ! ! convenient location	4475
1	fast and friendly service i pass by for my coffee every morning ! they 're just quick ! and anything you ask they do it !	4475
1	we love this dunkin ' donuts ! we come weekly for morning coffee and saturday breakfast with the family . they have never messed up an order and are always as quick as possible . we 're very impressed . today we ate inside so my three year old could pick out his donut . he order all by himself and the young man at the register was kind and patient . we will continue to come to this location regularly .	4475
1	love going to this location ... everyone is friendly & makes the best drinks , so much that i do n't trust any other location to make my drinks the same . even gave my pit bull a pup cup ( 2 munchkins ) . definitely my go to coffee stop !	4475
1	best dunkin ' donuts i 've ever been to ! ! ! the staff is by far the best staff out of any place i have ever been before : ) they are all so sweet , and always get my order right ! not to mention , the food/coffee/ donuts are always amazing ! ! !	4475
1	my coffee today was excellent and just the way i asked for it . chocolate filled donut is always delicious , as are most of the regular donuts , it 's when you get into specialty ones ( fritters , sour cream , et al ) that quality is n't as great . service was excellent and prompt .	4475
1	i love this dunkin donuts . i 've been coming here for 3+ years and the employees are so nice and always remember my order . i 'd like to say that devon , who is an employee there , always makes sure that my order is always right and 100 % goes out of his way to make sure our experience is the best . definitely recommend going to this location .	4475
1	we love dunkin . having breakfast with my youngest before school . the sandwiches are very good	4475
0	not impressed . i am disappointed in the fact that this place is filthy . not just surface dirt but total grunge . the bathroom was really disgusting . donut was good , coffee was obviously from the bottom on the pot and was full of grounds . i am certainly open to giving this place another try . the owner should give this place a good scrubbing .	4475
0	i rarely complain about an establishment or give one star . but this is the worst dd i have ever gone to . staff had no clue how to take an order . i asked for an iced half caf coffee with french vanilla . it was so sweet i could n't even drink it ! more like all french vanilla and no coffee . never again will i come here ! ! ! !	4475
0	the service is horrible . i waited 25 minutes for 2 drinks and when i asked them it looked like she did n't care . never again and i do n't recommend coming here . go across the street to starbucks in the frys . i also cme up here to get a gift card and the system was down . the guy said it was down all week and they could n't get anyone to fix it . they were told to apologize and i ca n't do this . this is not how to run a company . i think the manager of this place should be fired .	4475

0	i have been going to this location every day for the past 3 years and i am not surprised by the turnover in employees ! this location is a hot mess and i normally do not call to report bad quality of product or service , but getting moldy food and a coffee that i could not drink was the last straw . convenient as it is on my route to work , but not convenient throwing away my money more often than not . and do n't expect a call back from store owner , he/she probably already knows ( and is tired ) of hearing about it ! maybe that 's why i never got a call back ? ? ?	4475
0	firstly , they 're always out of donuts . tried getting a dozen chocolate frosted and they only had 6 . what a joke . on top of that , the chocolate donuts were sprinkled with sugar from another donut and they were messed up looking . i 've seen better donuts at the qt station	4475
0	love dd , but this morning 's experience at this location was awful . we ordered on the app and still after waiting in the store for 20 minutes we still do n't have our complete order . apparently it takes 45 minutes to make a bagel with cream cheese . also , napkins are like unicorns at this location- you want one but ca n't find one . horrible .	4475
0	the girl in the window every time i go is terrible ! ! tried to charge me twice while i was waiting then finally asked what i ordered again ( iced coffee ) then i watch her make my drink and it was literally all cream and no coffee . and she 's made it this way every time despite me saying light on the cream from the beginning . absolutely no customer service here . not like you 'd get at starbucks , i might just pay the extra for my coffee	4475
0	not sure what it is about this location besides the obvious- no one knows what they are doing , coffee is cold , donuts are disappointing . this location needs a new manager and trained employees .	4475
0	today was my last day at this location . not only did they forget part of my order for the second time in a row , but the food i wanted to give my son was totally burnt . ( i usually do n't feed him from a drive through , but we flew in late last night and did n't have any groceries yet ! ) also when i was pregnant and went through the drive through a handful of times for a decaf iced coffee it was always caffeinated and i 'd have to go back or just throw it away .	4475
0	horrible customer service . the lines are always extremely long and the employees do n't greet guests when they walk up to the register . i stood there for 5 minutes without being acknowledged because the drive through line was super long . i understand being busy but at least try to make up for it with good customer service .	4475
0	this location is the worst dunkin donuts i 've ever been to . they competed missed items , were out of stock , and sounded miserable in the drive through , i would recommend going to another location .	4475
0	was not clean at all . was a kitten in the store and staff was taking turns holding cat and then going to wait on customers . i like cats , but not in a food environment . wo n't be going back .	4475
0	sigh . yesterday at another dunkin we were told you get a doughnut on your birthday . came in today with my 11 year old as this was first on his list to do today . even after buying 10 bucks worth of stuff he was shut down kind of hard . you 'd think it would have killed them to give him a munchkin or something !	4475
0	i 'm only giving this place one star , because they have a roof over the building . however this dunkin ' donuts is a complete joke . the employees are rude do n't know how to take an order and when confronted give major attitude . if you 're driving by dunkin ' donuts and have a desire to get something do not stop here do not ! ! worse experience ever ! !	4475
1	found this place after the gym about 2 weeks ago . i just relocated to the area and needed a good supplement place . extremely friendly service here . the lady behind the counter is extremely down to earth and friendly and remembers the customers . i come in several times a week for after workout protein shakes . they have a bunch of good supplements . even better , i love how they have a selection of pre and post workout powdered supplements that you can come in to get a single serving made up before or after the gym .	4476
1	i work super close to one stop and i basically go there everyday . staff is super friendly and very quick !	4476
0	horrible customer service , came in at 7:40pm for a smoothie and the worker said he shuts down blenders 20 minutes before because he does n't get paid to be there after 8pm . huge one stop fan but unfortunate for this kid to being ruining the brand .	4476
0	came into store on sunday at 5:53 . i was told inside the store they are closed . i said i do n't need a shake how about a supplement ? reply was ca n't take a sale we are closed . i could n't even if i wanted too ! i guess my drive over and the sign that glowed open along with the hours on the door is n't really what they mean ? ? ? a lady was also turned down . i 've never heard of a small business turning down a sale ? they must be a small target	4476
1	i 've been in las vegas all my life . aida at hye tailor is the only person i trust with my alterations . she has a great work ethic and she is really good at what she does . she has even restyled a couple of mink coats for me ! awesome work ! highly recommend .	4478
1	the best tailor i have been to . aida works magic and knows exactly what she 's talking about . i listened to her suggestions from experience over my own doubts and definitely was not disappointed . i had 2 shirts and 1 suit altered here and they came out perfect and in a very timely manner . she was super nice and cheerful even with all the work she had . i will definitely be a repeat customer here . you can find her shop in the back corner of the plaza it is not the dry cleaners shop facing flamingo !	4478
0	just horrible place . aida is a nice lady but probably too old or stressed out to do a good job anymore . after $ 75.00 ( cash ) , that is what she asked me and after 3 weeks , alteration was pretty bad . she ruined all over again a nice chanel coat . if you have something little or simple , yes , probably ok , but x fine clothing or more complicated work stay out . total disaster.. find another place . i can not even comprehend other people giving a 5 stars.. beyond words .	4478
0	amazed ... .. tried asking for the owner 5 times . kept getting the run around ( he 's not in much , wo n't be in till august , ect. ) . planned on having them alter quite a few things and i said i had received lower quotes . it did n't seem to matter and they said the price is the price final ... .. you can take your jacket and do n't come back .	4478
1	i 've been going to vip for years ! ask for lan for a pedicure ... she does an amazing job and gives the best foot rubs !	4479
1	i really like going to this place after trying several others when we moved . my daughter loves the little girls chairs and the kids pedicure and manicure package ! ! best leg massage of any around and plenty of chairs to accommodate parties !	4479
1	great nail salon -- clean , well lit , and efficient . they do a great job , and i think it 's one of the best pedicures in town . i drive to cranberry from the city just to get my nails down there .	4479
0	got my nails done here saturday horrible service ! and today being monday my ring finger nail just falls off like i did n't pay 45 $ for it to last 2 days are you kidding me ? ! horrible place it 's just a waste of your money !	4479
0	had terrible experience here . i should have waited for one of the two people i always go to but they were busy . the older male never did my nails before and i would never go back to him , in fact , i 'm not going here anymore . he was lazy , just doing the minimum . could n't even paint the polish on the nail . when i went to leave , one of the ladies was even trying to clean the polish off my skin . gosh , what was i thinking . total waste of money . good bye .	4479
0	got nail fungus here on my toe . they do not clean tubs out with any kind of cleaner , they just rinse out . they are a little cheaper than most so i think that 's why people keep going back but fungus takes a long time to get rid of !	4479
1	great pharmacy and the reward points program is very nice , i have already received four $ 5 discounts and i have n't been using it too long .	4480
1	i am not a walgreens fan much anymore as most of the time their pharmacy staff are rude and simply just not helpful . however , this location is open 24 hours and that is why i am fan .	4480
0	well i am trying to think of a nice way to phrase just how terrible this pharmacy is . i am a walgreens customer , but my normal walgreens is not 24 hours and so therefore sometimes i am forced to use this place . i hate it . the area is not the best , the staff are jerks , and the service is possibly top 10 worst . i have never not had to wait in a 10+ minute wait line . i guess a positive is that they forwarded the prescription to another 24 hour pharmacy correctly ? do n't go . drive further and go elsewhere .	4480
0	do n't bother with this location , they do not have it together there at all . i called to get a prescription filled , and when you call , it goes to a call center instead of to the store itself . i stopped into the store to see if the prescription was ready , and they did n't even receive the request . so i called back to the call center , and they had no idea of me calling earlier in the day . horrible communication , and because of it , i am without my prescription now . terrible place .	4480
1	overall a great experience . i scheduled a eye test and finally had to break down and get glasses . i interacted with about 4 different people during my time there and everyone was helpful . from the actual md to the sales representative , they were very attentive . lenscrafters is out of network for most insurances , but they still worked with me and offered me a discount . they have a great selection of quality frames which i liked . most places just have the same old bland frames . i was very happy with my experience .	4481
1	love lenscrafters ! i was quickly checked in and well taken care of . had a great experience with diane today ! she was a great help and fun to work with ! we had many laughs ! she gave me honest opinions and suggestions on the frames i was debating on . ca n't wait for my new frames to come in ! this lensecrafters is awesome , go there . there 's other shops , restaurants and the harkins to enjoy before or after your appointment as i did ! lucky for us the farmers market was happening so we checked that out !	4481
1	great service , always professional helpful staff . much nicer than the one in arrowhead mall .	4481
1	i havent seen this good in forever . the staff is friendly and knowledgeable , and the store is amazing . i was told by my last optometrist that my vision was blurry because of cataracts and that they could n't make my vision better . the good folks at lenscrafters proved them wrong . when i put on my new glasses , omg i couldnt believe how clear and sharp everything looked . i am taking my wife to see them as soon as possible .	4481
0	i have n't been to lenscrafters since 2011 so i did n't know that there were changes made through my insurance so i was bummed out when i found out that my insurance does n't cover eyeglasses anymore . the lady who helped me was nice , but at first i feel like she was in a hurry to look at my prescription while i was still looking around and trying on some eyeglasses , she was talking really fast and asked me twice for my prescription . i 've had better experience in the other locations .	4481
0	my wife and i had our eye exams today and apparently the doctor was in a big rush to get out of there . not a real friendly guy . i guess he was in hurry to see the football game . we had our eyes dilated and they did n't even offer us those goofy sun shields . i guess i 'll stay with nationwide vision .	4481
0	we called in on a friday to ask about an appointment for saturday . the lady told us to come in between 1 & 2 because they accept walk-ins . we went in on saturday at 1:15 and they turned us away ! i was upset that i left work early only to have wasted my time and will not recommend this location to anyone . ironically this location was recommended by a peer however it was a very bad one .	4481
0	worst customer services called set my appointment gave all my insurance information , than when i arrived unfortunately am not on schedule than they say they do n't take my insurance i guess they just wanted me to get in building i do n't trust them from now on . only excuse we were busy am only the one in the building frustrated with there service	4481
1	i inquired about a price on an american standard stratocaster at their store , and they got back to me right away . the matched a price i was given elsewhere and even dug deeper to save me some coin . they were really helpful on the phone and by email , and shipped my guitar to montreal within the week ( after doing a full setup ) . very satisfied , and would buy another guitar from them in a flash .	4482
1	i just had great experience with tundra music . matt and rene are very helpful . they did n't have the guitar i wanted in stock so they had one shipped to the store . it arrived the very next day for me to pick up . amazing . it 's a small store but they will bend over backwards to help you .	4482
0	we ordered and paid for an accessory that they said would be there in 2 weeks . 2 months later i have called a several times and they promise to get back to me but never do . they seemed nice enough when we had purchased a guitar earlier . however this behaviour is a deal breaker for me .	4482
0	no no no ed and co. are a bunch of scammer - constantly get messages from them on craigslist offering to buy my guitar . took it all the way to whitby where they offered me a complete lowball .	4482
1	i brought my dog in after getting attacked by a pitbull . the visit was great - was seen on time . the vet and staff were very professional and friendly . thank you all for helping poor little panda . now she 's all healed up and happy .	4483
1	enrique our vet here is amazing . he cut us a deal and helped our pet chickens . good care was taken and he even liked our girls !	4483
1	after shopping around for the right vet , we finally came across this office ! dr. cruz truly cares for every pet that walks into his office ! he spent 45 min with me and my pup , examining him from head to tail . he explained and talked with me about what he sees and hears , and gave me his knowledgable input . ( trust me , it was helpful , especially since the last vet practically made feel like an idiot for even bringing my puppy ) so needless to say , i finally found a vet that truly cares and gives his all in treating and caring for all of his `` patients '' = )	4483
1	my pug loves it here . so far she 's been seen for an eye issue and a dental and we 've seen nothing but amazing results . lewis is always wagging her tail when we get into the office . the white board sign welcoming her was so cute . nice touch . we never have to wait long and the prices are so reasonable . my dog is my daughter and it feels nice that i can trust her with dr. cruz and staff ! : ) )	4483
1	so customer service might not be the greatest here ... .. but dr. cruz is an animal whisperer ! i have never seen anyone handle an animal the way he handled my overly anxious chihuahua . my puppy is lovey once he gets to know someone , but he is very mean to strangers . the way dr. cruz held him and talked to him , my dog did n't make a peep ! your `` kids '' will be in good hands with dr. cruz .	4483
1	dr. cruz saved my little dog 's life i would n't go anywhere else , he called me so many times to tell me on the update if it was n't for him my baby would have died , the staff is so nice and always there to help , my little dog is family so price mean 's nothing when it come 's to her life ... .so thank 's to him she is running around the house like a puppy and she 's 15 you would never know it ! thank you so much dr. cruz	4483
1	i went in on january 22 2015 to get shots for mt boy . these folks were super nice and friendly . even gave me the name of a loxal groomer to take my lil dog to . the shots and office visit were reasonably priced . the staff was great and the dr was great . he truly cares .	4483
0	i was looking for a vet closer to my house so i decided to check out camelback animal ( or hospital . if you click on their website it takes you to camelback clinic at 1025 e camelback rd ) . i tried calling 4-5 times at various times & days & every time there was no answer . i would eventually get an answering machine . i left messages & sent them an email ( through their website ) twice with no answer from either . what a joke ! ! ! ! the way i feel about my dogs this would be the last place i 'd take them to ! you might want to check out the reviews on angie lists also .	4483
0	do not take your four legged family member here ! this facility gave my dog kennel cough , tried to sneak extra charges onto my bill , and said they would only see my dog for the kennel cough ( literally the next day after his initial exam ) for an additional charge . this place is a joke . my advise is if you 're looking for a wonderful care provider for your fur baby , make the drive across town to the scottsdale veterinary clinic , it is well worth the the extra time and miles .	4483
0	been waiting 30 minutes for anyone to come into the room . ridiculous , do not believe this place is professional at all , let alone the place just looks dinghy . look elsewhere !	4483
0	this place is a joke . they overcharged 900 than another vet nearby for a simple procedure . they are not there to help animals they are just there to take advantage of good people .	4483
0	enough is enough . we had our third appointment for our pup at 3pm on sat which was originally arranged on fri . they asked us if we can change the date . it was not a big deal until they stood us up . we were at the doorstep for 15 mins . nobody was there . no phone call or a notice to inform us . and we were not the only client waiting outside . it was not cool outside in june . bad business ! !	4483
0	make sure to stay in the room while your pet is being examined . charges me $ 154.00 for heart and health . on top of other outrageous charges.not the vet as before . cruz is out to charge as much as possible showing empathy to your pet . he is seeing dollar signs rather than treating your pet in my situation . then wanted more testing with inflated costs . charges much more for visits much more than more qualified vet 's . had cruz treated my dog properly i would not have wasted my time and money . i ended up putting him down . i still miss him to this day .	4483
0	it 's is all money and never about the wellness of ur pet . they stated my pet insurance gives only a 10 % discount now . they failed to tell me they did n't take my pet insurance anymore and it was them discounting my bill , not the insurance . i could have taken my dog to a vet that expected my insurance . they made me get unnecessary testing done in order to receive eye drops . this office is dirty and the customer services was lacking .	4483
1	i just received one of the best massages i 've ever had at the tempe massage envy on elliot . kristi gave me an excellent deep tissue massage - painful and relaxing ; and i felt great afterwards too . i 've had many different massage therapists at this location and most of them are terrific , but i 'd highly recommend kristi as one of the best .	4484
1	amazing ! ! facials and massages ! i look forward to the hour and half getaway each time ! !	4484
1	love this location . people are friend and really enjoy massage therapist sharon . she is very in-tune with her clients and their needs . she brings a very natural approach and take the time to get to know each client as an individual . wonderful experience everytime .	4484
1	scott is my massage therapist . and every time i leave there feeling sore , but amazing . he has magical hands that can get down deep and release the muscle knots/tension . i recommend scott for your next 90 minute session . absolutely fantastic	4484
1	i just had an amazing hour and a half massage ! ! my therapist aaron was absolutely superb ! through his pressure point technique all of my tense areas are now relaxed . i feel like a new woman ! their customer service is awesome ! ! trust me if you ever want to really great massage this is the place to go ! !	4484
1	i felt miserable before the massage session . rhonda was wonderful . she was able to make me feel like a different person after the session . because of her skills , i 'm able to function again and i do n't even feel the tension on my shoulders anymore . thank you rhonda . you are the best !	4484
1	i 've been going there for years . i wish it was easier to get an appointment at the last minute , but hey , they 're busy , which is good ! they 're always friendly and i always have a great massage .	4484
0	worst decision i ever made was get a membership to massage envy . i can honestly say i 've come out of every massage saying `` this was the worst massage i 've ever had '' . save your money and do n't waste your time . it seems like everyone they hire has just gotten out of school and is practicing on you . also if you cancel you will lose all your credits.. so use them before you cancel .	4484
0	i was a customer of massage envy for about 8 years . you get a different story every time you talk to someone . i 've had to argue about the number of massages left on my account , lost massages , and my rate . i 'm done with massage envy and you should be too . there are much better massage options out there . the rooms are very bare bones , the massages mediocre , and usually you ca n't even hear the music . spend an extra ten dollars and go somewhere that 's relaxing , minus all the arguing with the front desk .	4484
0	unprofessional therapists and staff .	4484
0	called to make an appointment got one and called back to cancel 20min later , because of a flat tire and trying to charge me 50 % percent of the appointment . i will not be going to this company again . no compassion .	4484
0	i am returning for a massage here but only because it was n't that bad of a massage and i am desperate to have a massage tonight . the good points : the massage was competent . bad points : the atmosphere is very commercial , the front desk was super busy when i came in for my appointment and i had to wait a long time to get back for my appointment , and i hate places that pressure you to get a membership ... especially post-massage when you are weak and woozy . good place if you like membership massage commerical massage places .	4484
0	i am new to `` pro '' massages but i have been here several times now . i have been an athlete nearly all of my life and because of that my body is torn down . my wife goes to this location as well and she loves it . she is actually the one that put my on to massages . she goes for the relaxation . i go for the therapy . she sees scott as a regular . i see ashely regularly . she does really good tissue work . i would recommend this place to anyone .	4484
0	the receptionist are extremely rude and disrespectful , will not be going to this location ever again and the floors are so dirty ...	4484
1	one of my favorite smoothie places with some of the best staff . vegan pineapple spinach smoothie is amazing and delicious ! !	4485
1	i come here almost every week or every 2 weeks . the staff is always super friendly and sweet and remember my name ! loooove how thick the smoothies are , i hate super watery and runny smoothies . i 've tried like 8 drinks from their menu but nothing tops the apple kiwi kale . it 's sooo bomb and nowhere sells anything like it . i told all my friends about it and they order it now too ! love , love , love this place . they always have some sort of deal , $ 5 friday 's are the best because you get the 32oz drink from the whole menu ! you can also ask to split it into two cups .	4485
1	pineapple breeze is like crack . amazing . friday is a good day to visit , 5 buck deal . so rare to find a deal these days ...	4485
1	peanut power plus chocolate - a tasteful protein blend of peanut butter , chocolate , banana , nonfat milk , turbinado , and cocoa . not runny or `` unsuckable '' ( lol ) consistency is just right ! customer service was good !	4485
1	delicious smoothies and nice staff ! i always get the mango kale because it is so good . but i see from a previous review that the apple kiwi kale is great . i may branch out next time . i usually call ahead and my smoothie is ready when i get there . the app is good and it is easy to earn rewards . they also cater once a week to my sons ' school . my boys have their favorite smoothies too !	4485
1	love smoothie king . i lived in louisiana for a few years where it was started , and became obsessed with it ! therefore i was so happy to move back to az and find this location in mesa ! my all time favorite is the green tea tango with blueberries . their slim n trim vanilla with orange instead of banana is also amazing . i came here half an hour before closing and the girls working whipped up 6 smoothies for my friends and i so fast and they were all perfect . ca n't wait to come back !	4485
0	i have never been to smoothie king before in general so was unfamiliar with the menu . in addition i had two kids with me . from the minute i walked through the door , the girl that helped us was annoyed with us for breaking up her gossip session with friends that were at a table . she barely helped me through the menu and was just unpleasant in general . i will find another location to visit based on this experience .	4485
0	i 've been wanting to try this place for a while so when i recieced their coupon for immune builder smoothie they said i would only be able to get their pumpkin smoothie the coupon did not say only pumpkin . i wanted to try their another flavor but they would not honor their coupon . what poor customer service . how much do they spend to get a new customer in the door to try their stuff and then they treat them like crap . pinching penny 's just to loose a good customer . rude and lame	4485
0	the staff was very rude and unprofessional . i have visited this location numerous times and the smoothies are not consistent in their taste .	4485
0	my guest and i ordered the lean mango smoothies . i asked the cashier if it was made with yogurt and he said `` that it could be. '' . i looked at my receipt later and discovered that he charged me an extra dollar for each smoothie for the yogurt . i guess this is my fault for not asking but i think it was up to him to advise me . the smoothies were okay but we would try something different next time because we both did n't finish ours .	4485
0	my smoothie was so good , i got the mangofest with mango sorbet for additional dollar ... however when you order more than the drink itself , they should either put it in the next size cup since it makes the smoothie bigger or give me the extra in a small cup ! also you guys should have spoons iol i just got my wisdom teeth out and live in chandler	4485
0	have n't been back to this location after the manager refused to hold the employee accountable and another customer who was n't in there at the same time lied and posted a review mostly about me which is beyond bizarre . two other businesses in that plaza that i frequent mentioned having the same experience with that employee and telling the manager about it and received the same tone deaf response i did . the managers behavior overall has been ridiculously unprofessional .	4485
1	george is amazing ! i came in after i messed up my bangs and he fixed them for me so fast ! plus he 's so cute and nice ! definitely gon na come back !	4486
1	george ! omg ! he is amazing ! transformed my color ! he is an artist ! truly the best cut & color i 've had in years ! !	4486
1	there are few times in life when a haircut is so expertly crafted and executed , that its nothing short of genius . this was one of those times . kandis did such a wonderful job ive never looked so good . uuugh and what a babe . ill definitely be back .	4486
1	great experience ! ! ! i 'm visiting vegas and needed my hair done , i was happy to hear the regis was right here , in the middle of the fun part of vegas . as soon as i got in , the girls were absolutely friendly and i felt welcomed . aracely was my hair dresser , she was simply fantastic ! ! ! ! she asked and listened my request ( i 'm very picky with the way i like my hair ) ; she did awesome ! ! ! now i know where to go to have my hair done for my next visit to vegas ! thank you ! ! !	4486
1	i stopped by to ask advise from a stylist . my stylist was ashlee and once we started talking i felt very comfortable with her and hours later i left with the best cut , highlights and style i have ever had . i turned out we share the same birthday too ! ashlee may look very young but she has 8 years of experience and watching her work she is a pro . she gave a great shampoo and scalp message too ! thank you ashlee for making my/our per birthday so special and i hope you enjoy your special day too	4486
1	jonathan is seriously one of the best stylists i have ever had ! very professional great job . i was a little iffy on coming here due to previous reviews . totally worth it . friendly staff .	4486
1	been coming here for years . love the products and the people . highly recommended .	4486
1	george was amazing . he matched my hair color perfectly without messing up my highlights . the style he gave me was exquisite . i took a chance on george and am so happy i did ! thank you ,	4486
1	love this salon . always a good result for me . i saw george for the first time for my haircut . i wanted a different hairstyle and 5 inches after i ended up with a great long bob . he listens to what you want and advises you on the care afterwards . 17 years of experience and just a great personality . definitely a return client !	4486
0	avoid this place and avoid hairstylist irina ! ! ! save your money . i asked for layers and my hair was butchered and uneven ! this is what i ended up with . who cuts someone 's hair like that ! i also had my bottom ends dyed grey and no grey was noticeable . i ended up with orange/copper hair . i called to speak to the manager i was told i would have to wait a week to speak to the manager ! wtf !	4486
0	got the most overpriced haircut from shawn . he cut it to a length much shorter than we discussed . i asked for a long layered v and my layers are completely uneven . it looks as though he put my hair in a ponytail , chopped it off and sent me on my way . he did n't even bother framing my hair around my face . this hair cut is the saddest experience i 've ever had in a salon .	4486
0	if i had an option to give it no stars , i would . this is by far the worst salon ever ! stay away from this place ! ! ! they over charge for horrible work . i asked for ombre and i had a reference picture . the stylist did my hair and completely damaged my hair . and what 's worse , my hair looks nothing like the picture . i have orange hair ! ! ! i had to come back the next day to get it fixed , hoping it would be better but no . it looks worse ! ! ! ! ! ahhh ! $ 215 in two days !	4486
0	got my hair done here very recently while visiting vegas . the girl did a good job with my hair and what i asked for , toner + cut $ 120 . i was told the colour would last 6 weeks . now after 3 washes in less than 2 weeks my old colour has come back through and no longer looks new and fresh . very disappointed and a inconvenience for me to get it done again !	4486
0	went to regis to see if i could get my hair done , i'am a woman of color from chicago no one said can i help you ! ! i stood their for 5 mins . yes they saw me standing their ! shame on you regis ! ! ! blacks stay away ! !	4486
0	overpriced , next time i 'll get my twenty minute cut wash and style from supercuts and save $ 50 .	4486
0	i have been going to this salon for years . but recently it 's gone down hill . i just showed up for a mid morning appointment and the restrooms and floors looked as if they have n't been cleaned in days maybe weeks . lots of dirt , dust and filth . to make matters worse the stylist wanted to charge me 30 % more than i normally pay . if her attitude was inviting perhaps i would have agreed to the unconscionable price increase . but couple that with an unclean environment i would rather keep my money and my health .	4486
0	very disappointing as being a local and not being able to find the right salon yet because of being new to the area . i thought i would try regis out with having $ $ thought it would be reasonably price . however that was not the case . i wanted 1 inch taken off and they were going to charge $ 96.00 that is absurd ! ! i do n't know how they can justify getting a trim of 1 inch remove from my head and think $ 96.00 is reasonable . the staff was n't even friendly they made me wait 3 minutes no where to be found to tell me where to go . did n't even get a friendly welcome .	4486
0	worst haircut ever . also the group here were super unprofessional and chatty amongst themselves as my hair stylist was cutting my hair . maybe he was distracted by their gossip and just totally screwed up my hair ? never again ! i 'm getting a haircut somewhere else now to fix this mess on my head . also i want my money back . the lady on the phone said $ 50 for a women 's haircut but the dude who cut my hair said its $ 75 ... so irritating . i paid money for the worst haircut of my life . feel scammed .	4486
1	so ... it is a starbucks . lots of seats . i notice that because some of the newer remodels seems to feature less seating . staff was friendly ! parking was ok. drive through seemed to flow . coffee was as i expect .	4487
1	neat and clean location . first time at this location for my favorite pike place .. nice and fast service	4487
1	this location officially opened up nine days ago ! drive thru and all . good customer service here today !	4487
1	great and fast service . friendly staff and clean store . beverage and food was great as well .	4487
1	the staff her is always so nice and this starbucks is not as busy as most starbucks are . maybe it 's because this is a new location . i 've brought my laptop and worked from this location without any issues with noise or distractions . it also helps that it 's walking distance for me .	4487
1	i love the 2 for 1 holiday beverage special between 2-5 this weekend . the chestnut praline and caramel brulee are good but the caramel brulee latte us the taste winner today !	4487
1	i do n't know why this place has such low stars . it 's pretty much the same as any other starbucks . i got through the drive-thru pretty fast . my order was correct . and the attendant was courteous and friendly .	4487
1	this starbucks is brand new . great customer service and my drink order has been correct each time . this place is a little on the small side . they do , however , have a nice patio out front which will be nice when the weather is cooler .	4487
1	great starbucks ! very clean , super friendly baristas . wish they had comfy chairs inside , but the outdoor patio furniture will be great in fall/winter/spring . they always go the extra mile to make sure my drink is perfect , and they have great tips on ordering food and drinks . ( hint : try warming up the turkey and havarti sandwich for a twist . ) love coming here !	4487
1	i really like this starbucks coffee shop . the staff is friendly and the latte drinks are delicious !	4487
1	neat and clean location . first time at this location ... as usual starbucks is always good ..	4487
1	the ladies ( sorry i did n't get your names ) working this morning were awesome ! i was trying a new drink and was a little apprehensive as it 's not a commonly ordered drink . they made me 2 variations of the drink to try for the price of 1 . it 's always appreciated when excellent customer service is delivered . thank you for helping me discover my new favorite drink !	4487
1	i came here twice for their drive thru service only . the staffs seem friendly and drinks are delicious . i will definitely come back here again for my green tea latte .	4487
1	my first time here . it was during the morning rush and baristas chynna and thein were super friendly and gave me a warm welcome . my food and drinks were delivered accurately and quickly . the tables and floors were clean . the condiments were fully stocked . the mobile orders were ready before the customers came in to pick them up . awesome ! ! i have to give it a try sometime ! ! thanks for a great experience ! !	4487
1	i 've come here a couple times ; during each visit i 've received excellent service . this location is clean , efficient and friendly .	4487
1	updating and upgrading my review , now that this is our closest 'bucks , we have been here more regularly , usually for mobile app orders , and everything is on point . the baristas are friendly , even when i 'm just popping in to grab my preorder , and they always add a puppicino for mia with a smile . frequently busy , but clean and comfy seating inside and outside , too . see you soon , probably on my next double star day/challenge combo quest : damn you marketing gurus ! ( i 'm convinced they study meyers-briggs ; )	4487
0	today is my fifth and last visit there . drinks are never made with enough ice , topped all the way or they ca n't even get a frappucino made icy enough . to top it all off all the workers seem to always be frustrated and not in a good mood . we need dutch bros in chandler asap !	4487
0	nice place but do they really have to keep the ac so cold i was wearing a jacket and still freezing my butt off . and starbucks really 2.45 for a tall ice coffee i can get the same thing down the road for 1.65 wasnt too long ago was 1.95 . they do have a nice patio .	4487
0	they do n't listen i asked for a venti passion tea sweetened and left with a trenta passion tea unsweetened .	4487
0	slowest . drive thru . ever . got to the window after waiting 15 minutes . waited another 4 as the girl never even said hi , told me total , anything . she took orders while i was there and she scanned my phone and said nothing to me .	4487
0	one of the slowest starbucks in the east valley . understaffed when they opened and still trying to get full staffed . go to arizona and 202 for quicker service .	4487
0	i have come to the conclusion that this starbucks hates me ! it 's been a year since i 've been to this location and this is still the slowest starbucks i 've ever been to ugh ! ! ! ! waited almost 30 min for 2 drinks ... my daughters drink came out 15 min after ordering . still waiting for mine 10 min later ... no drink ! i finally just asked for my money back ! ridiculous !	4487
0	this starbucks is the worst ! very rude barista 's , waited for my grande iced cinnamon almond milk macchiato after 4 people behind me received their orders i asked . i got `` yeah it 's right here '' . i will never be back !	4487
0	this store is always extremely slow but i would keep coming anyways ; however tonight they reached a new pinnacle . it is over two hours before closing and i drove through asking for a trenta green tea no water . they said they could n't make it because they did n't have enough green tea made . i said i would be glad to wait for it if you would brew some and they said no we ca n't do that because we would end up throwing out too much at the end . okaaaay ! cancelled order and went to another starbucks . great customer service i have never had that issue at any other starbucks !	4487
0	have given this location three tries.. today was my last try . drive thru has been insanely slow all three times , today i left with plenty of time to get a coffee and get to work on time . sat there for approximately 15-20 minutes and could not back out or pull out as there were cars in front and behind me . made me late to work . i am normally very patient with places like this but this never seems to happen at their other new location on chandler blvd and alma school , so i will be driving a few minutes out of my way if i need coffee again . two stars because the employees have always been very friendly otherwise .	4487
0	just visited this starbucks and ordered a venti matcha green tea and they gave it to me half full with mostly foam . when i advised barista it felt half empty her response was it was probably a lot of foam . really ! ! she offered to remake it with an attitude but i had to get to work so i did n't have time . this is terrible service , i did n't pay almost $ 10 to get half a drink .	4487
0	slowest starbucks ever ! ! do n't come here if you 're trying to get coffee before work in the morning their crew sucks	4487
0	worst freaking starbucks ever . takes forever to get one drink . also just to warn you , they will forget to make your drink most of the time . i 've been here 5 times since it 's opened and nothing has improved . my recommendation is to go to another location or even another company all together .	4487
0	typical starbucks , decor nice and good coffee . parking is too small for how busy it gets being across from the chandler hospital . i had check on my iced coffee i ordered because i saw others who ordered after me receive their coffee 's . another customer had to ask about her order also when she saw me ask about mine . they were apologetic and i forgave them , but when i asked for a refill the cashier questioned if i ordered my coffee at that particular starbucks .	4487
0	today was my 5th and last time at this location . they forgot my order , and gave me a cold breakfast sandwich . and to add to it , they gave me a side of bad attitude . ai n't nobody got time for that !	4487
0	the service is bad . one barista even rolled her eye to me just because i tried to get her attention to my order while she was chatting with others . i called to complained and got promised the store manager would call me back but it never happened . will never go again even though the location is so conveniently located .	4487
0	they got my drinks right but warning : they are extremely slow . took 10mins for two drinks and i was the only one in the drive thru ( and no one ordering inside ) . guy taking my order seemed nervous too . update- i tried again after a couple of weeks and still extremely slow . the female at the window seemed to not be doing her job and talking to her friends about classes in the drive thru window . i waited another 10 minutes for 1 drink .	4487
1	i have been rent here for the past 3 years . yes there are scorpion but i look for any hole in my apartment and never leave food outside or trash . i always see shae alone in the front office and she does her best to help me out in anything when i have a problem in the apartment . shae is very nice lady to me and does her best . i have been here for 3 years and i feel very comfortable standing here .	4488
1	when i 1st walk thru the doors i notice it was only one agent multitasking while assisting mulitiple remember shane is amazing at what she do . she is very passionate about her job and have such a positive energy . she made me feel like i was a tenant before i became a tenant . she was by my side the entire process from the time i walked into the door inqurying for the apartment until the time i signed my lease . this property is more than amazing and im excited about moving into my 2 bedroom ...	4488
1	we found a perfect place to live here at solis the leasing sales lady shane was really helpful she guided us thru the application and she is really friendly and thanks to her me and my wife got our 1st place together thanks shane	4488
1	i went last saturday afternoon to simply view the layout of the solis property . i was greeted by a warm , pleasant and gorgeous diva , by the name of shane . she was the upmost professional . she was extremely patient and thorough and took me to 3 apartment layouts based on my needs and was efficient in giving me the information that i needed . if she is any indication to settling in to an atmosphere to call home , i will definitely be back at solis !	4488
0	scorpions everywhere ... i 've killed 6 in my first month . shae or whatever her name is responds to you like this `` i do n't know know when they are coming , i 'm not a weather stripper i do n't know there schedule '' after asking when will they fix the front door , scorpions are coming in that way . scorpion molting all over my patio ... open gates all day and night . worst decision to lease here ever . they will bait and switch you . document all your conversations and get names .	4488
0	they never come through on maintenance . health hazards all over ! i 've had this huge heat pouring , scorpion dripping , water leaking whole in my bathroom for a month . no attempts to accommodate me at all from management . problems since i 've moved in do not move here . they only care about your money	4488
0	i asked maria v , the business manager about scorpions in lv , unbeknownst that this complex is infested , her quote reply `` oh it 's a desert , you may see one here or there outside in the wild areas `` never disclosed that they are inside the walls and come in your apartment . the property needs to get rid of the rock landscaping that 's offering shelter to these venomous things . people 's life 's are in danger .	4488
0	escorpions ! ! 09/04/18 everwhere inside the apartments ! ! ! i know so many people there and the community , manager do n't care about that , they just care if u pay the rent late , charge late fees and charge the residents a lot of money for everything , do n't move to solis at flamingo maintance sucks ! the worst management of any apartment complex i have ever lived in . whether it 's taking over a month to fix the ac , or over 3 weeks ( and still waiting ! ) to fix our washing machine , the management here does not care about their tenants . do not move here. ! ! ! !	4488
1	dr. rowe is very kind and patient ... and fast ! very pain-free , stress-free experience today getting a couple of fillings . i was dreading it , but dr. rowe & her team made it easy . the service dog , zach , was a nice touch too . i felt very comfortable here & would highly recommemd her .	4489
1	best dentist i 've ever been to ! she does amazing work ! she performed pain free oral surgery on me , did n't rush thru the job and relieved me of a big dental problem . great staff that treats you right . a perfect dentist and centrally located west las vegas location ( on decatur near flamingo ) . i go back soon for my 5th visit and look forward to the deluxe work she does . if you can find a better dentist , i 'll eat your hat !	4489
0	i went to this dentist in 2011 . she did work on my teeth and charged my insurance . i also paid hundreds of dollars in deductible . she waited 4 years then called me and told me i owe 690.00 from a past bill . when i refused to pay her extortion she put it on my credit . i am still fighting this . she is shady and her work is terrible ! ! ! !	4489
0	yes she is somewhat nice but upon meeting her for the first time , she failed to introduce herself . she entered the room and went right to work , which felt very uncomfortable . but what i truly hated about dr. rowe is she is very argumentive , stand offish and does not value your opinion about what you would like to have done to your teeth , not forgetting that she and the front office lady did not follow through with a simple call back and insurace approval . so i 'm giving her a star for her time . one last thing about her office , the furniture and office is old and smelly and needs a serious upgrade to the 21th century .	4489
1	we took our dog to the animal hospital as a last resort . we had been given the news that our dog had hip dysplasia in both hips , and very badly at that . every vet who saw her x-rays said we needed to do surgery immediately . they stood to make a great profit off of both hips . instead , the vet here recommended a combination of vitamins and fish oil to help her . although she will probably need surgery eventually , she is a happy puppy and we are very pleased with the vet we met here . would highly recommend if you 're looking for a professional , kind atmosphere !	4490
1	five stars . i 've had to use their emergency services twice to put down pets and once for one of my labs . dr anderson in surgery repaired the cranial cruciate of my first lab and she did great . currently have another lab under the care of dr mackillop for epilepsy . on all visits everyone had been professional and clearly loves animals . it truly is `` you get what you pay for ''	4490
1	i had to take my dog there for some x-rays , the staff was really nice . we did n't have to wait to long for our appt . the only thing i did n't like was how congested the waiting room was on the non emergency side .	4490
1	took my dog here as he was lethargic and throwing up white foam . staff was great with him , he 's a little scared of people and animals . staff found the problem , an abcess , drained and gave us the meds . he was loopy but fine and it was 600 , which is fine as long as my dog is okay . i will use this place in an emergency again	4490
1	this place is amazing . they did an incredible job with my dog jasper 's eye surgery to remove a benign tumor . it looks like there was never anything there . the doctors and staff are wonderful . it 's incredible and reasonably priced . any time i need a second opinion i 'm getting a referral here ! i wish i did n't have to take my dog anywhere else !	4490
1	pvsec has always done an amazing job for my pup . i 've had to bring my dog to pvsec for emergency unfortunately a few times . pvsec always took great care of him . the doctors and vet techs are all wonderful , caring and very attentive to my dog . and also caring to me because it 's always emotional bringing your dog in for an emergency . they are extremely pricey but for the quality , experience and care you get @ pvsec it is worth it . if you are going into the er be prepared to wait and wait . they are always busy . if you have an emergency or need a specialty doctor i would only recommend pvsec !	4490
1	the surgical and emergency departments at pvsec are the best in the area . this facility was recommended by my regular vet to do weekend obstruction removal surgery for my 1 year old golden retriever . the office staff is friendly and informative , and so are the techs . the surgeon took time to explain the procedure to me and my family and they called me as soon as my pet was out of surgery to give me an update . these veterinarians and technicians are professional and passionate . i am so thankful for and impressed by the diligent and precise work they do here - they saved my pet !	4490
1	doctor and vet assistant staff are wonderful . very caring , knowledgeable and concerned about the pets . front desk staff is awful . waited over 45 minutes to check out . staff too busy chit-chatting to get up and take care of people . update : took dog there one recent night after he was stung by a yellow jacket . everyone was wonderful including the checkout . i 'm changing the review from 3 stars to 5 . they were very busy but each person was greeted warmly and sympathetically . the desk people remembered people 's names and those of the pets . highly recommend them for emergencies and regular vet visits .	4490
1	thankfully i have never had to use their emergency services , but i have used both dermatology and ophthalmology department for my dog . the doctors and staff are very professional and polite , they answer any question i had about my dog 's condition . i am thankful for these veterinarians and staff for helping my dog feel better !	4490
0	clean facility and nice staff . however , i 've been waiting for over three hours and my dog still has n't come back from her x-ray .	4490
0	price gouging ! these people are heartless crooks who will overcharge like you crazy . the doctors here each own their piece of the practice and set their own rates , which tend to change hourly and no matter what they quote you as an estimate , expect to pay much more . however , i would strongly encourage you to shop around for better prices . i found out after paying $ 1675 for an mri ( $ 3000 after including tests and consultation ) , that university veterinary specialists only charges $ 1170 for the same mri !	4490
0	the most insulting experience ever ! ! ! . rude doctors , the 3 of them we used ... .they were getting monetary credic card approvals every step of my pets treatment ... .. they kept pumping up the bill even they know my pet had no chance . they wanted $ 400 to cremate but we took our pet to north boros for less than half that for cremation . they are insensitive , hateful , rude and incompetent ... ... .lots of newbies working the er hours ... .. worst experience in my entire life . if there were 0 stars they would get that . these people are thiieves everybody i have spoken to hates this place and would never return	4490
0	doctor and vet assistant staff are wonderful . very caring , knowledgeable and concerned about the pets . front desk staff is awful . waited over 45 minutes to check out . staff too busy chit-chatting to get up and take care of people .	4490
0	poor service , extremely expensive , long waits and cold snd uncaring staff . i will not return here and would not recommend it to anyone . avoid !	4490
0	i have been taking my cat here now every other week for over thee months with multiple medicine changes and no results . i ca n't even get a doctor to speak with me and get stuck speaking with a vet tech . three thousand dollars later no results and no answers ! ! ! ! ridiculous ! ! these people want your money and there is absolutely no personal attention . also they do n't even let you go back when they exam your animal . bad experience .	4490
0	this `` hospital '' did everything in their power to delay treatment of our dog until her condition worsened , and at that time ask for more money to then perform treatments that should have been taken care of from the start . in the course of 12 hours , or dog went from tired but alert , to essentially catatonic . the hospital admitted that they did n't hydrate her enough , neglected to check her urine , or even administered an antidote in time even when they suspected her of being poisoned . if you love your pet as much as we loved ours , take them anywhere else . this is a business first and a hospital second . do n't be fooled .	4490
0	pvsec camp hill pa. was hard to get into . a month wait . very rude on phone . i was told his injury wasnt serious enough for them to see him anytime soon . second time . person i talked to would not take a msg from me . no other place in their automated system would take message . i was very frustrated . found another 24 hr trauma and surgery center that helped us greatly . avets in monroeville pa . i would rate avets 5 stars . surgery was done within a few days . extremely satisfied with avets .	4490
0	extremely slow . i was in there for four hours . waited an hour and a half for the final paperwork . very frustrating	4490
1	they get a 3 for the branch and a 5 for device and ease . the branch did n't have paperwork ready at the appointment time for signing so we had to wait an extra 30 min . however , the loan process and ease of it was great . awesome rates too !	4491
1	i have to mention ... the customers who come here are chatty and slow . a lot if them dont decision their financial needs quickly and need a lot of hand holding which slows down the line but the tellers are super nice amd patient . we love cesar	4491
1	love desert schools ! i am not a big-bank fan . the reason i love desert schools is that they are incredibly courteous , friendly , and helpful . they are great about answering questions and sent i really care about the customer experience . if you want a good bank where you will actually enjoy the experience , this is where you want to be !	4491
1	they are very pleasant and quick and dont solicit a ton of services like retail banks . they always have 3-4 tellers and i have never had a negative experience with anyone . the parking lot is busy so be careful and the customers arr lollagaggers	4491
1	when i get a document notarized at the credit union for free , then take it to my office , stupidly fax it to the wrong number by not adding a `` 9 '' at the start only to get a call an hour later from the bank employee who notarized it telling me that the person who received it in error had called her to let her know some numbskull was faxing important-looking legal documents to him by mistake , and does it all with a maximum of cheerfulness and forbearance . . . that 's service .	4491
0	terrible customer service . very slow . i absolutely hate dealing with this bank , especially this branch , but my auto loan is through them . unless you 're stuck with them for an auto loan go to wells fargo , they have exponentially better customer service . the desert schools online banking is primitive and the customer support over the phone is a joke . you 're out of luck if you need something outside regular business hours . go elsewhere if you can ! they will make you wait 45+ minutes to do something simple like provide insurance for your auto loan .	4491
0	coming to this branch is worse than going to the dentist . customer service is awful . wait time for the simplest thing is rediculous . the obviously enjoy each other more than helping customers as i honestly waited 5 minutes for a conversation between two employees to end before they would even acknowledge me . i miss the branch they used to have in walmart off elliot . ruins my whole day when i have to come here .	4491
0	slow and inflexible . they prey on small customers who are charged with excessive fees . it 's sad that our hometown credit union has taken a play from the big banks .	4491
0	do not get raechel as a teller she is slow . painfully slow . it took her 15 minutes to do a 1500 deposit that i counted and turned . and then spoke to me as if i didnt know what i was doing when i do the same thing weekly .	4491
0	i have banked with desert schools since 06 and have never had a problem with cashing a check right away . but a this location they decide to put a hold on more than half of it . made it very fustrating when i needed the cash for today . horrible customer service	4491
1	really torn on 3 or 4 starts here . they have nice furniture for a reasonable price but the shopping experience is always rather arduous . it 's like you are schlepping around on a pre determined path that always takes at least 45 minutes theto get through and that is with no stops . i 'd recommend going here on a weekday if you can ... . the staff is always fairly helpful , if you can get their attention , but not overly so . parking is not pleasant at this particular ikea and seems to be inadequate .	4492
1	i mean c'mon , what else can be said about ikea that has n't already been said . this location is always busy because it is the only one in both north and south carolina . i thoroughly enjoy this place , i always head straight to the market place . no need to go through the floor sets , i normally go online and find the aisle and bin number before i go . this is place is made for you not to mess up . it can get a little hectic , but when you decorate an entire house for little money my patience grows exponentially .	4492
1	what a great place and great concept . the prices are just phenomenal . the restaurant is so user friendly except they do n't have straws ! there food prices also are very inexpensive . $ 6.99 for salmon and vegetables . they also have a childcare center . the child has to be out of diapers though . you will quickly be overwhelmed by how big this place is and all the choices . but their awesome price will be very pleasing . you wo n't find anything like their items at other stores . i highly recommend just coming for a visit and enjoying the experience .	4492
1	how lucky are we to have this shopping mecca ? ! parking is in abundance . displays are neat & inviting . i think the staff is amazing . they 're always so friendly & helpful .	4492
1	always enjoy my pilgrimage here if only just for lunch of traditional sweetish meatballs and lingoln berries . always have what i need at just the right price . the ikea family membership is awesome too great deals .	4492
1	one of the best places for affordable and good quality furniture - always liked the unique swedish designs ! the food selection in the dining area is good . there are days when they take off the dining cost from your total bill , which is really good !	4492
1	this place is huge . wear sneakers . or come with a plan . if you 're going to just walk through the entire thing , be sure to stop at their cafe . it 's pretty good and everything is reasonably priced .	4492
1	you have to wear a patience hat when you visit ikea on the weekend . that said , with your special hat , you are sure to have an enjoyabe experience , even if you do n't purchase any furniture . however , you might find that little something that is a must have for your humble abode . when your feet are tired and you are ready for a nap , grab a $ 1 frozen yogurt on a cone or in a cup - it is sure to top off your visit !	4492
1	loved the ikea in san diego , ca . this store here had much less merchandise , i saw several things in the catalog i would have liked , the store did not have and there is no way to get it on line from ikea . my son that works for ikea dk in the head office says that they are changing to online shopping in the near future , but that can take years , i might be dead by then .	4492
1	it 's been a few years since i 've been to ikea but it is still the same . you can get things for your home at very reasonable prices . the cafe is also great because you can get a meal for pretty cheap . i got the barbecue meal for $ 4 . this was a shorter trip but i made notes of things i want to come back for in the future .	4492
1	huge . large variety . eatery upstairs . come with lots of energy and money . you 'll want more than you came in for .	4492
1	cheap build-it-yourself furniture . plan on spending at least a few hours of your life here .	4492
1	ikea needs no introduction - this is the one-stop shop for diy decorating on a budget known around the world ! the charlotte location is always neat and well organized , and features easy parking , a convenient location , friendly staff , and all the ikea goodness you know and love from flat-pack furniture to their signature meatballs . my only complaint is that the vegetarian 'meatballs ' come with boiled vegetables rather than delightful lingonberry sauce , mashed potatoes and gravy of their meat counterparts ; we meatless eaters want our comfort foods , too !	4492
1	it 's another ikea ! huge selection , super fun to walk through . if you 're just grabbing a quick dinner set or already know what you want , you do n't have to go through the showroom upstairs .	4492
1	they should have a customer service number directly for the store . i purchased a table and 4 chairs several weeks ago . i 'm just putting them together and realized that the last chair pad has a stain on it ( yes , brand new ) . after getting upset with the customer service representative , she transferred me to someone in the charlotte store to speak to directly after stating she could not . the store employee was very helpful and provided me with the local store number to follow up . they will . e sending me a new chair pad in the place of the stained one .	4492
1	lots of options , easy to navigate . quality of products is good , some pieces are tough to put together due to # of pieces but overall worth it	4492
1	love this place ... during the week . do n't try to go here on the weekends unless you absolutely have to as they are so so crowded .	4492
1	there is a time in every renter/ homeowner 's life when they need an aesthetically pleasing home good for a reasonable price and ikea answers the call . i 've owned several pieces of furniture that have lasted about 7 years on average . their items are low-cost and designed to be updated on a regular basis . i do enjoy looking at all of their stylish room concepts and drooling over their offerings in the cafe .	4492
1	huge place . have everything you could possibly need for furnishing a home/office/etc . plenty of employees always readily available and very knowledgable . my favorite section is the $ 1 one on the lower floor . only bad thing about ikea is having to assemble products yourself and if you buy a lamp from there you have to buy their specific bulbs .	4492
1	i love ikea . the best time to come is during the week . you can browse around and find a little of everything for every room in the house without breaking your budget .	4492
1	it 's ikea , how can you go wrong ? the furniture is n't the greatest you can find , but at its price point , i would say it 's the best you can fine . between the pricing and the modern design , it really makes this stuff a great way to transform any home into a modern living space .	4492
1	anything for the home one of my favorite places to browse to get ideas today i came for a sink and cabinet for my bathroom . i found just what i wanted i also got a bedspread , storage containers , plates , a rug , ceiling light , cutting board , window shades and storage baskets this place it huge . i 've been there 10 times and i can still get lost . it 's easy to fill your shopping cart they supply a pencil to write down the item number so you can get it before checkout . there is a cafeteria upstairs and a snack bar on the ground floor you ca n't be in a hurry . saturday is crazy busy	4492
1	i 'm biased . there . my wife is finnish and finland was a province of sweden for 700 years or so they share a lot . and so everything at ikea is super familiar and resembles the stuff we have at home . well , a lot of our home stuff are actually from there because of the history . the best thing about the place for me is the food court . the swedish meatballs they jave there is n't quite what scandinavians eat but they try . but all in all , good taste in good portion with reasonable price . hey , we all get hungry walking through that long maze right ?	4492
1	not only a great place to shop for cool/cheap stuff , but it is a destination place as well with great food at low prices . they watch your kids too while you shop .	4492
1	go during the week if you can . we love ikea but always have gone on the weekend . honestly , it 's worth a days vacation to come on a weekday . lots and lots of walking . we did n't eat at the cafeteria this time . i am not a fan of their food . it 's worth a try . got a new desk chair . ca n't wait to get home and put it together	4492
1	i love ikea ! always lots of stuff to choose from and see as well as great ideas . they have a kids play area where the kids can get dropped off at for a couple hours which is kinda nice . be careful what day you go though because it can get extremely busy on weekends and it 's very difficult to shop and check-out lines are ridiculous . however , during the week you can take your time and it 's very enjoyable . also the food it pretty good .	4492
1	what 's not to like at ikea ? ok , the parking lot . other than that , it 's a great place to stroll through , get some ideas and possibly explore your inner interior decorator self . it has a great layout and the products are very unique in and of them self . that being said , understand that the store sells to thousands of people so do n't expect uniqueness but do expect decent quality and creative items . the food is something not to miss either . from ribs , to mozzarella , tomato , basil pannini and swedish meatballs . there 's something here for everyone and it 's cheap ! !	4492
1	oh ikea why ca n't i ever leave your store without spending less than $ 100 in random items ? ! your reasonable prices and maze of furniture provide a pleasant way to pass the time during the summer heat . the cafe full of yummy things to eat is a perfect way to reward myself for all the exercise i 'm doing walking around your store as well . your parking lot is spacious and your stuff is trendy . i just hate putting stuff together after i buy it though , thank god for having an interior designer handy who likes to put stuff together for me .	4492
1	its an ikea . if you 've never been , go . make a field trip out of it . they have everything you could possibly need for your home . its relatively cheap . and its somewhat cheaply made , considering an expert wo n't be assembling it . unless you happen to be an expert .	4492
1	once you get through the winding swedish maze of home goods and fight off the roaming minotaur , it 's not too shabby of a domestic adventure . they 've got all the affordable home decor your little hermit heart can hope for . it 's not as strong as top of the line brands but those brands have a substantially larger price tag . the furniture is modern and looks good , there 's a good variety too . from couches , to bed covers , to pictures frames , plants and wooden spoons , ikea has it .	4492
1	love this place ! kids rooms are very cute and the prices are amazing . if you 're coming here , bring your walking shoes . it 's a long walk around the store .	4492
1	i spend all day and night in ikea ! they have furnished my whole studio apartment and salon space . i have only had to return one thing and it was because i did n't have a need for it . one thing that i am disappointed in is how they manage their multiple boxed items . someone took two box # 1 items and the two box # 2 were left . the online count system showed two in store but you could n't buy anything until the box # 1 item was returned . waited on this sideboard for over 2 months but i guess driving 8 hours round trip will ensure that it 's purchased without fail .	4492
1	it is awsome . the food is great . many foods are organic . everthing is fresh . i love the recycle system . drsserts are out of this world . the store is exceptional . the air conditioner was not as cold as i expected . i was a little hot .	4492
1	ikea is a great place to buy furniture and accessories to decorate your space without breaking the bank . i decorated almost my entire home office with stuff i bought at ikea . putting together their stuff can take hours , but if you set your mind to it you can definitely do it yourself . i did . it might not be really high quality , but it 's definitely sufficient for the average person , and the results are worth the trip .	4492
1	great store . unnecessary long lines at time and some of the departments are chaotic .	4492
1	cool place to get cool stuff for your house . fun to spend a day here . meatballs are amazing . only reason i 'm giving 4 stars is because it 's a little overpriced . it may be cheap furniture and you can find good stuff for a good price but you just have to be picky . you can buy a cheap nice rug here but do n't buy a cheap couch . get one used on craigslist .	4492
1	great place for decorative accessories , kitchenware , lamps , artwork , etc . the furniture is n't the highest quality but a great place to go for inexpensive home ware .	4492
1	headed over to ikea today - first time in over 5 years and was super excited ... was able to get some great deals for my daughters bedroom and had a pretty good meal ! ! ! our table got the chicken fingers and fries ... the meatballs ... strawberry and spinach salad with chicken and some red curry soup with chicken !	4492
1	it 's a zoo , always super busy and crowded the food is awesome . they workers are so busy that seem annoyed when you ask them for assistance . i hope they have more christmas staff	4492
1	this was a huge ikea with tons of parking . we went on a sunday morning and there looked to be a ton of cars outside , but the inside was n't very crowded . each of the workers we encountered inside were very nice and helpful .	4492
1	love the food here . meatballs and ligon berries yum ! ! now they have the berries by the ketchup so that 's even better ! ! and they have my favorite candy in the world , sour peach lips .	4492
1	made the drive from raleigh with the fam , worth it all the way ! they have added many modern and contemporary items to their inventory . the overall shopping experience was pleasant . even though the weekend is heavy in foot traffic , the design helps it flow quickly and efficiently . every time we come by , the options just keep growing and impressing . for the quality , price is perfect . it 's always a plus the different food options they have , the kids love it . wish they did open a location a little closer to home though..	4492
1	love this place ! super inexpensive . even the food is inexpensive . great shopping experience . only down fall is you have to put the furniture together . which requires an mit degree hahahah ! ! !	4492
1	i just love the values and the workmanship along with prices . my fav item is their storage bags !	4492
1	huge ikea store w lot of idea and display to deco the house , room etc . the price is reasonable on some items but some items are overprice in my opinion for the quality of the merchandise . i wish they have one closet to raleigh . i do believe we have only one ikea in charlotte for the whole north carolina . ( im not positively sure though ) .	4492
1	i didn '' t , but my friend found out that there is $ 0.50 a hotdog before you exit the store . haha ! ! ! i went there this morning to pick up another shelf . he stopped me and said he wanted to buy me a lunch . 2 hotdog , a soda and chip for less than $ 2.- iol ! ! ! !	4492
0	we order by phone ( because we ca n't online i have no idea ) and requested to ship to asheville . it only took 2 months ... i kid you not . can someone at ikea please try to get other delivery services ? and let people place orders online ?	4492
0	i stood in line for over 30 mins because only 6 or the 26 lanes were open on a busy holiday weekend . not worth it considering there was n't even a sale . this will be the last time i shop at ikea	4492
0	11am busy saturday 11/7/2015 , plenty of customers , 3 of 25 check out lines open . lines 25+ deep . management incompetence , again . nothing changes but the day .	4492
0	get ready to spend three hours picking out products only to find that they are out of stock of everything when you get to the pick-up aisles . it looks like it 's just too inconvenient to label what 's out of stock on the display floor . but , hey , they might get five in sometime next week . maybe . no , you ca n't order it . no , you ca n't pay now . one star for service ( terrible ) and stock ( non-existent ) . one more star b/c they do have fun foods . when they have them .	4492
0	horrible customer service ! we waited in line 53 minutes for a return . asked to speak to manager ( lump on a log ) , i told him our concern & i said at least give your customers a complimentary drink for the long wait time & the air was not working efficiently . also , we purchased a bed item & was overcharged $ 10 . could you imagine standing in line for another hour ? ! ? ikea customer service line , no one ever answers . bad business practice !	4492
0	horrible customer service . everything is about 8 times harder than it needs to be . pay for them to pick up you items and deliver them then order items are wrong and half are broken . have to call multiple times to have order changed . delivery company they use is awful . honestly the worst shopping experience i have ever had	4492
0	awful . been in line for over half an hour now . only 8 lanes open out of 26 . if it werent for it being a gift it would not be worth the time .	4492
0	just left the store to buy a peace plant no peace here it was priced at 7.99 . i waited in line for 20 minutes and it rang up 12.99 . the cashier would not honor and had to call 4 people i finally i said forget it . this is the worst store i have ever been in to purchase a damn plant ikea get your shit together . it 's called customer service ! ! .	4492
0	not well stocked . management needs to improve definitely . drove far to come here n so many empty shelves .	4492
0	all ikea stores are nicely laid out etc ... this particular store is cool unless you have to speak with customer service . the two times that i did need them , service was less than par and need proper training . i found the staff to be ghetto and lazy . it 's a shame .	4492
0	i agree with some of the other reviewers regarding the out-of-stock items . i will also add that last sunday around 5 pm was a most ridiculous wait in line . i mean there had to have been over 100 people wanting to check out , yet there were 3 lines open and one for debit/credit . we joked that this place is becoming like wally world . not cool , to spend over 20 minutes in line . we were happy with the price of our items and this is the only reason we continued to wait . in the near future , will make it my mission to go really early in the morning !	4492
0	ikea is fun until you have to return something . they ask you to take a number and sit in their waiting area . i came in to return a $ 6 item and i waited for 20 minutes until my number was called . how is this ok ? it 's not .	4492
0	finally delivered after three weeks past my expected delivery date . then many of my pieces were scratched up because they were only wrapped in plastic . not even worth dealing with their horrible customer service . i sat on the line for 2 hours when the truck driver did n't show up the day i was supposed to receive my furniture . i do n't even want to think about how much time it would take to replace my furniture . everything looks great after concealing some of the damaged pieces . if you 're going to shop at ikea pick it up yourself at the store ! !	4492
0	much better at selling cheap 3rd world made furniture than providing any decent level of customer service .	4492
0	love the products but they have got to open more lanes at check out . it takes at least 20 mins every time i 'm here . today i have been in like for 35 minutes and i 'm still not to the register . 5 of the 26 lanes are open .	4492
0	ikea is definitely a go to for all things home related but the customer service here is below average . i 'm not sure if it 's the mass hiring of teenagers or young college students that could care less how they talk to a customer or the lack of training but i loathe coming here for anything . why do i come you ask , like i said if your looking for little knick knacks for your home it 's most likely going to have it in stock , but brace yourself for the eye rolling , mumbling , or hallway patrol monitor attitudes . after this weekend 's experience i rather take my chances at target or good ol ' amazon .	4492
0	click and collect order would not recommend ! ! ! i ordered a tablecloth yesterday and drove 40 minutes to the store to pick up . while the clerk is looking for my order i get an email stating that the product is not available and they are issuing a refund . when i ordered the tablecloth yesterday the website stated that 5 were in stock . a waste of time and gas . this is the second time ikea has disappointed me .	4492
0	against better better judgement , we went back to ikea . yep , same lousy lines , except they out did themselves with terrible service ! congrats ikea , you 've out done your selves ! do they teach this in sweden ? do americans have expectations that are incompatible with low swedish service levels ?	4492
0	welcome to ikea , a ginormous home goods warehouse store . this store is different than most home goods places , the closest comparison in store content is bed bath and beyond but ikea is on steroids . overall ikea is a 2 star for me , i would give 5 stars for the content of items sold here but 1 star for the frustration of dealing with the crowds and less than helpful associates .	4492
0	i love ikea stores but this is more about the staff than the store itself . they have some very lazy workers . i struggled with boxes from the self service furniture area and the male workers just looked at me and did n't ask if i needed help . and then i et to the register and the labels are on the underside of the heavy boxes and he gets an attitude in trying to pick it up . this is ridiculous . come for the deals but do n't expect to be helped .	4492
0	horrible customer service . went into the charlotte store planning to put together a whole closet configuration , could n't get any help , even from a `` manager '' . walked back out again after being pointed to a couple of wonky computers and told `` figure out your own configuration '' . no one would help us , even though we repeated asked for assistance . obviously they do n't mind watching sales walk out the door ... fun store . abysmal service . will spend our money elsewhere .	4492
0	rating 2.5 : i like the savings one gets when shopping at ikea . however , customer service is lacking . they only had 4 cash registers open for checkout . there was probably over 50 people that needed to be checked out . they also need more people on the floor to help assist with locating items you ca n't seem to find . the food here is good . you should check out the cafeteria for lunch or dinner . just be prepared to waste a lot of time if you come to this ikea location .	4492
0	the cafeteria was n't serving the best especially since i brought my mother in for her first visit . no , wifi and i truly recall mlps ikea cafeteria having wi-fi . so = meh , i 've experienced better at other ikea 's . i love the location and cleaniness .	4492
0	do not come on a weekend ! ! ! poorly staffed & the lines are ridiculously long ! ! they even closed registers , which was crazy since the lines were so long . avoid it like the plague on weekends ! !	4492
0	so help me god i will never set foot in an ikea again i had the absolute worst experience going to this ikea save yourself the hassle . time is money . buy a more expensive piece of furniture from a company that will deliver and assemble it for you you 'll save yourself twenty hours of wanting to bang your head against a wall .	4492
0	check out at this ikea is the worst ? never come on a saturday or sunday ! good selection of cheap fad furnishings .	4492
0	horrible online customer service . this ikea in particular might be fine , but i ca n't get through to talk to anyone about a specific issue . the chat option is nonexistent , the phone is always busy .	4492
0	tried the kids club for the first time , the kids wanted to leave before the hour was up - said the untrained supervisors were mean to them , and this is not how you talk to children . nicolle and noelle were on duty , worth noting they were very rude during drop off and pickup as well . never again you will get the privilege of caring for our kids . avoid .	4492
0	lazy people work here . i was struggling with heavy items and they just looked at me without asking if i needed assistance . i love the ikea brand but the staff here is so lazy . such a shame .	4492
0	wait wait wait . ikea needs to do some serious hiring ! time spent trying to return is ridiculous , very few people on the floor if you need help , long waits to check out .	4492
0	better make sure you buy enough to make it worth the frustration at the register . it 's so frustrating to get to checkout and spend more time in line to pay than it took to shop . saturday night and they have about a third of the registers open . i guess that 's why we do n't come often . prices better stay good or the wait wo n't be worth it .	4492
0	had to return box containing parts to a bed we purchased during week when not busy . saturday afternoon and only 2 return counters open . after finally returning wrong box we were given directions on where the needed box was , only to be directed right back to same bin with box we just returned . nobody around to help , had to go online and figure what box we actually needed . my first major interaction with ikea and i must say i was underwhelmed by lack of help from staff , mislabeled boxes and incredibly long wait lines for , well everything .	4492
0	i have a mixed feeling about giving them a 1-star review as some of the employees were good . basically , we purchased bunch of stuff , with pick up-delivery-install services added . at the install day , we were told that 25 % or so of our purchased could not be installed , per their rules . no one told us this when purchasing and paying . so we either did it ourselves or hired handyman as we did not have appropriate tools . just beware if you plan to have your stuff installed by their services	4492
0	it 's much too much in my opinion . long lines , big crowds , so much merchandise you ca n't digest it all .	4492
0	good place for room idea but need to work more on customer service	4492
0	36 check out lanes and only 3 open . asked to get another open when over 20 people waiting to pay and the answer was a simple no . kiss my ass , ikea ! ! ! ! !	4492
0	we drove to ikea over five weeks ago and placed a large order worth a few thousand dollars . every weekend they have promised delivery and every saturday night we find out late that the delivery is not going to happen because of `` missing parts '' - even though the friday before we get the call confirming delivery . this has been 4 weekends in a row of horrific customer service with some of the furniture being for a nursery since we are about to have a baby in a few weeks . then when you call they will place you on hold for hours . will never order from ikea again .	4492
0	the furniture is cute , trendy , and greatly priced . however , my complaint is on the service . i do understand this is a self service location , and i am okay with that . the issue is more or less with the home delivery department . i waited 10 mins for someone to come out and help me at the desk while ten other people stood around , not even calling anyone to come up front . when the woman did decide to come to the counter her attitude and demeanor was nothing less than insulting . so much so that i ended up complaining to the manager , and returning all of my furniture .	4492
0	the food used to be better . i do n't know what has happened within the past year but i will not be eating here again . all my food tasted like it was several hours old , maybe even from yesterday . my mashed potatoes had small chicken bones in it . i nearly choked .	4492
0	awful experience . is anybody in charge here ? ? ? hundreds of people waiting in line and 4 of 26 cashier stations open . really ? ? ? ? what a joke . my cart full of $ 500 worth of merchandise is being left in the middle of an aisle . my time is too valuable to waste on this dump .	4492
0	just disgusted ! ! ! ! treated horribly by one of the employees ; causing them to lose quite a bit of money due to the fact we were shopping for wedding decor ... .. great job ! ! ! ! !	4492
0	the only positive comment would be the the couch guy who helped us not find the leather covering we were looking for . employees gathering together for chats , yogurt machine broken , and one check out line at 5:00 p.m. on a friday ... ..15 people ahead of us ... we just dumped our stuff and walked out ... .	4492
0	take ikea for what it is . affordable furniture but not customer support/ service . bought a couch a week ago and the chase was n't in stock , we came to find that out after 15 minutes with a wharehouse employee fixing what the floor employee messed up with our pick up . i was told it would be there the next day , then later told wednesday and then saturday and now here i sit a week later with no chase and not able to get help from a manager nor will they even answer the phone . they might pick it up and you can here them chatting it up but that 's it .	4492
0	this location has poor customer service ! they are rude and will not help you find what you need . due to the remodel tons of things are out of stock even though it says they are in . head to the atlanta or d.c. location instead .	4492
0	very long line with only one check out yesterday . took 20 minutes . but the check out person , `` aunjelis '' was very pleasant and offset an unpleasant experience . great employee !	4492
0	i bought $ 800+ worth of items , started putting it together and realized we were missing stuff . we went online and saw that a essential part was missing . so now i have a half finished bed frame because it was n't posted at the store . i could of dealt with that until i called customer service and they pretty much said it was my fault and that even though the cashier is suppose to check to make sure nothings missing there was nothing they could do for me . if i wanted half finished furniture and rude customer service , i 'll shop at walmart next time .	4492
1	update : they raised prices on all their machines by at least another .25 ! still my favorite place to come if you need a laundromat . staff is very friendly and helpful but every time we come more and more machines are out of service , especially the nice larger machines you can use for blankets , they are now harder to come by . i hope they start fixing their machines and dryers soon .	4493
1	nice laundry mega load is 6 bucks . attendant keeps place clean kids are quiet ( bonus ) they also have drop off for 1 a pound	4493
1	first time here . i find the place clean and comfortable with a friendly staff member to assist a customer . washing machines and dryers worked great . i would continue to visit this location .	4493
0	if you are not hispanic do n't bother to go here . staff was borderline rude to me , while gracious to the hispanic crowd . sorry for being a white guy that had to use a laundromat . machines were plentiful land did a good job . facility was clean .	4493
0	wow . do n't expect much at a laundromat but i will never go here again . i asked why i could n't get a refund for unused money on the card and she told me i do n't have to laundry here if i do n't like it . dont go here	4493
0	we came because of the good reviews and the wifi . no wifi ! and you must use a card and you ca n't get the unused money back . we travel and wo n't see this place again thank goodness .	4493
1	ran into this shop randomly when stopping for some subway . 5 stars because i found a cute denim crop button up for $ 4 & a funky color block clutch for $ 7 & everything in the store was an extra 30 % off ! great vintage button earrings . i didnt have a lot of time to shop but will definitely be back for goodies for my apartment .	4494
1	not at all fancy , but a true thrift store . i thought there were many bargains to be had . store and merchandise smells musty . no big deal . a little fresh air and sunshine or a quick wash is a small accommodation for a good bargain .	4494
1	i do n't know what these negative reviews are on about , because i had a great experience . this place has many quality items and if you look around , you can definitely find a great deal . i got a perfect condition vintage coat with fur lining and some unworn tommy hilfiger shoes altogether for $ 13 . ( always check the soles of thrift shop shoes . ) i 'll be back to treasure hunt !	4494
1	i stumbled upon this gem while visiting some of my friends in sun city . i was having a crappy day and needed some thrifting therapy and this place definitely gave me my fix . their black friday deals were spectacular ( 50 % off everything ) and they had really cool unique pieces . i wish i could have stayed longer and explored more . i got a legit thermos , mexican blanket , earrings , ceramic pots for my herbs all for 13 $ . so happy to have stopped by . check them out especially for their big sales !	4494
0	never been so we stopped in today . big store , lots of stuff . but here goes , the old lady that runs the cash register is super rude and needs some people skills . not very friendly either . the other people who worked amd walked around were super nice to bad , nice store . but once someone is rude to my mother i wont shop their again .	4494
0	prices are outrageous ! it is advertised d they are giving 20 % off excluding some things but u will still pay an unreasonable amount for used dusty items . mostly all of their items are old and dirty . the place smells sooooooo bad .	4494
0	awful place to shop . i was in the store at 3:45 and asked them to turn the lights on in the fitting room so i could try something on . the person working said no because we are closing . i toss the clothes on the counter because i was not going to put them away and i certainly was not going to buy them . i said that is no way to treat your customers then the man working said get out of the store f. b. and do n't never come back . he said some pretty nasty words.j	4494
0	overpriced junk that you could find at any thrift shop . and what 's with writing `` firm '' on nearly every price sticker ? get over yourselves !	4494
1	i was hesitant to go to this new location in the mall because the old location a couple blocks away i could park right outside the door . this really was n't too bad of an arrowhead experience . if you park in the north lot and enter the second level between dillard 's and sears it is right in front of you . i went to get one mothers day card and walked out with four . i always like that i can find a card to fit any occasion at a hallmark store .	4495
1	i really like this shop , it 's nice , cozy and cute . the displays are always fun to look at , especially during halloween and christmas . the items they sell are quality items - a bit pricey , but great selections . not always the friendliest staff , especially as being a younger person , but i have had no problems since stopping by this store at arrowhead for 6 years now .	4495
0	this is the worst hallmark i 've ever been to ... ... stacy you better take note ! i came tonight to use a $ 5 reward on my account and older lady gave me attitude and said it was sent months ago ... ..i told her to look up my account ( she refused ) this is the third time i 've come to this store and been treated like crap ... ... stacy take some lessons from thunderbird hallmark ... .they look up your rewards on their register ! leave the mall stacy ! ! ! ! ! !	4495
0	the cashier has so much attitude when i was just trying to pick up my order follow by hallmark instruction . honestly , if you have a problem with the hallmark website and shipment , please tell your own company and do n't take it out on me .	4495
1	these people are amazingly friendly , helpful and have high integrity . i feel very happy to have found them when i moved back to phoenix and need someone to care for my car .	4496
1	very professional , reliable and reasonable . i feel they are the most honest and trustworthy people and honor their actions . love giving business to my neighborhood of arcadia and appreciate their accommodating me when i need them .	4496
0	i took my prius in to get the codes read to see what problems my battery was having . it took them almost a full day of having my vehicle to tell me that my hybrid battery was bad . then proceeded to tell me the only option was to buy a brand new battery for 3400 after tax . then charged me $ 138 to tell me my battery was bad . i then went to someone else who gladly replaced my battery just shy of 1k and said that my experience with wilhelm was completely unwarranted . paid $ 138 to tell me what we already knew . would not reccomend them .	4496
0	we have taken my vehicle , parents , and daughters vehicle there for many years ( goodyear location ) . they are good for oil changes . however , they then started to say things were wrong and needed repair . one example is the breaks . they were working great and fairly new . after the visit , they supposedly needed repair . the other example is a cv boot , which they stated needed replacement . because we questioned this , we took it to the toyota dealership and was informed that everything was actually fine . with these trends , we have decided to move onto a different dealership .	4496
1	it was a pretty convenient location as we were walking through the market square area . we did n't travel too far into the store , but all looked well like a normal cvs . it was a bit busy when we went in with some pretty strange people lurking at the entrance into the building . all in all though . we found what we needed , allergy medicine , and got out of there without any issues . the cashier was pretty funny too , as he could see that we were both sick of sneezing and needed this medicine we were getting so he took full advantage of cracking some jokes .	4497
1	the suite is clean and well-lit . staff was friendly and helpful . the layout confuses me because of the store 's two entrances , but otherwise , ready to navigate . a pleasant surprise compared to other drug stores i 've frequented .	4497
0	they say work harder ... .i say work smarter ... umm ... its located in downtown pittsburgh you would think it would be bigger ... i personally do n't care which pharmacy i go to ... whatever is convent i would just to go ... but i do prefer the other pharmacy 's around downtown ... .they have a better selection of products compare to this cvs i go to ... . but cvs does have good sales ... came here and i got a two liter soda for less then a dollar ... it 's all personal preference ... .they do n't have a parking lot ... and the area is hard to find parking ...	4497
0	i absolutely hate this cvs . do n't deem yourself a pharmacy and then have the most limited hours on the planet . there are actually individuals who need scripts on sunday after the hour of 2p . additionally the pharmacy staff have always been extremely slow and not very attentive to those coming to drop off/pick up scripts . final complaint is the store overall , all items are significantly marked up compared to target , amazon or any other store . coming here is a waste .	4497
1	i 've used this dollar loan center a few times in a bind , and i can honestly say it was pretty painless . i wished i could have gotten a little more cash but these guys were very easy to work with . in minutes i was approved and i walked out wit cash in about a half hour . it can be very expensive but if you pay off some principal every payment and not just the interest , it 's definitely an option to help people that are in a bind . the girls at this location are very professional but there to help and answer any questions you have !	4498
1	this place is great ! ! ! the store manager kristin is the best ! ! ! great customer service ! ! ! stop by when you need a loan .	4498
0	beware ... .. they quote that they are following state laws and when asked which laws they are unable to provide the information . trying to get in touch with management is impossible ...	4498
0	awful place . customer service is terrible . they always need another document when you go there . just go across the street to check city and they will treat you with care and compassion and help you out in your time of need . could n't encourage people highly enough to stay away from here .	4498
1	amazing ! ! ! clean and pretty ! best service i 've been in las vegas ! everyone are so nice ! and all the design are perfect	4499
1	great place . questionable from the outside as plain ; but once inside , it is perfect . clean , great layout , beautiful employees that do a magnificent job . would definitely recommend and would go back for sure . i got a male pedicure and my wife and friend received mani-pedis .	4499
1	i visited this place a few times for gel polish . trying the pedicure . this salon is so nice and upscale . the polish selection is the largest i 've seen .	4499
1	i wish i took the lady 's name that did my lashes , but i am so in love with them ! ! it was my first time doing lash extensions and i was nervous not knowing how it would turn out , but it looks so amazing ! ! i 'm very happy ! edit : her name was nu	4499
1	miley is awesome ! she shapes my nails perfectly , exactly how i want , m . i 've come a few times now , and my acrylics with gel polish last 3 full weeks without a chip or scratch ! the salon itself is decorated nicely , very modern and clean . they always offer something to drink , which is a very nice touch . overall great experience every time .	4499
1	i have found my new home ! love pop nails ... .its very clean and professional . miley was super sweet and very gentle removing my gel polish and with my manicure and pedicure . i well definitely be returning ...	4499
1	loved this place . is small and cute and hannah was so nice and friendly . we were able to have conversations and she helped me pick a color and seemed genuinely interested ( which not a lot of nail techs do ) . she also educated me on nail shape most efficient for my nails and desires . i made a next appointment immediately after ! ! love my nails ! !	4499
1	perfect place to do your nails and eye brow waxing . there services were exceptional . they used very good products and the place was so clean !	4499
1	i love the atmosphere & the customer service ! hailee did such a wonderful job on my nails & took her time . i love them ! i 'm a happy little lady . ( :	4499
1	finally i found a place 100 % satisfied i wan na going back again ! after i moved to here las vegas .. i tried few nail salon but every place was ummmmm nooooo i wo n't go back ! ! finally i have nothing complain and happy to leave ! i tried many times already ! cheap fast and always their work is great ! this is my go to spot nail salon in las vegas	4499
1	this place is so cute ! and most importantly , super clean . i had my nails and toes done at the same time so that was cool . they have little snacks and drinks for customers in the waiting area . and the two people that did my nails were super sweet . definitely will be back every time i need my nails done !	4499
1	i just love this place ! ! i have had pop lash & nails do my eyelashes a few times and my nails and just love their customer service , the quality of my lashes , and my nails . yesterday i went with my baby girl and she loved her nails and the service ! i give them 10 stars if i could !	4499
1	wife says : new products , great selection of colors , and was able to try a matte top coat versus the classic shiny one ! ask for david . good music playing too ! nice ambiance !	4499
1	this my second visit to this nail salon thanks to groupon . i got miley both visits and she does a fantastic job with my nails every time ! she 's very meticulous and extremely thorough , no shortcuts with her ! when you make an appointment make sure to ask for her .	4499
1	vanessa is a master at acrylic nails . she completely transformed a badly done job i had at a different location and i was soooooo happy with the results . i 'll definitely be going here for my nails time and time again .	4499
1	got my mani and pedi done love it will be back . everyone is so friendly and the atmosphere is pretty . vanessa and erica are great and so is david is so friendly .	4499
1	love this place ! amanda does the best pedicure ! feet feel so wonderful ! just had my first hard gel nails set and love them too ! !	4499
1	just got the prettiest matte black stiletto nails done by mary ! great service , clean salon and a variety of services offered ! i will def be back in the future ! ! thanks pop lash & nails !	4499
1	my niece and i had a great experience at this lovely salon ! the first two things you 'll notice when you walk in is how spotlessly clean it is and how friendly the staff is . my niece and i each had a mani/pedi , and i also got my brows waxed . the staff was efficient and attentive , and we got out in reasonable time without feeling rushed . great place ! highly recommended .	4499
1	staff if sweet , friendly and accommodating . atmosphere is chic and clean . i only gave 4/5 stars because both my aunt and i got pedicures and gel manicures and both of ours started chipping in less than 2 days .	4499
0	this is the worse pedicure i have ever received . the girl who did mine rushed it . she only scrubbed the bottom of my foot and when i asked why she skipped the top she argued she did not and went over it very quickly . my feet are more rough than when i went in .	4499
0	this was by far the worst experience i 've ever had in the nail salon to date the man was unprofessional and pushy . he did n't remove all of the gel and then nipped at my cuticles haphazardly . i had him stop service midway it was that bad what a waste of time and money . i 'm sure that they do lashes very well other than that i 'm going for anything ... if i could give them zero stars i would ! ! !	4499
0	avoid this place . the lady said i had an ingrown toenail and ripped it out . the next day my toe is infected and pussing like crazy . went it to get it looked at and she ripped something out but wasnt an ingrown toenails . this place is unclean . ew . wish i could upload pic .	4499
0	nothing relaxing about my experience , to start the water was cold , the lady doing my manicure was rough and cut me more than once , my nails were filed horribly , like she was in a rush . while the other lady doing my pedicure `` supposedly '' clean and cut my nails . not happy at all .	4499
0	the staff talks shit on other staff right in front of me while getting a pedicure and blab the entire time to eachother . the back area is very smelly as well . i have a rip on my nail past the nail line and all she is going to do is cover it with gel polish and not repair it . have had better service honestly but the gel was painted decently .	4499
0	very limited gel color selection . manicurist hailee had no personality and never even attempted to be friendly . i told her my nails were thin and asked if she could make them a little thicker . she was so stingy with the product as if it are coming out of her paycheck . not a great experience to say the least .	4499
0	so the place is really nice and most of the people are nice . others make the experience not worth it at all . i was told that my groupon promotion , since i had on fake nails- it could be split so i receive my pedicure now and manicure another time- they changed their mind and said they 'd charge me for the manicure and pedicure without the manicure plus the pedicure fill i needed . i felt the least they could have done was fill my nail to compensate for the manicure i am not receiving . the pedicure was decent . not the best nor the worse .	4499
0	got my lashes done less than 5 days ago and it already started falling out . i am disappointed . this was my second time coming here ( first time was excellent ) but sadly my lashes started falling off right away ! i take care of my lashes very well so i did n't understand why it fell off so quickly . the direction of the lashes were all over the place and just was n't happy with the result . it was n't glued on right and my eyes burned too . sorry pop lashes , you have disappointed me and i would n't come back .	4499
0	this place sucks i was coming to try it out because i live close by and when i got in they said they would help me and then i went to the bathroom and the lady said sorry do n't have anybody who can do your nails . she said i do n't have anybody that can take acrylic off but we can do your feet for you . hi said can i just do my nails instead of my feet because those are more important i have some broken and she just said no . i saw some lady that was on her phone also instead of working ! i feel like they were being lazy instead of helping me they lost a good customer .	4499
0	i came in on a groupon deal and i felt rushed to choose my color.. i love for my nails to match my toes as close as possible and the man , who i believe was the owner , was of no help to that . only one person does acrylics so if you do want that service i would recommend an appointment . i got a regular gel manicure and she did a great job , but with feeling rushed and not being able to get acrylics because my appointment did n't specifically say acrylics , i probably wo n't go back . i just feel like if you have your nail license anybody should be able to do that service .	4499
0	the first time i came here they did a great job . owner was nice and brittany did my nails , but when i came back it was a total disaster . the girls who did my pedicure and manicure rushed through and did n't do a good job . i wo n't be coming back anymore .	4499
0	be careful ! a pedicure at this place could result in a nasty infection ! see photo . it looks like a clean place , but when you get nipped and then you get an infection , that means there is questionable sterilization .	4499
0	good location , easy to find , and they got me right in for a pedicure without an appointment . i told my tech that i had ingrown toenail problems and asked her to file instead of cutting . but she cut my big toenails anyway and cut the corners off . she spoke good english , so that was n't an issue . she thought she knew better and insisted it was best to cut them at an angle . it 's now 10 days later and i 'm in excruciating pain because the sharp edge is growing out . i do n't live in lv or i would go back and show her what she did .	4499
0	probably the worst gel mani i have ever gotten . i 'm from out of town and trusted yelp reviews . so i booked an appointment for my daughter and i . bad service and they charge way too much . ca n't wait to get back home and book an appointment with our nail girl . i 'm very disappointed . i would n't recommend this place . i would n't give a bad review if i thought otherwise .	4499
0	i am pretty disappointed with the service i got today at the salon . it was my first time getting a gel mani for a while now and the nail tech ( i think her name is hannah ? she has short hair . ) completely damaged my cuticles . after she used a machine on my cuticles they were bleeding really badly ! i told her about how after i washed my hands they were bleeding and she just brushed it off and said she will put neosporin on it . the gel mani itself came out nice but the pain on my hands right now make me never want to get one again .	4499
0	i emailed this nail shop 3 weeks ago and never got a response . boo . hello 3 weeks ago 10:21 am to popnaillv @ yahoo.com i wanted to find out how much a full set for gel nails would cost , and if you have any open appointments for this afternoon . please advise . thanks , tiffany j	4499
0	not a good place	4499
0	took my nails off and i found fungus on my index finger nail ! i was told it 's because they do n't sterilize their equipment ... .very disappointed	4499
0	update , the set did n't even last a full two weeks and totally changed colors . i had to have another nail shop redo the set about 10 days in .	4499
0	i had an appointment and when i got there , they told me they did n't have me on the books . i was pretty bummed because it 's my birthday week and i wanted my nails done . i ended up going to another place down the street , the salon , and janice did my nails . go there !	4499
1	working with ruby was a total joy . she made my experience in the store a delight after a very bad day and needing to stop for printer ink when stopping was the last thing i wanted to do . friendly and pleasant with a smile . thank you for giving me a break from my hard day !	4500
1	i came to this store to buy a color printer that was advertised for $ 59 . they were out of stock on it so the manager gave me the upgraded version of the printer that sold for $ 89 for the $ 59 price ! plus i got a free label maker ! score ! a+ for customer service !	4500
1	sunday morning and i am in a panic , printed material from fedex/kinkos in so ca where printed but not shipped as promised . got in touch with ryan and not only did he get the job printed but he hand delivered it to the client . i cant state how much service like this is appreciated .	4500
1	ok ... so the next part of my `` packing peanuts '' saga ! after walmart i head over to office depot . i was greeted by a very nice salesman whom i asked about the dreaded packing peanuts ! he knew immediately where they were and lo and behold not only did they have them but they are bio-degradable and came in 2 different sized bags . whew ! my search was over . there was a cashier all set to take care of me and in a flash i was out the door . quite honestly , i did n't even know that office depot was in this shopping center but i 'm sure i 'll be in there again !	4500
0	standing here experiencing horrible customer service . i usually use them to do all my printing in mass and have had awesome success at other locations . this location however is slow , unapologetic , and took over 30 minutes for a small and simple job . not coming back to this location again . learned my lesson ! !	4500
0	staff is not knowledgable and unapologetic . please use better training procedures as i waited 20 minutes for them to figure out a printer situation ( and even tried to help with mo knowledge of the product ) and they were still unable to assist me . thank you .	4500
0	despite the large selection and good prices at this store , i can not go in because of its layout . it is in a circular layout , which always makes me sick and claustrophobic . i always feel dizzy inside and i have to leave every 5 minutes to catch my breath . the bathrooms are also very dirty and its hard to get a parking spot and the lines are always long . there is good customer service , when you can find somebody .	4500
0	the assistant mgr in this place is rude and gives the worst customer service i ever saw . when asked if any specials were going on she said no , but in the flyer on the counter there was a huge discount on printing special . i mean come on shouldnt the stores assistant mgr know about these things ? also she can not handle busy times and gets too stressed and has no patience with people . i had been going here for years and loved everyone there , but i wont be going back now .	4500
1	love this place . good vibe . friendly staff . great music . $ 5.50 pints . will definitely come back !	4501
1	such a cool bar ! great spot to grab a beer while waiting for libretto . staff is super friendly ( the girl with the glasses is cute ) and it was a just really cool . call me a hipster but i call myself one open minded sob !	4501
0	service friday night in one word was 'painful ' . the bartender was incredibly rude and we were so disappointed especially given the reviews saying how great the bartenders are . she actually told me she did n't have time to make me a mojito and i would have to order something else . across the street is a portuguese wine bar which we escaped to . service was exceptional .	4501
0	tap beer was watered down big time . crowd was mostly low class hippy early 20s , space was very small and the staff was rude . there was no live band either , even though i called in advance and they told me there 's a live band that night .	4501
1	this place is fast and clean - using the traditional indian method of threading . for a married man , they know how to manscape the eyebrows in a fashion that preserves the masculine look . my babe really loves my look .	4502
1	super nice , great job , and a short wait ! so excited to have a threading place in the west valley . will definitely be back !	4502
1	great location ! it 's better than driving to the malls in phoenix ! ! the ladies speak to you while you 're getting threaded ( great customer service ) which is better than anywhere else where they just thread you and go about your business . the ladies are super nice and it 's semi private ( you 're not being watched by people waking around in the mall ) . i will definitely come back !	4502
1	walk in today and walk out happy ! ! pleasantly surprised with the friendly service and outstanding results . i was able to walk in without an appointment and paid half the price that i normally pay for the same service in the mall .	4502
1	radha and meena have been doing a great service for me i 've been coming here for two and a half years great job ladies	4502
0	i really like this place because it is clean and neat . however , one of the young employees who works weekends is very harsh with your eyebrows ; she is also kinda rude and not welcoming . she is always on her phone and seems bothered to have customers . everytime she is there , i walk out and come back when there is another employee .	4502
0	my eyebrows were uneven and i had to point it out multiple times until she corrected them . they eventually looked like blocks . i went at night so maybe the lady that was working did n't have much experience . will not return .	4502
0	i was loving my service here , until the youngest woman did them today and left them extremely uneven . i asked for a clean up and she end up taking a chunk off the top of one and the side of the other . make sure to ask for an older experienced threader .	4502
0	the girl was super rough on my skin . it was very painful , she grabbed my hand and pressed it super hard on my eye . she left my eyebrows super irritated . and also she used a dry tissue to pull on my skin horribly .	4502
0	i went back and they refuse service . never did anything to make my experience better . i had waited for over half and hour . i went on a friday and the girl was so rude she was saying bad word to us . very disappointing . do n't make the same mistake i did . do no go there !	4502
1	i 'm so happy i found groomer has it ... i just picked our baby up and he looks stinkin adorable.. he is scared of his own shadow so when he came out and then went right back to the door to check it out , i knew he had fun while getting a handsome haircut ... thank you so much , we will be back and recommending you to all our friends..	4503
1	this is one of the best grooming places i 've taken my dog ... they are so friendly and caring towards my hyper , bratty , sweet german shepherd .	4503
1	so happy with groomer has it services . priced right too ! my two cairn terriers looked great and happy . gave them a call after no return call from top dog grooming place . scheduling was prompt and professional . they call when they say they will . groomer has it came to the rescue . it was meant to be .	4503
1	so cute . so friendly . so fast . so affordable . located very closely to where i live and my dogs love the people . i will continue to come .	4503
1	took my phatboy there to get a nail trim and bath and they did a awesome job . they have excellent customer service and they noticed that my dog was n't to excited ( scared ) about going in the back but they were really good at making him feel okay .	4503
0	absolutely careless , twisting my dogs joints to the point that my dog is crying and yanking on my dogs legs while cutting his nails . now he 's at home limping and we have to give him anti inflammatory medication . if you asked me about this place weeks ago i would 've gave them 5 stars , but after actually watching them with my dog , absolutely not . if you care about your pet at all , take them somewhere else that will be careful with your pet .	4503
0	the last time i took my dog here she had a small cut on her underside and she no longer will let me touch her paws to clip her nails . they had to have done something to petrify her . i wish i would have just groomed her at home .	4503
0	i 've taken my dogs here a few times but the last time i took my dog here ( 06/02/17 ) they severely shaved my dogs paws . and they did not even have the decency to tell me . i discovered it when i got home after my dog kept licking her paws non stop . it 's not the accident that i 'm upset about , it 's the fact they did n't own up to it and apologize .	4503
0	we were excited to learn about this place since it 's close to home . we scheduled an appointment and dropped off our dog . it was cleaner than another groomers we frequently take our dog . when we picked up our dog , we noticed some areas that were n't trimmed ( belly area ) but figured we could do that at home . after an hour , my wife noticed our dog licking his paws . in two areas our dog was cut . one paw was quite red and swollen . i understand this can happen but the groomers should have let us knowing when we picked our dog up . we decided against going back since they are not honest .	4503
0	took my dog here on monday , the time in between her grooming appointment was 7 weeks . i told them repeatedly not to cut off all of my dogs hair . she called me and told me that the legs and ears were a bit matted but i do n't believe that it was anything an experienced groomer could n't handle . i pick my dog up and all of her hair was gone . not only did they not follow directions , but then cutting her hair was nothing but laziness . my dog wo n't be returning . go somewhere else . i 'm sure you can find another reputable groomer that can follow simple directions .	4503
1	i 'm not sure where the bad reviews are coming from . i 've always found the sales people at this best buy to be friendly , professional and helpful . we 've purchased appliances ( washer/dryer ) , printer and a laptop here , in addition to some smaller items . their prices were competitive with anything i found on amazon . in one case , they matched the price on amazon . i 'd rather buy these items in a store since i know that i can bring it back if i am not satisfied .	4504
1	bought a laptop and a speaker to stream bluetooth from my mobile . madison and calvin were amazing words ca n't express how amazing they were . thank you for walking me through everything ! ! !	4504
1	okay best buy has challenges . however , if you 're interested in a big screen tv , see sean in the magnolia section of the store - and no , it 's not a sacred place . sean is humble and gracious and really knows the products . i saved a boatload of money and bought a far better tv thanks to sean . give this guy a raise ! jimi says check it out .	4504
1	my boyfriend and i are contemplating purchasing a magnolia elite tv . since i had never seen one displayed , we drove across town to see it at the best buy off charleston . the tv speaks for itself , however corey , the sales assistant who discussed the tv features with us , was extremely helpful and aided in our decision . it 's nice interface with employees that know the product well enough to compare it against other items . we asked a ton of questions and in the end probably spent 20 minutes with him , and not once did he show any sign of impatience or irritability . thanks for the great service , corey !	4504
1	the employees are the nicest and will help you 100 % . i had the pleasure of meeting olivia and she went way out of her way to help me find a laptop . if you go to this store , please ask for her .	4504
1	i always order online and pick up at this store . never had to wait..always had great customer service .	4504
1	5 stars for calvin . he was more helpful than the initial guy who i spoke to regarding my asus purchase . calvin grabbed it for me and processed my transaction . although i did n't purchase the warranty , he tried his best to sell it . great sales tactics and very informative . i 'm just a determined person who does n't want to spend more than i should . he also left me with the option to come back within 15 days if i change my mind .	4504
1	honestly best buy has moved up in my book in terms service and pricing . their new ceo has taken it in a new direction which has helped bring me back . between the free wifi and their new price matching guarantee that even includes some online stores such as amazon or newegg.com , i find myself coming back to best buy more and more if its something i need and do not want to wait for it to come in the mail . finally best buy has stepped it up to the 21st century and brought people like me who used to use best buy as a showroom back in their store to actually purchase things now .	4504
1	i do most of my best buy purchases at this location because they have always been courteous , never had an issue with returns or exchanges , and price matching has been seamless . the management and staff have been very nice , and go the extra mile .	4504
1	my modem went out twenty minutes before the store closed . matthew walker `` apple mobility master '' helped me and he was amazing . he explained why i needed both a modem and router and exactly how to install them . he sold me what was right for my needs and did not try to up sell me . i was extremely pleased with his service and will request him again next time i go to that best buy . thanks matthew !	4504
1	we were told to visit this location because the other store was out of the headphones we wanted . that store never called to confirm the inventory , so when we got there we were so disappointed that the store did n't have them either : / we asked heather for help and she was great ! found us headphones for a great deal , and helped us checkout without waiting in line ! hurray ! we were very happy : ) thanks heather !	4504
1	always a positive experience , great customer service . address my conccerns .	4504
1	i have been to this store several times and the service keeps getting better . it seems that they are reading these reviews and trying to improve . on my most recent visit , i was greeted promptly by an associate by the name of matthew . he was very knowledgeable and recommended the perfect home security video system for me . it worked exactly as he described and i am very thankful to bestbuy for employing such a helpful person .	4504
1	love this store , very helpful and friendly staff . they will match internet pieces which is great and the best buy credit card give tons of interest free offers	4504
1	love the store , great salespersons . just purchased a 65 '' sharp 4k tv . the price was great . did a lot of research . open boxes mean returned for one reason or another . samsung has a lot of open box sales . sharp had none . do your research .	4504
1	i just want to say we had a wonderful experience at this best buy yesterday . we were really in a pickle and we needed a phone . your employee kevin did everything possible to help make sure we were able to get a phone . he called the right people to help us push through the process as quick as possible . with no hassle at all . we really appreciate it !	4504
1	this review is in regards to ms delores from the home appliances department . she provided top notch service and we feel like she is the only one who cares ! we ordered our lg washer and dryer and wine chiller . nothing was smooth , both washer and dryer were backordered for 6 months , chiller was defeated . delores upgraded the washer and dryer for us with a small cost , and we got both of them in a week . and she did a good job on following up the new chiller and made sure the second one was perfect for us . 10 stars to her if possible !	4504
1	stopped by to check out some items in the electronics . the girl sales associate was very helpful and knowledgeable . they have a great selection of items your looking for and the staff is always so helpful . i would go back when i am ready to buy .	4504
1	mark is amazing ! he is nice and funny and gives great costumer service ! ! he should be employee of the year !	4504
1	purchased a refrigerator . the salesperson was knowledgeable and helpful regarding the product and arranging delivery . the excellent customer service shifted me away from buying the fridge at the same price from a competitor . the delivery people were also excellent . they were courteous and helpful , and effectively overcame a few obstacles to get the job done .	4504
1	go there sort of late and pretty close to closing time however the staff were are friendly and willing to help with any questions i shot their way . quite an assortment of different items and was really amazed to see they are selling vinyl album 's .	4504
1	it 's a standard best buy store but recently re-modeled : - staff is always friendly and helpful when i had questions . - lots of floor samples ( tablets , cameras ) for hands-on tryouts . - i 've ordered online for store pick up and never had a problem . when i see a deal in the weekly circular and come in for it they have the item in stock . - it 's next to a office superstore , lowes , nearby costco , etc so easy to get all my shopping errands done in the same vicinity .	4504
1	another good shopping experience with knowledgeable sales associate who helped us make the correct purchase for out needs .	4504
1	i recently moved to the summerlin area and decided to replace my kitchen appliances . after visiting a number of stores , i went to best buy 's pacific sales kitchen & home . i was greeted by keith edwards who then proceeded to insure i selected the appliances that best suited my needs . he helped work out a package price that allowed me to get the best price for some really high end appliances . the subsequent delivery and set up went very smooth and we are very happy with our new kitchen . if you are looking for appliances , i highly recommend that you visit best buy and ask for keith edwards . you will be happy you did ,	4504
1	i was helped at this location by alfredo . i got my first smart phone somewhere else and needed ear buds and phone case . he could n't have been kinder to me . what a great young man .	4504
1	bby has always been a place i 've frequented over the years . it also was the first place of employment for me . that being said i try to review every place unbiassed . although , i never worked at this summerlin/charleston location i love it ! it is by far the nicest in layout and product assortment . this location also has a great staff , and is located off the 215 across from red rock station . the shopping center is beautiful , parking is easy and spacious . costco and lowe 's share the shopping centre for your other home furnishings or from competitive price matching . overall , probably the `` best '' best buy in town haha .	4504
1	this is my third time buying appliances there . i have to say it was a pleasant experience . the staff in the appliance department is great unlike the rest of the store they actually know what they are doing . i been to both locations summerlin and the store off of rainbow . great group of sales people . i had a problem with a part on my range and they sorted it out quickly . i will be needing a refrigerator next month i will go there over any other store ! ! ! good job	4504
1	i stopped in to check out the prices on some televisions . they have a lot to choose from , but the prices are better at costco . they have decent prices on kitchen appliances . i think i will go with costco .	4504
1	went to best buy to get an iphone 6 case and screen protector . as i was looking around , chris a sales manager stepped in to help . he is very knowledgeable in his products . he even took the time to look and see if he could price match the glass screen protector from zagg so i would n't have to pay so much . he also found a cheaper price for the case i wanted . me , my mom and cousin were in awe that he took the time out to really help us . what great customer service we had . if you need anything i strongly recommend you find him , he 's fantastic and such a nice guy .	4504
1	this is for terrence from the auto audio dept . he is the man and very educated on the stuff he does helpful and patience . on the other hand the 1st guy that helped me did n't have a clue the way he was acting good thing he referred to terrence which is a good thing . i set up an apt for getting my car audio hooked up for tomorrow so we shall see what happens after . i will be writing another post after service is done and see if i am completely satisfied .	4504
1	david was very knowledgeable about the apple products -more knowledge than apple employees are on their good day . he made a simple transaction meaningful and memorable . great sales experience as well as attentive . well worth the drive !	4504
1	hands down my favorite best buy store in the vegas area in all aspects ! ! kurt , justin , and kyle are awesome ! ! ! !	4504
1	it 's a best buy in a pretty good location so it 's nice here however i did have to look for assistance in the small appliances department of the store . i associate i did find was very helpful but was obviously not stationed in that department of the store . the cashier was very friendly as well .	4504
1	i 've been to this store several times now , and so far my experience there has been great ! anyways , there is one individual who deserves special attention , and his name is derek lee . i went into the store for the first time , many months ago , looking to purchase a computer , and derek was extremely helpful . i returned months later and again was fortunate enough to have him help me with my decision to finally purchase a computer . i mean , he really went out of his way to get me the best deal possible , and i truly feel fortunate that he was there to help me . thanks my friend ! god bless !	4504
0	honestly , it is a hit or miss with great service at this location . couple of months back , i received great service with employees wanting to give me service ( they all asked if i needed help or being helped ) . however tonight was the worst night at best buy because of one rude employee . at the check out she was talking to another employee making inside jokes when i wanted to ask her questions . when we did ask her questions she showed impatience and responded with not so kind attitude .	4504
0	went to bestbuy today to buy either the new apple bluetooth air pods or beats wireless headphones . not one person in the store could ask if i needed help . even walking into the store the greeter did n't say a word to me . this is n't the first time i 've walked out of this bestbuy with no one helping me . when your employees even make eye contact with me and do n't ask if i need help is poor in customer service .	4504
0	bought a tv and sound bar a few weeks before black friday because the salesman told me they would n't have any good sales for black friday this year . when i went on black friday i noticed great sales . returned my items the next week and went to target .	4504
0	the employees were nice but had an extremely hard time scheduling delivery of 2 items . we went in knowing exactly what we wanted , and it took an hour and a half for them to get everything set up correctly . training is definitely lacking ! then 3 days later we got an email from bb that they ca n't deliver the tv when they said they would and changed the delivery date to when we ca n't be home . i spent another hour getting the run-around on the phone from corporate before i went to rc willey and got a tv with delivery done in 20 min on the date i wanted . very disappointed in our best buy experience ... ... ... .	4504
0	i went there looking for a gps system . they are under lock and key . it 's not like you can pick up a package and head to the checkout . you must have a salesperson 's help and there was n't a salesperson anywhere to be found . i went to the front and asked for help . i waited 10 minutes and then decided they did n't want/need my business . i will not return to their store .	4504
0	by far the worst best buy in vegas . terrible customer service . went in there twice in a week to buy a camera . no one approached us once- first time in there i had to search for an employee to assist us in buying the camera . then when we asked about the best camera to use for vlogging she had no idea what it was . lol every time i go in there i 'm constantly disappointed with the disengaged and bored employees . i will drive an extra 20 minutes just to go to a best buy with 10x better customer service .	4504
0	paid $ 320 for a surge ifit watch . its not working properly and i have been on the phone for more than an hour on two occasions and nobody ans we rs thd phone at the store . horrible customer service .	4504
0	needed assistance on purchasing a new laptop . could n't even get the b*tch @ ss of an associate to come help . she was aimlessly walking around and blatantly walked the other way when i asked for help . i walked out and they lost out on $ 2,200 in sales . called to speak with a manager about my experience and was told that if i want to come back he 'll help me . honestly he could have cared less and did n't want to waste two seconds to apologize and try to understand which employee is ruining they 're business . definitely taking my business elsewhere to a place that appreciates my hard earned money and you should too .	4504
0	had a 55 '' tv delivered for a early christmas present . the salesperson said that the people delivering would remove it out of the box to confirm it was delivered in good shape . it was delivered 2hrs pasted the delivery window and noticed that the box was damaged a little . when i asked them if they were going to unpack it they said no , that they only deliver and left quickly . i unpacked it today to discover that the screen is cracked . i been on my cell phone for over an hour now trying to reach customer service ! not at all a happy christmas camper ! ! !	4504
0	horrible customer service . we 've been here twice in the home theater department . they never have anyone who can help . seriously understaffed ! i will not be coming back to this one .	4504
0	the only reason i 'm giving any stars is because the location is so close to my house.. the times i 've gone here for either video games , computer shit or simply a damn fan i 've had to try and find products on my own . guest service is rite down the toilet . i 'll drive the extra miles if i need to go to best buy , i 'll find another store to shop at or just stop going to best buy all together	4504
0	just bought a movie this morning around 1115am from an elderly cashier lady . she was the only one working and was rude . she needs an attitude adjustment . never will come back . i will tell all my friends to not go to that best buy . would give zero stars if given the chance .	4504
0	i ca n't believe the inconsistency between local stores . rainbow no problem . this location , what a joke . obviously customer service is n't on the top of the list . assistant manager and store managers just do n't care and do n't honor their word . and to get different prices for the phone i was turning in , really ! $ 100 difference . i will never shop there again !	4504
0	i 'm not a big fan of best buy to begin with , but this one seemed worse than usual . best buy typically has a pretty sorry selection , and inflated prices , and this location had both in spades . most of their inventory was cheaply made consumer gear , with nothing high end for those of us that can actually tell the difference in our electronics . the only reason they got the second star was because of their staff . i talked to 3 different people , and they were all very courteous and polite . at least they have that going for them .	4504
0	i was looking for a keyboard when the power went out . all customers were rounded up like cattle and we were all immediately treated as potential thieves . yuck . no thanks guys . maybe come up with a better plan when outages happen instead of alienating your customers . i watched them kick people out and block the entrances . like , really ? there 's got ta be a better way to handle situations like this . never coming back to this location	4504
0	what horrible customer service . we came here to buy two sets of noise canceling headphones for our thailand trip . not only did we receive little assistance but we were approached by these in home stereo system sales people who were pushy and rude . we left to visit another location . bad service for a best buy - disappointed .	4504
0	went in today to buy a large screen curve tv . went to the tv section of the store and waited 15 minutes while employees walked past me into the stock room . finally one advised me the two who should be in the dept are busy and will come as soon as their finished . 20 minutes later still no one approached me and numerous employees walking back and forth right past me into the stock room . it is good that they prioritize their stock room responsibilities over customer service because as far as i am concerned all they will have in the end is stock and not customers . worst retail experience ever . low energy employees .	4504
0	bought a car stereo and installation package . been calling the store for days now , they do n't answer . doesnt matter what extension . tried calling n rainbow store , same thing . tried online chat , nothing . tried 888 # and got transferred to their insurance company - what a total waste of time . i will not buy from here anymore unless i have no other choice . do n't expect any customer service if you go here .	4504
0	every time i come here , i know exactly what i need to get and i always check online if it 's in stock so i do n't waste my time or theirs . but once i get here , there 's no one to be found ! ! nobody asks if i need help and i search around but they either say they 're busy & they 'll 'call ' someone for me but never do . super annoying , especially when i 'm ready to buy and need to be in & out .	4504
0	possibly the best selection of products when it comes to a best buy . unfortunately , nothing can make up for employees who say one thing and do another .	4504
0	very high prices , you can find prices 10 - 30 % less online with free shipping and zero sales tax ! i can not understand why anyone buys at these high price retailers unless they want to give away their money and charity would be a better cause helping homeless animals ! wayne gorsek	4504
0	worse store to buy appliances from , when you need them repaired under warranty , managers or associates are not available.. do n't buy from this store	4504
0	i wish i could rate this store even lower than a one star . do not give them your personal information unless you 're ok with their employees trying to text you after you leave asking you out . not ok that your employees can just access anyones information at any time . even after i have told this person to lose my number and that i am not interested , he continues to text me . thank you so much best buy for the lack of privacy ! i will never shop at any of your stores again !	4504
0	i went in this past weekend and sales person tried to sell me a wireless speaker system by bose for my ipad3 that was $ 299.00 dollars , but quickly became disinterested in me when i questioned the cost . i did find a cheaper wireless speaker system for 59.00 that works great though . also bought a targus cover for my ipad thats the bomb ! !	4504
0	wow - totally awful customer service , which seems occur regularly at this store . was n't in looking for a tablet with my 11 year old . waited 15 minutes for a sales associate - none to be found . there were 2 horsing around at the security desk - but did n't want to break up their fun . waited in line for geek squad oy to be told that a tablet was the responsibility if the mobile dept - naturally they were too busy to assist . we were all set to spend $ 500 .	4504
0	went in to buy a new tv walked around and no one said a word to me . groups of employees all over the store just talking to each other , ca n't even say hello . i get it i do n't look like i 'm gon na spend 2k on a tv well i did . keep having poor customer service and end up out of business cause people will just go to amazon . i wo n't be back to this best buy again .	4504
0	we will never purchase from best buy pacific sales ever again ! ! ! ! the worst customer service we have ever encountered . once they sell you a product they do n't answer or return calls or even pretend to help . never again no matter what savings they offer ! ! ! ! ! !	4504
0	seriously this store is ridiculous ! they have an entire endcap dedicated to sony cameras that are not even available in the store ... . they offered to order it for me and these cameras are n't even available to order ? ? ? why would you have a display then ?	4504
0	i do n't usually like to leave bad reviews ... .but in this case , i must warn others that this store has the worse customer service in town ... ..their return policy sucks ... .talked to their gm , kurt , he 's an idiot and do n't waste your time talking to him ... .just dispute it with your credit card company ... .this should have been a negative star review but unfortunately you ca n't 'cause there 's no option for it .	4504
0	employees need to have training for how customer satisfaction relates to their employment . it 's just that simple .	4504
0	lazy ass employees . came here to buy a game . it says on the website it has multiples in stock . but the customer service just made up excuses . too lazy to look for it . worst best buy in town .	4504
0	i bought a new imac online and they automatically add kaspersky protection unless you remove it from the order . i saw the remove button just as i was pressing the complete purchase button . they would not refund that portion because it 's software . i called customer support and a supervisor there would not issue a refund . policy is policy . so they 're losing my business over a little thing . i have two words for best buy -- -- apple store .	4504
0	completely some of the worst customer service i 've ever experienced . review coming soon !	4504
0	tried to give this best buy another chance but ran into a very consistent lack of customer service . witnessed several others very frustrated with the lack of help ! the merchandise stocking is also very poor . out of many items . i will continue to buy all electronics at amazon .	4504
1	impressed how conscientious the techs are and that the process is totally green and safe ! their process extends the life of the carpet and restores the look to good as new !	4505
1	mike and tim arrived on time . i was worried they would not be able to get out the stains from my little rescue dog , but lo and behold all the stains and heavy traffic areas looked great and the carpet overall looked as good as the day it was installed . and the carpet is dry in 2-3 hours ! i was very impressed with their courteousness and professionalism . will definitely call them again !	4505
0	i have had a musty smell in my house ever since the `` cleaning '' 5 days ago . the carpets did n't clean up as well as the times i have had others come out . the tech was very nice however , he tracked muddy print across most of my tile floors and did n't ' clean up after himself . he also put his dirty chemical tank into my clean kitchen sink to fill up on water before the `` cleaning . '' i have a utility sink i would have been happy to have him used had he asked me .	4505
0	the tech guy who came was actually very pleasant and nice . however , the carpet did not come out very clean even though it was n't very dirty to begin with . ( reviewed for my dad )	4505
1	i 've used this location several times for printing and shipping needs . the staff has always been attentive and helpful . the self-print set-up is convenient and cost effective , even though the software is a little clunky to use if you 're printing a few different documents .	4506
1	by far the best service at any fedex i have been to . the people were very kind and helpful ! its the best place to go in ballantyne !	4506
1	we have always had great experiences with fedex . as a small business , it is helpful to have someone who is willing to answer your questions and help you as quickly and efficiently as possible . shout out the the assistant store manager - julian ( i think that was his name , or julius ! ) - he went above and beyond for us when the copier broke ! ! great customer service ! !	4506
0	do yourself a favor and go to another kinkos location . this one is the absolute worst i 've ever encountered across the country . slow is an understatement . they are under staffed and they do n't care at all . i waited 25 minutes for 5 pages of black and white text to print . five pages . there was literally not one person in there when i walked in . in that moment , they were over staffed and still didnt care . at all . consider yourself warned .	4506
0	fed ex driver ran over my mailbox and destroyed it in the beginning of the summer . hit and run . i had to replace it $ 115 . all summer filling out insurance forms and getting the run around . not paid back . immoral driver . rotten rotten rotten company .	4506
0	hideous service . snarky staff . seniors and baby boomers scorned . seriously understaffed . particularly in the printer copier department . the time is ripe for fed ex to get hit with an ageism suit .	4506
1	five stars for the super efficient will call and entry lines ! ! nothing beats walking right into an event that you are super stoked about ! i went in 2009 on the saturday and it was a bit too crowded for my liking , but could have been worse ( being outside really cuts down on the claustrophobia and annoying pushy people ) . this past year i went on the friday , and it was perfect . i loved partying as the sun was going down and having room to roam around . the lights and art installations are top-notch , and the music is always gon na be great .	4507
1	it 's crazy how edc has grown since my first time attending in 2010 . i can honestly say its such an amazing experience reason why ive gone every year . though everyone wishes it would come back to la but having it in vegas just gives it more of an adventure . see you guys there this year !	4507
0	saw a girl convulsing and foaming at the mouth on the floor before even entering the gates.. not good for kids indeed .	4507
0	they should limit # tickets to be sold and have id 's shown at the door	4507
1	received a call-back from leona tonight . could n't be nicer . this was customer service on steroids . she found my shoes and also gave me great info on waiting lists for others . leona deserves a 5 star review in my world . thanks much leona !	4508
1	thank you for taking your time and helping me find the shoe that fits me . i ca n't wait to wear them	4508
1	such a late review ! but i stopped by this louboutin store after stopping by the one in caesars palace ( they had terrible ! customer service ) . as soon as i walked in to this store i was greeted and asked if i needed help . i knew which pair i wanted already but they did n't have my size =/ . i wish i remembered my sales womans name she was a sweetheart she helped me decided my next choice and ended up walking out with my first pair of christian louboutins ! it was a great way to end my experience in vegas . i 'll be coming back again to this one for my next pair !	4508
1	oh louby i love you ; ) i usually purchase my cls from the cl boutique in downtown miami or online from http : //us.christianlouboutin.com/us_en but while at the palazzo for a modeling event i felt the need to peek in ... and of course walked out with a fabulous pair of shoes . the staff is very helpful and the store is clean . it 's not as large as the cl boutique in miami but a nice alternative for vegas . i will upload some pics . long heels + red bottoms = love affair with cl	4508
1	what a great shopping experience while buying my very first pair of louboutin 's ! not intimidating at all as some of these stores can be . i was in the christian louboutin boutique in paris this past summer where no once made eye contact or offered any help . i came in thinking i knew what i wanted and left with something even better ! the saleswoman and the manager were both so helpful in explaining the construction , fit and materials that i left with a lot of info for my next pair : )	4508
1	nice location- the sales associate was very friendly . it 's a busy location- noise level medium my one complaint- they do not carry a lot of men 's shoes .	4508
1	this store is truly a hidden gem . after getting beyond brutal service at the forum shop in caesar 's i found this store . even though its smaller than the forum store , the selection was better , the sizing was better and service was hands down second to none . the forum employees could take some pointers from these guys . i will definitely be making this my store of choice on my next visit . i ca n't rave enough about how great their staff are and most importantly i left with my first pair of louboutins .	4508
1	worth every penny ! i love tall heels but alas , i have back problems that prevent me from wearing anything higher than 2.5 '' without enduring some serious pain . enter christian louboutin . i do n't know how they do it , but these are the most comfortable 3 inchers i have ever worn in my life . i wore my brand new pair out to dinner and a nightclub . seven hours later i had no blisters and even more miraculously , my back did n't hurt . i 'm telling you - they 're magic shoes . oh yeah , and they look fabulously sexy , too .	4508
1	naturally beautiful shoes , helpful service from all employees working there as i strut on the red carpet . i was flip flopping and settled on these babies.. pigalle follies red ombre ... # inlove	4508
1	shoes are hot , hot , hot . the red lacquers of the boutique ooze sexiness . when you purchase an item you get a spin on the louboutin wheel , the prize is an artsy book , an ode to louboutin 's gorgeous footwear , but not to viewed by a child 's eyes .	4508
1	if you walk out with a bag , you know somebody is in a good mood . i think i only find myself in establishments like this while in vegas . the service was as you 'd expect it to be in a place like this .	4508
1	awesome customer service . all sales reps are very knowledgeable and knew what was in stock without checking . i ended up buying the alti spike pumps . only complaint is that they were out of size 37 in most styles .	4508
1	i bought my first pair of cl in this location the sale in this store was very nice . i checked my receipt and her name was kxxxx . she offered me to try on any one in the store that i like . once i found a style that i like , although size 8 was out . she was able to find me another pair i also loved . if i ever go back to vegas , i sure will stop by this store again . hopefully i also have $ $ to get more thanks	4508
0	go to another louboutin store . the sales lady here is very judgemental and i honestly never received such horrible service . i 'm used to sales reps from cl to be super helpful , courteous and patient . i mean i 'm about to spend a couple thousand dollars . i know i walked in with a jersey and some jeans , but never judge a book by its cover . wish i got her name that way i can put it here , but she is n't worth my time . i went to crystals to buy me shoes . go there ! the sales ladies are much much nicer ! !	4508
0	been at this location a few times to make purchases and this last time was n't that great . did n't get a greeting , no smile like before . guess they have new staff . had to ask for help and when i made my purchase barely got a thank you . guess i 'll try the other locations around town .	4508
0	i love the shoes ! i hated the store in the palazzo . since i was staying at the hotel , i went back twice to give the salespeople a chance , first time late at night and the second during early afternoon . i was never greeted by both shifts , not once . and both times i was wearing my very prive . i 'm never giving this store the commission they will make and rather shop at high end retail stores like nordstrom , saks , or neiman or directly at the louboutin at southcoast plaza in california .	4508
0	my fiancé and i went into the store this past sunday around 4 in the afternoon and the girl with the copper hair treated us like crap ! she was being very rude and was of no help . we were looking to buy heels for my fiancé for our wedding but she made it seem like we did n't even belong in the store . we will definitely not be spending any money at this location whenever we are in vegas . please hire associates that have better customer service skills	4508
0	i waited ... .waited ... waited for a sales person to help me . but it seems all the better dressed peeps were getting all the sales people 's attention . which is cool i guess i do the same thing . but sometimes the chick in a tank and jeans likes to buy mucho loubs . so instead of a $ 800 sale for them i just left..f it , i 'll get my red soles somewhere else .	4508
0	christian , if it was n't for sex and the city and celebrities wearing your red soled shoes no one would know who you are . designer shoes are meant to be flawless products you blow money on , but christian louboutins are poorly made with taped/glued on soles instead of stiched soles . i noticed half of the displays at this location had soles that were sorta coming off on the edges . not ok if you 're about to spend 800+ dollars on a pair of shoes . i 'd go with miu miu , lanvin , ysl , any other brand that puts quality in your money any day .	4508
0	being high quality store like they claim to be , their costumer service sucks . my wife purchased a shoe here and after 10 hours did not like and saw diffident brand that she wanted . we came here for her to return it , but no they said it 's exchange only no returns . the casher or the frickin sales person said we did say it 's only exchange and no return but you know for a fact they never mentioned anything like that .	4508
0	sales associates are not very friendly . they are a tad standoffish . the shoes however are beautiful . it 's like a museum of fabulousness . one day i will gather my pennies from teaching spin classes and get a pair ! cheers !	4508
0	please do not shop at this store ! ! ! the sales lady ( wish i had the presence of mind to asked for her name ) was so rude , condescending and has no customer service etiquette . go to the forum shops by caesars palace , they treat you like human being there and goes above and beyond catering to your request of finding the perfect size and style shoes you want .	4508
0	so i finally wore the prive shoe ( nude ) and boy was it uncomfortable . truly wearing it for like 5 minutes or so it totally numbed my feet then it started to hurt . i decided to give it another chance ( ca n't waste ) and it felt a little bit better . however , i do n't recommend wearing it for hours . i do n't know how the celebrities does it , guess there 's a price to looking good . boy for a shoe that cost almost $ 900 , not so worth it especially when your feet is blistering ! ! ! uniqueness : 5 stars sexy : 5 stars comfort : 1 star i choose comfort any day !	4508
0	um ... . i was scolded by the bouncer here for trying to take a cell phone picture of my wife in front of a wall of shoes .	4508
0	ok i walked in here expecting the shelves and floor to be glamorous looking , but ehhhh it was n't at all like that ! it was n't the most fabulous store i 've been to and the shoes were okay looking . there are two little separate mini shoe room displays here and i do n't get it . there were a few cute shoes on display at the window , but the customer service was horrible , not that they were busy , they never even said hi , wtf what if i wanted to buy 700 shoes sheeeesshhh acknowledgment would be effing nice man !	4508
0	my mother bought some black patent bianca pumps for my birthday dinner here . sales girls were rude and not very knowledgable about heel styles . they could n't even answer basic questions about release dates and materials . go to caesars palace louboutin boutique instead ! she loves her shoes btw !	4508
1	i had a fantastic experience from valleywide . they were able to come to my home within a few days of my call , worked quickly , and achieved a better results than i had anticipated . i have a heavy , three-section , commercial sliding door at my home . it has been so difficult and frustrating trying to find someone who could work on it so all sections open . what a relief to have had such an excellent outcome and really fast and friendly service . i would highly recommend valleywide .	4509
1	i just had two sliding doors installed into my home the company was very professional they showed up on the time they said they would . the doors work fantastic i even had a doggie door put into it . i would highly recommend this company !	4509
1	i had a sliding glass door that i thought needed to be replaced and was also looking for an automatic sliding door closer . i had quotes to replace door plus closer that was going to cost over $ 2000 . i spoke with tony over the phone and he told me what he could do and estimated cost . they came in and did an excellent job repairing the door and installing a high quality closer and saved me over a $ 1500 .	4509
0	initially they came out and did the repair as needed for 250+ dollars . said i had a 2 year warranty . however , after door stopped rolling again we contacted and no one very returned our call , contacted a 2nd time , and then waited all summer with a broken door . finally got another company to come and fix for us .	4509
0	do not use this company ! they took my deposit & have not been in touch in over 3 weeks . none of my messages have been returned .	4509
0	called 4-9-18 for a ball park quote and spoke to a woman . called 4-10-18 and all phones are disconnected or not working . went out of business ? glad i did n't hire them .	4509
1	this location is conveniently located in the target center on the south end and has a drive thru but the parking lot is small .	4510
1	this location rocks ! ! ! everyone is always in good spirits which helps me when i need a lil pick me up ! they 're the sweetest & do an excellent job at making the best drinks with that extra special sparkle going the extra mile to be sure it 's perfection & know you 're happy ! really great service & just the same in regards to friendliness ! ! they 're always awesome ! it feels like they 're all part of my family : )	4510
1	this location has such friendly and professional staff . i even watched one employee remake a drink for a customer with a smile . it was a very pleasant experience here .	4510
1	hmmm ... me and my kiddos really like this starbucks . generally , not too busy and the staff is always super friendly .	4510
1	trenta cool lime with no limes is my everyday favorite . never gets old . the drive thru is one of the fastest in town , just not today . lol .	4510
1	i do n't always visit starbucks , but when i do ... this is my favorite starbucks to come to ; my sister 's as well . fast , very friendly and never an order screw up . always willing to make suggestions on something new and if you do n't like it , they get you something else .	4510
1	laura rocks ! ! she handles customer orders incredibly well especially during big rushes . she does n't get flustered !	4510
1	i love that it 's drive through so i can quickly grab it and go . everyone is very nice here and has n't messed up my drink yet haha	4510
1	love this starbucks ! little tight in the parking lot area and drive thru but ive never had a bad experience . staff is super friendly and always smiling . im really surprised at the negative reviews .	4510
1	always friendly and fast ! love that i can order ahead and just pick up my coffee ! sad they raised prices but promotions help !	4510
1	i got my drink quickly and it was made just as i asked ! the location is clean & spacious , good place to get my work done !	4510
1	reviewing the drive through only at this location . it 's a drive thru . it 's fast and accurate . enough said .	4510
1	stopped in the drive thru this morning on my way to walk some rescue dogs . i went through the drive thru and had the most pleasant encounter with a girl who had short hair and the spunkiest personality . i pulled up and the first thing she says is `` hey , nice car ! ! i have one in black ! '' to which we started talking about hyundais and how sad i was that i had just gotten damage on my car . i love this place , and will definitely stop in every time i 'm down there .	4510
1	love the outdoor seating . very convenient to shops and communities . dog friendly and very customer based .	4510
1	avoid busy hours , staff were pleasant and accommodating . service was quick and latte was great . will be back but will avoid busy times of the day .	4510
1	i use the drive thru at least 3x a week . usually very good at getting my drinks correct . anytime they mess up , they always give me a free drink coupon . i appreciate this , as many of the other locations just give you the stink eye and make you feel like you ordered your drink wrong . you know , the same drink that you 've been ordering for the last ten years every single day !	4510
1	wow ! so surprised by so many negative reviews . i almost exclusively mobile order . i just swoop in , my order is always ready and consistently tasty . the staff always appears to stay calm at an obviously busy location . the volume of customers continues to increase and it is time for a larger store .	4510
0	this location is very inconsistent with their drinks and today was the second time my mobile order was lost . i 'm better off going inside target or fry 's to get what i really want .	4510
0	when this location first opened they had an excellent crew who could really make excellent drinks . recently , they have a lot of new people who do n't seemed to be trained very well . their mocha fraps taste burnt because they are made incorrectly most of the time . when you bring your own cup they do n't give you the cup discount 50 percent of the time . pretty sad for how expensive their drinks are .	4510
0	the slowest drive thru ever ! ! ! ! so frustrating . i have a baby and it is not convenient for me to go inside . i thought the drive thru would be easier , but every time it takes 10-20 minutes . that is ridiculous . i am giving up on starbuck 's all together .	4510
0	horrible management ; rude and just make up excuses why they ca n't do something . it is 110 degrees here , so we asked for a 2 pack of brownies from the freezer . there were no brownies in the case . the rude manager says that she ca n't sell me any brownies today because she wo n't have enough for the next day . that is so stupid . how about ordering more stock . i will no longer waste money at starbucks or buy my ground coffee there . that is $ 100 spent else where	4510
0	this girl sasha here never provides customer service , she always seems annoyed and bothered that your there ! rude !	4510
0	i went to starbucks @ 6:02:26 pm reg 4 drive thru , i ordered a serious strawberry and plain croissant . the serious strawberry was the worst ! all i got was iced milk with whip cream with not even 1 drop of strawberry . i ordered a tall . i should have turned around and took it back it was that bad . i paid 4.25 for iced milk , could 've done that at home . wo n't be back there again . i agree with the other critical yelps , this is in a bad place with no room to park . this is the first bad yelp i have written in a while .	4510
0	i wish i could give no stars . i 've been to this starbucks numerous times over the last couple years and every time i try and run through the drive thru it takes 15+ minutes . and while at the window the employees are messing around inside or laughing/chatting with each other while the drive thru line is 12 cars deep . they also routinely screw up my order . i 'm not difficult i just ca n't have dairy as i 'm nursing and my son is allergic . i always end up driving over to target in the same parking lot , to go get a starbucks in store	4510
0	went in to get drinks with my friend and this absolutely rude employee named trisha or something amongst that name was very unpleasant . i go into a different starbucks all the time and it 's always such a pleasant visit . completely opposite with this location , very disappointed in the rudeness of this employee and disappointed customer service when she handed out the drinks with an attitude and practically threw them , we were upset . when we got our drinks they were n't to their full potential . very disappointed , will never go back to that location .	4510
0	i go to this location all the time only due to convenience . i always order some sort of iced coffee and 9 times out of 10 its a sloppy mess that is running down my hand and car . i do n't understand how they even pass the drink out to me in the drive thru when they see that it is clearly not wiped down on the sides . i was hesitant to write a post since i go here often but i 'm pretty much over how careless these employees are and how much i pay for sloppy coffee messes .	4510
0	i frequent this location at least five times a week and there are others i strictly avoid ... this one used to be my favorite , very consistent however they have changed , drinks with no foam , have foam , the level of the coffee is much below the brim ... i understand you 'll tell me you have regulations but you 're paying five dollars for three pennies worth of coffee . service has lacked as well as quality	4510
0	wow been in lime for over 10 minutes . i think there should be a wait limit and once it exceeds over 10 minutes drinks are on starbucks .	4510
0	i 'm posting this because i know starbucks wo n't suffer as a company from negative reviews ... . but this location is extremely frustrating . it 's convenient with a prime location but the employees do n't really care about that ( i 'm just guessing ) . long wait time inside and out , no matter how busy . and you rarely receive genuine positivity from the employees .	4510
0	worst service i have ever recieved . i go to this starbucks a lot because it 's on my way to work and everytime i regret it . the service is slow , even when i 'm the only person in the drive thru . it take them forever to even greet me , and the coffee is n't that great either	4510
0	so annoying i pay 3 dollars for coffee and they ca n't even fill it up to the top ! looks half way full ... .	4510
0	what 's the point in having phone order when its never ready ? ? ? im sure the point of starting something like this is for people that are extremely busy like me . not only was i late i paid for a drink i did n't even get ! ! ! ! do n't order ahead at this location unless you give them 30 minutes in advance .	4510
0	i am never greeted when i go in . i always feel as if i am bothering them . i now only go to starbucks once a month because of this location . i used to go 4 times a week . so thanks for being so rude , you are saving me money .	4510
0	attitude . thanks for dramatically shaking up my layered drink . you obviously resent your job and customers .	4510
1	really great place . went there on the advice of a friend , and now i 'm a bit obsessed with ron himself . such a character , and i mean that in the best sense of the word . he does great work , and always goes above and beyond . not expensive at all , and your shoes come back looking perfect ( actually , more than so ) . got two heels replaced , and he even polished them up nicely before giving them back . so taken with the experience that i wrote about cecil 's on my blog . ( http : //looksharpsconnie.blogspot.com/2012/05/cecil-shoe-doctor.html )	4511
1	so to be honest , i did n't even know if there were shoe repair places around anymore ; but cecil 's is the best . they are always fast and do a great job . i took two separate pairs of boots to cecil 's with broken zippers and booth were fixed like new in less then a week . they also have very good pricing .	4511
1	we have been taking our shoes for repair here for so many years . he 's amazing and a very friendly man too , i recommend cecil hands down !	4511
0	shoe repair takes forever . they promise two weeks and it takes months . the place is a mess . they lose shoes all the time . service is poor . i 've walked into the store and have waited several minutes before i was greeted . i was the only customer in the store . the female prefers to chit chat and is very ditzy . she does n't even know how to run credit cards so cecil has to do it . i 've brought several pairs of shoes and boots to this store and all but one pair turned out beautiful . the last pair were garbage . it 's not worth the headache , go somewhere else if you can .	4511
0	prices are ok , quality is so-so , but the owner is the worst part . lucky you if he likes you - you got better services and quick turnaround , but for everyone else - cecli does n't give a damn . want you shoes repaired quickly - prepare wait for 2 months . want to check status of your order - `` we can not do that over the phone - come and search by yourself '' . i had to come 3 times to search for my shoes or to hear that it would be ready next day ( it was n't of course ) . please , people , save your time and money and skip this place .	4511
0	i 've had several shoes repaired here for minor issues ; fair price , good work . however i now have a pair of booties that has been in there for 5 weeks . the heels are done but not the insoles . the third time i called the person on the other line got short with me . what was supposed to be 2 weeks max is now stretching into six , with no apologies or etas . i 'm picking them up tomorrow , ready or not , and will take them elsewhere if need be . ridiculous .	4511
1	i ordered a wedding cake from here but did n't think to read reviews . i decided to look up reviews and to see that this bakery got so many bad reviews i was so hopeful that the wedding cake would turn out good well guess what ? they did an amazing job ! i 'm so happy with it . it was n't too sweet either and having to travel 2 hours away with it , they did a very good job on packaging as well . great jobs guys !	4512
1	i got my wedding cake from this bakery . we ordered a coffee cake with hazelnut buttercream . it was the most amazing wedding cake anyone had ever tasted . it froze very well and we were eating it here and there for over a year ! i even changed my colour choice a few weeks before the wedding and the finished product was even better than i imagined . everyone is still raving about this cake .	4512
1	delicious cakes and treats . everything we 've tried is great . we ordered a custom cake for a very special event and were overwhelmed with the end result . highly recommend them for any custom cake order !	4512
1	i went here because the ruelo bakery was n't open yet . it was my birthday so i bought a chocolate/white chocolate mini cake which was so creamy and delicious . i also bought 2 macarons ( i thought you had to go to nyc to get them ) . the lavender-so divine ! i have n't tried the raspberry chocolate yet ... but it will be gone before midnight ; ) btw only accepts cash , no debit	4512
1	been coming here ever since a family friend had her wedding cake from here a few years back . the individual cakes are always a great treat full of real fruit and nuts and not smothered with overly heavy or sweet cream . rose cookies are really great too , the scent and flavour of rose is perfect with a hot drink .	4512
0	the customer service from the owner of this place is awful . she is very blunt and incredibly condescending . her husband has better customer service skills . cakes are edible . decor is nice . prices seem high .	4512
0	the birthday cake that we got was alright ... but the cake was ruined by the questionable penmanship ... do n't think i would ever come back again for a birthday cake . ruelo from the same plaza does a much better job with birthday cakes .	4512
0	food : 1/5 their macaroons are not real . they are hollow inside . location : 3/5 . free parking . near central street but car dependant . price : 2/5 . $ $ $ such macaroons should cost .50c not $ 2 will not be back	4512
0	we ordered our wedding cake and one for our baby celebration . designs for both cakes are not the same as we ordered . we made special requested on the cake designs and was promised to fulfill our request . however , it turned out different from what they promised . felt so disappointed ! !	4512
0	my friend recommend for me this place . huge mistake the owner does not give us the properly price and not helpful at all when choosing the cake . no category or sample to try the cake . it 's too late for us to change to another bakery so we stuck with them . we have to blind our own eyes to go with this place . i never recommend this place to my friend ever .	4512
1	great ambiance ! ! the staff greeted us with a smile and a complimentary drink to start off the services . we were a group of girls who went for a bachelorette and we were all sitting side by side along their bar watching sex in the city : ) the blowouts were immaculate and held for longer than my average blowouts . a must try !	4513
1	excellent salon , pleasant environment & perfect results . my stylist was very polite & efficient . i enjoyed watching gossip girl while my hair was done lol . plus my cut & colour was only roughly the same price as one of those usually are at other places i 've been to . overall great experience , i will be back !	4513
1	amanda was my hair stylist and she was very friendly and outgoing . she did a great job on my blowout which i got sleek with curls . she also gave us food and drink recommendations in montreal . very clean place and good ambiance .	4513
0	very nice staff , cute interior , and it 's nice you get mimosas and stuff ( one free and pay for the rest ) but not worth the cost ... they wash your hair quickly and not thoroughly . if you show them what you want , what you get does n't match the photo . my curls also fell out before i left the establishment , and there 's a hefty tax charge . i paid like $ 65 i think before tip , for literally , nothing , but one mimosa . disappointing , particularly since it was for my friend 's bachelorette party . would n't recommend this place or go back : (	4513
0	came for a blow out and requested a classic curl look . my hair looked fantastic walking out of the salon - but it barely lasted 2 hours . my hair was flat by the time i got to my event . it was unfortunately a waste of my time and money . i do not recommend !	4513
0	brought a picture of simple beach waves and left with the polar opposite . maybe i went on an off day ... . the stylist was quite rude and did n't speak to me or offer a drink . when i politely asked her to make my hair look a bit less `` done '' she told me it was fine . not impressed , especially given what i paid . will not return .	4513
1	not sure why the bad reviews ? i have had 2 iphone screens replaced . reasonably priced @ $ 80 and 2 day turn around . not sure why people think they are going to have a brand new device or console unless they pay for it . my wife and kids have both dropped their phones and shattered the screen . apple wants to replace for $ 200 and a simple screen replace has been well worth it . thx guys !	4514
1	a friend recommended inspect-ur-gadget to us for iphone repair . we were pleased to find out they also work on gaming systems and laptops . we spoke on the phone to a knowledgeable tech and decided to take our electronics in need of repair to have them inspected ! another customer was getting their gadget back all shiny and working . she was almost giddy with the results from their work . that 's always a good sign ! i 'll give an update after we get the results of their inspection !	4514
1	just got our electronic gadgets back and wow ! they fixed our wii and an ipod touch . great service at an even better price . i ca n't shout it more from the yelp rooftop , `` these guys rock '' !	4514
1	i took my ipod here for a battery change yesterday and it was done within a couple of hours . i just got it back so i do n't know yet how it will fare with the new battery but so far , so good . it 's a little difficult to find as it 's in a complex that looks like it 's a medical center . look for the western skies center . the staff were very friendly and helpful .	4514
1	i do n't write many reviews , but i 'm happy to for these guys . i wanted to get a friend 's iphone 4 screen repaired as a gift for them , but , because it was a surprise , it needed to be done fast . these guys were really friendly , got it done in a fair amount of time and at a fair price . i 'm happy to recommend them .	4514
1	awesome service , just picked up my 4s working & looking great . half the price of the apple store with better customer service .	4514
0	i brought my xbox one in to have them look at a simple mistake it was having , and i was told i would take two days . i had to call them multiple times to see if they were ready with my xbox , to no avail . about two weeks later , i got a call saying that my xbox was fixed . after picking it up , not only was my xbox not fixed , but also had another problem . now , it 's not loading discs at all . paid $ 40 for more problems and no solution for the reason i brought it in in the first place .	4514
0	went there as my phone screen crashed . got my so called fixed phone after two days with a screen , with lot of scratches ... soooo unsatisfied.. waiting for the monday to come and gon na ask the inspecturgadget guys to fix this issue.. if they are not , i need to take some severe action . sooo worst service . i will never go here again.. its high time for them to close their business ...	4514
0	they fixed a cracked-screen iphone 3gs back in january . their warranty on the site states that for repairs after january 1st they will guarantee the work for one year . apparently this does not apply to groupons ( like they do better work when it 's a groupon order ? ) . after almost no use ( the phone was not a primary device ) , the touch screen quit working on one side . that 's when we found out that the warranty does n't apply to the groupon purchased repairs . wo n't even bother coming back to this place when there 's plenty of competitors now .	4514
0	it took 2 tries to get my old ps3 up and working , but they got it . the 2nd try did n't cost me anything , but i did have to bring it back a 2nd time . i took it in for a disk read error ( would n't read any disk ) they said they replaced the laser ... took it home , it worked when i tested it ... the next time the miss 's tried to watch a blu-ray ... ... same disk read error . so i took it back , and now we are on try 2 at no charge for the 2nd	4514
0	had a droid x2 cracked screen replaced for $ 149.00 on 10/27/11 the phone started having problems again 9 months later . i called they wo n't do anything about it . unless i pay $ 99 . cant afford this kind of service . talked to repairlabs.com they will replace any part they fix for life for free .	4514
0	stop ! do not get any service done here ! ! they broke my son 's ds and will not fix it . they had it over 1month and still get all excuses to pick it up . like alex the employee '' it 's not ready we have n't put it back together '' . i 'm about to get news 3 involved this is bull ! alex is the rudest person to be employed at customer service . do not recommend this place at all ! save your self a night mare .	4514
1	i have been going through kelly for years ! i have never been disappointed ! she replaced by $ 60.00 per haircut salon .	4515
1	they get me in and out , and looking good . i 've always been treated kindly . they have my style on file and give consistently good results .	4515
1	my hubby just got a haircut there and really enjoyed the experience . he used the app to check in and the wait time was only 15 minuets . he received excellent customer service and a great haircut from vicky . he 's looking sharp ! thank you so much for the great haircut .	4515
1	my son does n't want me to cut his hair . i got a coupon in the mail and used it . we always go to amazing cuts becausw it 's just right by us . so we tried great clips and the lady did a really good job ! my son did n't cry . she was talking to him and making him comfortable . she cut my son 's hair gently and to the way i want . we went there by just walking in . they even have a lego table for kids . i recommend this place !	4515
1	it 's definitely hit or miss but fortunately i 've had more hits than misses . shawn is the only one i will let near my hair with clippers , the others have been lacking confidence with ethnic hair and the ethnic stylists seem less than enthusiastic to cut my short ethnic hair . it 's terrible to see so many bad reviews because i see they 're really trying and can often get overwhelmed . i will continue to come back and my only advice is try to stick with same stylist if you find one you like , do not gamble on a random pick as it may or may not result in a disappointment .	4515
1	i 've been here over a handful of times and have always loved my trims . i was nervous that they would n't know how to handle black hair but nicole does a better job than the overpriced salons i used to go to . a very happy repeat customer .	4515
1	if you need a quick cut this is the place . very cheap and good service . the only reason i do n't give them 5 stars is because i have never once been asked if i would like a shampoo with my cut .	4515
1	$ 11 cuts whats there to complain about ? staff are very friendly and wait times are very minimal . i 've been here twice on busy days ( weekends ) and have only waited at the most 5-10 minutes before getting called up . decent place until i can find a real barber on this side of town .	4515
1	we are here regularly getting my son 's hair cut . he loves kelly . we 've come to a few different stylists and we always come back to kelly . tessa helped us a couple times , and she did a fantastic job as well . kelly keeps my son engaged and is patient and understanding that he 's 5 and does n't understand his head moves when he talks . go see kelly !	4515
1	i came in ; did a walk in . i 'm new to las vegas area . i was helped by nicole . she did such a good job . when i said a trim , she asked how much . i said an inch ; and she cut only an inch . and i love that she did n't over cut it like most hair stylists would do . recommend her very much !	4515
1	you get exactly what you 're looking for here : a cheap haircut . nothing fancy . i come here when i need a quick , cheap cleanup . when i want an actual `` styling '' i 'll go to fx in the same parking lot & see amy . but , the 2 are completely different experiences & expectations .	4515
1	nice , easy place to come get a haircut . they tell me this is their busiest location , which makes sence because there are always at least six stylists on hand . that 's what i love about it here , there is almost never a wait because they are staffed so well . this is the only place i go for my hair , in and out nice and fast .	4515
1	im a greatclips veteran ... been to many in 3 states and usually satisfied . true , the stylists vary a bit , but that makes it special when i get the same great stylist again . haircuts grow out but a friendly haircut lasts ... thanks !	4515
0	if they spent more time concentrating on cutting hair then freaken chit chatting with eachother it would be a miracle . wo n't be going here anymore . amazing cuts down the way much better and worth the price .	4515
0	so this was my second time going to this great clips and they totally ruined my hair the back of my hair i asked for a line and 1/2 is way shorter than the other i do n't know what to do i would n't be going back there	4515
0	i got a haircut from vicki or vicky . she cut my hair and she kept bossing me around and being rude . she was acting like i 'm not a living thing with emotions that can be sad or happy or angry then the next customer came she was acting very nice . this is from my son who is 11 years old . he wrote this .	4515
0	went in to get a quick haircut one morning and the stylist cut my hair crooked . i am not sure how she did not notice because it was prerty bad . went somewhere else to have it fixed .	4515
0	checked in online waited 30 minutes to come in because i checked in online to get a haircut for my nephew and because i checked in using my number online then changed the number when i got here ( since my husband comes usually with him ) he got bumped from 4 to 8 ? ? over and hour wait ? ! ! after waiting to come here because we were checked in online . poor customer service ! ! will never come here again . you lost my business for a family of 6 ! !	4515
0	came here to get my 2 sons haircuts and they were quite rude . this includes the lady who checked us in and the lady giving the haircut . if you do n't like the fact that you are busy then why come to work . a smile go 's a long way too . will not come back here or recommend any of our friends and family .	4515
0	if i could give 0 stars i would . there are no requirements for the hair 'stylists ' to meet in order to work here . its a cheapie chop shop and you get a lot worse than you paid for . i do n't know why i returned after a couple very bad cuts . maybe i am a glutton for punishment or too forgiving or just too lazy to find a new place but surmise it to say : this great clips has terrible cutters with no training and i recommend avoiding it at all costs .	4515
0	sorry to say this -- -i gave them a second chance , but their hair specialists ca n't seem to follow simple instructions . i told him to trim my son 's hair and not to cut too short . he ended up buzzing it too short and told me he thought i wanted it short . he told me it was going to grow back and did n't apologize that he made a mistake . i would n't recommend coming to this location . another customer told me that they seem to employ substandard hair specialists ...	4515
0	omg . i have an event . i went here to have my hair done , not cut , just blow dried and styled . it 's not good . my hair is flat on top with weird tight curls that start at my ears . i 'm not pleased . i will not be back .	4515
0	went there ask for medium length haircut she cut my hair shorter than my shoulders . i even showed her a pic of how i wanted my hair but 2 inches longer . worst place ever 2nd time they messed up my hair will never he going back it 's better to pay 60 bucks for a great haircut than 15 bucks to look like a guy .	4515
0	these people are beyond slow . every time i come here i wonder why i did n't drive a little further for better customer service . i 've been to better great clips locations like the one on centennial pkwy	4515
0	i took my kid in for wash/deep cond , she has very curly hair that tangles ez , sasha complained about her back hurting & it taking to long for her to comb out . her 1st experience & probably last	4515
0	awesome to know that i can check in just to get there 6 min . later to be told my phone number is no longer in the system for some reason . then to be given a piece of paper to input my contact info to register once again . i literally watched `` vicki '' bump me down from top of the list to the 4th in line ( on the convenient screen customers can use to see where they are in line ) then start calling those names before mine when i had already been waiting before they came in . talk about awesome customer service ... not .	4515
1	beautiful modern salon ! friendly staff with expert skills . i had the zoya naked manicure . looks great .	4516
1	decided to try elements from a friend 's recommendation . needed a major make over and could not be happier with the results . nicole moen , my stylist , had just returned after a lengthy maternity leave . she 's on her game ! i am so happy with my new cut and get loads of compliments . i highly recommend elements salon .	4516
0	i 've spent quite a lot of money at this salon , over almost two years , on manicures and pedicures . i am in fact a regular customer , and i am particularly a fan of mandy . however , when it really counted - on the day before a big wedding - they refused to fit me in to do a nail repair on one chipped nail ( i had just gotten my manicure there two days prior . ) it would have taken about 15 minutes . this is not good customer service , and i will seriously be rethinking my loyalty .	4516
0	customer service is terrible . the staff is extremely unfriendly . they act like they r doing you a favor by talking to you ! highlight ... .terrible ! worst i have ever had . and as for groupons , do n't do it ! ! ! they do not accommodate , and could care less about the service u receive . very disappointed with this place . : (	4516
1	i began seeing dr. bellota 4 years ago . i was very impressed with how caring , thoughtful and courteous she is . eventually , 4 of my colleagues and friends ended up being her patients and were just as impressed with her caring and thoughtfulness as i am . i found her staff extremely competent , and on point during the past 4 years . once , i was depressed and called to see her the same day , they fit me in even though she was already booked a month in advance . i will always recommend dr. bellota to my family and friends .	4517
1	dr rosa bellota is awesome ! she is very caring and empathetic . i would recommend her to anyone . if you are in need of help do n't hesitate . her staff is also very efficient and polite . i have never waited more than 10 minutes to see her with the exception of one time when she had an emergency patient . i 've been a patient of dr. bellota for 16 months . i moved to las vegas from the northeast and she welcomed me with open arms . i feel very fortunate to have found her .	4517
0	`` testing '' involves listening to music or playing with toys for an hour.. do n't worry about being early or on time as you 'll probably wo n't be seen until 20-30 after your appointed time . staff also seems more interested in the lunch orders and gossip than customer service . i hate coming here but my insurance says i have no choice .	4517
0	terrible experience..3 cancelled appointments in a row , did n't even follow up to see if patient had refill on depression meds . office staff let 's you drive all the way there when they knew 2 hrs prior that your appointment was cancelled . we did n't even get an apology . second appointment was during week of thanksgiving and we were told dr. did n't want appointments over holiday week and would n't be available . most uncaring dr. and staff i 've had the displeasure to deal with . left my family stressed out and without answers . we no longer see this dr .	4517
1	my 91 year old mother was taken to this hotel when hurricane mathew hit her condo in sc . the people at this hotel were wonderful ! my mother is not very mobile , had a number of special request . the staff was more than responsive and caring . every one of her needs were looked after by the aloft staff . i want to say thank you . special thanks to ewan - housekeeping manager	4518
1	i 'm giving this hotel a full five stars because of the staff . it is what would be expected from an aloft in terms of decor , cleanliness , style , etc . however , the staff here is exceptional ! i would stay here again based on this alone .	4518
0	the concept is honestly pretty cool , but it 's also completely impractical . for those with children , aloft is simply impossible to work with . the property was clean and the service was good , but the strange rooms with things like a pocket door bathroom providing little to no privacy just make it a place i wo n't be visiting again .	4518
0	customer service for reservations at this location is absolutely atrocious . i travel all the time , and have never experienced anything like this . the hold times are upwards of 25 minutes . and when i finally got through to a live human being , she immediately disconnected me . the booking and cancellation options on the website are limited , so one is completely at their mercy . for me , this level of impaired customer service is a deal-breaker . there are plenty of other decent hotels nearby who place more value on their cusromers ' valuable time .	4518
1	fantastic coffee for an airport starbucks ! appreciated it after my transatlantic flight !	4519
1	this is a nice and spacious cafe starbucks in the montreal ( yul ) airport . there are two sections of seating and an option to purchase three different designs of canadian signature mugs .	4519
1	claimed my `` reward '' here ... $ 13 for a chicken sandwich ! but i paid nothing ! thank you for feeding me for free at the most expensive starbucks ever ! if a woman tells you that you ca n't get a sandwich for your free reward , tell her `` yes i can ! alex did ! '' you are welcome . man , is this blonde coffee strong !	4519
0	worst garbage you could possibly even imagine putting into your mouth . it 's a shame this chain with the billions of dollars that they make can not offer people good food . this particular one had the worst i 've ever seen .	4519
0	just paid more than $ 15 for 2 small lattes and 2 chocolate croissants . hard chunks of chocolate in a mostly empty small croissant . ripoff !	4519
0	3.45 $ cad for a plain bagel with nothing on it . no trenta and no cold brew available ( today )	4519
1	600th review ! ! ! had a pleasant experience here ! the clerk helped me ship a package & got me the cheapest rate possible . she was very nice to me and others that encountered her . most usps clerks are n't the friendliest ! but she was very accommodating . kudos to her ! ! ! ! so glad i had a 5* experience on my 600th review .	4520
1	the mobile post office located right outside of this location is amazing . the woman who works the van is so sweet , always happy and damn fast at her job . i am always so relieved when i pull up and the van is outside . the staff inside is amazing as well . there are almost always long lines , but come on guys , it 's a post office . : )	4520
1	went here for the first time last week ... was pleasantly suprised : ) they not only have a full service counter but they also had a little van / wagon `` express '' stationed outside in the parking lot that also can accomplish pretty much all your shipping and mailing needs . it was really helpful bc the line inside was montrous .	4520
1	useful , i am not a fan of the post office . convient for picking up package and getting stamps	4520
1	nice location . friendly staff . lines can get long at times . if you can print from home , try to ahead of time . they have po boxes , passports.. anything you 'd need .	4520
0	i 'm sorry but the employees here are not friendly at all . they talk to you like you owe them something . i 've taken a while to write a review on this place because i like to give places 2 or 3 chances but wow every time it 's even more disappointing .	4520
0	absolutely horrible . this is the walmart of post offices . there 's never less than a 30 minute wait and do n't get me started on the attitudes in this office . do n't open on time , waited until 9:15 to see anyone to helps me .	4520
0	i recently moved into a new apartment complex , which is ironically , neighboring a different apartment complex . it has been a little over two months , and my mail still gets returned to sender and packages still get marked as undeliverable . i called usps and spoke to a supervisor and alerted them of the incorrect delivery of mail , and they seemed to rectify the issue for about a week , as i started to finally receive mail and packages , but then again , mail and packages become undeliverable . i receive mail and packages sometimes now . which is unacceptable . i 've had my 401k checks returned to institution and then some .	4520
0	wish i could leave 0 stars . best four letter word for this place is slow . everyday i come here that 's the experience and everyone i line has same complaints	4520
0	just completely dislike the postal workers attitudes at this location , we came in for a passport renewal for my daughter . as we approach our time for the appointment , the usps guy who processes the application had this arrogant behavior and simply made our task of getting the passport renewed a freaking nightmare ! ! !	4520
1	we had our first birthday party at this money joe 's and it was spectacular . our party host victoriya was kind , patient and very helpful . she made the experience enjoyable . highly recommend this place .	4521
1	my husband and i took our kids ( three years old and under ) to expend some energy . . . great fun ! the employees were friendly and available . . . the place was clean . we 'll definitely be going back . if you plan to go , keep your eyes open for it - located at the far end of the strip mall and around the corner . ( not easily visible )	4521
0	this place has gone downhill used to be a regular place i would take my granddaughters , but not anymore . jumping slides are n't patched , do n't have enough aid and are filthy . i used the last entry punches on our entry card . used to be $ 4 each use now $ 11 . we can go to discovery place for that . i do n't recommend this place .	4521
0	my 11 year old is not welcome on a day the charlotte schools are closed ? perhaps you should send your management team to urban air so they can learn how to not let money walk out the door .	4521
1	there 's nothing like an oreo overload from cold stone . so when the better half and i passed one during a recent trip to vegas , we had to stop and get some . http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-stone-creamery-las-vegas-2 ? select=uywicgomsiqdqqwelacb1q # uywicgomsiqdqqwelacb1q http : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-stone-creamery-las-vegas-2 ? select=ffhelo6xanvo_eq2e2nazg # ffhelo6xanvo_eq2e2nazg the employees at this store hooked us up and made ours with a ton of oreos/chocolate chips/caramel ... .much more than we normally get at the stores we visit in scottsdale . when you get the craving for ice cream , you have to satisfy it ! return factor - 90 %	4522
1	there 's a young gentleman working the counter- blonde highlights and glasses . he 's running the ship by himself , greeting every customer as they enter the store , working with a sence of urgency , engaging with every customer , and he 's extremely polite . oh , and our ice cream tastes great ! ! ! !	4522
1	clean place . fast customer service . staff are all courteous . they also have cakes and cupcakes available for take out . we 'll come back again for sure .	4522
1	there were 4 employees so the line was going fast . ronnie was amazing . apple pie ala mode is my favorite .	4522
1	max was beyond helpful and super duper nice ! he was all by himself and helping us and the other customers so quickly . he got through the line fast , he was super sweet , and helpful/patient when we could n't decide what to order ! i will definitely be coming back on max 's shifts !	4522
1	ok , finally a good review ... greeted with friendliness and a smile . we ordered peanut butter perfection and cheesecake with blueberries . they were fast and friendly and the ice cream was fantastic ... if you 're a peanut butter fan , you must try !	4522
1	i 've always had a great experience at coldstone . they are always friendly and have no problem when i ask for extra toppings . they have the best tasting ice cream in town .	4522
1	mmmmm ... this ice cream is heaven ! i love this location and staff as well ! people here are so friendly ! the ice cream shakes are to die for ! ! ! i highly suggest this cold stone !	4522
1	i came here late at night around 8 pm on july 14th and i had the best of customer service by all 3 staff members at the location . they were patient with our order and went above and beyond taking care of us . the generosity of this staff is not unnoticed . like willy wonka said `` so shines a good deed in a weary world '' . the ice cream was great as well .	4522
1	the ice cream here was so tastey ! just the thought of writing this review makes me want to go back and have another one . they have all sorts of flavors . i love their ice cream ! they are always quick and the price is great !	4522
1	2 words `` oreo overload ''	4522
1	it 's great ice cream but a tiny bit pricy . i found the staff to be friendly and prompt . the bathroom looked not too clean . the shop and tables were a little sticky . the place was good but the prices are relatively high for what little i got . i 'll be back but not soon . i 'm looking for full time employment so what i do spend has to be 5 stars to be worth using my plastic !	4522
1	recommended . very clean store , lots of great options , very friendly staff , very well-stocked , very quick service no matter what time of day you go . just an all-around great place . very fair price and they serve just the right amount . delicious !	4522
1	i come into this location frequently , i usually get mediocre service , not expecting the world . this past few weeks , my family and i come in and are welcomed by a young lady named kylie . she makes everyone feel like there is no rush and gets out order correct 100 percent of the time ! whoever hired some life in this place did a great job by hiring this chick . thanks ! !	4522
1	place was clean and staff was efficient . the only thing that would have made it better would be the staff being personable . it felt like they were drones . if they would be more personable i 'm sure they would make more tips	4522
1	always friendly staff , great ice cream . less one star because this place smelled so bad like wet mop , that we took our ice cream to go . had it not been for our gift card paying for our treats , i would have suggested we go somewhere different this night .	4522
0	the ice cream is good , but the service is poor . the guy at counter not only took his time greeting us when we walked in , but also took his time getting our order , and making it . the co-worker that was there with him went to hide in the backroom while he struggled to get the first cup of ice cream made . finally she came out of hiding and helped him . still slow , but no longer at a snails pace . gave the 1 star rating bcuz of the service and lack of cleanliness . the tables look like they have n't been touched with hot water in days .	4522
0	employees look like they were new . i ordered 3 small ice creams . 2 kids and mine had additional peanut butter and peanut butter cups . mine ( dad ) came back smaller than the others by about a third . when i mentioned it i just got a `` sorry '' . will not be coming back .	4522
0	orders a churro caramel crave and instead of making it all the employees played with each other . after 20 minutes i confronted them on how long it was taking , once confronting them then they started . 30 mins later i finally get my ice creme and it sucks . just go to roberto 's	4522
0	do n't come here if you want anything blended . i went there about a month ago and they said the blender was broken . no big deal . i took it home and blended my ice cream into a shake . today i went back looking for a shake . still no blender . i was n't heading home right this time so i could n't make a shake . i just walked out . get it together people . how can you not have a blender for a month being an ice cream shop .	4522
0	the worse place if you are buying cake for birthday they will not write anything on the cake , i was buying $ 60 dollars cake for my wife birthday the cashier told me we do it once a week and i told him witch day he told me thursday only morning time , so guys i do n't know who will be the lucky customer who will have birthday on thursday , worse place to do business .	4522
0	waited 45 minutes to get my ice cream , it was almost the same amount of time last visit . the prices are expensive and they do n't have gelato out of all the flavors . the line is always long and noisy , the store has debris all over the floor , i do like their late hours and giving a star for that . going to baskin robbins from now on	4522
0	seriously i do n't think i can ever come back here , every time we come they have the absolute worst customer service i have ever seen . it 's like if you have a horrible personality they hire you ! literally their only job is to hand u and make ice cream ... . do n't waste your time here there are so many good ice cream spots ! ! !	4522
0	bought the largest tub of ice cream they had . it was over $ 16 with tax . tub was n't even full . take a look at the picture i posted .	4522
0	ice cream is good but they really need to work on cleaning the place . nice employees they need to dress the part and do some personal grooming .	4522
0	walked into the store about 3 pm today . a ten year old child sat alone eating ice cream in dining room . i waited ten minutes and no one helped me and i was the only customer in the store . i left and went to the yogurt place across the street . wo n't be back !	4522
0	we come here frequently because it 's close to our house , but it 's ice cream and when i need a fix ... .i need a fix = ) but the customer service leaves alot to be desired . no friendly smiles or happy helpful attitude ( s ) . i have my favorites ( oreo overload & chocolate devotion ) but i 've seen others come in not sure of what they want and the workers almost seem annoyed and in a hurry ... i guess ice cream is enough to make me happy so i keep coming back ... .for now , after all dq is not too far and the service has always been great there .	4522
0	just had the worst service . two guys working were rude and told us that we could n't use a coupon that expired today . any other place i have been to , you have until the expiration date to use , not the day before it expires .	4522
0	valentines day 2017 . no whipped cream , no cookie dough , no napkins . the 2 ladies working behind the counter were polite and professional . the owner/manager should have stocked his inventory . really , no whipped cream ? at an ice cream spot ! ? ! my family and i started going to coldstone creamery back in 2000 when living in el segundo , ca . during the weekend the line would be out the door . when you left a tip the workers would say a little cheer . here in lv coldstone creamery is just another ice cream place	4522
0	unfortunately had to give a star in order to review . you totally ruined my 7 year olds birthday ! ordered a cake and it was never made , leaving us scrambling last minute to figure it out . so super cool of you guys ! thanks !	4522
0	i did n't like the staff here . they are not very friendly or attentive . i understand that cold stone is just a ice cream joint , but i think they just wanted everyone to get ice cream and get going . in addition , they seem to spill all over the serving cup . the cup was sticky even after they wiped it clean with some cloth . i am definitely not going back even though i love cold stone ice creams.. i am willing to drive to another location for it even though this is the closest to where i live .	4522
0	this particular location is dirty and takes 15-20 min place to order , both issues due to the fact that it 's not properly staffed .	4522
1	i had been researching the senas for a couple months now and finally decided i was going to buy one . i talked to jason g. and he was so informative and helped me decide which sena was better for my needs . on top of that , he personally installed it , and was more than happy to meet me half way to deliver the product to me . i am very happy with my purchase and the customer service that was provided . thank you so much !	4523
1	i took my son to the store to buy his first helmet . like me he has a hard to fit head . we did measurement of his head before so at least we had a place to start . my 11 year old son was finicky and tried on many helmets before finding the one he wanted . the staff that helped me was patient and answered all my questions as i needed . he was not pushy but followed our lead and was there whenever we needed him . they were pleasant to deal with . we will defiantly go back . this is the second helmet we 've bought from this store .	4523
1	i worked with andrew this morning in returning some boots that went bad before their time . he took a look at them , decided that he could warranty them and found a replacement set of boots in my size . all within about 20 minutes . since i started riding motorcycles , this shop has been my go-to shop . they have great service and good advice .	4523
1	been here over and over an have had nothing but great service . helped me with my helmet and scala with no hassle at all .	4523
1	this is one of the better places to get your gear . the staff is very knowledgeable and will steer you in the right direction . i consider my self very knowledgeable and put them to the test . no bs they were spot on and their prices were good . jenn went the extra mile and a true asset to this company with added humor along the way . thank you and i will continue to use cycle gear for my future purchases .	4523
1	good gear at descent prices with good monthly sales . staff are pretty knowledgeable . changed my front tube in 10 min for $ 15 . the only downside is limited selection of parts ( ex $ 46 sparkplug for 07 250crf ) so i still have to go to honda store , but that 's ok and expected .	4523
0	horrible customer service.. i pulled into the parking lot at 7:55 when they close at 8pm . the man inside ran over and locked the door right in front of me when all i needed was an oil filter for my bike and would have taken 5 mins or less . i know they lost at least one customer as ill be going back to north valley honda and i hope many more do as well after reading this review .	4523
0	omg ! avoid this place at all cost !	4523
0	customer service is awful and they make price promises they refuse to keep , albeit they are way better than mesa but this experience was awful	4523
0	this place is for suckers . it 's run by idiots . i tried the place a few times and have never had a good experience . the employees follow you around and are not very knowledgeable . the services they offer are insane . you can find better shops in the valley . you can also definitely find better services . this place is for the morons that go to ride now . lol	4523
0	overpriced and limited selection . i only buy certain items here and only when they 're on sale . staff is typically friendly though .	4523
0	very bad customer service . told us it would be 170 $ for two tires , got there and it was way more . the guy told us the person on the phone was new and he could n't wave any fees because of that . ended up paying 230 $ if i had known that i would n't have waisted my time or money on this place . just terrible . will never do business again with them .	4523
1	nice , relatively new , mesa gun shop in the old bank building w/the clock tower on main st. good prices , decent ammo inventory , helpful , knowledgeable , friendly staff . veteran owned with a modest veteran 's discount on purchases . my new favorite gunshop in the area .	4524
1	what a great gun store ! customer service is top notch and their firearms knowledge is the best here ! we purchased 2 firearms here , our experience was phenomenal . first example , we wanted a special gun that sells out quickly . the owner checked and verified they a had couple on order . i gave them a deposit and they called me as promised , on time . excellent customer service ! we also took the ccw class offered by the shop owner . such a valuable class , he kept it interesting and had great examples throughout the presentation ! gun selection is outstanding as well , love our sigs !	4524
1	i have been into guns for years now and i have been in a ton of gun stores . this is by far my favorite shop . super friendly , great at working on firearms with good prices . purchased a sbr they built , it shoots amazing put thousands of rounds through it with no malfunctions . im very happy with it . i wo n't go anywhere else for my guns or ammo .	4524
1	great gun shop , great customer service , great staff , great inventory and great prices ! the owner nick is a class act ! one of best gun shops i 've ever been in ! do yourself a favor and check it out .	4524
0	unfortunately al is right ! they blow smoke and tell you your first on the list and they 'll call you when your item comes in , but they do n't . i 've seen the item come and go . watch out for price gouging too ! they insist they wo n't `` be like the other guys '' , but that 's not the case . disappointing .	4524
0	they just blow smoke up your a** tell you that your first on the list for a gun . i wait , then u see the the same rifle listed in stock ( for sale ) i call and they tell me it 's sold . bunch of crock . do n't trust them . they will never call u back	4524
0	shop else where customer servie sucks , they lie , never calls you back , take your money else where !	4524
0	sales men very pushy very rude to customers prices extremely high shop else where ! save your gas !	4524
1	i was very pleased with my visit yesterday the staff was friendly and got my drink out fast i was n't sure what i wanted but i was helped by a young lady named bella and she really took the time to listen and know what i wanted . she even continued to talk with me after i bought my coffee the employees really did make my day . i will continue to come back to this location .	4525
1	the baristas here are the best . always promopt and kind . i highly recommend this starbucks .	4525
1	i do n't feel like a person till i hit my favourite starbucks every morning before work , the servers are very cool , the drive-thru is usually long but i guess we are all addicted to sugar and caffeine . just got my fix driving away very happy	4525
1	cashier was really nice & said happy birthday when i ordered my birthday drink ! they made the drink super quick and i realized too late & someone took my frappe : ( they apologized and ended up making me a new one and gave it to me personally . super nice about it .	4525
1	cashier was very nice and welcoming ! my new favorite location ! the girls working today were in hustle mode ... yet still very attentive to their customers !	4525
1	why the four stars ? no parking . well , not enough parking . we went through the parking lot at least three times hoping to find a spot and had to resort to parking next door . the coffee ? of course , it was wonderful ! i had an iced coffee , and i never have iced coffee but phoenix is just too hot to have hot coffee in the middle of the afternoon ! ( but i have decided that i would rather have hot coffee on a hot day than put up with the flavor of iced coffee which just does not touch the spot . )	4525
1	i came here again and had a good experience . the staff was really nice and i got my drinks quick . that is my usual experience , so i will bump this up to 4 stars !	4525
1	love coming here . in particular , a barista named mark is super friendly and always remembers my drink and always makes my visit memorable . every time i come through the drive thru it is always fast and smooth when he runs it . keep up the good work mark !	4525
1	the staff at this location is always super friendly . brandon took my order at the drive thru and gave amazing customer service ! i always look forward to the friendly faces at this location and the speedy service !	4525
1	this is my go-to starbucks . not too crowded after work , music is n't loud , and the staff is really nice . before long i was a regular that would have my order in-prog before i was even at the counter . i 've been to other starbucks where the music is blaring so loudly that i just get up and leave . when i come here after work it is an ideal place to sit down , pop on my headphones , and draw without distraction . never tried the drive-in , so no opinion there .	4525
1	working christmas eve is difficult for everyone , so about ten of us at the hospital decided to order some starbucks for a pick me up . we know it 's difficult to get such a big order on a busy day but jeremy delivered . all of our drinks were perfect and delicious . thank you !	4525
1	the people were friendly but maybe they need to be given an espresso drink before starting their shift , sunday 's are always busy so they should be prepared for a fast phased environment . 4 staff only 1 making drinks , 1 taking front counter , orders and 1 in drive thru . management should suggest possibly having crew members that are just standing at registers to make the items their waiting on so customers are n't waiting 20 min for 1 coffee in an empty lobby while drive thru is getting the only service .	4525
0	i work near here so i always go there to get something , and no matter what drink i get , there is always a mistake . either they did n't make the drink correctly , or add-ons were never added ... i try to give them chances and still , there is always something .	4525
0	worst starbucks i have ever been to.. i live across the street and i drive to other starbucks to get my morning coffee . they are unprofessional and very slow . coffee is not consistent . that is the short and sweet version of the stories i have	4525
0	worst starbucks ever ! ! ! ! drive thru takes 20 minutes to go through it ! ! ! ! does n't even deserve stars ...	4525
0	when the cup says vanilla flat white but tastes like a bag of burn ass coffee ... ... ... ... ..	4525
0	i purchased a grande flat white , and it was half way full . i meant really ? i paid five dollars for a half cup of grande size .	4525
0	worst starbucks i 've ever been to . did n't even order anything because we pulled up to the drive thru and the guy says `` what you want ? '' . drove off , not the service i expect from starbucks .	4525
0	great service . the bathroom situation was difficult at best . could n't get in for an hour or more because of the line ... do n't know what these people were doing in there for so long but there were quite a few of them and they all took an inordinate amount of time ... i was told by the management that they could n't do anything about it - and i consequently ca n't come back - which is unfortunate because the service was otherwise so good .	4525
0	they closed 20 min early . dont have a closing time if you 're not going to honor that . very rude people here .	4525
0	came here specifically for a quick oatmeal breakfast and they said they ca n't sell oatmeal to me because they are out of lids . i suggested putting the another bowl on top but no . dumb and extremely inconvenient for me right now .	4525
0	this is the worst starbucks i have ever patronized . drive through is always slow and that act like they would rather be anywhere else . the barista are also sloppy . the carmel goes in the cup not around it ! inside in no better . yes , i 've tried on two separate occasions .	4525
0	if this were the only starbucks i ever visited , i would not ever go to another one again . it seems poorly managed by the ( tweaker ? ) taylin who runs this location . they are always out of something !	4525
0	i 've been going to starbucks for years ... .this is by far the most unfriendly and unprofessional staff that i 've encountered . does starbucks not train their staff anymore ?	4525
1	i came in a couple of days ago with a scratch on my back bumper , the owner of the shop helped me out and pointed me to the right person that could fix my scratch for little money . i 'd recommend and return if anything happens in the future .	4526
1	i got rear-ended in my 2014 jeep patriot coming off the freeway and i went through abc auto body because of a referral from a friend . i would honestly recommend them to everyone . they 're awesome and the job was completed quickly . my car was finished when it was promised and it looked brand new again . jeff in the office made sure everything was done smoothly and called a few times to keep me updated . they 're great and make it such an easy process !	4526
0	run away as soon as possible . it 's a very expensive place to go guys . i do n't recommend this to anybody else .	4526
0	friendly professional service . i picked this place because of other reviews and it was spot on . not only did don the owner give me a fair and honest quote but they finished ahead of schedule ! oh and his wife is so nice it was like coming into someones home . i highly recomend this place and would send my best friend there . so i thought i would update this review as my door on the minivan was fixed with parts that ended up rusting . the other door on my minivan has not rusted just the one that abc worked on .	4526
1	we went to the one at santan mall . this is a very unique place . the donuts are made right in front of you . our grand kids loved it ... ( us too )	4527
1	took the family here for the first time ! the kids were so excited to customize their own donut . the menu had so many great options . the donuts came of fresh and warm . my son got salted carmel with m & m 's . my daughter got strawberry shortcake . my husband got chocolate covered cherry and i got salted carmel . we all enjoyed it very much . we will be back again for sure .	4527
1	great doughnut options with tons of combinations ! blueberry is the best but you ca n't go wrong with the chocolate options .	4527
1	best donuts in town ! love that you can customize them ! the staff is always friendly and the price is reasonable . the iced coffee was also very good . i love that they have their creamers in a mini refrigerator . these are a definite must try !	4527
1	i recently ordered these off the uber eats app for my class . even upon delivery they were still nice and warm and smelled delicious . i 'm not a huge fan of donuts in general , but these were good . and the toppings/flavors are very fun and unique ! i like the concept and appreciate that they belong to uber eats !	4527
1	derek and brenna were awesome ! ! my my girlfriend and i went in sporadically on her birthday and they really treated her with topknot service . they make a great donut , and amazing atmosphere , and it 's super fun to be here ! definitely coming here again	4527
1	cool place - love the fresh donuts here . austin was courteous and friendly and the place was clean .	4527
1	fun place for a dessert , and we love the location ! such creative ideas for donuts , and i like that you can add ice cream ! i 've had the gorilla ( i give it a 7 out of 10 ) , and rocky shores ( a 7.5 out of 10 ) . i want to try the french toast and the oc sands next visit . good stuff guys ! great service too . thanks !	4527
0	my husband and i came here last night . we probably should have left without ordering . the `` kids '' working were messing around , not professional , and i 'm finding out a few hours later that they probably did not wash their hands before making our donuts and frozen hot chocolate . it took four of them to figure out the frozen hot chocolate and when i got up to grab a napkin there were boxes all over the floor and the male worker messing with some of them . pretty sure he 's the one that then handed the donuts to my husband . we 've both been up for hours so sick . do n't eat here .	4527
0	everything was dirty , tables , floors , hand wash sink , bowl for fresh doughnuts . toppings in glazes . 2 groups walked out .	4527
0	donut with a side of sarcasm ? cashier was so rude , i cancelled my order . if i had n't already promised one to my kid , i would have walked out . i think she is watching me write this review , she just brought me a free donut . thanks , but you never get a second chance to make a first impression . maybe you 're mad that your coworker wont get off his phone . meh .	4527
0	it should really be a zero star review since i never actually got to try a doughnut . stood at the counter for 10 minutes while the girl wiped the counter , moved boxes around , stirred frosting . she never said hello , asked if she could help us or anything . so we walked back out . we were so excited to try it as we 've heard great things but looks like we 'll be going back to our local friendly shop .	4527
0	the employees were horrible ! ! slow and too busy on their phones to take orders . donuts were good though . probably wo n't come back because of the employees . horrible service ! ! ! !	4527
0	went in to get some donuts for my family and there was absolutely nobody in the store . i waited for a few minutes and had to leave . i think having somebody at the counter to help customers would be a good thing . back to bosa !	4527
0	would not recommend . visited for the first time today and ordered a dozen different flavors to go . i asked one of the workers how the donuts were and was told they were `` okay '' . should have listened because they were gross . all flavors tasted the same and left a bad aftertaste . not sure if it was from the oil or glaze will not be back !	4527
0	i guess if you like cake donuts this is the place for you . i ordered 12 different types and i was n't impressed by one . they are pricey for what you get too .	4527
1	i was there the last week of may 2015 and was pleasantly surprised . i actually hesitated going to this location after having read some marginal reviews but i was close and short on time . boy , am i glad i did . the service was prompt and professional . in addition to the basics i have a front piece of plastic , that sits under the bumper , that is slightly loose and i asked if they could fix it and while they did n't have the parts to do so they inspected it thoroughly and said if i returned with some zip ties they would be willing to stitch me up for free . excellent service experience !	4528
1	i just stopped by to get my oil change and i was very surprise with the manager and the staff at this jiffy lube location . they work well and fast . i definitely recommend them . keep up the good work	4528
1	fast and honest service . the whole team treated me and the van right . explained everything to me in an honest and up front way . they hold to their promise of service and offer top off of fluids to your next oil change .	4528
1	rob is the man . he always ask if you need other stuff done with your car changing filters and stuff like that the best place in phoenix	4528
0	beware if this location . these guys here are lazy . they were nice enough to say it was ok for me to show up right at closing . to tell me a few minutes later that there was a crack in my radiator and fluid was dripping ( ... it was brand new radiator fluid dripping out ) and that due to liability issues were unable to work on my van . i took my van to my mechanic and not a single thing was found to be wrong . wish i could give this location a zero ! i will never recommend this place to anyone	4528
0	the integrity of the service here failed my expectations . i just changed my windshield wipers last month and the technicians suggested i change the wipers because they looked `` cracked . '' i now question the proper services i 'm truly receiving and no longer trust the jiffy lube corporation .	4528
0	went in for a/c car service . they over filled with freon . was not cooling at all . called them and they wanted to charge me again . what kind of customer service is that ! will never go there again . went to another a/c certified service professional and they told me it was over filled .	4528
0	2 stars only because of price . $ 82 for a simple mixed blend oil change on a standard 2010 toyota highlander . the service was fine and the facility is very nice but in my view these guys ( or jiffy lube ) have priced themselves out of the market . even for convenience it is over priced . i can go to a dealer with a coupon ( and they always have coupons ) for almost half this price . sad .	4528
1	currently building my first fixie and chris / tim have been super helpful . helped me find the right parts for my old road bike and ordered them for me . really excited to get started on this build !	4529
1	ca n't thank them enough ! they took excellent care of my bike . very friendly and helpful .	4529
0	the attendant was really smug and snobby about biking . i did not like his attitude .	4529
0	not a bike shop for common folk . this place is hard core cycling only . i tend to agree with other reviewers ... staff can be a bit arrogant , and seem way to serious ! lots of potential to reach out to the public and new clients in charlotte and surrounding areas however this place seems to operate as more of a competition cycling training center than a retail store .	4529
1	hands down the most beautiful art pieces i 've ever seen with my own eyes . i could not afford any of it but hey ! nothing wrong with looking , right ? lol i ca n't say what the staff is like , being that i never got past saying , `` hello '' to them . they did say hello and they flashed a beautiful smile lol . i wish i could have all the art pieces !	4530
1	the best art gallery i 've ever seen . it 's also my first yelp review and i just need to write it down . if i manège to make a fortune in the future it 's the definitely the place i will be back for .	4530
0	a physician walked into the store this weekend and was promptly asked to leave . she was told that she could n't afford anything in the store and was not allowed in to browse ! great way to lose the support of this and several thousand fellow physician moms . any good sales associate should watch pretty woman and be trained to appreciate that one should not judge a book by its cover .	4530
0	artwork is beautiful but felt like they did n't want to talk to me bc they assume i could n't buy the item . not throwing down 7 grand on an item ( which i love ) if the customer service feels i 'm not worthy of customer service bc they feel i ca n't afford it . should n't have to come to you . when i step in i should be acknowledged . wo n't be here again . oh yea , looks are deceiving . remember that next time you rude folks think you know someone 's bank account by how you think they look .	4530
1	a previous garage door company , failed to show up . i found a authentic in the foothills focus . i called and asked them if they installed equipment purchased elsewhere , and they said they did . they were a little higher priced , but at this point , i wanted the thing installed . it was saturday morning . the woman said someone would be out between 10a and 11a . at 9:30a , geoffrey arrived . he could n't have been nicer . walked through all the steps . took the old opener down . installed the new one . programmed the remotes and we were up and running in less than 90-minutes . great customer service and they did what they promised .	4531
1	darrell provided excellent service and replaced coils , gears and adjusted garage door so that now we barely hear it opening and closing . we will keep this company as our official garage door service contact .	4531
1	scheduled an appt from a flyer i received in the mail and they were promptly there at the arranged time . very knowledgeable in fixing my garage sensors/wire connections . very professional and reasonable prices . i would use them again !	4531
1	i have to say it 's a sunday morning and my garage spring broke . i called a tot that it garage door service and they were out within the hour to fix my garage door . jp was very courteous and very informative and got the job done well . definitely would recommend this to anybody who needs repair service on the garage . thank you for the great service	4531
1	called today and jp ( jason ) came out on time and thoroughly went over everything with me . he was very professional and very knowledgeable on product and how to perform the repairs . he explained everything he was doing and why and how to maintain it for lasting results . the cost was reasonably and i would definitely use them again .	4531
1	i called to get the spring on our door replaced and was fortunate to have mike at our home within one hour . he quoted a price and went to work . mike made sure everything was working perfectly with the door . fast , fair , ethical .	4531
1	the a-authentic technician , billy f. was punctual . he tuned-up our garage door . he did an excellent job ... and the price is right ! ! he is professional , courteous , and amiable . i highly recomment this company .	4531
1	jt did a wonderful job , fixing our garage door . thank goodness for valu pak that had their flyer a-authentic garage door service co. ! bbb a+ rating this is a great company with jt handling all of our needs , saved us alot of time and money . our garage door works so smoothly now it 's like it 's brand new . thank you so much jt , we appreciate your business !	4531
1	great customer service . these guys are great . always prompt and eager to help . christopher really knows his stuff and was able to help me reset my new wifi to my phone app . he was patient ; kind ; and funny . we have used them a few times now and would 100 % recommend .	4531
1	just had my garage door repaired by patrick . he was top-notch . personable , professional and explained everything to me . here 's to hoping i do n't have more garage issues - but if i do , he made me a returning customer ! highly recommend	4531
0	the service call was because neither remote control was working . this fixed , the technician suggested he install new nylon rollers to replace the metal ones , that these new ones would last much longer and the metal ones were wearing out . i wondered outloud whether this was the reason the operation of the door is always so loud ( even when properly lubricated ) . the technician told me , yes , the door would be quieter after the new installation . $ 119.40 later the door sounds exactly the same . i was up-sold unnecessarily and , therefore , have been taken .	4531
0	called and had a appointment set up to have our garage door fixed for saturday . we were told to expect a service person between 4-7 pm . we had no one show up and no one call to cancel or reschedule . very upset at the poor customer service .	4531
0	they up sell you on everything , then present you with a bill 0f 1150 dollars on a garage door opener that they advertise for 269 dollars , do n't use them unless you like high pressure and high prices . he would n't take a 75 dollar coupon they had in the mail .	4531
0	springs broke , guy comes out , tells my wife we need new springs , ball bearing rings and rebuild will cost $ 550 . two other companies quote $ 180 . the guy at a a gets angry and says that they are n't using warranted parts and he 'll file complaints against them . the other companies do use warranted parts and i 'm not sure how he 'd file a complaint without knowing who the other companies are anyway . these guys oversell what is needed and charge double for the same service . we paid the $ 65 svc fee and asked them to leave . avoid this company .	4531
0	our garage door opener is old and we 're tired of just fixing it . we contacted a authentic , told them we wanted a new opener and scheduled an appointment . the technician arrived as scheduled , after a brief discussion of the reason for appointment , the technician apologized and told us the only opener on the truck was one of a authentic 's most expensive . we did not get a new opener or reschedule with a authentic .	4531
0	they replaced the broken springs adequately . however , they told me the door closed down too far , so they adjusted it . in the weeks that followed i got all sorts of debris in my garage because there was a gap between the door and the concrete . i called to inquire ( not complain ) about it four times ... .and was never called back . i would never use this company again . triple b came out and adjusted the door properly ... i should have called them originally .	4531
0	rep was very polite and actually early for the appointment . the reason for the low ratings is due to prices and i he up sale . needing a new opener leading needing a total of $ 1208 for repairs . when i told him that was way too much he told me there was a $ 65 service fee . i explained that if i had been told about that when i called that was fine , however this was the mention of it and i would not be paying it . my last words are beware and shop around .	4531

0	technician was informative , responsive and helpful . the work was quick and efficient for typical door servicing . the cost i believe was much too high . i will not use this company in the future .	4531
0	no stars for this company that tried to charge me $ 1000 for a whole new door when all i wanted was a spring replaced . never paid them a dime and called a1 and they replaced both springs and adjusted the door and were wonderful .	4531
1	i got the sexy bikini wax - cost $ 39.55 taxes in . i usually go to the location on queen st. w ... but thought i would check out the location on yonge uptown . super happy with the results . clean space , nice staff , efficient + quick service , great wax . i 'll definitely be back . !	4532
1	i got my full legs done . no complaints on my end . it was quick , the pain was minimal , and i had zero issues with skin irritation . would 've gotten 5 stars if it was slightly more affordable .	4532
1	i 've been coming here for just about a year and i ca n't say enough great things . if you want the job done right and fast ... see nayeska . i 'm moving out of toronto but i will literally come straight here when i visit just to see her ! !	4532
1	fan member for a few months now . been serviced by more than four different people and all have been very professional . what i like most about fuzz is how warm and welcoming it feels . the staff is really down to earth and do their best to help you feel comfortable . all the rooms i 've been to have always been imaculately clean and lemon fresh . all the services i came for have been speedy , thankfully . there 's two different types of waxes they use and they explain it to you when you 're there . the quality of the results is in the 90 % to 100 % range . great experience overall and i 'll keep coming back !	4532
0	terrible . simple upper lip and eyebrow wax resulted in skin being torn off . wrong wax and wrong strips used on face area . the aesthetician tore skin off my eyelids . horrific experience .	4532
0	inexperienced ! ! simply dreadful ... .waxed ... .hurt ... .scarred ! ! !	4532
0	i wish i could give this place 0 stars . it is truly awful . they gave me a severe bacterial infection from waxing my armpits which i had to go on antibiotics to clear up . horrible experience and the customer service following was even worse .	4532
0	expensive and their wax technique is mediocre . the lady broke all my hair instead of removing them ( and i do n't have a lot ! ) then i realized i still had hair on several spots , she told me to remove it by myself at home with a tweezer . ca n't believe it . very messy technique , way too expensive for the service .	4532
1	excellent ... excellent ... .excellent . i go to dr. linder for botox and fillers . she is an artist . never overdoes it and i always come out looking refreshed instead of over-filled . i have my standing appointment with her for the last 3 years and would never go to anyone else .	4533
1	i am writing this review hoping it wo n't violate the tos . i was present at the appointment for my father . he had some concerns about moles and through yelp i found dr. linder . she was amazing ! kind and caring and her staff was very pleasant . we did n't have to wait long for the appointment ( 3 weeks ) and we were in the waiting room for about 10 minutes . she seems to be very busy but as a patient it does n't seem to affect . also , unlike other derms in my experience she did not try to `` sell '' services or products . great dr !	4533
1	dr linder is awesome ! ! i highly recommend , oh wait she 's not taking new clients : ( sad for you .	4533
1	i got an email from the dr. linder 's office and it was professional and caring . i really appreciate it and love seeing businesses that really care . i 'm going to give them another shot .	4533
1	dr linder is the best ! i am so very impressed with my results ! i 've been going for a few months now and i have much more comfortable in my own skin ( literally ) ever since my first consultation it 's gotten better and better !	4533
1	i had a chemical peel and it was great . no redness or discomfort after . everyone there was very professional and dr. linder answered all of my questions thoroguhly . highly recommend her .	4533
1	i saw dr. linder to have six moles removed from my face and neck that had been bugging me since , well , forever . my main concern that there would be scars left in place of the moles , but i need n't have worried . she was absolutely wonderful - she made sure that there was no pain , carefully explained what i needed to do after the removal , and best of all the results were amazing ! it 's only been a few weeks and i can barely see where they used to be . dr. linder specializes in very advanced skin cancer surgery but is also a master of cosmetic procedures . i would recommend her to anyone .	4533
0	i would give them zero stars if i could . i called and was told they were so busy that they triple book and to expect to wait an hour in the waiting room for your appointment . why would anyone want to go to this place ? i have never encountered such rudeness . the receptionist was condescending and belligerent . do not waste your time calling . instead i called dr. walter on pima road who was so wonderful , kind and respectful . call her instead . you wo n't regret it .	4533
0	`` hello , dr. linder 's office . '' me : `` hello , i 'd like to schedule an appointment with dr . linder . '' `` okay . have you ever seen dr. linder before ? '' me : `` no , i have n't . '' `` okay , what were you hoping to schedule an appointment for ? '' me : [ explanation regarding my reasons for scheduling an appointment ] '' i 'm sorry . dr. linder is not accepting any new patients at this time . '' me : `` okay , so ...	4533
0	wow ... had a referral from my doctor . called and was told that dr linder is not accepting any new patients . the one other doctor in the practice is scheduling for next june ! ! that 's right , june 2018 ... 8 months from now ! the receptionist seemed offended that i do n't want to wait that long . will be letting my doctor know to stop referring her ! ! ! ! !	4533
0	called and asked if i could make an appointment with dr. linder . i was told by the receptionist that she is not taking new patients except for cancer surgery . i noticed there are two other md 's mentioned on her website . the receptionist did not mention if they are available . why on earth if there are no appointments for general dermatology , do they even have the services listed on the website . they could simply put up a notice that they are not accepting new patients .	4533
0	i hear amazing thingsabout dr. linder and i must say front desk is the nicest but today i spent an hour and half waiting to be seen and ended up leaving before i got called back . i 'm not sure if this place is for mostly non working individuals but certainly does not a fit for my schedule . bummer .	4533
0	i had to wait 55 minutes to see the dr. people at the front desk were not polite and their billing department is just horrible . i have a ppo and dr linder 's billing department sent a claim to my insurance co using the wrong group number so the claim got rejected and i got billed for the full balance . i had to call the dr 's office a couple of times and asked them to re-send the claim . for a 2nd time they made another mistake when they billed the insurance co . i got a 2nd bill . dr linder this is a lot of work for me . a waste of time .	4533
0	i went in to get laser done for broken capillaries and she burned my face with the laser . said it broke . i have a permanent dark spot on my left cheek and still have broken capillaries . she charged me for this and said they 'd call me when the laser was fixed . they did n't call but i would be too scared to have her try again anyway .	4533
1	she did a great job hemming my bridesmaid 's dress with a quick turn around ! will be back for other alterations .	4534
1	have been a customer of pv tailor for 2 years . ali was the only one ( first used the tailor at the tailor at the ralph lauren store in phoenix ) who was able to make a leather blazer fit me properly . i have since brought many items to her , and she has always done an excellent job . have also found her to be pleasant and personable . i highly recommend her .	4534
1	my daughter need 2 pairs of jeans and a pair of running pants done with a quick turn around so she could return to college after the holidays . she was professional and quick . a bit disorganized ( could n't find things ) , but her work is extremely well done and she was quite friendly .	4534
1	i really do n't know what this people are talking about . i have been her costumer more than 3 years now and never had any problems .	4534
1	hello , i have to say that my experience with pv tailoring has been a very pleasant one ! i have received top notch treatment and am very pleased with the work and attention to detail on my garments . ali is an absolute doll and extremely helpful . she always manages to squeeze me in and get my items done on time ! i would recommend pv tailoring to all ! it is in a desirable location and the hours are quite convenient . parking is easy too ! hope this helps all of you new to the area or whatever your needs may be !	4534
1	the nice lady running the store is amazing ! i lost tones of wight and did not realize how big my tuxedo was for me . long story short , she rely did a great job in less then a day and more impotently she relay was awesome and caring .	4534
1	did a great job on a leather blazer style jacket and school uniform skirts . priced right , done on time and quality work .	4534
0	rude ! ruined my daughters brand new prom dress ! snagged it then tried to get snags out with hot iron/steam but now the dress has oil like stains all over it . my daughter has been crying for days and we may have to buy a new dress and prom is in 4 days . lady would n't come out to talk to us , she 's hiding from us and she took our money and wo n't return it . do not use this tailor	4534
0	lousy ! rude but most importantly she butchered my pants ! do not use	4534
0	horrible , stay away ! over charges and rude . my item was not ready when she said it would be finished . she did n't even know which item was mine as she did not label it . unprofessional owner .	4534
0	this is the worst tailor ! she is a fraud ! she charged $ 194 to fix 2 suits and all she did was hem ! both suits still fit the same ! ca n't even read her own writing ! ca n't remember her promises ! she called me stupid for telling her that she did n't do what we paid her for ! threatened to call the police because i wanted my money back ! do not go here ! ! !	4534
0	rude , rude and even ruder . i agree with the other comments on yelp . one item was done well , the other was not , and one pair of pants was taken in at least an inch too much . work is never done as promised and then she blames it on the customer . i am not going here any longer . too many problems .	4534
0	this is the worsttailor i have ever used . i took an expensive formal pants in to have them hemmed . when i picked them up and looked at the hem i could not believe my eyes . the hem was hacked off , very uneven , with threads hanging off everywhere . when i tried them on at home the hem came completely out of one side . the black pants were filthy like they had been tossed on the ground when done . no wonder they make you pay up front and in cash . i will never walk through their doors again . i only wish i had read the yelp reviews before i used this tailor .	4534
0	rude , just very rude . i had a new pair of pants tailored there . there were notable wrinkles on them , and i expressed my concern . in response , she started lecturing me and claimed that she did this type of job everyday and all tailored pants looked like this . she then asked me if i have ever had any pants tailored before , and why i brought my pants to her shop rather than had them tailored when i bought them ! i was speechless ... . i hope i 've read the comments on yelp earlier .	4534
1	joanie did a wonderful job on my wedding gown . she took her time and carefully altered my dress exactly the way i wanted it . it was a tough task and she handled it like a pro .	4535
1	great experience . staff was welcoming and friendly . fitter was patient and very helpful . they were able to accommodate my request to have my dress altered quickly and really made me feel like a valued customer . would recommend them highly .	4535
1	been here several times . had some alterations done and some shirts done had some dry cleaning done . they do a satisfactory job . i guess as good as you can expect . the one issue i have is mornings it seems to get backlogged and i 've actually seen five or six people waiting to be served . not a big deal i usually leave come back later in the day . i will continue to use this facility .	4535
1	needed some dress pants altered . i was in and out in under 20 minutes ! always great service .	4535
1	i 'm really unsure why this place has such low reviews - maybe it 's the phenomenon of people only writing reviews of places that provide services when they want to complain ? i stopped in today to get a pair of pants hemmed , and everyone there was friendly and helpful , and the pants look great . and they hem them in only 30 min ! i was able to run a couple errands , come back , get my pants , and wear them the same day ! i 'll probably be back for dry cleaning , or if i have anything else that needs hemming . it 's not super cheap , but for the quality and speed , definitely worth it .	4535
1	extremely professional workmanship on their product and i was thrilled they could get my dress pants ( 3 pair ) let out by the following day ( for a nominal up-charge ) . very friendly folks when i picked them up this afternoon . i would give them 5 stars except their prices are pretty high , but again , great workmanship , and the folks at drop off were a bit less-friendly and unsure if they could help me . bottom line : i 'll use them again and i trust them .	4535
1	i am also surprised by the negative reviews . i have had nothing but great experiences each and every time i visit . suit alterations , to pants needing hemmed , to extra starch on my shirts when getting them dry cleaned and pressed . amazing service and great attitudes even when i show up 15 minutes before they close as i work late some nights . quick turn around time and excellent prices will keep me coming back ! keep it up !	4535
0	the staff was really rude to my daughter , they act like they did n't want to touch her ! they said they could n't help her so we ended up leaving and sending her dress back one week before her 21st birthday never going back again ! ! ! !	4535
0	this is a damn lie ! ! ! i 'm trying to figure out why it is called express when they took almost 3 weeks to fix my dress . when i called they did n't even start it and then could n't locate it ! told me they would call back ... did n't ! the lady then told me another week until i told her i have to leave town for the wedding which i said when i dropped it off ... so if you want express this is n't it ! i 'll never come back . alterations express but tara did amazing but the other people who work there needs customer service ! ! ! ! ! !	4535
0	rudest customer service ever . they messed up my pants and still charged me extra for something they forgot the day before my wedding reception . when i said that they should work with me because i would n't have paid $ 50 to have my pants hemmed , she said all i can do is a 10 % discount and it could be longer than a half hour . i also saw her being blunt with other customers . go somewhere else .	4535
0	this is my second review , seamstress read directions wrong and cut my pants wrong , if they cant read right how can they sew things,2 pair of pants not the way they suppose to be , wan na make money but cant do job right ... .	4535
0	brought my service dress to alterations express for taper alterations and dry cleaning . the seamstress was thorough and did a nice job . dry cleaning service was abysmal and all 4 of my shirts and jacket will have to be redone when i arrive at my next duty station . two shirts were starched and two were not . the short sleeve shirts had dozens of wrinkles in them . there was also a 40 % up-charge for `` express '' 3 day service . 40 % . the alteration service was good and the staff was helpful , but i can not recommend this place to anyone in the military . save yourself the 160 $ and warm the iron up .	4535
0	i spoke with a lady on the phone asking if i could come in and be measured for a wedding dress i was strongly thinking of buying online to make sure it would fit . the lady was very rude and said , `` well , if you 're actually a size 2 , it will fit and you can just come in with it after you bought it and we will tailor it for you . we are n't a custom shop , we do n't help customers take measurements '' she also told me to stop talking because i was giving her too much information and she was busy . rude .	4535
0	the first time i went to get something altered i was very happy with the result . went back again and spent a lot of money between a significant amount of alterations and dry cleaning . 2 out of 3 of the items i had altered and paid for they just simply did nothing to them . did n't fix them , but charged me for the work . just flat out did n't do them . some of the items of clothing that i had dry cleaned were shrunk .	4535
1	just talked to a dude named tj . super helpful on the phone . will be by to make a purchase tomorrow .	4536
1	this location of leslie 's is tucked in a strip shopping center on hwy 51 in between a bar and a gym . while the shopping center is sort of old and run down , for a pool supply store , it 's definiltey not a bad location . they stock everything you need to keep your pool running year-round ... .from chemicals to cleaners to pump/filter replacement parts , this is my go-to store . the employees are helpful and if i need something not in stock , they 're happy to order it for me .	4536
1	knowledgable and very helpful . almost did n't go because of bad reviews . i suspect the bad reviewers are more likely the problem . prices are a little higher than amazon , but you can get your stuff today . worth the extra to me .	4536
1	the team at this leslie 's has always been wonderful to work with , professional , and helpful ! as a new pool owner , i really do n't have much of a clue as to pool chemistry and pook care , but the team here always takes the time to work with me and my wife to get it right ! we are customers for life !	4536
0	service was poor . prices much higher than needed to be . better prices on amzn or elsewhere .	4536
0	customer service is very poor , as they do n't serve people as they come into store . profile also was n't updated after being in four times in last two weeks and having had a tech out . i 'll be going to oasis	4536
0	saturday june 18th approximately 2 o'clock p.m. walk-in and they were busy stood in line and they allowed people that came in after me and another lady and allowed them to jump the line and then their excuse was they were buying something . i could n't believe what i was hearing they were complete assholes to this lady and i will never be there again i understand getting frustrated when they 're busy but their excuse for allowing people to jump the line was no excuse in my book . headed to backyard pools the next time i need something pool related .	4536
0	i will not purchase with this company . tried to get a price match which they guarantee , they wanted to add tax which would bring the product up another $ 18 . i told them the other company did not charge tax or shipping , but they said they had to charge tax so i asked them to figure the tax in and calculate the price accordingly , he refused . i talked to the online order manager after holding almost an hour to get help online . they were short and snappy with me . i do not like this company .	4536
1	this dealership was great to work with and eliminated all of the bs that you normally get from the big franchise dealers in the valley . they gave me a great price on my trade in and a very good price on my new car . they also came up with creative and cost-efficient solutions to a couple items that appeared in a after purchase inspection of the car . they are great to work with , fast response and very affordable . i have no problem doing business with them again in the future .	4537
1	buying a car from jeff at jba was the most please take car buying experience i have ever had ! he was honest and never rushed us ! when it was time to do the paper work he was quick and made the process painless ! highly recommend ! they also have a great selection of cars ! ! !	4537
1	i just recently purchased a range rover from jeff at jba motors . if i could give this company more than 5 stars i would . this dealership has an amazing selection of high end cars to choose from . jeff was an honest and helpful car dealer . he made the process of buying a car smooth and fast . all in all it was a great experience and i left completely happy . i will definitely be buying more cars from him in the future !	4537
0	really odd place . called in advance to see if a specific car was available , i was told it was , and when i got there the car was n't there . one employee told me the car was auctioned off , another gave me a broad answer that the car was being driven , and had n't been auctioned ... whatever that means . nobody took accountability for having me drive all the way there for no reason , and i never even got a straight answer about the car 's availability .	4537
0	be aware of this dealer ! sold me a piece of crap car that i had to invest another $ 4,500 a month after i purchased a car from them ! they 're such a scam very shady to deal with ! biggest mistake of my life was purchasing a car from this dealer ! jake barely responds to your needs . do yourself a favor do not buy from this dealer believe me you 're going to get burned ! the add was amazing and he never told me about the problems that the car had ! since we were in different states and miles away i could n't do much ! not reliable dealer be careful from this dealership !	4537
0	i called earlier inquiring about the rolls royce drophead . telling them the truth that the vehicle is going under my wife 's name but obviously will be driving it . with attitude and no customer service the piece of shit told me oh we can not do that you have to be on the loan . lol i have purchased many vehicles as many couples do the vehicle does not have to go on both names only the insurance does ! dude is a loser and needs to learn before giving false information . good luck on moving that drop head !	4537
1	i live nearby and decided to come get a facial here and it was amazing ! best facial i 've ever gotten . i 've gotten multiple facials here and both the estethicians , megan and callijah , are very skilled and knowledgeable . i actually get results here ! ! my skin has improved a lot since getting facials here ! front desk staff and management is super friendly and professional .	4538
1	everyone is amazing here ! from the minute you call until you leave , you are treated like royalty ! a special shout out to amanda , my massage therapist , and to megan my esthetician = ) .	4538
0	this place is horrible management does n't care she was so rude she was so worried about me getting on social media bc she prob knows this problem happens a lot five mins late is n't the end of the world ! ! do n't try to delete negative comments like u do with ur facebook ! ! makes u look even worse ! ! dear ck if ur employee explained it to me that i would be minus 5 minutes i would have been okay with it she made it seem like 15-20 mins	4538
0	do n't set up an account here they will take your money close your account when you want to and keep it there are no refunds !	4538
1	my experience here has been amazing . rented twice from this location . once as a pickup and once a drop off and each time it 's been great . it does take a while sometimes , but that 's understandable , given the time of day and it 's an rv , not a car rental . never felt rushed and everyone was nice and polite . had minor issues with the rv , but again , it 's an rv . haha	4539
1	easy to rent and great idea to do this first if you are thinking of buying one . easy to rent online and all the fees are shown . i would do it again . they include insurance and roadside assistance unlike most of the other rv rentals . i wish they came with an awning and kitchen stuff was my only complaint . there is a walmart close by so you can load up there .	4539
1	three times i 've used cruise america with 0 issues . truly exceptional . small rv problems , but cruise america made it right ! highly recommended ! ! ! !	4539
1	we rented a 30 ' motor home for a three week trip and found that the rig was clean when we picked it up and was very comfortable inside . the ford powered rig ran perfectly for our 3,000 mile trip . the staff was pleasant and answered all our questions . we would recommend cruise america , mesa , if you want to try an rv .	4539
1	we had a 27 foot rental and it fit 3 people with lots of space . it was easy to use for first timers . the customer service at the flagstaff rental location was excellent . we had no issues with our unit and we able to pick up and drop off as early as 7am .	4539
1	the service was friendly , charming and casual . the staff created a comfortable environment , which was the perfect way to set the tone for our vacation . since this was my first time renting an rv john was very patient and accommodating in showing me how everything works and refilling the necessary tanks . thanks john and jackie . see you soon .	4539
1	rented an rv for a week to grand canyon and sedona . granted it took about 30 min to get our unit ( but there was a major event going on and the staff was a bit overwhelmed ) . once we checked in , the staff was extremely pleasant and the rv super clean . would highly recommend renting from them .	4539
0	i 'm not impressed with this company . i live in oc , california and my parents came here on holiday from europe . they booked an rv for the whole family , and we were really excited to go on an rv trip in california . the booking went through , but then my dad got an email from a reservation specialist `` your id verification was denied , i have cancelled '' . they didnt bother calling and explaining what went wrong . simply cancelled and that was that . we called and the answer is sorry we dont know what went wrong.the family trip is ruined . thank you cruise america ! ! !	4539
0	the local branch is n't so bad but the business it 's self is like a horrible service , they will not work resheduling . the 1 800 number is the worst customer service . please rent from anyone else	4539
0	these people are rude and non-customer oriented . watch out for hidden fees ie ; house keeping , extra mileage , contract closure date , propane tank fill , generator run time ... .on and on and on . a/c barely worked , heater did n't work at all . we were told to go buy a small space heater . turned in rv under mileage and spotless , the facility i rented from did n't check in for two days and i was charged an additional 40 $ . crappy service gets crappy ratings . not to mention , the beast we rented at 7 miles to a gallon cost over a thousand dollars in fuel .	4539
0	awful experience with the company ! ! ! ! ! ! rv was in terrible condition . when we returned the rv to the spokane , wa the employees refunded the wrong credit card and they will not fix the issue . i am out $ 258.00 because of their employees laziness ! ! ! ! ! ! find another place to rent from . you can not talk to anyone in customer service only through email . what kind of customer service is that ? if i could give a negative rating i would ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4539
0	had an appointment to pick up rv at 1 pm ... .they did n't have our size cleaned yet . we waited 1 hour & 45 minutes ... .what ? there was no option offered to us to upgrade from the parking lot full of other ready rvs . the manager lady needs to be trained on good customer care . i am renting from cruise america and paying them ... the customer should be the priority .	4539
0	booked my rv and was told via the website that i could come to the reservation desk anytime between 1 and 4pm . upon my arrive i sat down and waited . after a a while i asked how long and they said do you have an appointment ? i said no , i was never told that i needed to book one . other people in the waiting room were also very upset . one of the staff said it could be hours and if i had things to do i should go and do them ! completely unacceptable and an absolute joke ! utterly ridiculous and horrific customer service !	4539
0	this company does not service their equipment very well . we had a hose break on the freeway on the way home , and after 9 hours , when we went to turn in the rv , the dealer was closed . i told them what happened , and he gave me a small refund , then charged me all these extra fee 's . i then wrote a letter in writing to customer service , and still no response after almost 30 days . i would not rent from them if i was you .	4539
1	the staff here are friendly and care about the customers . i had to get a card project done and i saw the ups store offers cheaper pricing than kinkos , so i went with them . the staff member there was kind enough to stay past store closing to help me get it done . i have not had customer service like that in a while !	4540
1	great service , very friendly , love the location . always able to drop my packages here with no worries . this is the best ups store i have ever used . will continue to do my business here . right in the walmart grocery parking lot .	4540
1	the guys working here are super friendly and helpful . they are also really quick on their feet . they do n't have a `` wait your turn i 'm busy '' nor `` that 's his job , i 'm doing something else right now '' attitude about their work . i can tell when the store gets a little busy they try to work faster and not make the customers wait long . this is how customer service should be . very satisfied , i always come here to drop off my packages . the best ups location i 've been to . keep it up ! thank you !	4540
0	beware beware beware they charge $ 12.50 for a book of 1st class stamps , which is not posted anywhere . did n't know that was permitted ? the guy at the counter said they do so well , they can charge more . how conceited is that . you can get stamps at walmart , when they have them , for less than $ 10 ! !	4540
0	do n't ship from here , they lost all the christmas presents i sent to my family and then have the nerve not to refund me the full shipping cost ! ! ! you lost the package morons it would be helpful if an adult worked at the store . post office from me from now on . if i could have given no stars i would have .	4540
0	this is my third time in to the store , and it will be the last time because of luigi . all three times that i have stepped into the store luigi has been very unfriendly , he 's never greeted me or exchanged any pleasantries . all he has is a blank stare on his face like you 're inconveniencing him coming in , so here 's a thought i will take my business a couple of businesses down in the same shopping center and give them my business .	4540
1	love this location ! i always get my car washed here and the gas prices are great ! tony is amazing !	4541
1	i know some folks are giving this spot a thumbs down because they do n't take credit cards but the gas prices are sweet . usually i go fill up at costco but its always a parking lot so discovered this new spot with almost identical prices and no huge line . the place is pretty clean inside staff varies between polite & bleh . but in the end makes my wallet happy .	4541
1	we need to buy gas on way to hooer dam . station looked very nice . after gas filling we pick a cup of coffee . station is clean , stuff was helpful . thank you for service .	4541
1	what happened to the 5cents off when u buy a car wash at the pump ? all the other locations with the splash n dash car wash do the 5cents off . make sure u ask the car wash attendant for a stamp card . buy 6 washes get a super shine $ 13 for free .	4541
0	after reviewing the video tape the employee did in fact take the paint off of the car with the high pressure hose .	4541
0	went to their carwash and the employees damaged my rims by putting a chemical on them before entering their car wash . the company and staff admitted fault on numerous occasions . they even had us get estimates for the repair . they then changed their minds and said they would not cover it . never take your car there ! ! ! they will damage your vehicle and pretend they will cover it and then change their mind after wasting your time .	4541
0	i purchased a car charger and actually held on to the receipt for about a month ... then washed my car and threw it away . of course now the charger is not working . well , i thought that for sure they will at least exchange without a receipt as most all retailers do . they did not ... per the manager . i was a frequent customer but will no longer be .	4541
0	horrible customer service during the week . especially in the evenings . very zombie like and non-responsive . i wish you could pay cash outside to eliminate interaction with them . clerks are friendlier during the weekends during the daytime .	4541
1	i own a soap business in california and i recently placed an order through ba online for over $ 1400 worth of product we needed . their product came in great quality and in a timely fashion . i dont know why there are so many bad reviews but i felt i should come on and say how great their stuff is ! shipment was supposed to get here yesterday but sat at the carriers center over night but thats not ba fault . great product great price will be stocking our inventory from them again soon !	4542
1	i have been ordering from bulk apothecary for about 3 years now and have never had an issue with any products or shipment . they are great , very professional , and products are quality . if i have questions or concerns customer service has always been kind and accommodating . they respond the very next day when i send emails after hours . do not listen to the negative comments ... see for yourself . they ship really fast , maybe because they are in ohio and i am in michigan .	4542
1	i ordered a small quantity of fragrance oil , lotion base and shea butter to try out a generic bath and body works scent that they offer . it is super close to the bbw scent that i love and my order arrived earlier than i had expected . i 'm excited to replace all of my gross parabeny lotions with this new stuff ! will order again	4542
1	i am a business owner and i rely on my distributors for quality products delivered to me on time . i am thrilled with bulk apothecary in every regard . their products are very good quality , their customer service is friendly and helpful and their shipments are very fast . a special kudos to kayla and angelica for being there for me when i needed your help ! highly recommend bulk apothecary - i give them 10 stars ! !	4542
1	got my complete order and within 4 days . i 'm happy about this . good quality product as well . i live in florida .	4542
1	i used bulk apothecary to provide customized lip balm products for an annual event we have . they included our color logo and name on both vanilla and raspberry lip balm . the product is very good , and the lip balm tubes look great . after reading a few negative reviews on shipping time i became concerned and did follow up a few times , and received the product in time for the event . ( the day before , so i am glad i followed up . ) their customer service was only a 3 or 4 out of 5 , the product is a 5 . ( i did not receive a return email or phone call . )	4542
1	great company and great products . i 've been ordering essential oils from bulk apothecary about 2 times per year for 2 years . my orders arrive within a week , packaged neatly and well packed . i have been happy with the quality and the prices ca n't be beat !	4542
1	had a very positive first-time buying experience from these folks . they shipped my order fast and everything was well packaged and of the quality they represented . the aluminum containers for the essential oils are especially nice . this was a large order ( over $ 600 ) and they absolutely nailed it . just placed a second order for more oil and fragrance . thumbs up !	4542
1	great company . i have used other companies as well to purchase essential oils for my skin care products and have been pleased . i have not had any problems with the order and i am currently looking into order more products . highly recommended .	4542
1	i have bought from ba several times . mostly no issues . stuff arrived promptly . the customer service is great . they are willing to address the issue and go the extra mile . i ordered closures of wrong size due to the website ( needs greater clarity ) . they were kind enough to give me a credit towards the right item . i will shop again .	4542
1	i sell essential oil blends . i use bulk apothecary to purchase 99 % of my eos . i find the prices very competitive to other companies . the smell of the eos are nice and i have had no complaints about my essential oil blends . the only problem i have had is they advertised a specific color ( amber ) in their 16oz bullet plastic bottles and i received an extra order of black without consulting with me first as the consumer . so now i am stuck with 100 16oz bullet plastic bottles instead of only 50 . color is very important on how we represent our variety of dog shampoos .	4542
1	i placed an order with bulk apothecary and *then* read reviews , many of which were not positive , so i became nervous . turns out my fears were unfounded because my experience was very good . my order was processed and shipped quickly . i placed an order on saturday and received it wednesday . all of the items appear to be of good quality . none of my items were out of stock . i will continue to order from bulk apothecary until they give me a reason not to .	4542
1	i am not sure what is up with all of these bad reviews . i order their products all the time and have never had a problem . i also order from a more expensive with , eden botanicals , from nature with love , and occasionally amazon vendors . i find their products and delivery time to be as good or better than the other vendors i order from . i will admit i have never dealt with customer service , as nothing has been wrong with my order . something seems not right about theses reviews ... .. competitor perhaps ? ? ?	4542
1	i almost did n't order from them after reading the reviews , but decided why not try . being i placed on my credit card i can always dispute the charge if i needed to . so i purchased close to $ 40 in bath bombs , they shipped out the next day and were quickly received , the box actually contained more than i ordered ! i am getting ready to place my second order of the items that were previously out of stock . i am confident i will be a return customer of bulk apothecary .	4542
1	for a bulk site they 're shipping is horrible , i was told they ship in 1-2 business days , my order has been awaiting shipping for almost 3 days now . customer service does not reply after there initial response . do not buy from them if you need supplies in a timely matter . update : ive ordered a few more times and have n't had any issues . i recently ordered during their black friday sale and my order was shipped and arrived quick . i was impressed !	4542
1	i 've been buying bulk raw products for making lotions and oils for the last year and have only had good experiences so far . but most of the products i buy are from a specific company so the stuff that bulk apothecary sells from other companies may not be as good - or they may be , i do n't know . most of my orders end up being from nature 's oil through bulk apothecary . the prices are reasonable and the products have been nice so far . shipping takes a little longer than amazon prime but i always receive my order in about a week or less when i do standard shipping .	4542
1	i bought a bulk of chapsticks for wedding favors . they arrived in less than a week and look great !	4542
1	my order came very fast . one product lid was damaged . i sent an email and the very next day had a reply stating they would send a replacement and then an email letting me know that it had shipped . will order from them again .	4542
1	fascinated by the extremely negative reviews for this company because that is the opposite of my experience . i have ordered multiple items from them and have always received my stuff in a timely manner and in great condition . they have really good prices for their products . i bought 1 pound of dead sea salts for $ 3.99 , ca n't beat that . they also have a good variety of essential oils and herbs and they are also priced nicely . will definitely be buying more items from them soon .	4542
1	excellent quality herbs and oils for great prices . i have made products with oils for 10 years . its hard to find good quality these days . this is it ! super happy ! !	4542
1	i love this place we get our essential oils here , there prices are good , , and had labels done , although it took longer than it was suppose to they really came out nice for our ministries . be kind to them and im sure they will do there best to get the order placed and properly sent to us..patience is a virtue..and learned wisdom .	4542
1	these oils smell great and the delivery was quick . i 'm applying them to my skin and using them for my diffuser . i have n't had any adverse reactions . i put the oils in my bath , wear as perfume and disperse in the air around . not sure what 100 % pure fragrance oils means exactly , but i do like the way they smell .	4542
1	after my first time ordering i was happy with my product and decided to try again . no problems this time and my oils are great .	4542
1	i have been using this company for several years . i can not figure out why they are receiving such bad reviews . i have never had a problem ordering or receiving my products and everything has been fresh and in perfect condition . i have bought oils , and ingredients to make soaps and candles . i have purchased oils from `` those '' other companies , and i have thrown them out sooner than my ba oils because they go rancid so fast and cost at least twice as much . bulk apothecary is a great company , has an amazing selection .	4542
1	bulk apothecary got me my products super quick and without hassle . a quick google search brought me to their site . they have the lowest prices on essential oils and soap making supplies around . i 've been nothing but pleased with my orders and have been ordering from them for the last 7 months . a+ !	4542
1	they ship fast and item exactly as shown on web page..my 3rd time buying and i will buy again ... bruce in ladson , sc	4542
1	i have not had a bad experience with bulk apothecary . i find their prices are very good , and the products have arrived on time and intact . i have placed about 15 orders with them over the past 2 years , the biggest problem for me is the shipping . i have to get organized enough to place fewer , larger orders instead of several small orders . otherwise , i think they are a great supplier .	4542
1	i 've had great experiences ordering from this company , so i really ca n't empathize with the kvetchers . i ca n't speak for others , no , but my orders have all arrived swiftly , and have been exactly as i ordered them . all of my orders , too , have been packed with care . huge thumbs up from me !	4542
0	asked a simple question about the product being sold . my question related to the nature of where the products are being made and or where the origin of the ingredients are from . received a vague answer with no solidity or any help . the answer received was them telling me that they are only a supplier and have no clue where everything is made or where the origin is , kind of tough to make and sell products and try and explain where my products originally come from . will shop somewhere else .	4542
0	their site boasts about more potent fragrance oils , i used them in some candles and they were hardly fragranced at all . for the price i can get way better oils else wear that actually are more strongly scented . and surprise surprise , my review on their site was never posted .	4542
0	terrrrrrrible quality ! i ordered the lavender oil . it takes 10 times the amount of their product to equal the potency of dotera or other providers of lavender oils . wtf ! what a waste of money .	4542
0	be careful of the liquid volume of your order . i have around 17 orders of their essential oils in 2 oz amber glass bottles . those 2 oz bottles are as expected , top grade concentrate . however , recently i purchased 16 oz quantities of a couple oils , they arrived in aluminum metal cans . these 16 oz `` essential oils '' were highly watered down versions of their 2 oz package counterparts . the strength was approximately only 1/3 of what they should be . this is a dishonest practice and they have lost a customer .	4542
0	for a bulk site there shipping is horrible , i was told they ship in 1-2 business days , my order has been awaiting shipping for almost 3 days now . customer service does not reply after there initial response . do not buy from them if you need supplies in a timely matter . update : first of all , to reply to the rep below , i placed my order on feb 26 . it says right on my account . dont make false responses to look better . i received no shipping emails ( none in spam ) and my account still says awaiting shipment . i had to contact you guys again for tracking .	4542
0	this company has definitely gone downhill since i first started ordering from them . i wo n't be ordering from them again .	4542
0	terrible quality that can take your business down . highly unrecommended to all businesses . and consumers as well .	4542
0	i have tried to log on to their site for 3 days now to order supplies but the site wo n't come up . i call them but when i spoke to the customer service rep she said the site was working and it was my internet that was messed up . she assured me the site was working and asked me to try again later . i tried to log on from home and work ... .the site is still down . i asked to see if they took phone orders and they do not . customer service is not helpful at all .	4542
0	horrible customer service some good items but customer service is horrible lost package and no one has gotten back to me about it . horrible . emails and phone calls that no one is responding to	4542
0	do n't order from this company . i placed an order in august . one item was left out . i contacted customer service and was told they would immediately ship it out . i waited a week and sent another email . no response . i tried calling several times and no one answers the phone . i filed a dispute with paypal , but still do n't have my money back . i tried to give a review on their website , but apparently they only accept positive ratings . i wish i had looked on yelp before ordering from them .	4542
0	worst company ever ! placed my first , oh and definitely last order with them . ordered a week ago . get an email today , oh , sorry we are out of stock - we 'll refund you in a few more business days ( so like next week ) . really ? how about you learn the first rule of business - do n't sell what you do n't have in stock ! chatted and called - basically got the run around . ugh , so frustrated ! good riddance !	4542
0	zero stars ! ! ! ! do not waste your time with bulk apothecary ! ! ! they dont keep track of their inventory specifically to get your money so they can move it around for themselves long before you are even notified that there is a problem with your order , they overcharge on shipping , they mislabel their products , their refunds can take longer than a month , & they truly have some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced . nick	4542
0	i will never purchase from this company again . this was my first order and their site said something was in stock and it really was n't . they gave me a partial refund which i did not understand why . when i tried to speak with someone so that they could correct it they wanted to charge me more than i paid originally for the products to be shipped . never again . horrible company !	4542
0	horrible customer service , originally ordered a material without being notified of it being out of stock . charged my card without ever being notified and had to call in to cancel order when it never showed . later , ordered again against my better judgement , and when shipping had issues , took so long to inform me that i had to cancel order again . customer service was terrible to talk to every time . please avoid at all costs .	4542
0	do not buy here ! very unethical business . they sell fake e.o and claim that they are therapeutic grade ! i bought some argan oil and it has a bad petroleum smell.. i spent almost $ 150 there.. all the oils i bought ended up in garbage !	4542
0	i agree with kathleen , orders are placed then it takes more than 20 days to just ship and process , i 've still yet to receive my package for a whole month now , very irritating . please , do n't purchase products from them .	4542
0	what happened to you bulk apothecary ? i have ordered from you for years but i ca n't anymore because your massage oils now have mineral oil in them ( a distillation product of crude oil ) and your massage lotions all have parabens ( a carcinogenic preservative ) . do n't you realize the virtues of natural skin care products , for the clients and the therapists ? please revise your formulas and i will continue to buy from you .	4542
0	i went to the website oder some products from them , and the shipping cost is almost as much as my order , so i search if they have any promotion on shipping and i did found one and it rsaid if u order over 295 u get free shipping , but the code did n't work . so i decided to call and talk to this guy name corey . i had the most horrible customer services experience ever , he had no intention to help me and he claimed that he 's the customer services manager , but he was so rude and use this heavy tone to his client . ca n't believe a big company like that would hired somebody with no manner.f	4542
0	delayed shipment . wrong item sent . ca n't get return label as promised . not sure if refund is possible . extremely frustrated .	4542
0	most awful customer service especially for a first time buyer . caps do n't come with their bottles but it is unethical how they hide this is print next to case orders . i had to pay more for shipping the order of caps than the actual caps cost . requested free shipping but no it is my fault ! terrible company . they do n't even have caps in stock for the jars i purchased so oh well . do not shop here use uline they are accurate and professional .	4542
0	always out of stock , big holes in their inventory . order labels from them that they promised within 5 days , have n't even received .	4542
0	do n't buy from them , they have nothing in stock and you end up paying the shipping fee for items you never receive . they will cancel your order without notice and refund the money you pay not including the shipping you paid for that item without any apology or explanation . they 're a shame , many people have had that experience so stay away from them , that 's their business culture .	4542
0	i too have waited nearly 2 weeks for my order . now only about 1/4 of what i ordered got here and all the jars were thrown in a box , many upside down and many of them leaked all over everything . when i called to ask where the rest of our order was , they said something happened with that box ( wonder if the way they packed it had it leaking all over the delivery truck ) and they would have to reship . my personal experience is that this company is very unprofessional and scattered . their product is nice when we get it but the aggravation in dealing with them makes it difficult for us to consider reordering .	4542
0	smells more like a cucumber than the ocean . i 've been trying for a week and a half to write my review and something is wrong with the bulk apothecary web site . i ca n't post , when i click the submit button , it states e-mail address is incorrect . i 've called them several times and they keep saying they are working on it . i am beginning to think they do n't want to fix the customer 's ability to post a review . so , i 've decided to go on yelp .	4542
0	the problem : - bulk apothecary sent me the wrong caps to my jars and sent me the wrong candle mold . -2/3 of my orders have been incorrect -it has taken 3 calls to fix my order and is still not fixed . -it has been a month and they still cant get it right -girls in customer service do not care or fix anything , in fact sending an e-mail is too difficult . i am a small business owner and have lost sales due to bulk apothecary 's inability to perform at the most basic level . if you need to depend on your orders do not order from here . very disappointing . if i could i would do negative stars .	4542
0	placed an order from them and was not informed that they were out of the bottles that i needed and that is the reason that i placed the order . if they would have informed me that they were out , i would have reordered a different style of bottle . i ordered again ( big mistake ) , they were out of two different items that i needed ( lotion pumps and caps ) , was not notified that they were out again , plus they shorted me on 2 oz bottles . i have since emailed them to let me know the shortage and i am waiting on a reply . do not do business with this company !	4542
0	i just received an email one week after placing an order that they are out of a product and i was to be refunded . this is absolutely unacceptable . i depend on this company to deliver products for my business and i 'm continually let down . i 've paid for items and then days later been told they are out of stock . it takes extremely too long to process orders and get them out for shipping . i hope they make changes as they grow to keep up with the demand , before they piss everyone off .	4542
0	mr. gary p. do you have an email address where i can ask you a question before issuing an online review ? i 'm getting too many different answers from customer service reps . thank you , karen l. ( customer )	4542
1	i have a membership at this location . the front desk is always , quick , professional and pleasant . i recently saw michelle for a 2 hour , deep tissue massage , with sports activity focused ( hamstrings , quads , hip flexors , etc ) stretching prior to massage . michelle is awesome ! very knowledgeable , one of the most therapeutic massage i 've ever had .	4543
1	this location is wonderful . i have been a member since 2014 or earlier . i find all who work here professional and caring . from the moment i walk in to the goodyear spa i feel cared for and i find the therapists do address my needs - thanks . because of my move i needed help with my membership and aliza has been so helpful - thanks ! i now live in maryland and the spas here are just not the same . the md staff is not as warm and welcoming . looking forward to attending the spa when visiting my sister in goodyear !	4543
1	my husband and i look forward to our monthly treatments . i think we tried every massage therapist and have enjoyed them all !	4543
1	my experiences over the past 4 years at this location have been excellent . i have had different therapists over this period of time that were great . it takes time to try out various people to get a perfect fit ! i have always had great service at the front counter . i have only had professional experiences here and would highly recommend this location for massage therapy . the therapists have helped me through several health conditions . thank you massage envy .	4543
1	absolute nessecity as a scoliosis patient . i had a membership for a year . major improvements with mobility , and i even gained a half inch in height ( as part of a holistic program including chiropractor and home exercises . ) king of deep tissue is david ! when he is not avail jermain and ryan are excellent .	4543
0	if i could give massage envy zero stars in general for their obscene contract rules , i would . i lost way more money to this company than i care to admit and the best part , i do n't even get to use the services i 've already paid for . i feel completely swindled and tricked by this company and will never be returning again . i will never suggest massage envy to a friend or family member .	4543
0	do not get a membership here ! ! ! ! i cancelled my membership back in august 2014 , 9 months ago , and now i am getting harrased for not paying ! not only was i told i had to cancel in person , you have to cancel at the location you signed up at . i signed up at the avondalle location , went there to cancel , and they told me to go to the goodyear location ! what a poorly trained personnel and poorly operated company ! you get what you pay for !	4543
0	what are folks paying for memberships here ? seems to be much confusion and discrepancies in membership dues ? mine just went up $ 20/mo after being a member for 6 years with monthly massages . what are your monthly dues ?	4543
0	the therapists are excellent at this location . i have been happy with every one . the issue i have is with the front staff . they lose paperwork , have an attitude when you want to cancel , and are just rude . just the thing i want when i come out of a massage .	4543
0	this was a ok massage like eating at berger king $ 1.00 menu , your not at smash berger that is for sure . you can tell it is a franchise , the lmt are very green and all they want to do is up sell you , and then the front desk tries even harder . so if i was relaxed when i was done it all gone when checking out .	4543
1	this place is close and handy for me . they carry a variety of healthy foods . employees are friendly and always helpful . if you need gluten free , this is the place to go .	4544
1	considering that there is probably very little call for health food in tallmadge i think these guys have a decent store . they are n't big like the mustard seed or earthfare and their prices are higher but i assume they do n't get price breaks for buying in large quantities like the others . the day i went the employee at the register was friendly and had a genuine smile . i did n't ask for help from anyone on the floor so i ca n't say how that went but i was n't accosted by anyone either and i really appreciate that .	4544
1	i shop here twice a week . can find fresh organic produce and other natural items that giant eagle does n't carry . mostly , there pricing is less than others .	4544
0	i got sucked into the idea of organic and healthy food . however , beware of ready made deli foods . thee items are loaded with sugar and salt . the owners have gotten very arrogant over the years . i rarely go there anymore .	4544
0	http : //reviews.birdeye.com/seven-grains-natural-market-544881056 horrible owners , very unprofessional and rude . overpriced , mediocre produce .	4544

1	a+ quality knowledgeable team affordable prices allpro is one of the city 's biggest and most reputable paint company 's for a reason .	4545
1	thank you to gaby and miguel for the beautiful paint job in our home . they painted the entire interior of our home , new baseboards throughout , our front door and french doors on the patio . they give attention to every detail , have a strong work ethic and are respectful of your home . thank you to pete also !	4545
0	estimator was about 30 min late without calling . his professionalism was lacking ( `` hey man.. '' , `` yo.. '' ) and did not provide any other details other than his business card ( other professionals provided a folder with paint descriptions , their licenses , guarantees , and references ) . while their prices are comparable to other professionals , negative reviews have responses that deflect blame on everything but the company and/or their workmanship . i was not impressed with the estimator and is in fact the major reason we went with another company .	4545
0	do n't bother to give them a call they did a no show for an estimate not even a phone call to let me know horrible service	4545
1	i believe none of this crap . the people are very kind , and sometimes playful . there is one guy who is always serious , but he 's nice and professional . there is no smell , unless it is a scent from a customer . i 'm not sure why people are so awful and lie for no reason .	4546
1	i know this place gets a bad rap , but i had very good service there today . the manager was very helpful to me and saved my mailing issues immediately . they could be a tad bit happier to be working there , but i am sure it is a hard job . but they were great today !	4546
0	they understaff the counter which leads to overworked and stressed workers who have no desire to help anyone . there is always a huge line because of this . they treat customers like they are being bothered by our needs . no one ever smiles . it looks like they all hate their job . i go to post offices 5 times a week and every other branch has happy workers .	4546
0	do n't go here if you can help it . rude employees who have talked trash about a customer who had just left with her two kids . the employees looked at me like i 'm an idiot when something is n't done correctly . like this is my job . slow to boot . after going here a few times when i lived in lakewood , i tried to avoid it at all costs .	4546
1	for some odd reason cleveland ohio spirit airlines was on top of there game ... .3 out 4 gate agents were friendly ! ! ! just 1 needed midol . i had some issues with my ticket because they used my old info on my spirit number & they would n't let me enter so i had to change my reservation to my current name ... .it sucks being liz taylor & having a dozen diff husbands but yolo ! ! ! my next husband will have a private jet so i do n't have to deal with commercial flying	4547
1	i have no issues . affordable with no frills . have low expectations and you will be fine . we flew from cleveland to las vegas with zero problem . the seats were uncomfortable , but what airline is ? you pay for everything separate . so pack light , check your bags ahead of time , print your boarding pass early , and check in early . you 'll be fine . if you do n't read the fine print , expect a free drink , and think you can just come last minute without paying fees , you are in super trouble . i would fly spirit again .	4547
1	we flew round trip from cleveland to myrtle beach . flights were all on time , no delays and everyone was very friendly . our luggage fit under the seats with ease . this was overall a very positive experience for a very great price !	4547
0	zero stars ! ! ! i can not even fathom the ways they get you to pay for everything and anything ! ten dollars to print your boarding pass ? 20 to pick your seat . forty five for a carry on ? unreal . never again ! ! !	4547
0	can you give 0 stars ? ? this airline is a bait and switch operation that should be avoided at all costs ! if you happen to get vonda at the check-in window in cleveland then good luck , she 's a nasty piece of work herself who gets off on charging all those hidden fees . i hope this airline goes under and takes her with it ! thanks for nothing you nasty nasty woman .	4547
0	this airline sucks ! it says it 's on time on the board but online it says my flight is delayed 5 hours . we were meant to get on the plane at 12:16 . it is now past 1 o'clock , people are still in line to board , and they have yet to make a single announcement . i do n't recommend risking your time with this airline .	4547
1	i went on saturday june 3 because of abdominal pain . the wait was kind of long , but the np who treated me , jennifer , made it all worthwhile . she continued to follow up with me several times with the various test results and even called me today , two weeks later . normally at an urgent care facility , they treat you that once then immediately refer you to your own doctor for any follow-up care . not so with jennifer though , she has been outstanding in every way , both in her medical knowledge and her passion for caring .	4548
1	i was referred by my insurance company united health care . from start to finish the front desk , medical assistant and doctor was great . i would recommend this clinic to anyone .	4548
1	had to take my boyfriend to fastmed urgent care last week for an eye abrasion and the doctor was amazing ! ! it took us less than an hour to get a diagnosis and prescriptions . when we went to go see an eye specialist the next day , she told us that the urgent care did a phenomenal job in treating his eye and prescribing the right antibiotic . would totally recommend ! !	4548
1	first time at fastmed yesterday and it was a great experience . very quick to be seen , clean facilities , and all the staff was great . total time in the urgent care was under an hour which is awesome .	4548
1	i came here on a saturday night and the front desk staff helped me immediately . i filled out the paper work and before i could even sit down they called me to be seen by the physician 's assistant . he addressed my concerns and i rcvd a prescription . no issues at all . i would definitely return here for care .	4548
1	very nice , new and clean facility . multiple flat screen tvs and wifi access help while waiting . came in late on a tuesday and received prompt service . definitely recommend	4548
1	in and out in 20 ! now that 's the fastest med i 've ever been to . took my son in for a last minute physical before basketball tryouts . we usually go the fastmed on ray but we were in the tempe area and we 're pressed for time . because we had been to another fast med within the past year we did n't have to fill out all that paperwork which was super nice . pa cody was probably the most professional and knowledgeable pa i 've met at a fastmed . i 'd come back for that service without a doubt .	4548
1	i was pleasantly surprised by how quick the process was ! i completed all registration paperwork on my phone which was super easy and i was in and out in less than 20minutes . the medical staff and front office were super nice and knowledgeable . i am absolutely going back should i ever need quick help .	4548
1	had a great experience at this location recently . was seen quickly and the nurse practitioner that treated me listened , was knowledgeable , and resolved my concern quickly . i will definitely visit again when needing to get in right away .	4548
0	i have asthma and was having trouble breathing . i showed up 10 minutes before closing and was told they were not taking any more patients ... the lobby was empty . i explained to the young girl that i was having problems breathing to which she replied that all she could do was take my vitals . i was left to quickly find another urgent care to help me . mmmm ... so much for urgent care when you arrive before closing . perhaps they should close earlier and not give those in need of medical care false hope that they are truly open and ready to serve . anita w	4548
0	got hit on my bike a few days ago and as usual the pain started to get worse the longer i waited so thought i 'd check them out to see if they can help me ... mistake accuse me of using drugs to excess because i donated my kidney so because i saved some ones life i do n't deserve pain relief . screw this place never will go here or let anyone i know go here	4548
0	extremely slow service . i 've been waiting over an hour to do a simple drug screening for a new job..	4548
0	really ? thought that signing into there on online waiting list would help . appointment made for 10:30 am . show up at 10:15 . finally get called in at noon . signs all over lobby saying that they care about your time . obviously wrong name being called fastmed .	4548
0	not busy when i arrived . waited over an hour to see physician 's assistant . she was good . however , they never followed up with my results . not impressed at all .	4548
0	the young lady at the front was not friendly in effort enron put her head dawn at the front counter like she 's was too tired to work !	4548
0	this is the first review i have written , that 's how much i hate this place . they have the laziest front desk people i have ever met in my life . with a waiting room full of people they just talked to each other and did no work what so ever . i highly recommend never coming here ! literally , go anywhere but here !	4548
0	scheduled a 8am appt on a sunday so i could get in early and get on with my day . except for the receptionist , the staff slowly showed up between 8:10 and 8:15 . i expect a medical staff to be a little more professional .	4548
0	i 'd take my chances with a witch doctor before i came back here . the p.a . here gave me a prescription for the wrong dosage but i did n't find that out until i already paid $ 200 for the rx and later followed up with my pcp ( because the meds were n't working ) and she said that the dosage for this particular medication starts at 100 mg , i was given 25 mg and that 's too low to be effective for anyone . also , there 's absolutely no reason to do the online check-in , the receptionist admitted that to me . when i arrived there were three people ahead of me and i waited two hours .	4548
1	very good used auto parts store local to glendale az with a great selection and low prices .	4549
1	... .never find what i want back in there . im lying . this one time i did find a mirrors for my truck . apologies to you pull and save..	4549
1	along with their phx location , this is a great junkyard . huge selection and a large portion of the yard has a concrete slab which makes working on the cars way easier . great prices too .	4549
1	definitely a lot nicer than the south phoenix locations , more organized and friendlier staff in my opinion . viki was nice and helpful thanks !	4549
0	horrible place to go for auto parts bad customer service do n't care about there customers do n't tell you about returns or what you can and ca n't return do n't go to pull n save not saving any money just wasting your money and time would not recommend	4549
0	it 's impossible to get an engine in good condition . some members live in the yard and they take the engines that are for sale and try to resell them for double the price . they know when the cars will be taken outside before for the rest of us , and try to get them first , always . makes the mission impossible .	4549
0	this place sucks ! ! ! do not bring a credit card or debit they will decline it and skim your account i have had 5 accounts hacked by this business two different business american express rest visa mc and debit . spend hours pulling parts and no atm everyone just shrugs and knows nothing . bunch of no care mexicans go to broadway you will regret it if u try to use a card . never again ! ! !	4549
0	i loved coming to this place . it is very organized , and clean . seriously though make it clear that kids ca n't come though . very pissed . try to get out of the house , get all the way down there , and ca n't even go in . i checked the website before leaving , and it does n't make it clear anywhere the kids ca n't come , and there were n't no signs outside either saying they could n't enter either , got told once we got inside . think you guys need to update your website and put the rules to entering your yard .	4549
1	wrote about the hotel instead of the restaurant by mistake . have not stayed here .	4550
1	great location inside caesar 's palace . the front desk staff was very nice and delivered a luxury level of customer service . the room was large and well appointed with the modern-day amenities including a large screen tv and plenty of outlets . although it looked great the shower was very disappointing . the water pressure from the shower was unbearable ( it hurt ! ) , and there was not a way to adjust it . i was completely disappointed as i was expecting a nice comfortable shower after a rough night in vegas .	4550
1	very nice hotel with exceptional customer service . the room was on the smaller side but the luxury items in the room more than make up for it . the bed is most comfortable bed on the strip as it reminds me of the heavenly bed from westin hotels . one thing i noticed is they provide natura bisse products in the room . it 's not often you get spa type shampoo , soap , lotion in the room . you need to try the room service for breakfast as they serve signature nobu items for breakfast you can only get from room service .	4550
1	love this place ! it 's pricey yes but you usually get what you pay for . access to the venus pool and your own elevator sorta is a plus . it 's never crowded in the lobby and they always greet you at the valet and take your bags without hesitation . it 's different and not for all but if you try it you may love it !	4550
1	very nice boutique hotel inside of caesars palace . has a asian flavor with all of it 's decor and amenities . bottled water available for free outside of their gym area and business center . nightly turndown service with mats next to your bed . soft robes in ever room and a very nice modern bathroom . the tv inside of the room must have been at least 60 inches . i liked the comfort of a small hotel inside of a massive resort .	4550
1	all i can day is wow ! ! our anniversary dinner and mina made it special . we ordered the chefs special and could not have been happier . the waygu a5 did not disappoint along with the black cod miso ! ! ! pricey but worth every penny of you are a foodie , if not save you $ and go to mcds ! i had the lychee & elderflower martini was awesome as a starter . relax and enjoy .	4550
1	we had a basic hotel room on floor 74 . we loved the place . positives : you get japanese tv , slippers , robe and the way everything is set up is great . the bed and pillows are incredible . negatives : no view on the 74th floor . you can hear the club music if you 're in your room during club hours , no free coffee . instead they give you a water heater and you have to buy the instant coffee by starbucks in the snack drawer . also , it 's a tiny ways walk to the hotel . you have to walk through the slots to get to the service desk . overall , i would come again .	4550
1	excellent service from the initial phone call-in ... the operator pronounced my last name correctly as well as the ladies who checked us in at the restaurant ( a+ ) nothing better than not murdering or insulting a customers name ... the wait help especially cerika and all of the waiters brought each omakase dish to us smiling and gave us a sense of good open approach that is welcoming to customers who want to feel we matter ... great ambiance and perfect portions ... each course perfectly balanced and ono ( delicious in hawaiian slang ) ... thank you all the way from hawaii ! ! ! better than morimoto 's omakase in hawaii ! ! ! ! ! !	4550
1	headed to vegas on a whim for my birthday 2 days ago , we stayed at nobu hotel inside caesar 's palace . i love love love the hotel ! ! their amenities are top of the line , the staff who always greeted us by name , was the friendliest most professional and dedicated to making our stay awesome , we felt like vips ! ! ! the beautiful minimalistic decor is a feast to take in , welcoming at every turn- i felt like i was walking through a spa . nobu we will be back ! ! !	4550
1	if you need to stay at caesars ... .stay here . it 's extremely nicer than the dated big hotel . it 's like an oasis inside a big property . you have a separate check in , which you will appreciate versus the absolute horror show at caesars . very quiet , nice bar and very nice rooms . the entrance is on a pass way and not in the middle of chaos . so if your here for a show , this is the better choice for a little more that what caesars would be .	4550
1	definitely impressed . very classy and modern decor . the service was beyond expected especially the amenities . great perks ! such as priority entry into the clubs and pools . shout out to dan our bell voy ! hooked us up ; ) . cant wait for the breakfast room service from nobu restaurant	4550
1	the service and food were remarkable . this is our favorite place in vegas . we were so impressed with heather , and we could n't have asked for a better dining experience .	4550
1	gorgeous property . from the moment you check in to the moment you lay down to sleep , the experience is top notch . i highly recommend this as a place to stay for visitors or even for a staycation . it truly is luxury at reasonable prices .	4550
1	upon check in , we were treated like royalty . a bellman was ready and directed us up to a private check in area on the second floor of the nobu tower upon arrival . there was no wait or busy lobby . zoey checked us in and offered us an amazing upgrade . she worked hard to get a great deal for us . the room surpasses any room we 've stayed in in las vegas . we will be back !	4550
1	o nobu é um dos projetos exclusivos do caesars pallace . tem como principal diferencial , além do requinte característico da marca caesars , um toque de elegância personalizada com privilégios e serviços premium .	4550
1	pros : -comped tickes to pure ( but no one cool goes to that club anymore tbh ) -clean , modernish , japanese influenced cons : -caesar 's is n't that great , kind 've an older population -if you want a younger crowd this may not be the place	4550
1	this was my first visit . nobu hotel is first class just like the restaurant . service is over the top from the time one pulls up to the valet . my friends and i will most definitely return .	4550
1	their tasting menu when letting the waiter/chef choose is truly second to none . there 's `` sushi '' and then there 's nobu sushi . among all the nobu locations i 've experienced this one is my absolute favorite .	4550
1	great hotel for the money . they just added a gym on the 2nd floor which is convenient and high quality . this is the second time i have stayed at the nobu hotel . overall , the hotel is much much better than the average room at caesars . however , the service was not as outstanding as my first stay . the house-keeping service was still good , but the first time i stayed ( 3 years ago ) , it was amazing ( tea , turn down service , cookies ) . the concierge service was very good . they were very helpful and helped me get good show tickets .	4550
1	had a good experience here , ordered room service from the restaurant and it was really good and time attentive . i love the smell that marinates throughout the whole establishment . will most definitely stay here again in the future .	4550
1	date & time : saturday july 29 , 2017 @ 3pm companion : the husband scene : international- european & asian couples : gents in open collar shirts , dark jeans & $ 700 sneakers accompanied by ladies in little black or blush dresses w/ chanel bags decor : zen , asian-inspired rooms w/ all the comfortable amenities imaginable service : impeccable 5-star service total : $ 2000	4550
1	oasis in vegas . you have to go through caesars to find it , but it 's an oasis in the chaos . clean , modern yet comfortable and very calming asian atmosphere that provides an amazing and restful contrast to the chaos of the strip . the staff are also extremely friendly and helpful . treatment was very personal , i did n't feel like a number . bed is outstanding and the bathroom is very clean and modern . only drawback is lack of ice machine on every floor . this is my new vegas go-to .	4550
0	food was okay , but felt like the waiter was a sneaky up-seller . we would ask for a california roll and he would imply that they do n't have it but hey have a soft shell crab roll ( $ 40 instead of $ 12 ) , but we then ordered an additional californian roll because that 's what we wanted ! same with ordering a salmon roll , waiter said he has a salmon belly special roll instead . again $ 42 vs $ 12 . the negative review is more the way he went about it , it was clear he had a target for what he wanted the bill to be at the end of the night . no desire to return .	4550
0	had to do review because of the crappie service . started at check-in , staying 3 days family of 4 requested 2 queen size beds upon booking . said she was all out , then acted as if she was doing me a favor when she found one . no discounts on anything for staying here shows , dining , etc . more than that it 's the service from the food court , casino concierge receptionist . rooms are nice , services are motel 6 . save your money . stay elsewhere . glad only one day left .	4550
0	einfach zu viel erwartet . essen hat mich nicht grad geflasht und geschweige den der preis viel zu überhöht .	4550
0	do n't be fooled this hotel is not a 5 star hotel . they would not even valet my car because they were busy . i told the valet i was staying but they did not care . so if you do n't mind self parking at a 5 star hotel , place is not bad .	4550
0	upon arrival , i had to wait 30 minutes before i was able to check in . once i checked in , the representative mentioned that the hot tea will be arriving shortly in the room . when i went to the room , the room key did n't work and i had to go downstairs to get a new key . in addition , looking at room service , it is not 24 hours . it is dark from 12 am to 6 am . finally , the nobu hotel is overrated , nothing special to talk about except that nobu restaurant is downstairs .	4550
0	terrible slow service . food is decent but they really have issues with staff and slow food . server knew nothing about the menu . food came cold and drinks took 40 minutes to come do n't waste your time it 's nothing like la nobu	4550
0	c'mon this is vegas ! service capital of the world ! must try harder nobu . say `` no '' to nobu . awful service ! ! so weird for vegas !	4550
0	far and away the worst service i have ever encountered . the desk agent team displayed complete incompetence in checking in , making change , understanding of their own room locations or basic linguistics . i have received far better service at red roof inn let alone other alleged 5 star establishments . bell staff was fantastic and should replace desk manager . justin deangelis	4550
0	omg terrible construction noise . my reservations is for palace towers and without telling me they said at check in i got an upgrade to nobu tower . it 's weird that a upgrade is the worst noise that i have ever heard . if they had any class and for how much we paid they should of closed this wing . or at least told me what was going on .	4550
0	probably the worst customer service in all of vegas . i 've been to most hotels on the strip and have never had such a bad experience . the room was not bad , but overall a horrible place to stay and give your money to .	4550
0	stay at the hotel last month . never told me about a discount at the spa for hotels guests . called tonight and asked if i stay there tomorrow if they could give me any type of discount . told no . told spa was owned by someone else so they could n't do anything . in other words not our problem	4550
0	second time not a charm . they put us in a room right above the club and you can feel the music through the floors . worst hotel planning ever ! why not put the gym in this location instead of rooms . they moved us but it was a smaller room with an odor . think we 're gon na be moving back to the mandarin oriental .	4550
0	horrible service they never make our 2 rooms i call several times and nothing happen and the next day i call to housekeeping and ask for towels and shampoo they came after 45 minutes and explain my problem to the supervisor and with a big smile she told me so sorry and that 's it ! ! ! ! it 's really old building , its a shame for the nobu and the worst part the hotel shows like 5 stars and reality is 3 stars	4550
0	i had much higher expectation of this hotel and when i arrived i was very disappointed . there was a bit of trouble with checking in , and they did not accommodate well . hotel room itself was probably not worth paying $ 250 for a standard 1 king bed with poor view ! the bathroom was not bad , and the bed was comfortable . everything else did not feel high end as hyped . i felt ripped off and rather stay at caesar palace itself than here ! like i said , view here is dreadful ! ! ! ! ! ! !	4550
0	our recent stay at the nobu hotel was mired by a faulty refrigerator , malfunctioning air conditioning , the bathroom bar had some sticky residue looked like coke , floors were dirty . the wet bar could not be repaired . ac was resurrected ! housekeeping took care of the rest . the bed and pillows were comfortable , decor modern and refreshing . the hotel is over hyped and expensive attempt at a `` boutique '' basically it 's the old centurion tower refurbished . i must say customer service was excellent . too bad there is no coffee offered . chris r	4550
0	sushi is fresh and service very good , but one server brought out a sizzling beef dish , lifted the cover , and brought it between my wife and i where the steaming hot liquid dripped onto her bare leg . ouch ... more training needed !	4550
0	rooms are small and furniture is big ! rock hard couch with no view of the tv . complicated thermostat complicated shower ugly carpet and walls nice bed and bathroom . room service menu is all asian and that includes breakfast hard as jerky style bacon and cold toast . ordered icewater both days and didnt get it !	4550
0	this is the worst hotel in las vegas . i check in online at 8 am , however , when i got there , they told me that the room is not available until 4pm . i explain them that it was my wedding and it started at 1pm , so i could n't wait till 4pm . they did n't care at all . no costumer service at all . ignorant room coordinators . never come back again . they almost ruined my wedding . the worst hotel experience i have ever had .	4550
0	please do not stay here , the rooms are adequate the customer service is bad . no one calls you back they lie to you and when they do call you back they do n't do what they promise . there are so many better options in vegas why stay here you will be disappointed . as an update the hotel still does n't return calls and as i started to read other reviews there seemed to be a common factor of the hotel offering not only average but poor customer service . i truly see no reason why anyone would want to stay here .	4550
0	i do n't know how we would up in nobu since i booked through caesars . but here we are . the room was small but clean , except the windows were filthy and spotted . upon entering , the room was freezing . we called maintenance . it took several hours to get the room to a reasonable temperature . the water in the shower never really got hot . certainly does not live up to the hype .	4550
0	old hotel . rug and carpet looks ghetto . at least use some better looking carpet instead of an ugly one that does not match the design of the room . the lobby looks nice but they need to change there carpet . old and ugly design . hire a better interior designer . bell desk takes forever to answer .	4550
0	i have been to quite a few sushi restaurants including nobu at hard rock . the quality of the fish was good . i noticed a little variation in the uni though . all the basic sushi like yellowtail , albacore , salmon and tuna were good including the the amberjack , mackeral and sweet shrimp . the one thing i really noticed is the lack of skill in the sushi chefs . their hands were clumsy , slow and awkward . i 'm surprised that such a name like nobu showcases such subpar culinary skill . for half the price , i can go to sushi roku and have a fabulous meal with skilled culinary masters .	4550
1	i 'm not sure why this place only has two stars . i 've had two very positive experiences here and i 've been to three other practices in the valley . i had an exam with dr. susko and he was very thorough , answered all my questions and provided a couple of treatment options for some scarring issues . i recently made a consultation appointment with reylina , the aesthetician . she too was super professional and offered me a couple treatment options and answered all my questions . she took my skin sensitivity very seriously and recommended a couple products . the front staff has always been helpful too .	4551
1	i was referred here by a friend and hit very lucky , as a few other places i had called did n't have appointments until november ! my appointment was with christine crovetti , pa. mark , the ma , was polite , professional and courteous . christine is beautiful , confident and competent . she never made me feel uncomfortable . she engaged and explained . i trust her . she froze a barnacle which caused me more pain than i expected . perhaps my own low tolerance . instructions were made clear to me by mark . no complaints . i 'm happy to return !	4551
1	great experience for a doctor 's office ! the girls up front are awesome . wait time has never been longer than 20mins . today it was maybe 3 ? ? doctor galina came in promptly both times and very friendly . my son 's issues are resolving . and am overall very pleased with this practice ! **and to the staff reading this , you guys rock ! !	4551
1	everyone so nice . vanessa was just awesome and great listener ! i was in and out in under 30 minutes . 6 stars if possible	4551
1	when looking at these reviews i ca n't even imagine it 's the same place , that or some people are just really bitter in this world . i came to thomas dermatology today for a little small procedure and found the office staff the doctors and nurses to be absolutely terrific . everybody went out of their way to be nice they were efficient and they are a very busy office and got people through with great efficiency . i would highly recommend this office to anybody , and these petty little bad comments that are made prior to mine , i just actually do n't understand because his office is nothing like those bad comments . thank you again	4551
1	honestly nothing but great things to say ! i had to get in the day of they squeezed me in and i was so grateful ! everyone is so nice ! and every time i 've come back it has been so fast . i barely wait in the waiting room . the procedure i needed was very quick they had me in n out of there , they are so quick and thorough ! all the staff & drs make you very comfortable , i believe i had dr michaels and he was wonderful ! so grateful for everyone there and how easy and quick they make everything : )	4551
1	my first time and was a very good experience . my appointment was 9:15 . i arrived about 9:07 , was given paperwork to fill out . was called back at 9:17 . the pa was in my room by 9:25 . she answered all of my questions . i was examined and treated for pre cancer spots and was out by 9:50 . i was treated well and professional .	4551
1	i 've been going to thomas dermatology for years now . i 've been very happy . no pressure to get extra services , very thorough , and the wait is typically minimal .	4551
1	i ca n't speak highly enough in regards to the service and treatment that i have received from dr. lieberman and staff . very knowledgeable and caring . always a clean and positive environment when i visit !	4551
1	i 've seen galina serdtsev , pa , a few times , both for cosmetics and medical appointments . every time she 's been extremely professional . her style is to listen , ask questions and then share ( a lot ) of information . then with that info , i am to make an informed decision . what stands out from many providers , is the time she took to make sure she got a complete history and i understood the pros and cons to each treatment .	4551
1	i came to see a pa jordan . she is really nice and listened to my concerns and gave me different treatment options . the office is very nice and clean . the staff greeted me as i walked in . the only thing is that my appointment was in their upstairs suite and i went to their suite downstairs on the opposite side of the building . being my first appointment they should have advised me of this . otherwise great experience !	4551
1	best bed side manor ever . super friendly and awesome . second time there she treated me as if i was a long time client . will definitely be back for my annual body check .	4551
0	was not given any service and charged $ 109.00 for absolutely nothing . i asked for my bill to be removed and they told me their is nothing they can do . i will not recommend this place to anyone ! horrible customer service and respect for patients . if you say you do a service and can not provide why charge someone ! i will be filing a complaint with the better business bureau ! please avoid this place at all cost !	4551
0	my experience was ok with the wait time scheduling and visit with the doctor but my experience with the front desk girl twice was very smug , snotty and no customer service friendliness , unfortunately . her name was janet i believe . what a shame bc that really is the first impression .	4551
0	well here we are 4 days since my last post and the last time i spoke with the office mgr . and my pa still have not seen the $ 40 over charge on my debit card returned friday will be 7 weeks with no enbrel and no refund , this office has a real organization problem , no communication when needed . giving one star only because yelp will not let me give negative stars .	4551
0	worst dermatologist ever . i was basically talked into acne medication that i did n't need , had a terrible reaction that i 'm still experiencing consequences from . then i was charged a $ 25 no show fee for a 6 week follow up appointment that i was never even text or phone reminded about .	4551
0	basically in line with everyone else 's complaints . the wait time is ridiculous , the `` dr 's '' are rude and not very smart , the front desk is a mess , and they mess up on your billing . they will send your bill ( that they accidentally `` misbilled '' ) to collections and tell you they ca n't help you anymore . it 's a scan and the guy at the collections agency mentioned that they do this very often . they are not helpful and do n't care about the case .	4551
0	the worst dermatologist ever ! i had a appointment for 10:30am the receptionist tells me to arrive 15mins early to fill out paperwork . so from 10:15 - 11:15 people are checking in and seeing the dr. at 10:50am i asked `` what time was my appointment ? '' the receptionist tells me `` the dr will be available in about 10 mins . '' at 11:15 i just get up and leave . so there 's no point of setting up an appointment because they do n't care . stay away from this place ! ! !	4551
0	staff and registration kept me on hold for over 18 minutes and still has not picked up the phone - why waste time and $ $ $ at this establishment	4551
0	front office is very unprofessional . did not even get to see the doctor because they are too lazy to learn how a referral system works . my referral was sent in and confirmed by my primary and my insurance . wasted a day off of work for this . i asked them if they could check with my referring physician because i have the confirmation ... they blew me off.. never will come back or recommend this place to anyone . you can be a good doctor but you have to a patient first !	4551
0	i 'm not sure who this will read this if anyone , but the henderson office as serious problems with its patient care and organization . it has been 6 weeks without my enbrel medication and i do n't thing anyone at this office cares . i continue leaving messages that go unanswered by the staff and the `` within 24 hour '' policy to return calls is a joke , they done listen to the message and do n't reply accordantly . this would be bad enough but i was charged $ 70 to my visa card when i have a $ 30 copay and the promise to refund the $ 40 overcharge has not taken care off .	4551
0	so i called to make an appointment to get something that is of a concern looked at . booked the appointment by talking to someone at the front desk a few weeks previously and was told everything was all set . i show up after taking time off of work and now they tell me i ca n't see anyone without a referral . i hope i do n't die from skin cancer . thanks .	4551
0	i called at 3:30pm to schedule an appointment . got the answering machine ... after several rings . i left a detailed for a call back . no call . waited two days and recalled . i called at 2pm . got a receptionist who put me on hold . no one picked up after 15 minutes . i am done . i think the doctors need to know they are losing business due to the unprofessional front office staff . maybe a doctor will read this and take note . i am taking my business elsewhere !	4551
0	if it takes all day to even attempt to make an appointment ( new patient ) , not a good sign . i called three times from 12:00 - 1:00 , let it ring for 10 minutes or so , and no answer . i tried again around 2:00 p.m , it rang for about 3 minutes , then someone answered . wheee , i got all excited ! until she said `` may i put you on a brief hold ? '' eight minutes later ... on hold ... is not brief , so i hung up . i 'm sure there are other competent dermatologists in henderson who actually want patients and strive for good customer service .	4551
1	had my doubts about coming here because it 's a chain but found that the staff cut my hair pretty well . relatively affordable compared with other places around summerlin . usually do n't wait more than 30 mins and if i do , can watch sports on tv or go to downtown summerlin .	4552
1	i am typically very skeptical of economy class haircuts ... most often you get what you pay for . i just got my haircut by monica and it was a pleasant conversation and she did a fantastic job ! ! very happy with the outcome . i 've taken my kids there for years but never trusted any of the stylists for me personally ... not that i value my kids haircuts less than mine it 's just they 're in school and it seems like most of the kids these days have bad haircuts ... lol . in a professional setting , things are different . i 'm happy to say monica has earned my trust , and my business .	4552
1	monica of course is da bomb ! so funny ! great service . they have the double your mvp for the same fee . awesomeness !	4552
1	i came in here to get a quick haircut . they did have a long wait but it is vegas even though we 're out a ways . michelle cut my hair and did a great job . i get a simple cut number 2 buzz cut . but she really took her time to make sure she got everything even . that huge for me since i 'm very ocd . she was super friendly and informed me about the special they had since it was customer appreciation month . next time in back in vegas and need a haircut i know where i 'll go .	4552
0	hmmmm not happy . long long long wait . ok it was sunday but only six out of eight chairs being used . haircut is a 2 out of 10 .	4552
0	nice and clean saloon . friendly staff . very unhappy with the haircut i got . showed her few pictures of me because i 'm foreign and do n't speak perfect english . got a completely different result ... comparing my before and after pictures was like comparing ceaser 's palace and ellis island . if the lady was n't so nice i would have made it a big deal !	4552
0	waited in line after checking in online ! i watched 3 others get taken before i did , who were not on deck and had wait times over 30 mins . i was on deck ! shady shit going on here !	4552
0	checked in online and when we got in my son was on deck , we waited for 20 minutes 4 other people were called some were not even on deck . all of a sudden looked at the board and my sons name was gone ! ! very annoying waited for nothing , we tried to check in again , we would end up waiting another 40 minutes ! ! this only happened in this branch . we never had this issue with the other sports clips	4552
1	the best customer service . you wo n't wait long and they respect your time . the associates are very kind and helpful	4553
1	if you are looking for a chase bank , that will be friendly and will handle you banking problems with concerns , this is the branch . after having problems with another branch and not getting through , for some reason after calling several times , brooke tenbrink took my call and was so nice . she informed me she would handle my problem . and she did . mrs. brooke tenbrink is the branch manager , at 637 n. stephanie her branch will see to your needs and you will be able to have someone answer your calls . i am new to henderson or las vega , and i depend on yelp at all times for good information ,	4553
0	my grandmother is stuck in puerto rico with limited food and water after the storm . i came in here to deposit cash into her account they refused to take cash as i was not on her account . but if i pay for a cashiers check or money order they would deposit . very rude unbelievable that a bank would take this stance . do not bank here . hence the reason i do n't .	4553
0	walked in and did n't really get greeted or anything . was told there was a long line and someone would be back to update with us with how long the wait would be but after 20 minutes , still no update from anyone . finally got some assistance from cody campbell . cody was very helpful , nice , and patient . as far as other employees that day , none i could recommend . please go see cody campbell if you come to this particular branch !	4553
1	went here for years , friendly staff and i always spend way to much money because i love this place ! !	4554
1	very conveniently located in the target/kohl 's shopping center and the staff is always very helpful .	4554
1	this location is pretty large ! the first time i had to go by here was for my first online pick-up order and the process was extremely quick and easy . since it was the holidays , there was a bit of a line but the two cashiers were working as efficiently as possible ( while still being friendly ) to get people taken care of and help the next people . i was asked if i needed assistance while i was in line and politely declined , then ended up in a fun dragon ball z conversation as i was purchasing a scouter for a friend 's christmas gift . fun way to pass the time and overall day-brightener since i 'm a nerd .	4554
1	oh gamestop , when will you stop abusing my bank account . great store , friendly service , stocked up every time i go in . f*** yeah .	4554
1	this gamestop location is the best i 've been to in terms of staff friendliness and helpfulness . i 've been to other stores staffed by arrogant and rude people that would argue with me about my trade-ins not working even though they worked fine on my game systems and then flat out reject my games . so its refreshing to actually have nice staff that inform me of trade-in deals and make a good impression on me every time i enter their store ! now i do n't go anywhere else for my video game needs !	4554
1	my favorite gamestop is at this location . very friendly , approachable & informative service here . if you come to gamestop often , i encourage you to get a gamestop power up card . it will help you save money in the long run . you can trade in your used games , iphones , ipads & game consoles here . there are lots of cool games in this store & if they do n't have it here , you can order it online & pick it up here . this is one of mine & my 2 kid 's favorite places . gamestop is the best .	4554
1	this is my faouorite gamestop location . they always help me find what i need ! its sometimes packed but customer service is key over there	4554
0	average famestop , nothing spectactular . coming from someone who games on all mediums , done sales , frequents online steam purchases as well as gamestop transactions , as well as a former employee . overall my thoughts of this spot is , it 's not too bad to get it games from here	4554
0	service here blows . waited twenty minutes in line . only one cashier . second employee did n't even bother to assist . go somewhere else .	4554
0	long line and only one person working . at least 30 minutes just to buy a game . it 's just a regular day and no new releases . why understaff ?	4554
0	the guy behind the counter was a dick . maybe its the fact im a cute female , so theres no way i could be a actual gamer in his eyes . i bought 2 call of duty black ops 2 games for ps3 yesterday , he was not nice & he didnt even offer the map pack package like he did everyone else before me . i just appreciate a friendly attitude especially since ive spent a large amount of $ in that store on triton headsets , bat man arkham city , halo 4 etc etc ...	4554
0	the asset store manager was very rude and disrespectful i will be canceling all preorders i have with this location . an never recommended any of my friends or family go there	4554
0	service is subpar . i went to buy an action figure that should not have been on the floor waiting in line for 20 minutes to be denied the purchase . ironically enough , i stood and listened to a 30 second speech about discounts and coupons , ... .. if i bought an $ 8.00 bag that i did not need . there goes future business . if the employee had the confidence to run the register , then he should have had confidence to fulfill the needs of the customer so that `` i '' would return .	4554
0	tried trading in 3 games that cost at lease $ 60 each when i bought them brand new for gta5 and wow , they tried buying my games for $ 1 each ! ! ! so the game i was supposed to get still cost $ 60+ . gamestop is so unfair seriously . so pricy but when it comes to then buying your game , they 're so cheap . plus the lady had an attitude just because i did n't want to make the deal . never going there again !	4554
1	they have new management so i think some of those reviews are old . great nails by great people . johnny is awesome . he is really into researching the latest trends and having new colors and even makes his own sparkle gel powders . i like that they have the examples for each type of nail shape to help you choose . sophia does amazing art and design . mid week is the best time to go . *****i updated my first review to reflect the new management and recent experiences .	4555
1	i have gone to this place a handful of times over the past few months because it 's super close to where i live . unfortunately , the experience has been horrible . i started going somewhere else but today i only had a little bit of time and i said `` hey , let me give this place one more try before i write them off for good.. '' lucky for me , this place is under new management ( as of a week ago ) and i had a great experience . the place is in a great location and now that new management has taken over , i will continue to go back .	4555
1	i have went to this salon twice and they did an excellent job on my nails a guy did my nails both times and he was very nice .	4555
0	do n't get me wrong , this salon does good nails and pedicure . i 'm not complaining about that . these people have no manners and are simply rude ! then , one had the audacity to get an attitude because she was wrong and obviously ca n't read . no beverages were offered to me or my sisters , but were offered to the people who came in afterwards . no manners . if you want good nail service then go here ... ..only if you 're ready to curse somebody out ( cause you will have to go off ) .	4555
0	they never have enough people working , nevertheless certified nail techs . they always force gel on you and it 's annoying . they hurt taking off nails , too . worst nail place in town .	4555
0	in my honest opinion they do n't even deserve 1 star . first off.. the gentleman that works there is rude as all get out . he waited until he was halfway into doing my friends nails when he jacked the price up . then he proceeded to jack her nails up twice . having to re-do them . my pedicure felt amazing . the girl was really good at the massages and they have nice chairs . however she did n't do a good paint job ( see the photos ) and she did n't even file them down . we wo n't be back . i suggest you do n't darken their doorsteps .	4555
1	absolutely the best experience if you 're going to get married in vegas . very professional . beautiful inside the chapel . everyone was so very nice and made the experience that much better . could n't be happier , and that 's the way it should start .	4556
1	i just saw this in a movie , `` ek mein aur ek tu '' . i vowed to myself that i 'm gon na get married here .	4556
0	i attended a wedding this past sunday . omg , i have not seen a crew so unprofessional like this one ever . elvis rushed through the songs ... the man officiating the ceremony had more directions on how to stand and look at the camera than feelings to deliver into the actual ceremony . they took no time to kick the couple out to the front to have pictures taken by themselves . i felt sad for the couple and the family . i wish this chapel would make an effort to train their people to make ceremonies less of a business move and more of a heartfelt affair . it only takes some energy , not even more minutes .	4556
0	i 've never been here but their phone line is linked to mine . i 'm tired of receiving phone calls at my personal home line . this has gone on now for 8 months and i made my 2nd formal complaint today . please stop calling me or legal action will take place for harassment !	4556
1	i just bought my 4th car from metrolina . i have jay leno 's love of cars but unfortunately do n't have his budget . ryan and justin are just great . i wo n't ever buy from anyone else . they are the only auto dealer i have ever dealt with that are truly interested in you finding the car that is right for you rather than the car they want to sell you . they are fair and trust worthy . thanks guys !	4557
1	metrolina has the best cars in charlotte . if you are in the market for a luxury car , this is the place to go ! they have an amazing selection and have the best prices . justin was amazing and i will be buying all my cars from him .	4557
0	i had a horrible experience scum bags , someone named stephen , full of lies . said he had a car for sale but it was not there when i got there . bait and switch .	4557
0	terrible customer service . had an issue with title work and called mutiple times and never received a call back !	4557
1	i had to print a few quick things for an application . marquis was a great help ! will definitely return in the future ! highly recommended ! ! ! !	4558
1	giving this particular location 5 stars because of the level of service afforded by the staff . they 're friendly and helpful . marquis helped me most recently and he was great even with multiply customers waiting . i 'm usually out the door within minutes . i 've used this location for passport / visa pictures and printing out documents on fancy paper . the cost is fair and what you would pay at any other print / copy center . i have n't used them for their shipping services but you can get that done here as well .	4558
0	i waited in like from 11:40 to just after 12 , 3 people ahead of me and they had 1 person working . you would think during a busy during the week lunch time they would have more than 1 person . the lady that helped me was very sweet and professional .	4558
0	does it really cost $ 17 to ship a phone charger ground shipping or did they just rip me off ?	4558
1	i have been getting my hair cut by patricia since i moved to charlotte a year ago and she has always done a good job . there is hardly any wait time , the price is good and it 's in the mall . it does n't get any better than that . if you are looking for a good hair cut just ask for patricia ! ! !	4559
1	great ladies ... great hair cut ... .thanks ms. patricia you gave my son a great hair cut . we will be back ... .	4559
0	people with ethnic hair looking to save a few dollars should steer clear of this salon . i had my hair cut by krista and it ended up severely uneven . it was hard to tell until i washed it at home . i decided to give them a chance at redemption so i went back to get it corrected and ended up with all my hair being cut off by another stylist . she explained she was only going to clean it up for me . after she started across the top of my head with clippers it 's not like you can stop and say that 's not it . lesson learned ... .i will not go back to mastercuts . no strike three .	4559
0	fast but that 's all . hair all over the place and had to ask to clean up . messed me up . good think my hair grows fast .	4559
1	this place is the best ! specifically andrew , with the amazing hair , is great . i walked in with my iphone 5c . i explained that the phone had some water damage and was not charging . he looked at it , asked if i used rice as my method for drying it and then popped out three seeds of rice . boom ! that was it . he did not charge me or even mention a fee . i would highly recommend irepair and andrew . he is friendly , professional and honest .	4560
1	great on the spot customer service . eric hooked us up large . 10/10 would irepair again .	4560
1	very efficient and professional ! i spilt coffee on my macbook pro , and i ca n't open it any more.what was worse , i did n't backup my data . irepair really helps me out , they diagnose my mac carefully and let me the details of damage very fast . and they also give me multiple fix discount . i 'm glad to give them 5 stars . thank you so much !	4560
1	great repair job , excellent service . would definitely go back . the malfunctioning debit terminal was a pain in the butt though .	4560
1	great service ! the person working the front desk ( most likely the owner ) was very friendly and very knowledgeable . i highly recommend ! ! !	4560
1	awesome . just awesome . dropped an iphone 4 off and within 2 hours had the diagnosis and info on how to get an out of warranty replacement for something that can not be repaired . amazing service .	4560
1	very nice customer service . had dropped my iphone . they repaired the phone free of charge ( some loose connections , etc ) .	4560
1	the team here on college st is great . have been using them for years and get consistently good service and the work done is top notch . on this last visit , i submitted a 2012 mac that had no battery life and they make a tweak in the settings and now it runs like a dream . and ... they waived the fee .	4560
1	i dropped off my iphone 4s for a cracked screen repair as well as a battery replacement at 11:30am . i came back at 3:30pm and it was ready for me to pick up , screen looking and working good as new ! i 'll have to see how the battery replacement fares but so far , so good . and they did it at a reasonable price as well ! i 'd definitely come back , but hopefully not too soon !	4560
1	i have had four devices repaired at the college st location . lindsay there provides excellent customer service . they were slow fixing my playbook , but they were very apologetic , and in the end charged me very little for the work . so i ca n't really complain . these people are honest , highly competent , and provide excellent customer service . it 's my go-to place for any repair .	4560
0	this was probably the worst service ever . my friend 's iphone 5s had a broken screen and after he paid 160 $ to solve it , his passcode did not work . maybe these emo goth employees did some voodoo shit to it but he is unhappy and now so am i . thank you for wasting our time irepair . you guys suck	4560
0	i went here on a recommendation and got my phone fixed for a broken screen and within a week without dropping it and with a case on my phone it was cracked again and they would n't fix it after i paid $ 100 plus tax ! they offered us a $ 10 discount so wanted me to pay $ 90 again ! ! ! so disappointed !	4560
0	had to actively pursue them for updates multiple times . in the end i was without a phone for about a week and paid a lot for repairs . disappointing experience : (	4560
0	do not take your business to this company . there are plenty of other repair shops out their that would be happy to take your business and in return treat you with respect and courtesy . i found the management ( phil and lindsay ) to be very rude and unprofessional . they do not follow up with you as promised and their time lines mean nothing . they are only interested in taking your money not offering you honest support and advice .	4560
0	i spent $ 60 on getting my ipod repaired and there wasnt much of a difference . worse , it now cant even upload new music or connect to itunes . so it went from bad to worse . this was no different than putting money inside the toilet and flushing it .	4560
0	after buying a new iphone i needed to sell my old one . after doing a little online research irepair seemed the only place that offered $ rather than a store credit without the hassles of selling it privately . a phone call to them suggested that they would offer between $ 125.00- $ 150.00 so we visited the store and dropped off the phone . we had to leave it for them to inspect it . when we called back later they offered only $ 50.00 . we said no way and picked up the phone and will now sell it privately .	4560
0	an interesting looking shop . if you break an ipad or pod or phone or touch , this is a repair shop to fix it . i did n't actually get anything repaired yet , but the staff were helpful and answered my questions as to what type of store they were . 2 stars for now because i did n't take anything in for an irepair , but when i do i will yelp about it again !	4560
0	ipad no longer connects to wifi . but my screen is fixed ( barely ) . the screen comes off at times . never coming back . 0 stars	4560
0	i 'll keep this short for now . over the course of 3 months ( sept-dec 09 ) , irepair.ca charged me $ 170 , and did n't fix my ipod touch . they misdiagnosed the problem , and after assuring me it was the correct diagnosis , i paid them to fix it . then they did it again . now they refuse to respond to emails or better business bureau complaints . i 'm sure it works out for some people , but a company that treats it 's customers this way is not worth the risk .	4560
0	i 've been here several times , for 2 iphone repairs and a laptop repair . i thought they were great until recently when i brought in my water damaged iphone . they called me and said that it was irreparable , due to `` logic board damage '' . i picked up the phone anyways and took it to my friend who 's an electronics engineer , to see if he can salvage the remains . he noticed that the wire that connects the screen had been cut with scissors . long story short , i think this place is super sketchy and purposefully damaged the phone further before returning it to me .	4560
1	excellent hair styling by stella . highly recommended the pedicure is really good as well .	4561
1	got my haircut from petronela and it was awesome . she nailed every detail and even gave me great advice on the look i wanted . this is the first time in a long while that i 've had such a precise and well-serviced cut . i 've finally found a barbershop that i would like to frequent !	4561
1	i like the others bought the groupon as i though it was a great deal for haircut and straight razor shave ( not to be missed ) . i ended up with the best haircut i 've ever had and have been back 3 times since . ask for yvonne , she is the the best stylist/hairdresser/barber i 've ever experienced . a great experience and a great haircut !	4561
1	leanne cut my hair . she knows that she is doing and has been doing men 's and women 's hair in salons in ottawa for decades . you get exactly what you ask for and she is fun to chat with . nice people working with her too .	4561
1	i came here while visiting toronto and it was a wonderful experience ! when i first came in , the receptionist offered to hang my coat on the coatrack . my barber was a joyful guy who was great to talk to and good at cutting hair . on top of that , they also give you a mini side shave and a hair wash . overall , a great experience . i would definitely come back next time .	4561
1	great detailed cut , hot towel service , and overall good service . would definitely recommend !	4561
1	i got the $ 29 groupon and thought that it was a great deal . the service was quick and friendly . jenna gave me an excellent hair cut . i would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a new stylist . i do n't know that i 'd pay full price , but it 's definitely worth trying if you get the groupon .	4561
0	this review is for the simcoe location normally i have a good experience here $ 20 or so for a cut with clippers . i called for an appointment and arrived on time today . 3 barbers working and they had me wait for 25 minutes until i finally left . if you are going to take appointments you should honour them . location is perfect for my office location so i 'll likely go back but if there was another option is take it . my normal barber mojdeh was n't working today i might have had a different experience if she was there .	4561
0	i like many others it seems was suckered in with the groupon offer , and learned a great lesson , when it comes to haircuts you get exactly what you pay for .	4561
0	overcharged for a trim , did not refund or amend charges . lackadaisical hair stylists , poor ambience , bad customer service . lazy attitudes from individuals who will ask how soon their break is while they are actively cutting your hair . do n't get your haircut here , there are more economical options and more consistent barbers .	4561
0	unfortunately this place is being great at one thing . inconsistency . sometimes you get a great haircut and other times you get a complete amateur job that costs you $ 40 . they 'll happily fix any issues but it 's not good when you 're trying to find somewhere to get a good haircut .	4561
0	groupon offer is real - $ 20 - but misleading . it is not the 'regular ' cut at a discount , but rather a discount cut . service was friendly , but it does not regularly include a wash , and was 2x as fast as a normal cut for a similar price . all in all , a decent $ 20 haircut . will likely visit elsewhere in the future , as discount is first-time only .	4561
0	i bought a groupon but when i called to book an appointment , they told me they could take me at a particular time without hesitancy . they then asked how i heard about them to which i responded i had a groupon , and i was subsequently told that they actually had no appointments for me and i would need to wait 2 weeks for the `` groupon specialist '' . there is nothing in the fine print or coupon indicating this and i think it 's a terrible customer experience .	4561
0	one of my worst experiences ever . there are far better places if you want to spend this kind of money in downtown . bought 2 groupons and also booked the 2 appointments . first appointment - she asked for additional money which was not part of any terms and conditions on groupon . when i called in to re-confirm my second appointment , they did not have it in their system . i tried to work out an alternate date and time and the only suitable time they were able to give was 3 weeks away that too for their screw up . never going here again ! !	4561
1	rh cigars just celebrated their 4th anniversary ! still the best place to buy , sit and enjoy the cigars and company . great and friendly crowd that welcomes all ! events coming up next week include a cigar event and pig roast . cuban roller making a comeback . great to watch and the cigars are affordable and excellent . congratulations to dave on the anniversary . see you there !	4562
1	royal havana cigars is your classic cigar lounge with a modern laid back atmosphere . tony hooked me up with a few cigars to enjoy on my way back home to brooklyn , ny . if you 're ever in the willoughby , oh area stop by and see this establishment .	4562
0	the selection is very limited compared to other local b & ms and the prices are extremely inflated . there are a few things this business will need to survive . 1 . improve the selection of cigars . 2 . charge a fair price . i paid $ 15 for a $ 10 cigar today . 3 . ventilation . keeping the side and front door open is n't ventilation . 4 . buy some leather sofas . most of the furniture looks like it was picked up off of the curb on garbage day .	4562
0	big disappointment more recently . plain as can be he embarrassed customers at an event and said statements which were not true . can not be trusted .	4562
1	love the housewares selection here . everything is so cute . clothes selection is a little bit too preppy for me . plus $ 40 for pants ? no thanks .	4563
1	my favorite location thus far . it 's close to my home and this location is not too crowded . the selections are decent but not as vast as the other locations that i 've been to . parking spaces are plenty . it 's close to other shopping establishments like , ross dress for less , target ( another favorite location of mine ) , biglots , ulta , tmobile store , and more ! the staff could be friendlier and their selections could be more plentiful . recommend this location . enjoy shopping !	4563
1	i love this place . good selection for women shirts . the men 's selection is skimpy but i usually go to shop for myself so whatever . never a line and they have some homegood selections as we 'll including dishes , towels , etc .	4563
0	this store sucks ! ! do n't tell me what form of payment to use what if i do n't want to use cash what if i would rather accumulate points . do n't use sharpies for your brows either i ca n't take you seriously .	4563
0	if i could give zero stars i would ! i have given this place so many chances ! ! the staff is never in a good mood and the 5 times i have been there have a huge line with only one cashier ! i am done with this place they have lost my business !	4563
0	i am not a fan of marshall 's . especially since i 've never been able to find anything worth spending my money on in this store . and , it 's next door to a ross , where i happen to find lots of things to buy . weird . everything seems overpriced , used and really picked over . i do n't know , maybe i am hitting there on the wrong days , who knows ? ! i am just not impressed by this so called `` discount '' store .	4563
1	i am extremely picky and have found that the staff at forest nail are kind and courteous and do a great job . owner joanne goes out of her way to make sure her nail place offers the best quality and service . i 've been going here weekly since they opened 8 years and will continue to do so .	4564
1	forest is a great find around yonge and st. clair . i am particular when it comes to manis/pedis and they were very careful and quick . moving back to toronto from new york i was hoping to find something comparable - and i did ! will be a regular from now on !	4564
1	very friendly and competent staff in a clean setting and at a good price , this is a recommended nail salon in an area full of nail and hair bars . accommodating and the massage chairs are a bonus . you can also store your personal polishes there .	4564
1	got a mani and pedi after lunch on friday for the first time based on coworker recommendations . i was very happy with the experience . nice leg and hand massage . nice massage chairs . place is very clean . i had two people helping me at the time . one for the pedi and one for mani so i finished very quickly . they also allowed me to use my own nail polish . will return .	4564
0	highly over-rated . much better service and mani/pedi 's elsewhere . owner is rude and this turns me off bigtime.. lots of other salons to patronize and significantly better .	4564
0	this place is pretty hit or miss for me . the quality of your manicure is very dependent on which technician you get . they are all very nice , but some of the women are much better than others . also , the owner/manager can be quite rude to customers and the other employees of the salon which is a huge turnoff for me .	4564
0	i was visiting my friend in toronto and i was there for a wedding so i needed a gel manicure and pedicure . the pedicure was ok but the gel manicure was bad . one day after the manicure the thumbnail split and half came off . then three more nails started peeling . i flew out of toronto so my friend went in to tell them what happened . they were very nonchalant and offered no compensation such as a manicure for my friend . i have gel manicures all the time and this has never happened . for $ 94 this was a big ripoff ! ! !	4564
0	got an infection from manicure given by owner..joanne ... very rude person ! ! ! ... never going back ... and neither will anyone i 've shared my story with .	4564
1	i work in the medical field and am extremely impressed with dr. taylors medical knowledge and bedside manner . dr. taylor actually spends time , and listens and addresses all of your concerns unlike some who are in and out within 5 minutes .	4565
1	are you kidding me ? if you do n't like dr marshall and his staff there 's something wrong with you .	4565
1	dr marshal angela and dr. taylor have been just so awesome over these years . we are going to miss your entire team . thank you for your care for your consideration and thank you mostly for just listening .	4565
0	my husband and i were patients for decades , things went slowly downhill . we have recently moved to another family doctors office .	4565
0	absolutely horrible ! ! ! ! ! a family member and i were treated hostilely and unprofessionally for their mistakes and discrepancies ! ! ! ! his assistant richard called screamed , talked down to my family member and i on many occasions for their mistakes ! ! ! ! ! the worst experience we have ever had with a doctor and their staff ! ! ! !	4565
0	highly dislike this office . dr taylor rocks and so does summer marshall but their office staff and polices/procedures are horrible . i could go into detail about a couple issues but would rather just say stay away . ca n't even get records without a $ 1.00 per page fee . also if you have a deductible they make you pay up front before they will even process labs at there lab machine in office . those are just two little examples .	4565
1	the people working at this car wash are super friendly and always helpful . my car looks good after and they have nice new free vacuums . i sometimes go out of my way just to come to this specific terrible 's car wash but they are all great . the air freshener 's last a good amount of time !	4566
1	i originally started going to this location for oil changes because it 's convenient on my way home from work . now i go there for how thorough , and pleasant they are . as well as the fact that they get you in pretty quick and the waiting room is n't bad . the price is good considering you get a free car wash every time . the car wash portion is good too . they do a nice job ! they also give you a free air freshener and a cloth cleaning the inside of your car . i highly recommend them .	4566
0	rude car wash cashier attendant . $ 8 was their cheapest exterior car wash option . not worth it . it 's just a short ride thru their automated car wash and not enough time going thru the dryer at the end . cashier needs a serious attitude check .	4566
0	there is a crazy white lady with blonde curly hair / 5ft 9 / big / shift leader ? that works here . really rude and having a bad day ! no respect at all ! 1:10pm 7/16/17 ! ( she was walking from the other terrible 's across the street . ) i will not do any business with terrible 's !	4566
1	i have been going to deyna for many years now . she 's fast , professional , does a great job . i recommend her to everyone i know for their waxing needs ... .	4567
1	i 've been coming to see deyna for years ! you wo n't find a better waxing place in the valley . she always does a great job ! !	4567
0	deyna zinn is so unprofessional . i went to the address the email provided me and even i showed up on time and she called me and canceled ... why ? because i was at the wrong address mind you i was only a minute away from her actual location . she did not try to work with me after i told her i drove a whole hour to see her . definitely only booking with lori corrigan she is way more professional and definitely not shallow .	4567
0	i got the groupon & tried to schedule three times , all three the woman rudely told me she was booked up . i just went to european & had my groupon refunded .	4567
1	wow what a great company ! they went completely above and beyond in service and quality workmanship . the fence and gate they built in my backyard look amazing . i have already referred them to 2 friends and they are both extremely happy with pinnacle . i would recommend this company to anyone . a++	4568
1	i am editing my prior review as i did not recall the extent of work done almost a year ago . the company was reasonable at the time . my only issue was when i called to request a modification of the gate installed there was no reply . sorry for a misleading review initially ,	4568
1	the great people at pinnicale fencing solutions just finished up installing my brand new gate and i ca n't be happier ! ! ! thank you so much pinnicale fencing ! they are honest and trustworthy	4568
0	i called and made an appointment and jon came out to assess what we needed done . he was late and did not bother to call and let me know he was running late . then , a week goes by and i had not received a quote so i emailed asking about it . i have never heard a word back . not good business . could not recommend .	4568
0	they are putting fence up for our neighbor but they are in our yard walking on my flowers .breaking them off , taking our rocks that we paid for and putting in her yard.you say something to them and they smile and say sorry . her yard is all dirt nothing in it to walk on but my yard is landscape . plus we paid for mound in our yard they were cutting the side off for her fence . but mound is in our yard not on the border line . 7/17/15	4568
0	this is the most unprofessional company i have ever worked with . a gate was delivered that was not the color we ordered . the bolts were not powder coated but a can of spray paint was provided . jon refused to return over 20 calls . i spoke with a receptionist who screamed at me . we were sold a service `` that they do n't usually do '' . if it 's not something they did they should never have contracted it . instead they were angry and delivered an inferior product .	4568
1	it is a great place best massage in town . customer service is very good . experienced staff and excellent massage . my back was healed by this place thanks to the staff at qq massage . get a one hour massage great price too . they soak your feet too : )	4569
1	superb service and the staff is really experienced . the techniques are unique and different . i 've been to many many foot spa places and this is by far the best one . do not confuse the deep tissue pain . it 's worth every moment and will get better . there 's a language barrier but the staff are patience and will do their best to understand you . all in all , the massage techniques are superior and are not cookie cutter like other places . they will hunt for your knots and will knot let you down . : ) highly recommended after a long day of the casino . ask for lily she 's amazing !	4569
1	it 's very good place very professional for foot massage good price also good environmental it 's very clear i will back	4569
1	this is a very clean and professional place ... staff is friendly and can speak several languages .	4569
1	clean , polite , great service ! i will recommend this location to friends .	4569
1	all the other reviews you read about this place that sound and possibly glowing are correct . i look forward to being there every time i 'm back in las vegas . in fact , as i 'm in the middle of a long stretch of travel right now , and my back is feeling it ... i wish i were visiting the spot this evening .	4569
0	i requested a lady to massage me.. she disappeared twice ! ! first , she went to pick up a phone call.. and second , she 's dealing with a customer who just walk in.. ! ! i thought she will add more time to my massage.. but nope ! we start at 1pm and finished exactly at 2pm ... after all of that.. she also demand min . $ 10 tips.. wow ! ! i 'm just speechless .	4569
0	i 've been too many massage places but this is the worst massage and foot reflex . the massage is soft and i told her to make it harder but it feels like she 's upset and gave me some kind of rashes on my back . my back is painful and sting . it 's not a foot reflex they are just rubbing my feet , towels are rough like a rock and they demand extra tip . $ 35 is not worth it . me and husband regret . never go back	4569
0	i used come here often to get my massage , ye was really good , but now they raise to $ 25 dollars per hr , although on the door and online it says $ 19 / hr . then they demand a minimum tip of $ 10 , it 's just too much for me , 45 % of tip ? ? ? i go to somewhere else ... .	4569
0	the worst place i have ever been , not professional stuff , and i do n't even want to talk about the massage the funny part was in the end that they asked from me to give them a minimum of $ 10 tip almost % 50 from the total price lol , unbelievable people .	4569
0	this was the worst place i ever had my massage . i get massage monthly so i know the difference between a good and a great massage . this place sucks from service to techniques . the two therapists that work on us was rude and they rub lotion on us verse massage our feet . never come back here again .	4569
0	called for half hour foot massage since they close at 12 . said to come . i come at 11:30 and door is locked and they wo n't answer phone .	4569
1	called on the phone to make sure they were open . the guy was friendly . went into the store about 10-15mins later . loved how they were super friendly even though i was already mad at the other stores . i will come back to this one .	4570
1	i have been using their po box service for around 4 years now . they always offer to help me outside with large orders . very efficient when it comes to collecting mail . i can call in at any time of day and ask what packages or mail i 've received and they quickly go through it with me . they are friendly and courteous and do their job with professionalism . before using them , i dealt with two other ups stores in town for my business . this one beats both of them hands down i hope this store is around for many more years .	4570
1	the best service . 2 notaries . really nice staff and the owner is very nice too . we are grateful for their help !	4570
1	fast , clean , and friendly . go in , drop your mail or boxes off for delivery , and out you go . easy stuff .	4570
0	this location is not open on sundays . not happy i drove all the way over here . waste of time and waste of gas . they need to update their information . sitting in my car writing this review i 've seen two other customers walk up to the door only to be disappointed .	4570
0	i drove all the way out to this location day off took 20 minutes to drive there in 107 degree weather.. they show online that they are open on sunday till 3 pm i picked up an extremely heavy box by myself to the door and they have a marker written on there doors that they are closed sunday ! ! they should change their website.. i am not happy	4570
0	this particular location does not offer microsoft office software and also charges $ 5 to use the computer . i did not use this computer more than 2 minutes because i was not able to open the document and they charged me $ 5 . i would never return to this particular location due to the lack of customer service and general lack of printing assisted software	4570
0	danielle has been stealing from the registers since this time last year , she pockets notary money and does n't write them in her book.. pay attention to her or simply go rewind your cameras she 's stolen up to 180 $ a day on notarys and she cancels transactions and steals from the register as well.. not to be trusted and a random drug test will reveal why she 's stealing from your company , she also personally has tried to sell me credit card information that she gets from the store she told me there 's a box full of records from everyone that opens a mailbox there , i would not recommend anyone to go to this store ! ! !	4570
1	my 4 year old son fractured his arm this past week and after confirming with x rays we went to children 's bone and spine surgery and saw pa scott arregui . he was friendly and kind , took time to review the x rays with us , and clearly explained what to expect in the coming weeks . my son loved his energy and the overall experience was amazing ( minus the fractured arm ) !	4571
1	there was an issue but kim took the time to listen and rectify it , which is what matters most . burt was also helpful in expediting what could have been an unnecessary long wait . problems always arise , it 's how they are handled that matter . thank you !	4571
1	great staff and clean office . we were in and out with no problem . they were very patient in dealing with my 4 year old . highly recommend this office . we saw dr. nielson for follow up after our visit to sunrise hospital	4571
1	this place is very clean , accesible . the staff is very friendly , especially william cooper medical assistant was extra nice to my son .	4571
1	i started out ready to hate this place because of all the issues i was having getting my daughter 's insurance verified . however , the office is clean , the staff is very helpful and courteous and we did n't wait for more than five minutes past our appointment time . the care she received was thorough and i did n't feel as if we were being rushed in and out . i took off one star because of the issue of insurance verification with someone who was less than efficient but otherwise , you can do a lot worse .	4571
1	fabulous . quick and easy , the assistant who put my sons cast on was a blast and we were in and out . doctor seemed knowledgeable . i 'd refer .	4571
1	dr camp is fabulous , he 's been with my little sister for a few years now and there is nobody else we would trust . so kind , friendly and welcoming his office and staff are amazing	4571
1	they see patients same day for injuries . they are nice and orderly . office staff is sweet and the office decor is beautiful . take your kids here for all ortho injuries . skip the er ! !	4571
0	dr. camp is unprofessional , money-hungry and does not care about patients or their conditions .	4571
0	this place triple books appointments . they make you wait for over a hour after your appointment time . the receptionist is rude	4571
0	office and doctors here are unethical and extremely rude . always wait 1-2 hours to be seen past our appointment time .	4571
0	not happy . found that after the fact they charged my account more than the insurance paid . now in collections for $ 350	4571
0	every person up front are extremely unprofessional and rude . this place makes no one happy and are a nightmare to work with . the stupid inconsiderate people are very rude . no consideration for children . please do not go here find another dr .	4571
0	dr stewart has no bedside manners . i informed the office to pls not mention the word surgery around my daughter , because my daughter freaks out big time due to all the surgeries that she has had , and the idiot kept mentioning surgery . of course , my daughter starts to get scared and freaks out and then the dr just looks at her like she is crazy . has no sympathy or compassion ... will not go see him ever again	4571
0	very rude and unprofessional scheduling department for both locations . they canceled 3 appointments due to their inability for not knowing which doctor was covered by my insurance . finally , one months later made appointment with right one . hopefully doctor is better then the scheduling people . will update my review after i see the doctor	4571
0	the front staff seemed disorganized and when giving me paperwork they handed me a copy of someone 's insurance and id . now i know accidents happen to all of us but in the medical field you really have to be careful about protecting patient 's privacy . then there 's dr. stewart . he appeared flat and uninterested while examining my child , and very dismissive to my concerns . then after walking out i heard him complain to his nurse , asking who had referred my child because he does n't want just anyone to be able to come to his clinic . i guess my daughter 's condition does n't bring in enough money .	4571
1	elvira c. is so sweat , very helpful & hard worker ! thank you so much for helping me with which meat to choose	4572
1	i love this place . they have this big metal conveyor belt factory-looking thing that they make fresh tortillas on all day . they got the good mexican sodas . they have all the good sauces . this is a straight-up mexican food store . the prices are terrific . there 's a guy in the parking lot making ans selling roasted chicken . this gringo is a big fan . muy bueno ! ! ! !	4572
0	i honestly hate shopping here and rarely do because of how gross , smelly and dirty this place is . the dumpsters outside are always over flowing and there is trash littering the parking lot and surrounding areas . i like food city because they carry some latin foods i ca n't find anywhere else but i wish i did n't dread going there because of the filth and stench .	4572
0	i call this place ghetto basha 's . it is always dirty and smells bad . i do n't understand because basha 's are usually very clean . guess when you target a certain ethnic group they deserve low quality . looks pretty racist to me .	4572
1	fast , friendly , drive through pharmacy . i take my brother here when i run him to the dr. etc . and they are always friendly . it 's not the best of neighborhoods but it 's clean inside this cvs and they have everything you need . again , i use it for the drive through pharmacy and they are bomb fast .	4573
1	these guys well the 2 ladies that helped me today were awesome , thanks so much for all your help this store has most anything youd need excellent customer service	4573
0	worst pharmacy service ever ! i just go there because its by my house but service is the worst customers sucks its like they get your prescription and stick it up the butts because the doctors have to send it 50 times before they can received it ! even people at mcdonalds have better skills and customer service than this people at cvs pharmacy !	4573
0	if this pharmacy had 0 stars that 's what they would get.the worst pharmacist i 've ran into rude racist embarrassed me i 'll never go in that place again the same script he would not fill i went to walgreens and had it in 10 minutes.that guy is the worst	4573
1	excellent service . great staff . good pricing . i would n't go anywhere else . thank you pce for your services .	4574
1	my son needed braces to help resolve his toe walking- ed was amazing to work with ! he calmed my son ( and my ) nerves and anxiety . they were kind and attentive . quick to get us in for an appointment .	4574
0	place is over priced paid 11 hundred dollars for sneakers because i had no insurance they only lasted 6 months when i need inserts adjusted they said no after they get your money they do n't care about you	4574
0	do n't use this prosthetics provider unless you like being overbilled . the amount pce bills for basic services is a joke . even if you 've got insurance , you 'll be paying them off forever . the owner ( gwen ) runs the office like a factory . use denham o & p in green valley or p.o.p . instead ... you 'll be much happier .	4574
1	the hours that waze gave me did not match at all . i took a photo of the sign for yelp to update . they were closed when i came by .	4575
1	princess auto is basically canadian tire if you stripped away any decorations . filled with aisles and aisles of tools , equipment , and some of the strangest liquidation items as well ( i love going here for those rows and see what i can find in the discount electronics aisles ) . i 'm not going to really describe it at length as it 's too difficult to properly quantify , but it 's pretty much as close to a one stop multi world bazaar of tools and parts of all sorts . to really understand it , check out the website or just take a 1/2 hour and walk through the place . god knows what you 'll find that might be useful .	4575
0	prices are reasonable . however , customer service was terrible . staff literally saw me coming with a flyer in my hand and would run away . are you kidding me ? i just wanted to find something in this rats nest of a store . there 's also no logic to the layout which will leave you stuck in the maze with no staff help . better to come browse than try to find anything specific , trust me .	4575
0	yes the prices are good ( not great ) but customer service is just horrible ! if you 're not sure what you 're looking for - good luck getting any help . especially mike ( i 'm not hundred percent on the name but he was bold with asian look ) that was exceptionally rude and unprofessional and i do n't even know how those people get hired for customer service job ... if i could give a minus one star i would !	4575
1	had a good time with the kids here . it was reasonably priced and safe . i will go here again .	4576
1	jump street is a fun place to take kids and even for adults . i was surprised how quickly you get tired . i 'm in shape and i pretty tired after an hour of jumping . it wears you out quick . the dodgeball area is fun for everyone . there is plenty of room for people to jump even when the place is busy . do n't get too much time like i did or else you will be sitting there after an hour .	4576
1	we went to jump street with some friends after a brunch to celebrate my birthday ! we went on a sunday afternoon and it was n't that crowded and we had a blast . what a workout ! we figured out how to do flips and other tricks by watching others . i will say that it was a bit weird that they do n't have more lockers etc to lock items up and the carpet and food set up is a little dated . you also ca n't bring you 're own water which is a shame because you 'll need it if you jump a lot .	4576
1	nephews love coming here and the prices are not bad . the volleyball games here are kid friendly and are fun . affordable and decent location .	4576
1	i have a 4 & 2 yr old and they love this place . i had their bday party here and they had a blast with all their friends and family ... the best part about it is it 's fun , but the kids are also getting a great work out . i jump with my kids for a couple minutes and i can feel the work out : )	4576
1	the only thing i would suggest is super comfy chairs / it was fun and the bull is so cool	4576
1	really fun and affordable . really like how they have the toddler area . my kids love it . will definitely go back !	4576
1	i love it here i bring my 80 year old grandma every time and she loves it especially slam dunk ! if you have a grandma bring her in she will enjoy it . p.s ( not your grandpa )	4576
1	first time yesterday , we went there for a birthday party . i have a 6 year old daughter that was very excited to jump around . not sure of her age , but she told me she could n't jump in certain areas . she had lots of fun . but would of liked to go to some of the other areas too . hungry howie 's pizza was very tasty i must say . the girls that were helping with my friends birthday party , were very helpful . definitely a place i might try again . very clean , staff very friendly . jump street ( warner ) .	4576
1	big big big place ! lots of trampolines . they have a dodgeball room -- -with trampolines , a bouncy house type area for the smaller kinds , basketball with trampolines and a jumping like foam pit . my 12 year old had a good time . sometimes it smells like feet but i mean come on . you ca n't jump with your shoes on lol . spend time with your ids and bring them here . i gave them 4 stars cause i felt it was a bit pricey and i do n't like the fact that they put a time limit on the kids playtime . especially for that price . have fun ! i highly recommend this place	4576
1	i think this place does a great job especially for the younger kids who like to jump as well . my sons always leaves sweaty and it is very reasonably priced . the only negative is that it tends to be a bit dirty due to people eating , more vacuuming !	4576
1	great place to take the kids when you want to stay cool and get exercise . we 've been here several times over the years but but recently they remodeled . some trampoline places smell like feet and dirty shoes but this place does n't have if it is new and you can tell they take the time to clean the trampoline and other toys . it 's a great place for kids over 48 in tall . if your kids are less than that there 's only a small area that they can play in so it is a little limited . we bought 2 1 hour passes on groupon ... definitely worth the splurge !	4576
1	wow after finally getting the guts to backflip this place was so fun ! great way to burn calories in the cool !	4576
1	first time here with the family and i must say i was impressed . price was a bit high but it kept my kiddo happy the whole time . i would definitely recommend this place for aduls and children . jumping just a few minutes is an instant workout by itself . it got me sweating and my heart racing . i plan on making my kiddo 's birthday party here .	4576
1	do n't go in expecting a ton of bells and whistles . the arcade games in the front are there mostly to fill space , the trampolines are the main attraction . it seemed clean and there were workers everywhere monitoring the jumpers . the temp was cool in there and the staff was friendly enough . if you get a special , it is definitely worth the price . ; ) i 'm kind of cheap , though so give it a whirl : )	4576
1	this jumpstreet is always clean and organized . the staff is friendly and attentive which is important when boys are playing dodgeball . even the teens employed there seem to care bout their job ( uncommon for teens ) . we always have a good time there !	4576
1	it can be pricy . go during the week or keep an eye out for groupon discounts . i hate groupon but i keep it around for these kinda discounts	4576
1	i 've been here one a month for the last few months playing trampoline dodgeball . its a great time and a good workout . loads of fun if you can get together a few friends and go as a group .	4576
1	my kids and i enjoyed it there .my 1 year and 3 year old had so much fun on the little kid side . there 's 3 big trampoline for them you ca n't jump with them and that 's fine . the place did n't smell like i though it would , great price for the little ones .	4576
1	my son absolutely loves jumpstreet ! he has been and can go to any other jump place but he chooses this one every time .	4576
1	long trampolines instead of multiple individual squares ideal for longer tumbling passes . pricey unless you have some discount . wo n't take my kids unless i have one . usually from groupon .	4576
1	ca n't wait till my son is older and we can go on the large trampolines together . that is the only bad thing about this place is if you want to jump with your kid ( if you 're secretly a child inside ) they have to be old enough to go on the main trampolines . they do have trampolines for the younger kids but it 's kids only . so much fun . great way to exercise your kids and wear them out .	4576
1	this is a fun place to bring the little ones to exert energy , have fun and gain exercise ! hours of fun for cheap too !	4576
1	the prices are reasonable , took the family to the one in chandler and they all had a great time . they need to look into adding more tables and chairs and a concession stand with food !	4576
1	great place for boys mine never want to leave . they always have a great time . dont bother paying adult prices unless you plan on jumping . its well worth the time for adults its equally enjoyable just sitting , relaxing , watching , or taking pictures . boys are aged 5 and 8 i would say 5-12 is the ideal age , although they do have a little kid area .	4576
1	this is my 2nd time here and this time is for my sons bday . there is plenty to do and the friday night pricing of $ 14.00 for 2 hours is a reasonable price . just realized they had a toddler area so i may bring my little one back . staff is always friendly and helpful . great way for kids to have fun and exercise at the same ti	4576
1	had a family birthday party here , kids loved it . in the children area where the blow up slides are i saw many parents going down and enjoying the slide , including myself !	4576
0	i had to downgrade this review to one star . the initial stench in the lobby is 2x stronger , the dirt , hair and bandaids are just as prevalent , and now , you can not walk along the side of the trampoline while your kid is bouncing . please take your children elsewhere . teens and adults , as long as your sense of smell and hygiene are impaired , go for it .	4576
0	dodgeball set up was fun . the rest of it was boring , unless you 're 9 years old . the trampolines are n't very bouncy and they do n't let you jump between tramps ! lame ! i swear the guy was even yelling at people telling them not to have fun . haha . oh , and if you want to do the extra stuff you have to pay more . just include it all guys ! wo n't go back unless dodgeball calls my name again .	4576
0	this place sucks hard ! there is nothing for little kids to do and they make you pay alot for them , its hot , nowhere for parents to sit , birthday area is a joke and there are 5 tables crammed together . the area is separated by plastic wrap . fuc dis place	4576
0	we are at jumpstreet right now and this place is smelling something fierce . if you plan on going this week keep this in mind , plus you might want to have your kids wear their socks . they charge plenty it should n't smell like a teen 's laundry hamper . we complained but they just brushed it off . disappointing , can you say bacteria ?	4576
0	every time you come here the rules are different but the one rule i hate is no bottled water . i understand no food or outside soft drinks for obvious reasons but no bottled water ? i have an infant and was harassed about bringing in bottled water . this is arizona water is a necessity much like air .	4576
0	i spent twice the amount i would have at any other kid play place and my kids could n't even use one third of the amenities . if your kids are under 8 but over 3 , forget it ! take them to mcdonald 's instead . pictures speak louder than words , check them out !	4576
0	geared towards older kids . young kids ( 7 ys and younger ) will get really bored ! ! ! not enough areas for them to play , and they pay the same amount of money as any other jumper ! ! bothersome that shorter and looking much younger and clumbsier than my 6 y/o girl ( who probably lied about their age in their consent form ) were allowed in areas marked 8+ . basketball shooting marked for younger kids was filled with older ones taking much of the space and taking up the turns of the younger kids . little to no staff monitoring . bottom line : too expensive for what they offer . will not recommend .	4576
0	why even let kids under 4 in ? my kiddo wanted to go and so we took him , he was so excited and we got there and he was confined to one small section in a corner and we could n't jump with him . he wanted to jump with his dad along with every other little kid in there wanting their dad to jump and you ca n't . they ca n't jump anywhere else even with an adult . it was awful . we paid and literally left 5 minutes later . what a waste of a cool place .	4576
0	this place was a disgrace not only to me but to america , horrible service , horrible attitude , horrible environment . i went with my children and they sat down to take a break because my little baby 's were tired and the ladies told my babies they have to be standing and would n't allow them to stand up and began to yell at them . i have never been so disrespected like that before in my life . i highly suggest you do n't waste your time and go here i also saw one of the employees pick her nose while she was getting out brackets on so disgusting . horrible place	4576
0	place is fun for kids . jumping around and whatnot . the place is beyond filthy though . for christ sake please buy a shop vac and a mop ! there is so much dust and dirt inside the trampoline areas that i thought it was a sand box . i even saw a fingernail laying off to the side in the dodgeball area . really disgusting stuff..	4576
0	this place is lame . i do n't have a more eloquent way to put it . there is no one in this place on a tuesday night but myself and my kids . they are only allowed on the 'under age 7 ' side to jump . ok , i get it . parents are only allowed to jump with their kids on the 'over age 7 ' side . sorry kids , guess you wo n't be having fun with mom today . nonsense .	4576
0	so disappointed in this place . we had multiple children with us , only 1 under the age of 4 . we had to be separated as a family for the entire time because our littlest could not go onto the bigger trampolines even with the parents , he could n't go into the basketball area w/ us , or the dodgeball area . there was only 1 or 2 other families at the place when we were there . i will never go again . and their staff were total jerks while we were there !	4576
0	first they are very rude and with the kids also paid $ 15 per person my total was $ 48 for this very bad place to get there . children	4576
0	the staff are really rude .. most of the staff are younger generation who clearly have no manner or respect for their elders . def not coming here again	4576
0	urban jungle is so much better . this facility is small and crowded . personal water bottles not allowed , but company wants you to buy water while there . the drinking fountain was so foul you will have to buy water .	4576
0	everything is filthy , nothing age appropriate for two and under , machines were not working . only thing i can say is that the staff was kind and apologetic .	4576
0	do n't waste your money here . our two and a half year old son was so bored in the little tiny area for younger kids . there was n't anyone else on the trampoline so my husband jumped with him and got yelled at . the attendants were rude and more concerned with socializing than watching our six year old when she got stuck in the obstacle course . the rude responses we got to all of our questions and the lack of amenities for what you pay for will definitely never bring us back . if we wanted to pay that much money to be around rude and disrespectful teenagers we would go to a justin bieber concert !	4576
0	this place sucks ! you have to pay extra to use all their stuff and all they have is a small trampoline area for kids under 8 . when we paid the difference for their `` fun pass '' they were annoyed that they had to do their job and open the extra areas . wo n't ever come back ! oh , and they played crappy country music the whole time .	4576
0	i experienced the worse customer service ever . i will never book another birthday party here . the prices are outrageously high for the basic things you are provided . i paid over $ 300.00 basically for 2 hours of trampoline time for the kids to jump and receive a bottle of water . the hostess was of no help and i did a lot of things on my own to get the party started and finished within a timely fashion . i would n't recommend this place to have a birthday party .	4576
0	this place is disgusting . it smells like feet as soon as you walk through the door . there is hair , bandaids , toenails , etc ... that are all over the trampolines . the staff are rude and could n't care less . they tried to rip me off . they said that they voided my card and the transaction did n't go through but it did . a total of 5 times . then when i confronted them , magically the money appeared back in my bank account . worst place ever . never going back . hope that this place shuts down	4576
0	it was nice but very small . the system they use is terrible for it being such a small place . paid for my daughter ( 7 ) to play and she wasted almost 30 minutes in line to do the course in the back of the building . we ended up not even staying the entire hour . i would rather spend the money somewhere much more livelier and fun . this place was more for smaller kids although there are things for kids ages 8+ . one kid was badly hurt when we were there on the cliff-like wall you jump off of onto a poorly inflated mat .	4576
0	i 'm very unhappy that they discontinued their aerobics class . most weekends , the class was pretty full . bring back the class and bring back april . she was an awesome instructor .	4576
0	went there for my son 's 7th birthday party . we were initially told that we would get out own area for the whole party to jump , separate from all other jumpers but we were not . the jumping areas are blocked off by age so he was not able to jump with his cousins or his younger sisters because they were all either younger or older then him and could not jump in the same area . the bounce house was closed so they gave us a `` discount '' of about two dollars per kid . we had one table for a total of 30 people so all of the adults had to stand .	4576
0	this place was very expensive for a short amount of time . they split up my kids and sent my very large 6 year old to bounce with the babies . we had to pay more so he could be with his sister . they also made up rules not posted anywhere as the kids were playing . i would n't ever go back .	4576
0	we had a horrible experience here today we were the only people in the place for three hours which is understandable considering they cost at least do it over us constantly were informing us that we were not following the rules even if we stepped over a line or poor little for your old got stuck on the trampoline and they told us to stay on the blue area and not go get himthree different people come and stand over us we were the only people in the place really	4576
0	my 4 year old loved this place until the changes we discovered yesterday , parents no longer allowed on trampolines with their children . my son was not happy i could not play with him on the trampolines . also , he was instructed he can no longer do `` somersaults '' or tumbling .	4576
0	apparently you are supposed to lie about your child 's age for them to participate . several 3-4 year olds doing the 8+ activities , but because my 7.5 year old had the wrong color wrist band he was not allowed to climb . my bad , unfortunately for my kid i was an honest parent .	4576
1	my absolute favorite store in pittsburgh ! ! ! the best items at the best prices . found so many blazers and scarves and coats and shoes and more . love it..	4577
1	this is a wonderful consignment shop . located right along greentree road . free parking lot in front . always new items coming in . beautiful and unique high end items . they have furniture , home decor , clothes , shoes , hand bags , jewelry and accessories . all merchandise is good quality . i frequent this shop often and have purchased many beautiful items . highly recommend .	4577
1	i love savvy fox ! it 's so nicely curated and they have a great selection . i 've found some real treasures there . everyone who works there is really friendly ( well except for sue who looks like she just drank spoiled milk and seems suspicious of all her customers . ) all in all i highly recommend it for those who like treasure hunting / thrift shopping in a clean environment !	4577
0	consignors beware ! this is the worst store i have ever consigned with . after my initial drop-off appointment , they sold the new on-trend items right away , but neglected to assign them to my account . i had to visit and call the store a couple of times to correct the situation . the owner was rude .	4577
0	very rude ! after dropping off a coat and three purses , i stayed to shop a bit . while i was looking at the jewelry , i overheard the two older ladies working at the register commenting on my `` filthy '' purses and ugly coat . if they were not interested in my items , then they should not have taken them ! consigners are what keep businesses like savvy fox open , so the employees there need to have a certain level of professionalism . once my items sell , i will not be returning .	4577
0	i found the staff to be extremely rude . they also rob you if you are dropping off items . i 'm not sure who they think they are but they are just another resale store .	4577
1	i used groupon to get a brazilian blow out treatment . melanie was a doll . i have a lot of hair - both thickness and length . she tackled the whole treatment very quickly- took about 3 hours . i usually do the treatment myself , but i was n't in the mood this time- i am so happy i chose to let melanie to do this ! my hair turned out so good i may never do my own treatment again ! thank you melanie for all the hard work you put into my hair- i will be seeing you again ! !	4578
1	i am writing this review because i have seen some bad reviews on melanie and peopleya got ta b kidding me cause she has done the best brazilian blowout on my hair i have ever had and i have had it for 3 times and my daughter just had one and loves hers also so all these haters r a joke she is very professional and down to earth my car broke down once and she rescheduled with me she has always been on time for my appointments i will always go back to her she is the only one i trust now for my brazilian blowouts try her for urself u wo n't b disappointed cause these reviews r completely wrong	4578
1	i received an amazing haircut and ombré color ! ! ! i would definitely recommend ! ! ! and melanie was upbeat and professional ! ! !	4578
0	terrible ! has the worst scheduling process & low availability . scheduled 2 weeks in advance ( online only by force ) , drove 17 miles , waited 15 minutes , forced to txt for a response , returned call on restricted # , was on vacation & did n't bother to check her schedule & left me hanging . extremely disappointed ! no respect for peoples time . ca n't handle her own business & then deleted my post on her fb business page instead of dealing w/ comments good or bad !	4578
0	thank you melanie for disrespecting me yet again by using your personal client log to violate my privacy ... you make it very easy to continually point out your lack of professionalism . again i shall acknowledge how i highly do n't recommend your services ! ! ! !	4578
0	i got a horrible hair cut : ( i 'm still trying to recover . melanie did everything i told her not to do- this includes giving me layers and cutting it very short . my hair was supposed to be an inverted bob , instead it looks retarded -- choppy with incredibly short bangs ! sooooo disappointed : ( melanie did refund my money back and she was very apologetic . but ... the damage is done .	4578
1	these guys did a great job for me when i was forced out by a catastrophe . jared was right on top of it ! ! many thanks . highly recommended ...	4579
1	jessica gomez has been a godsend through and through from beginning to end . my situation was very difficult in the area that i live in especially considering the fact that i have three cats and living in silicon valley with a housing shortage is not an easy task period was very frustrating but jessica has been wonderful . even after placement contact with her has been amazing . amazing .	4579
1	crs was amazing . we were having incredibly difficult issues with a 3rd party vendor and melinda had our back the entire time . it felt so good to have her and crs in our corner . this is my 3rd review ever , the only other two yelp reviews i left were because of terrible companies . it feels so good to be able to write a review about a company that really went above and beyond . i can not say better things about this company and the wonderful people it employees . this experience really made me think that there are companies out there that can be truly considered exceptional .	4579
0	due to misunderstanding between my insurance company and crs temporary housing , they send me a collection letter with falsified attachments . it was a contract not even related to my claim . very unprofessional . very sneaky . very illegal .	4579
0	if your insurance agent tries to work with this company , immediately decline ! i was told over the phone for a monday delivery and waited all day for it . at 6pm i called and left a message . i received a callback telling me they are scheduled for tomorrow instead . no courtesy call or notice was given for the delayed delivery . for someone who had just lost their home and everything they 've owned and loved in a california wildfire , this is the last type of lack of professionalism someone needs . stay away !	4579
0	we were told to pay a lot of money down in fees , deposits , ect ... when working with crs . of course when it was time to get this money back we were unable to . they tried to help but when push comes to shove they were not able to get us any of the money that the housing area they set us up with decided not to pay back . i would never use this company again .	4579
1	this is a great place to live ! very quiet and smoking free . everything is kept clean and maintenance is very quick to respond with issues . it has a great view of the mountains and is close to a lot of great restaurants .	4580
1	this place is right next door to a target , what else do you need ! beautiful views of the superstition mountains , pool , and everything is brand-new !	4580
0	we have made numerous attempts to ask the office to take care of the noise issues that come from our upstairs neighbors . we constantly hear banging and yelling and everything else until early hours of the morning and still nothing has been done about it even though our child wakes up almost every night due to the noise . we were even asked to move even though we have done absolutely nothing wrong . i highly recommend not moving into this place .	4580
0	the office smells aggravating my allergies they require you to pay them if they accept a package for you most places do that for free .	4580
1	dr gallai is my doctor at momdoc he is very attentive to your care and does a great job to evaluate all you concerns and problems . the medical concierge are very friendly and courteous make you feel like family . i love coming to my appointment and would recommend any of the doctors .	4581
1	amazing service , caring staff and immediate appointments . what more could you want - they are the best in town ! !	4581
1	they are quick and efficient . always treated with care in a timely manner . and i have always felt comfortable and safe .	4581
1	dr srinivasan is great very attentative and makes sure all your questions and concerns are resolved right away	4581
1	i absolutely love this obgyn ! it 's so modern and everyone is very friendly . i wish i came here when i pregnant with my first .	4581
0	horrible experience with them ! my first visit they lost my urine , second time they made me belive i had an ectopic pregnancy ( which was not ) . the nurses are not orginized at all ! would not recomend mom doc to none of my friends or family !	4581
0	staff and drs are rude and insensitive . they do not listen and will not perform tests or exams needed . ladies listen your body and not some doctor who thinks they know it all like they do here . never going here again .	4581
0	i did n't make it pass the scheduler , heather . i thought she was rude & had an attitude . i prefer to go to an establishment where there act like they actually want you as a patient . just lost an established patient .	4581
0	i could n't agree more ! they make terrible errors and refuse to even apologize , after failing of course to blame everyone but their own lazy selves . walked out of office after waiting more than two hours ! they could n't care less . and i 'm suppose to have surgery tomorrow	4581
0	if you want to see a nurse or a pa , they can probably get you an appointment within 24 hours . if you want to see an actual doctor , you 'll have to wait a week for an appointment and then an hour in the exam room for one of their 2 doctors to actually make time for you .	4581
1	not the cleanest laundromat but it does the trick . laundry machines of all sizes . free soap . drop off/pickup available monday thru friday for $ 1.50/lb and a 10 lb . minimum ( same day service if you bring it early enough ) . weekends get very busy . there 's a barber shop 3 stores down too	4582
1	tourists in vegas for a couple nights and staying on the strip . this laundromat was recommended to us by concierge at mgm grand . we got a taxi there and back - $ 15 each way . easy to buy detergent and change notes to coins at the store attached to the laundromat . free wifi and reasonable prices . would def recommend !	4582
1	reasonable prices to get the job done . i wish there were some closer to my house though . it sucks driving to the strip .	4582
1	this is attached to aunty mays . we 've used this laundromat a few times for the fluff and fold . it 's handy and cheaper than laundry at the hotels . somehow we ended up with a few undies and shirts that were n't ours . not to mention i had all my bras in a wash bag and and wound up with 2 bras that were a size too big but still from victoria 's secret in my wash bag ... . 18pounds worth of laundry was $ 26ish .	4582
0	the only good parts are that the bathroom has hot water and you get a free drink when you get a roll of quarters . unfortunately you need a code to get in and it has no soap , toilet paper or towel/dryer and it 's painted black . it is n't that dirty except for the bathroom sink . it 's more expensive than the others i 've been to in the area . they have 3 tvs all showing the same thing and wo n't change one even if no one is watching any of them .	4582
0	broken machines , super shady and a complete waste of time . do n't go here	4582
0	horrible customer service ! this is our third time here and the hispanic lady that is here everytime we come was very very rude . when we walked in she said `` move move hurry , i have to get to the other side '' . i said `` excuse me , i 'm just opening the washer so i can throw it in and than i will move '' . do n't be so rude remember we pay your pay checks . it 's people like us who pays your bills . just because you have lots to do in a certain time frame it 's not my fault ! ! !	4582
0	do not go here ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! there are 13 dryers broken . the washing machines smell terrible . it is $ 2 a wash for very very small loads . bigger loads are $ 4-6 a wash ! washing machine did not fill up with water . it is overall unclean and messy . it is next door to a pole dancing school and a bar ... .maybe that excites you .	4582
1	just take my word for it and come in ! ! ! try it.. thank me later ! ! great staff super friendly .	4583
1	i went with the deluxe wash , took a long time but car was spotless inside and out . i mean pristine . the deluxe is not the option for a quick wash , but if you have time go for it .	4583
1	a full details for 55 dollars u ca n't go wrong . i would have never stop by in this location but the reviews were great . it 's in the middle of good and location is worn down . the bathrooms were clean . they did a descent job cleaning the car . they left the cup holders little dirty in the center console . but i ca n't complain the price was too good to be true . i normally pay 120 at other locations and they do n't even do great job . will definitely go back in future .	4583
1	please read the whole review . it is in two parts . first - best wash my car has ever had . the exterior and interior were great . everyone was very friendly and helpful . second part - do n't let the looks of the place from the road scare you away . the reviews that describe it as `` sketchy '' and `` that kind of hole in the wall '' are accurate . the place is very clean , but if not for all the great reviews , i would not have gone there today . it is now my only choice for car washes here in the valley .	4583
1	take your car here ! paid $ 18 for a deluxe car wash and my car looked like it just came out of the factory lot . it took a little time but there were tv 's inside and refreshments . there was also only one guy working on the cars in 112 degrees . he did an outstanding job . i gave the guy a huge tip . completely worth it . most other places start in the $ 50- $ 60 range for the detailing . take your cars/trucks/buses/bikes here . you will not be disappointed .	4583
1	they did an amazing job on my car yeah it might be a sketchy place but it 's cool ! oh and pay with cash cause they charge $ 2 to pay with bs card !	4583
1	best car wash in the valley . $ 25 hand wax , exterior and interior . out of my way but well worth it . my car looks brand new every time i leave .	4583
0	the worlds longest basic wash ! ! ! took over an hour on an empty sunday afternoon . my car was left in the sun for about 20 minutes before anyone started to dry my car or attempt to get what was left .	4583
0	horrible job . i specifically said no armor inside the vehicle , bcuz it 's greasy and i do n't like it . got my car and it was shinny but far from clean . horrible vacuum hob . windows all streaky and cup holder still dusty . would not come here again	4583
0	i 'm not happy with how my car turned out ! i paid for the basic $ 11 wash. ok yeah , it 's their bare basic but my car 's not clean ! they did n't vacuum my trunk or the seats . the dashboard , the doors , the cup holders , basically everywhere inside is still covered in dirt and dust . there 's still dust , bugs , and bird poop on the front and top of the car and the lights . their air freshener lasted only a few seconds . it 's not even worth the $ 11	4583
0	i 've been going to this car wash for years . my mom use to take me when i was a kid back in the 90 's but they have been really disappointing me lately . the new staff they have seem to be lazy and not as caring as the old crowd use to be . one day i took my car here and they managed to crack my whole dashboard and the only thing they offered was a free car wash ! the prices are cheap but the quality is getting worse each visit . i would take your car to los olivos down the road way better !	4583
0	i used to go here 5 years ago..and came back this afternoon since my car was dirty . i got tired of waiting inside , so i say outside to watch ... and i see one of the employees drive another car ... right into the back of mine ! when i went to investigate..all the guy ( jacob ) said was.. '' it was an accident '' . wth ! ! ! what customer service ! ! another guy comes up and say it 's ok- like it 's his decision ! then walks off- no apologies whatsoever ! i 'll update once i speak to the manager	4583
0	we 've been here several times to have our company vehicles cleaned . we 've always been happy with the price , service , and attention to detail . however , today ( 11/25/17 ) i walked in to have my van that i always bring in handwashed . the gentleman quoted me over 2x what he usually quotes me.. laughed at the price i said i usually get ... and told me that my business is `` not worth his time '' .	4583
0	where to start ... 1 . they `` lost '' ( maybe stole ) my gold class ring . 2 . two hours to finish a regular car wash. 3 . swirl marks from their towels all over the car . steve the owner was a nice gentlemen but i ca n't look past these three huge issues . i will be in contact with them again on wednesday to try and solve the huge issue of my missing gold ring .	4583
1	very thorough and great communication throughout the entire repair process . pictures and honest evaluation of your car . their car care club is a great deal as well . highly recommend !	4584
1	excellent place to take your vehicle . i was nervous to have the issues looked at , but jim assured me that the job would be taken care of in a timely manner and that the problems would be fixed . they did an excellent job . it 's been 4 days since i had work done and the car is still in great condition , so i 'd say the did an awesome job . will definitely be taking my car here again and again .	4584
0	i 've gone a couple times now , mostly due how quickly they could get me in . prices after speaking with other shops afterwards are above industry standard and they nickel and dime you . the bill adds up . was in for very simple routine maintenance and walked out paying 20 % more than quoted . not a huge deal to pay 20 % for smaller items , but i would n't go there for a costly repair . work seems fine ( hard to mess up oil changes ) . i ca n't speak of actual repairs . they are friendly enough and they seem to be able to get you in quickly , just expect to pay more than listed/quoted pricing .	4584
0	customer service is incredible . however , i had them check out a vehicle before i bought it , said it passed with flying colors , within 1 month i spent well over $ 1000 in repairs . obviously , incompetent mechanic .	4584
1	my experience with fox rental was great . i was worried because of bad reviews that rental car companies get but i had nothing bad happen at all . transportation to and from the airport was great . the lady at the counter was friendly , informational , and quick . i got the small economy car and it was great . because of this first experience i would totally recommend fox rental .	4585
1	sorry no complaints on my end . excellent car rental place and a bang for your buck . all around great car rental for my family and i. i will definitely use fox rent a car again . ty	4585
1	phoenix , az-busy day for a wed , but what can ya do ? booking was great , service was great , rented the cheapest car and got a 2013 chevy spark with 1000miles with excellent mpg . car was pretty small but thats what happens when you go economy . as for all the bad reviews ... not here ! 5 stars ! ! !	4585
1	rented a second time and still had a good experience . i have n't suffered the lines and i was told summer in phx is slow for rental cars so low lines alleviates the high stress i 'm guessing customer service feels during peak times .	4585
1	i was actually really apprehensive after reading all the reviews but i had a great experience . when i got there my reservation was taken care of really quickly and while i was given options of various price options i was n't pushed into anything i did n't want . my car was really nice and i had a small dent but it was acknowledged . my only complaint is that i had to make sure the lady behind the desk marked the dent on her sheet too as she did n't . check out was really quick and simple . price was really great too . based on my experience i would recommend this again	4585
1	after reading so many bad reviews , we almost cancelled but decided to stick with our reservation . the rental price was unbeatable . we arrived on saturday afternoon and returned car saturday night . there were three customer service people working and we were in line for only few minutes . we reserved intermediate suv which was out , so fox provided us with minivan instead which was even better for us . the minivan was very basic model but worked fine the entire week . return was super easy . we really did n't have any complaints . since there are so many bad reviews about this place , i decided to write a nice one since we did have a very good experience .	4585
1	once in a while i will rent an suv to drive up to the snowbelt ( during season ) and i will look into the prices for an suv rental ... .these usually rent in the areas of $ 50 a day ... .but twice now i got a mid-size suv for $ 18 a day ! ! ! ... ..unlimited etc ... .you cant beat that ! !	4585
1	i had a positive experience renting a car with fox . my vehicle was in the shop over the holidays and i was really bummed about not having wheels while i was on winter break . i found a really good rate on carrentals.com with fox rent a car when i picked up and dropped off at sky harbor airport . luckily i 'm not far from the airport . i did play around with the dates and times of pickup to get the best deal . the only downside is i returned the car early by about 12 hours and that did n't lower my total rate . i was still happy with the overall experience and would use fox again .	4585
1	there was 3 people ahead of me when i got there and 15 minutes later i was sitting in a very nice 2017 ford mustang next time i rent a car i will be going back to fox for sure ! unlike what other people suggested it was fast and there was no hidden fees super smooth and i was very happy with the whole process .	4585
1	decent and affordable , nothing over the top . check-out took less than five minutes . returning the vehicle was quick too . they add unnecessary steps like `` signing for the keys '' that there 's dents/damage to car , and upon return , you ca n't go straight to the airport . rather , you must go to a kiosk to refund/cancel your deposit . but the competition was twice the price .	4585
1	the rental counter is tucked in the middle of the rental car center with a small sign - we missed it so really look hard for it or you will miss it ! they are meticulous when it comes to checking the car for damage so be sure to do a thorough walk around and note even the smallest dings and scratches before you leave the garage . great price though - saved $ 208 for a week versus all others and that was for a compact car . imagine how much you 'd save for an intermediate or larger vehicle !	4585
1	2nd time i 've rented with them ( 1st in phoenix ) . the car rental is a few miles away from the airport so there is a shuttle that takes you over . had no issues renting . i used a debit card and showed my licensee . they wo n't check your credit score if you are visiting and can show a return flight . rented an economy car and it was great .	4585
1	first time using fox rental from phoenix location . i usually use the one in vegas and have always been treated well . this location is no different . quick service and low prices to rent from . was greeted and got help right away . friendly staff joked with us and was awesome enough to give us a free upgrade to a bigger car . i was lucky and got a brand spanking new 2015 nissan altima with only 6k miles . would definitely recommend this company !	4585
1	cheapest rate i found for what i needed . arrived at the counter and the attendant needia ( spelling ? ) was friendly , helpful , and enthusiastic - great attitude . the attendant downstairs was friendly , courteous , and quick . car was very clean , in great shape , and performed like new . i often rent cars when on business trips and i can say without hesitation that this was my best rental experience to date .	4585
1	the check in took maybe 10 min and we were on our way ! very friendly staff and such a positive experience : )	4585
1	they were great to us ! ! the women that helped us was fantastic ! her name was bea ! ! thanks again so much ! phoenix arizona	4585
1	i use fox whenever i go to phoenix . they 've always been friendly and professional . today , when dropping my car , fernando made my day with his infectious good mood ! thanks fernando , i 'll pay your good spirits forward !	4585
1	rented a car through a third party website for nov 13-17 ... .they had the best rate by far . had a reservation for a full size ... .nissan altima or similar . took the shuttle from terminal ... .there was no one in line and was helped right away . did n't have an altima but got a fairly new camry with 14k miles . paperwork was easy ... .they knew not to hard sell the insurance and gas and we were on our way . everyone was friendly ... .no problems . wo n't hesitate to use again .	4585
1	quick , cheap and friendly service i got a great deal on my car ( less than 100/wk ) nothing fancy about the car or quality but service was fast and friendly , the gentleman who assisted with the return of my car was great , no complaints !	4585
1	i have used fox many times . they are always friendly and provide nice cars . i agree with scott l 's post about the lines ... it took for ever for us to get our car . we rented a honda civic hybrid for around $ 40/day . not bad for a hybrid ! we saved a ton on gas in the 600 miles we drove in 4 days . i 'll return to fox again , but please get more people up at the desk ... it is bad when people in line feel the need to complain before they even get to the front ...	4585
1	compared to other rental services i have used , fox was great ! the car was very clean , smelled clean , and very well maintained . the check in and out process was streamlined . in fact , returning the car only took about 3 minutes ! some car places will review every nook and cranny and then try to charge you for anything that was exactly documented prior to departure . i 'm used to it taking a good 30-45 minutes for pickup because of having to document everything . not here ! on top of that , the rates were amazing and they upgraded us one level from what we had purchased . thanks , fox !	4585
1	not sure why the bad reviews . we had a very good experience with fox at the airport ... got a great price which was much lower than the others . had a malibu that was clean and big ... mileage was a little high ( 58,000 miles on it ) ... but no biggie . - short bus to the rental center ... no line ... fast check in ... quick pick up downstairs and fast drop off afterward . - the above are all i need in my rental company . foxy !	4585
1	i was a little wary of renting a car through fox given the other reviews on here , but i had a great experience with them . the employees were very courteous and our car was ready when we requested it . the car had a few previous dings on it , but for $ 8 a day , who really cares ? i saved a bundle and had a very nice experience . i would rent from fox again .	4585
1	pretty much get what you pay for . ask for a hyundai , they almost always have free satellite radio	4585
1	i was worry about bad review but , general manager : walter ( very nice looking guy ) he was so big hearted and helped me what i needed ! and alberto was try hard for me . he was kind too ! i appreciated both ! and did n't wait much great price and nice car ill rent fox again ! ! ! ! walter look like denzel washington ! he was such a sweet heart ! ! ! ! thank you ! ! !	4585
1	really easy , pleasant rep explained options , no pressure . quick pick-up , clean car , easy drop-off .	4585
1	fox rental lax has the friendliest and most helpful staff . both upon pickup and return , i was met with friendly engaging staff and a sense of humor also . thanks for making a stressful work week better with the smooth check out process and helpful hand sorting out the financials . sure to rent again !	4585
1	my rental of a 4 door wrangler from fox went perfectly . got in at a quiet time so the wait was short , with similar lines to the other rental companies . the car worked great and was n't dirty or smelly or banged up . return was smooth too . rate was excellent compared to the other companies . besides which nobody else at all had wranglers . btw you can fit 3 britax carsseats across the back seat of a 4 door wrangler . and the luggage area is big enough for a couple suitcases and bags and a stroller . way more fun with the top down than a minivan .	4585
1	fast friendly service at checkout and checkin . best prices . free ( truly free ) upgrade . will definitely use fox again .	4585
1	cheap rates , nice car ( jeep wrangler 4 door for $ 40/day ) , ca n't complain . i was worried when i came out to the car on day 2 and noticed a dent on the front bumper ( it was dark when i picked up the car and it had just been washed and still wet so i did n't see it ) . however i called them up when i saw it and they understood and noted that for me so i would n't be responsible for the damage . all i can ask for in a rental . would rent there again based on my experience .	4585
1	fox always gives me vip treatment . the front counter reps are personable and polite and the agents downstairs are always pleasant ! lorima , who works the desk , is the best ! ! ! it 's always great to see him . he keeps an upbeat and fun attitude throughout the check out . i never feel pushed to upgrade or buy add ons like i have with other rental places . fox always has the best rates and the best service !	4585
0	the reservation price online is different from when you come pick up the car . thy knock on about $ 50 dollars aside from fuel ! not only do you wait for an hour in line but they will offer you a better newer car and at the end state it 's only $ 78 more.. no thanks ! !	4585
0	of all the fox locations , the only one worse than this one is las vegas . cars are never ready !	4585
0	they do not even deserve 1 star . the sales people are scam artists . the guy added insurance when i said i did not want insurance . my price went from $ 150 to $ 359 . they are sneaky and they use confusing codes to trick customers . do not rent from them ! the management was absolutely no help .	4585
0	charged me for a `` free weekend upgrade '' offered to me by michael c. after realizing i was not fully refunded my deposit i called and spoke with brooke who was rude and told me i had to settle it with rental location . learned my lesson , will not be renting with fox again .	4585
0	a person i was traveling with booked fox . horrible , horrible customer service . sales rep tried to up sell absolutely everything . she was rude , pushy , sarcastic and everything else someone in customer service should n't be . she gave us the wrong directions to where the fox cars were , which was icing on the cake of her attitude . additionally , my colleague was charged for hours driven . so it 's not really unlimited mileage . spend the extra cash to be treated with respect !	4585
0	they would not honor the expedia price that i booked in advance . they charged excessive fees for an additional adult driver . i was told i would have to pay a late fee of $ 25 for returning car late . i was fine with that . they also added a $ 30 tax to that fee and an additional full day rental . that is double charging me . if i paid an additional day i 'm not late i 'm early . they added lots of unexplained taxes and blamed it on arizona . most customers there were complaining . never again and i 'm disputing the charges on my credit card	4585
0	walter from fox rent a car charged 200 dollars more on my credit card he then said that he could not use that card because of his mistake now we have been here for 3 hours after flight still with no vehicle . very unprofessional and a waste of time . we had reservations and now how to look for a new company .	4585
0	the worst rental car place at the airport . i landed from the east coast late and my brain was n't fully functioning , but i clearly remember declining all insurances and everything was added on . they over charged me by $ 150 . do not rent from here . go anywhere else .	4585
0	got to the fox rental area at sky harbour airport in phoenix , az . it took over two hours to get to the counter and confirm our reservation ! then 1/2 an hour to get our vehicle . i have rented from them before and spent less than 20 minutes to sign contract and get my keys . they have changed their procedures and the computers were not working well . also , only 1 or two people were at the counter . i will not use this rental agency again . tried to cancel the reservation and got stonewalled and placed on hold for over 30 minutes ... ... .	4585
0	arriving in phx at 9 pm we made our way to the rental car area . there were about 10 people ahead of us in line . we waited in line for over an hour and i 'm pretty sure that the lone guy behind the counter helped one person in that time . i finally gave up and went over to a bigger name rental company where the guy matched fox 's price and had me checked out and in my car in about 10 minutes . save yourself the hassle and headache and go through a reputable rental company	4585
0	the worse rental car experience ever . -5 review if it was possible	4585
0	i would give 0 based on the wait time . no other car rental company had more than 3 people in line most with none , yet fox had 30+ and initially only one person at the counter which eventually became 3 people at the counter . it took an average of 10-15 min to check in each person . ridiculous- my opinion plus the other 30 people still standing in line . one redeeming factor- counter staff were courteous .	4585
0	if i could give them zero stars ! while they offer the best rates on the internet their service leaves a lot to be desired . after arriving in phoenix , we take the shuttle to the car rental center . we are immediately greeted by the longest car rental line i have ever seen . the average wait time was over an hour . they had multiple people at the small counter but each car rental seemed to take over 15 minutes . after 20 minutes in line i decided to go next door to sixt ! paid $ 40 more and walked out with . car in 6 minutes ! save your time , energy and money .	4585
0	the worst ! ! ! our flight was delayed several times and they had no flexibility to accommodate us , canceled our reservation ! ! ! the woman told me they are not mit grads they ca n't trick the computer , i should have payed attention to their ratings ! steer clear , pay more it 's worth it !	4585
0	the customer service was horrible . the rep was so rude . he was so inappropriate . there is a reason their price is the cheapest . they are trying to gain customers . stay far away ! the pick up and drop off were both horrendous experiences .	4585
0	100 people in line , because their prices are cheap . their prices are cheap because they only have one guy working . be prepared to wait at least an hour , standing , for a rental . al other companies are open and no waiting .	4585
0	rented online for phoenix pickup . got car after upsale at counter and was paying what i did online . self inspection when taking car - now remember this ! ! ! take pics before leaving of everything - they tried very hard to charge me for a pinhead size chip in the windershield - fortunately we spotted this when we were exiting the pickup area and took a picture of it - get this - this chip was so small it doesnt show up in pic - but the inspector at check-in went to it immediately - lucky we had photo - now we are trying to get back deposit -	4585
0	if there 's a negative rate i would do it ! if i knew i would encounter this horrible experience i would 've paid more and get a better customer service . this is ridiculous ! not sure why all other companies have no lines and this one is the longest ever ! this is not worth this long wait . no one deserved to be treated this way . not sure how your company treats its employees that it reflects on their customers ! this is the worst ever ! ! !	4585
0	i rent cars nearly every week . thought i would try fox because of the good rates . like always you get what you pay for . rental agent laid the scare on insurance , obviously pressured to up sell and get a commission . i get it . but then i wait for 30 minutes for our car . pay back for not purchasing the extras ? perhaps i 'm still upset over such poor service and i 'm going to conspiracy theories . but i will not ever rent from them again . next week i stay with the tried and true	4585
0	we did our booking 4 m9nths ahead of time for $ 150 . however when v reached the place , the guy said he did n't have a car for me since we are 3 hours over the booking time . our flight was delayed n then their line was so long that we had to wait for more than an hour . he then wanted us to pay extra for driver . we ended up getting the car for $ 100 more than what we paid for initially . horrible service . wo n't use it again .	4585
0	be careful here . my problem was that i booked it through a broker that was far from honest . the fox counter people admitted that , but then stuck me with the unpaid part of the bill . do n't ever do this to yourself . they got in a hurry when i arrived , with long lines , and then told me that the problem on my bill would be resolved when i returned the car , no problem . when i returned the car , they blew me off . then they lied to amex , which dropped the ball on the dispute .	4585
0	we reserved a full sized suv but when we got there they did not have one . they tried to give us a much bigger one or a compact one . the staff and manager basically stated that we had to settle with cars we did not want .	4585
0	i would give it a zero if possible . first the guy at the counter was n't happy because my reservation was made with another vendor on the internet . then he tried to upsell me with insurance . then , despite having a reservation , they would n't honor it because they `` could n't '' use my credit card because it did n't have my first name , just an initial . the guy said that he would need to make me a new reservation . of course the rate was double the price i had on my reservation .	4585
0	ripoff ! ! ! watch out for ripoffs with this company . they will try to charge you for things like `` loss damage waiver '' and other addons that you do n't need . their base price is cheap , but then they push upgrades in such a way that unsophisticated renters ( like my wife ) end up paying way more than the advertised price . i actually disputed the charges with my credit card company because they were so deceitful . never again will i go to a fox rent a car , especially in phoenix !	4585
0	the service rep was good , and i got lucky with the line . it took 25 minutes with three customers ahead of me when i entered the line . i have no idea how long it took the last of eight people in line when i left , but it ca n't have been good . i was charged a $ 150 deposit , and was only refunded $ 125 . i called customer service and they refunded the `` early return fee '' , which never should have been charged . if i had not checked they would have , in effect , stolen $ 25 from me . i wo n't use fox again .	4585
0	needed a car simply to get across town a coupe of days . thought i would save a few bucks but in the end not a saving . service was okay . car was a beat up looking one with dents and scrapes not accounted for , had i not brought the car into a more lit location i would have missed a huge dent due to the dark . if i did n't catch it perhaps i would have been billed like other folks who have reviewed did .	4585
0	horrible ! ! the car had damage and they over charged me for one additional day . they also use high pressure to sell the insurance . i wo n't be back . run ! ! !	4585
0	the service was n't bad , it was n't the fault of the people who work here at all . in fact the gentleman who served us was very sweet and patient . it 's just that i was given a quote when i had made a reservation weeks ago online , upon arrival , ( as expected ) extra fees were slapped on , alright understandable , but the price went from $ 143 online to $ 440 in person . why such a significant jump ? was completely unexpected and very dissapointing ! next time , will call enterprize ahead of time since they are more accurate with quotes and do n't waste any time ! ! ! ! very dissapointed .	4585
0	wish i could rate zero . do n't go here pay the few extra to go anywhere besides here . on top of bad service your bill will be double in extra charges and other things . i would get into detail but just know to runnnnnn ! ! ! ! ! !	4585
0	spend the extra money and forgo the intense headaches this poorly managed company will cause you . i waited 42 minutes in line just to get a car . and to top it off , their subpar customer service employees know that they suck and have developed a very defensive tone with their customers . i witnessed two people in line get aggravated and voice their frustrations only to be belittled by their counter staff . those two people promptly left the line , went next door to enterprise with what i assume was no reservation and left with a car in mere minutes . if only i had followed them . avoid these folks .	4585
0	my car smelled like a dog peed in it and then someone smoked ten packs of cigarettes to cover up the dog pee smell . also , nice job phoenix car rental area with no gas stations nearby . i used priceline and you get what you pay for . avoid .	4585
1	great nail salon in north scottsdale . everyone from the front desk to the nail techs are all sweet and professional . the salon is clean , inviting and nicely decorated . nail color selection is awesome and if you want something out of the ordinary they can do that too . mandy my nail tech is just lovely but if she is n't available everyone else will do just fine . salon is in a nice area , plenty of parking and surrounded by great restaurants . worth a visit .	4586
1	i love getting my gel manicure and pedicures done here ! i have been to a lot of nail salons around the valley and this one is by far my all-time favorite ! my gel polish always stays for at least 2.5 weeks and there are so many beautiful colors to choose from . if you 're into glitter , this is the place to go ! all of the ladies & everyone here are so friendly and welcoming , i just love coming here.it 's a great place to bring friends and family ! always very , very clean and the salon is beautifully decorated !	4586
1	i 've been going to scottsdale hand and foot spa for a year now . i love it here . cherry is my nail technician and she is the best , hands down . i 've been to a lot of places and i 'll never find anyone as good as cherry . the service is always fast and friendly here and even on days when they are busy , the staff tries their hardest to accommodate everyone . awesome place !	4586
1	by far the best place for mani/pedi anywhere ! everyone is so friendly and customer focused . massage chairs for pedicures are heaven on earth . mandy is the bomb ! she does such a great job , even when i have unique nail design requests- she 's fantastic ! people constantly notice my nails and ask where i get them done . and my nails stay perfect from visit to visit . i recommend them highly ! ! ! ! danny , please double mandy 's pay ! !	4586
1	great service , they really care , better quality and treatment . much better than scottsdale nails . i ca n't believe i wasted all this time at the ridiculous salon .	4586
1	i love dream catchers and now i have them on my nails ! amazing ! thank you for always bringing my photos to life !	4586
1	i have been going to scottsdale hand and foot spa for a couple years now and absolutely love it ! this is my nail spot i can always rely on them to make my nails sparkle and make me feel like a princess . they are very genuine and welcoming and the environment is zen like with soothing music while you have your services done . one of the best parts is how clean the nail salon is with their disposable liners for the pedicures . they go the extra mile with rose petals and orange peels in the pedicure bowls ! this place is top notch .	4586
1	i have found my go to salon for my manicures and pedicures . tracey always creates a unique and beautiful design for me . she takes the time to perfect the details . i make new friends every time i go here too ... customers and staff so friendly !	4586
1	been to scottsdale hand & foot spa this morning . tracey did a wonderful job on both toes & fingernail designs . do n't go anywhere else when your hands & feet need pampering . when you 've had the best , nothing else will do ! ! thursday , october 12 -- another masterpiece by tracey at scottsdale hand & foot spa	4586
1	love the foot soak here . the only thing that could be better was the massage pads were hard to use . but one of the best pedicures i have had in a long time .	4586
1	i have been using scottsdale hand & foot spa for my gel manicures and pedicures for about 4 years . my nail tech , mandy , is fabulous . all the technicians are awesome . the spa is clean and state of the art . ever since switching to scottsdale hand & foot spa women constantly ask me where i get my nails done ! even other nail technicians have inquired ! thank you mandy and all the nail techs at scottsdale hand & foot spa !	4586
1	i 've been coming here for many years been coming to cherry and love her work ! she is a perfectionist ! always pleasant . in the event she is on a vacation , i see her sisters jennifer or stephanie . cherry does it all ... acrylics , gels ... . ! ! ! ! denny is an awesome manager as well ! ! !	4586
1	after having a rough experience here , the owner , denny contacted me . he was very apologetic for the services i received and made it right by having me come in and get a new sns manicure done . jenny is a patient and meticulous woman . i 'm a very critical and picky customer and she took her time with me knowing that . not once was she rude , not once was she short with me , and very very accommodating . i would absolutely come back again !	4586
1	great and efficient ! really liked the atmosphere with the friendly nail technicians and soothing aquariums . highly recommend to travelers and locals !	4586
1	what a beautiful place with fish aquariums and a fun bar type seating for your manicures . i was very impressed with the price for a spa type setting and great manicurist . if would of enjoyed a little longer massage but was very happy with the services . i am here every winter and finally found my go to place !	4586
1	this was literally the best nail salon i have ever visited ! besides being really great and detailed at doing my shellac manicure and pedicure..the nail techs were super nice , friendly and warm ! danny the manager had great customer service skills and really cared about how our experience was .	4586
1	i have only visited this salon twice , but both times i had a very good experience . the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing . i especially like the large fish tank , you can view it while getting a pedicure or sitting at the manicure bar . the massage function on the seat also had a heat setting that i really liked for my sore back	4586
1	moving to arizona from indiana i had a hard time finding a nail salon that made me feel like home . after trying out multiple places i knew after mandy did my nails for the first time i found my new nail home ! ! her attention to detail is excellent and she introduced me to hard gel instead of acrylic and it has been life changing for my nails ! ! i send all my new friends to mandy and they are hooked as well ! ! you wont be dissapointed ! !	4586
1	i 'm 100 % happy w my outcome ! my manicure looks just like the pic i brought in . tiffany killed it ! she did my chicago cubs design by hand . i 'm super impressed ! i ca n't wait to show them off in chicago . this was a trial run ... but i know i 've found my person and place ! see u in a couple weeks . you 're the best !	4586
1	we lve miss mandy she 's amazing the sweetest & kind & meticulous my nails look sooooo pretty & they last i look toward to seeing her every two weeks	4586
0	the place just is n't the same since lee sold out . i 've tried to stay but at some point the wide selection of glitter and polishes does not outweigh technicians who do n't know what they are doing and who are rude . i need a new place ; (	4586
0	tragedy struck when my wife made an appointment for a pedicure for 3 pm . she arrived at 2:50 and promptly watched while numerous customers were taken ahead of her . by 3:20 it was clear that they had no interest in taking her and she left . i suppose that if you are a regular customer they might do a good job but for those looking for a new experience , probably best to go elsewhere .	4586
0	cherry always does a wonderful job but the customer service is horrible ! even with an appointment , i have waited almost 30 minutes to get started . a few times are understandable but almost every time , it 's at least 10-15 minutes . if a discount or some sort of deal was offered because of the inconvenient wait , that would be fair . but after going there for over 2 years , a simple sorry wo n't do anymore . i hate to have to leave this place and find another but if you 're a busy person like me , it 's hard to just sit around and wait	4586
0	i found this pedicure shop on yelp and based on the reviews gave them a try . i ended up being very disappointed . the nail polish selection was ill kemp and disorganized . the seating at the foot dryer were $ 10 ikea chairs and not something i wanted to sit on . it is true , they do offer disposable liners but you do n't get massage jets as the liners are placed in plastic foot baths within the spa . they put a mud mask on my legs that they left far too long and it ended up burning the backs of my calves .	4586
0	over charged ... gave us the menu of prices and over charged us by $ 25 . they said it was because of the gel . i have never been anywhere that charges more than $ 5- $ 7 for gel . overall staff was ok except two were rude . i would not go back ... . felt ripped off .	4586
0	denny this is the way you saw it . your nail techs that were available said that yes they had appointments coming in but they could have easily fixed my 2 broken nails in 10 to 15 minutes . the problem is you are not accommodating . everything is done on your terms no customer service on your part .	4586
0	this place has gone downhill . the gel overlay always chips and they are not accommodating to fix . i have gone to this place regularly for years and am so disappointed in the changes over the past few months .	4586
0	a group of 5 of us had an appointment for 2:30 . my cousin and i got sat about 2:45 for our pedicure and about 3:35 i look over and my mom and the girls were still waiting to get their manicure . it had been about 1-1/2 hours . really chaotic in there the guy was running around like crazy . when we brought it to his attention he was not apologetic at all . my mom did not get her nails done because we had to get to a dinner reservation . very disappointing - will not return . tip to this establishment - stop accepting all the walk ins when people have set appointments ! ! ! !	4586
0	the gel polish peals very easily . i wo n't go there anymore . they do n't treat everyone the same .	4586
0	spent $ 200 here in one weekend ... two nails popped off in 3 days . went back the following weekend with an appointment to repair them , and they ignored me . i sat there for 25 minutes and finally left .	4586
0	when i entered the `` spa '' it was hot and crowded and loud . a gaggle of little girls had taken over the shop so there was no quiet and relaxing atmosphere . the lady who worked on me never attempted any conversation and attempted to up the bill immediately . she never completed the service - no hot towels for my feet ! she rudely jerked my feet around and laughed at other customers and talked to a fellow pedicurist in a foreign language making facial grimaces at other customers . when i came home my heels were rough and had nicked places . i will not be back .	4586
0	i called they said that my daughter and i could come on and we were there three minutes later and discovered that they had no openings for two hours . we could have gone to four other locations on the way from our house to here but chose to come here based on yelp reviews .	4586
0	there good until you break a nail and if denny is the manager he makes sure he has no one to fix the broken nails . i 'm finished with them	4586
0	( see update below ) 3/17 : excellent service , all 5 of us were satisfied with our mani & pedicures fabulous color selection & designs offered . some of us got regular and some of us gel ... .all amazing ! will be back definitely ! ! ! update 3/20 : my manicure lasted only 3 days : ( see photo of nail polish peeling off in a whole sheet . and this is regular polish ( not gel ) ... i 've never had regular polish peel like this ? ! i give 2 stars instead of 5 now . i must say my pedicure by jen still looks great .	4586
0	i made an appointment at 4pm . i was five mins early . i had someone to be at 5:30pm so i thought an hour and 15 mins was more than enough time . i did n't get helped until 4:45pm . on top of them making me 45 mins late to my meeting . i hate my nails . i told her i wanted them to look natural and they look far from that . i am so unhappy with them . i will never be back . they have to respect for people 's time or honoring an appointment . i will never go back .	4586
0	my friends and i wanted something specific and when we called to make an appointment we were told it would n't be a problem . we got there and the nail techs would n't do as we asked and insisted they knew better . our nails did not turn out well at all . we would not recommend this nail salon at all . very poor customer service .	4586
0	this place is absolutely horrible . the man who answers the phone is incredibly rude and condescending and this establishment should be embarrassed to keep him in their employ . save yourself the terrible experience and go elsewhere !	4586
0	i usually love this place but not sure if new owner or what but def gone down hill . i choose numerous colors and seemed out or lost . then the man doing my nails asked l another co worker questions and she got very rude worth me and him . i felt be littles . i ended up not getting anything done but have them take my polish off and i still had to pay $ 10 for it . will never return which sucks cause i used to brag about this place	4586
0	i 've been here a few times , but i always end up coming back to get something fixed ! i went in yesterday and waited 30 minutes with my feet in hot water . i also noticed they were letting people wait long time with no service . my friend was waiting for 45 minutes . they seem to bite off far more than they can chew , and the front desk guy jumps in and looks very unprofessional . he went from doing one customers pedicure then to an older woman and was painting her nails standing up . hire more workers or simply stop trying to over stuff clients at your business .	4586
0	i 'm completely unhappy with my service i received here . i felt ignored while i was waiting even though i have heard great things about this place . i came in just for a gel polish change right before i left on vacation . and just two days after getting them painted they have already peeled a good amount . i 'm completely unsatisfied especially after paying $ 25 just to get them painted . what a waste of time and money this place was . i highly do not recommend it . i honestly wish i could get my money back because i 'm incredibly unhappy .	4586
1	ontario place is a small amusement park for younger kids . they have a number of rides and even a water park . they usually have a number of people in costumes for you to take pictures with . there is also an imax which you can watch certain films ( but not movies ! ) for free . you can walk along the harbour and cross over to the canadian national exhibition centre during summer . however , the park is getting a bit old and there is not a lot to offer for the older kids . adults may find the place a bit dull .	4587
1	i did n't grow up in toronto , so i never knew ontario place in her heyday . i will say , though , in the summertime there is still a lot going on ! the venue is used for lots of festivals and fairs and the park and water views are fabulous . the imax is back up and running in the cinesphere and and i look forward to introducing my daughter to the joy of pedal boats soon .	4587
1	i have been here several times now or concerts . very nice venue ! seats are good , even lawn . you an see from everywhere . lots of concessions . friendly staff . getting out after a show can be challenging ! watch out for the cabbies that are right by the entrance . they go rogue and gouge concert goers ... '' how much will you pay ? '' . if you take a short walk up the road to the first light and hail a can there , you can get the normal fare . fun place to hang . beer is cold , food is n't to bad .	4587
0	5 stars if it was 1979.. ontario place was a really cool , unique theme park . they have a nice space for weddings , fortunately movies are playing again , mostly second run.. for the most part it 's sat for ages , with little to no reason to enter . toronto has improvements , overall a disappointing waterfront . this ontario place takes a big chunk of it . the imax theatre is incredible , check it out . rest of ontario place looks abandoned l .	4587
0	last time i went to ontario place i wanted to shoot myself out of boredom . i do n't understand why they do n't just make access to the grounds free , and keep paid access to things like the rides , water park , etc . i do remember one time i went there with my high school that was fun though . some yacht owner was driving around the harbour blasting the macarena while people danced on the bow . even if they knew how embarrassing that dance was going to be years later , i think they still would have done it . that was priceless , but not an incident ontario place can claim responsibility for .	4587
0	meh . not a lot to do here if you 're not 10 years old . however , they do have the occasional concert that is amazing to see in their outdoor theatre ! do n't even bother getting tickets to the covered area seating , the lawn seating is where it 's at .	4587
1	one of the best bakery & restaurant in las vegas the pastry is always fresh & the customer service is excellent ... .. ! !	4588
1	absolutely love the smell of fresh bread and the cheesecake here , i cant get enough of it . the selection of bread is good and they have all of my personal favorites so im very happy with the variety offered . its a very nice family owned bakery and the service is great , they are always so nice and friendly . you have to try the papa nachos they are delicious and my new favorite snack .	4588
0	no les recomiendo este lugar dan un servicio de la chingada y las popusas no estan rellenas y el encargsdo o dueno tiene un caracter de la mierda , compre un pan y esta seco y viejo y no me lo quizo cambiar el vato es un senor de barba abusados amigos	4588
0	learn about service dogs and avoid law suits that will make you loose thousands of dollars and intimidation and rudeness dont work on me ! you need to train your workers better	4588
1	i always go to this starbucks because there is a drive-thru and there is rarely a long wait . everyone who works here is very friendly . my drink always comes out tasting great !	4589
1	this starbucks is perfect ! service is amazing ! we love coming here eventhough it is n't closer to us thsn the other starbucks ! expect to be treated kindly . the baristas make your drink the way you want it and they care unlike the other robot barristas at other locations . we keep coming back to this place !	4589
1	i love this location ! ! all the baristas are nice they never make mistakes , always smile and giving good service	4589
1	missy was very friendly and professional ! she introduced me to a few new drinks and they were absolutely amazing ! great customer service	4589
1	i will make this review simple ... it is starbucks . thank is all ... if you do n't know what starbucks is and reading yelp to find out , yelp may not be the right site for you . decently friendly staff .. a little bit busy of a location - horrible parking lot . it is starbucks .	4589
1	this is the starbucks i frequent the most because it is the closest to work . they always make my drink as specified , and are always friendly . the only downside is that the parking is kind of a pain in the butt because it is next to an equally busy einstien 's bagels .	4589
1	traffic in the area is n't the greatest , but other than that . great place to grab a quick frap	4589
1	i always go through drive-thru because there 's limited parking in front of starbucks . you 'd have to park near wells fargo or the pub if it 's full , which most of the time it is . for me , it 's pretty easy to get in and out of the plaza even though that area is so small . they have plenty of staff to get the line going , so you rarely have to wait a long time . the phone app makes it easy to pay too and they 're always so quick in their service . this starbucks definitely up to par with the name and the kind of service you 're supposed to be getting .	4589
1	the coolest decorated starbucks in the whole sw . the baristas always get my beverage right and out to me quickly . as a former barista , i can say they 're one of the best locations in vegas	4589
1	i have the risto here at the starbucks on the corner of rainbow and flamingo . i never forget who i am and they always remember my drink . i especially like the flat white these days .	4589
1	this is the best starbucks . i ordered on my phone and went to pick it up . they had done one of my drinks incorrect ( should have been hot , but they made it cold ) no biggie , i went in and explained it to them , they were very nice , and apologetic . they made the new drink for me right away and i was out the door . mistakes happen , but how a business handles them says a lot ! !	4589
1	ok , i had a show to go to and i needed not to nod off at any time during the performance . what to do ? stop at starbucks on the way and get a quad espresso , the drink of champions . this rainbow boulevard location is semi on my way and it 's open later than a neighborhood bucyky , so here it was . the coffee was great , the play was fantastic , and it was a great night . i think i have a new stopping off spot when i need that extra lift !	4589
0	place has a musty smell to it , staff was n't very friendly and i have zero clue how you mess up a double espresso , but they sure did it ... drink came out half the size of any other starbucks in town	4589
0	besides the parking issues on this location . i came in today and i ordered an ice chai tea latte with soy , and everything seemed okay . leaving the location i looked at my drink and i come to fine out my milk is clunky ... it was spoiled.. i went back in and i told them if they could remake it . some girl with curly hair and short told me , '' so what . does that mean you want me to remake it '' . bad service ! ! !	4589
0	i walked into this starbucks that was not busy at the time ( 8:45am sunday ) and no one greeted me , no line and 5 employees all talking together just standing around . after a minute the girl finally walks over to the register and unenthusiastically asked me how she could help me . during the whole transaction she was indifferent and stone faced . she must either hate her job or was having a bad day . so sorry for her but very low standards for starbucks employees . never happened to me at starbucks before . i will not be visiting this location .	4589
0	i like to stop at starbucks on occasion and normally its an easy in easy out experience . the product was fine as always and the staff was friendly as expected . the problem with this location is just that , it 's location . the drive though starts around back and depending on the line it blocks a few different lanes of traffic , especially when others do n't realize there is a line forming in one direction and they try and start a new line , not exactly any room for this . there was constant horn blowing and yelling while at his location , a bit mad if you will .	4589
0	i 'm a normal starbucks lover but this location has no consistency . i waited over 20 minutes in the drive-thru just now and also the coffee was so bitter than i have ever had . it was scolding hot and i was n't the other person who said something . the lady in front of me was so displeased that she parked her car in drive-thru , got out and said to fix her coffee asap . i love starbucks i really do and honestly i do n't complain but pick up the wait times and have a little more consistency with making coffee .	4589
0	5 minutes until the free tea special ended , the girl taking orders decided to delay the person she was taking orders for on a very simple order to run the time down . this resulted in the rest of the line not being able to get their free tall teas . this is not good customer service . i hope management realizes how stupid this was too annoy the rest of your customers . 8 people walked out .	4589
0	i go to a starbucks every day . i 've even worked at one for a while . the baristas here are very nice , but they do not know how to make a flat white . i keep getting them and they come with no . foam . come on , guys . i know it gets busy , and it 's a pain to foam up the milk . but that 's what the drink is supposed to have . if i wanted a foam-less drink , i 'd order something else . and if i 'm going to pay almost $ 5 for coffee , i want the right one . i do n't have time to demand another one .	4589
0	this company supports people who engage in discrimination against physically disabled people . if you 're handicapped with any physical impairment starbucks will put profits before people and just do not care about us	4589
0	i asked for my mocha `` extra hot . '' i guess that means `` almost warm . '' i 'm bummed that i did n't check it while i was there because i know they will heat it up . i 'm looking for suggestions for a better coffee shop in the rainbow/flamingo area .	4589
0	morning crews are so bad . they event told me the red reused cup is out of stock but if i want to buy ... they have it . really	4589
0	the coffee works in a pinch , but still taste like dirty water . i do n't get foo-foo drinks , if i did it might taste better . service is always good to great at any starbucks .	4589
0	just left this location . i even tipped the girl at the window . whichever barista made my caramel macchiato thought they could be sneaky and jip me on my drink . my sister however received her full amount of almond milk on her macchiato . always check your drinks before leaving . sometimes they make them right and other times its bland or lacking in volume . i used to work for starbucks and they know better . pure laziness here ! !	4589
1	this getgo is really convenient on freeport rd but easily accessible from rte 28 . its right on my way to work , so i can get hot coffee in the morning and cold drink in afternoon , and of course gas anytime . service is quick inside , and there are plenty of pumps outside .	4590
1	convenient , well-stocked , and very helpful with the linked discounts from their grocery stores - this is the place we always stop at !	4590
1	it 's on a busy corner so watch pulling in and out but the gas prices were low . inside they have a lot of hot food and soda options . ive had there sandwiches before and they were good but i 'd rather drive a quarter mile and get some thing at the big giant eagle . great place to get gas , coffee and lottery tickets	4590
1	okay , it 's a large gas-station/convenience store . it 's got a lot of pumps , and they give a good discount if you agree to shop at giant eagle and whore-out your identity via a little bar-code ( ... and i do it ) .	4590
1	i never got any food before from get go until august 25 , 2015 . it was late we just came from a gala that only had finger food and was still hungry , so we stopped at get go on frankstown rd . we got a steak hoagie , buffalo chicken hoagie , and cheese fries ... very good ! food was good quality and hot . i had to try them again on october 17 , 2015 this time i got the buffalo chicken hoagie my fiancé got last time and it was the best i ever had . i 'm like sheetz who ?	4590
0	never go to this or getgo anywhere , never use the car wash it 'll scratch your car , and smells like sewage , and the managers wo n't even tell giant eagle corporate about the claim . they just throw it out when you leave .	4590
0	i 'm a regular at this location . never had a complaint until today . ordered food . got my food . drove down the road . opened up food container . to my surprise i was given these ( refer to picture ) . laziness at its finest . the employee had to place these in the container . what made them think `` this looks good '' ?	4590
0	just went through the wetgo carwash and it smelled like raw sewage . it was stale and dirty . i paid $ 12 for the deluxe wash and it was such a waste . my car smells bad inside and out now . i 'm extremely disappointed .	4590
0	this get go is butt . always packed with creeps and the food ai n't no good . i wish there was a sheetz there so i could get some decent mto . stop eating there pat , it 's weak	4590
0	they turned an elderly man away who was clearly in distress , all he needed was to use the restroom . no compassion , maybe it 's a rule but come on fuck the rules !	4590
1	he 's ok . i do n't like going to him . ( only because i cant eat next door at ichiza afterwards : )	4591
1	all my family members have been with doctor andy for over 10 years . the staffs are friendly and helpful . never have to wait long to get the treatment . doctor takes time to answer your questions and explained what needed to be done and why and giving you options to decide . never try to rip you off .	4591
1	i 've been coming to evergreen dental for over 10 years and have never experienced a problem . i get my teeth cleaned regularly and follow dr. andy 's recommendations to maintain a healthy smile .	4591
0	is there anyway i can give this place 0 star ? i would not trust this dental place . we went there because this place took our insurance , after the x-rays they told us ( me and my husband ) that our teeth were horrible and that we need deep cleaning ! we told them that we just want regular cleaning and we had just moved to vegas and had our regular cleaning when we were still in new york but the dentist insisted that he ca n't do regular cleaning for us . we did n't check the review before visiting this place and that was our bad .	4591
0	the receptionist in the front has the worst custumer service . she is very rude . and do n't have manners to talk to anyone . she was talking to me like i am her child . my question to her was why did n't i get a call reminder for my appointment and she said `` you are a grown women and you need to be responsible for your appointment '' . excuse me lady but any other dentists or doctors had always send me a reminder.i regret moving from my prior dentist . no one should go there unless you want to deal with someone like her .	4591
0	this is the worst place in las vegas to get your teeth examined looked at or fixed . evergreen dental is very poorly put together . they are insurance scammers once they figure out your insurance they will hike up all your prices they will tell you you need a root canal not a tooth filling . the staff is very rude and unprofessional very bad attitudes very lazy very snobby all they care about is hiking up your insurance and getting the max they do not care about your dental plan or your needs or your wants please find a better office to go to	4591
1	i frequently go here for gas . i 've used the usps located at the back of the store . although separate businesses , it 's nice having the capriotti 's shop attached to the location . i choose to go in and pay cash for gas and i 've always encountered pleasant cashiers . there is an atm inside this location . i 've never had to wait more than a few minutes in line to checkout . it 's a convenience for me !	4592
1	when the wife has the middle of the night munchies , this is where we go ! it 's nice to finally have a 7-eleven close to home . reminds me of when i was growing up and there are on almost every other corner in las vegas . fortunately , i do n't go for the slurpee or convenience store junk food anymore . they do make a good once-in-a-while treat for my young men , however . even in the middle of the night , this store is busy ! store is clean , the employees are friendly , they stock the ben & jerry 's ice cream here and that is why we go .	4592
1	not normally a huge fan of 7-eleven 's , they tend to smell like a hundred years of spoiled roller dogs to me . this one , however is nice . no nasty smell , good selection , and friendly employees . plus , it 's super convenient to my work . just watch out for the parking !	4592
1	it 's always convenient to to do last minute shopping when your friend coming to visit you from out of town and you do n't have nothing to offer beverage or food .	4592
0	be advices . had incident happened 7/10/15 during routine car wash. metal bar came crashing down on my car . called facility and business/district manger 20 times , was promised a call back . not one single returned call , but was promised they will take care of it . the staff informed me this is 3rd time it had happened at the car wash . finally got word from my insurance that the manager informed them they are not responsible . just wished they could have told me straight up instead of wasting my time of calling and leaving voice mail everyday . what a bad brand name for 7/11 , and sinclair .	4592
0	austin , is rude and does n't seem to care about general manners . i walked in and was heading to the back for a soda and this punk austin nearly ran into me & then proceeded to act as if i was in his way . then i had the misfortune to have the same guy ring me up . he was still being rude and has zero politeness whatsoever . who hires such a jackass ? the guy nearly scratched me when i handed him my item to ring it up . such crap service for such a brief interaction .	4592
0	what 's the point of having medium slurpee cups with no medium lids ? or large slurpee lids with no large slurpee cups ? or wet large big gulp cups like they were just rinced out ? and over four of the sodas on the fountain marked out of order ? at least the cashier was frieny and said `` have a good night , '' but i was still disappointed .	4592
0	got home and looked at my receipt and i was overcharged for items that i did n't even buy . beware.will never comeback . i hear that there is a scam going around that when the people in front of you use cash , the cashier will pocket it , and charge the next person on line if they use a credit card .	4592
1	had two jackets i needed to get dry cleaned in time for the fall season . i was a bit apprehensive because one of the garments is my all time favorite leather bomber jacket . however the lady working at the front was super nice & helpful , so i was more reassured . when i picked both items up , they were both pressed and dry cleaned perfectly ! going to give their alterations a try on a couple items and will update this review .	4593
1	always drop my clothes off here . quick convenient and easy . never had a problem . prices are affordable to me . nice and friendly people working .	4593
1	a great neighborhood dry cleaner/tailor . i 've come here for a few years now and they 've never failed me . excellent service . a really nice gentleman , and tailor , runs the shop and is always attentive . he 's probably tailored 3/4 of my wardrobe . it appears some , maybe all , services are done in house . all my items come back the way i want , there is no fear of items being damaged or ruined . give them a go . they truly care about the product and customer .	4593
1	excellent business . i had a pair of pants altered and two suits cleaned . turn around time was just a day . pants for absolutely perfect . wo n't go anywhere else .	4593
1	my son is thrilled with the hem on his gi ( jiu jitsu uniform ) . he was impressed with how professional it looked and super happy that they rushed his alteration so he did n't miss a class . great experience . : )	4593
1	angel cleaners are the best place to take my clothes to dry clean and alternation . they are always on time and best service . way to go thanks !	4593
0	over priced for the poor quality dry cleaning they provide . i have taken the same suit in on 3 separate occasions for one small stain that they could never get out yet charged me for every time . i recently took that same suit with that same stain to one click cleaners and they took it out with no problems !	4593
0	just tried to take my shirt back so he could fix it he wanted to charge me 15 more dollars . never again will i wver go back there .	4593
0	i walked in with a pleated raw silk skirt that i need tailored to be taken in . the owner had me try it on . and started pinning on one side . i pointed out that it had a zipper and that it it must be taken in on both sides for symmetry since it is pleaded . he swapped my hand off the skirt and said he was the tailor . poor listening skills and rudeness made me walk out . i drove across the street to all star cleaners , alterations by edwin . amazing job ! highly recommend him .	4593
0	negative stars ! went here to get some shirts dry cleaned . as soon as i walked in i noticed an overpowering scent of cigarette smoke so i walked out . why would i leave my clothes there ? who wants their clothes smelling like smoke ? not me !	4593
0	go somewhere else . trust me . the owner is rude and overcharges , when i pointed out the overcharge , no apology no nothing just muttered under his breath . never coming back .	4593
0	absolutely the worst . completely ruined my $ 100 silk shirt and would n't do anything about it except offer to dry clean it again which would n't do anything . it was returned to me ripped in the back and stained on the front . a reputable dry cleaner would pay to replace it but no he only insulted me by saying i bought it in like that and said it was too tight on me and i spilled food on it . no , it 's a silk shirt . who wears a silk shirt tight ? nobody . this is bullshit . do n't give them your business . would n't even refund the $ 5 to clean it .	4593
1	super clean and excellent location around the corner from notre dame and less than a half a block from rue saint paul , the main street in old montreal . service was also very friendly . valet price was reasonable . i deducted a star because the mattress and pillows were extremely uncomfortable . the sides of the mattress offered no support . they had too much give . maybe this was because the mattress was on a murphy bed instead of a regular box spring ? pillows were lumpy .	4594
1	excellent hotel . great location . you can easily have a family in the room since it is basically a suite . staff was very nice . maid service was very good since they came back in evening to get the room ready for the night . our facing courtyard room was dead quiet ; street could be a bit noisy but not bad . i could make my hot tea easily every morning . recommend it highly .	4594
1	one of the best hotels that i have ever stayed at ! prime location -- all the restaurants , bars , and shops are right outside your door . friendly staff -- everyone was always happy and willing to help . the rooms were large , clean , and beautiful ! i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting montreal !	4594
0	- room was dingy , oddly laid out , with a tiny , dirty bathroom . - giant cart of dirty towels sat outside out room from check-in until 11pm or so , even after we asked for the removal of them . - front entrance and bar reek of some sort of cheap scent . anyone with allergies should avoid . - bartender did not know basic drinks , like an old-fashioned . - we had room service for dinner and breakfast - very slow , presentation was not on par with a `` luxury '' experience in any way . very very sub par experience . - extremely noisy from the street outside all night - until about 4am .	4594
0	waited over an hour to get served breakfast for a group of six . watched others arrive after us and served in 15 minutes . mentioned it to the waitress and continued to watch others come in and get served . got the message when my cottage and fruit arrived 5 minutes after the rest of our group had been served . we visit axis every year but wo n't be staying here next time .	4594
0	this place is terrible . typical terrible french canadian attitude one sees in the movies . valet us not attentive . the bar manager rude . the bed is tiny in an expensive suite . bad experience within 30 mins of checking in . avoid it if you do n't like attitude from staff .	4594
1	great people ; enjoyed the atmosphere . on vacation and truly enjoyed my experience !	4595
1	came here tonight with the boys . we started out on a pool table in the middle , but lindsey made sure that we were able to move to a better table asap . she was super sweet . prices were reasonable and service from lindsey was awesome .	4595
1	metro is a great place to kill the time . ok music and great people watching . cider on tap beer on tap good mixed drinks . the waitress staff and bartender staff are all nice folks and work hard for their money .	4595
1	i was in pool heaven ... . i could not believe how many good pool ayers were actually in one place and we 're nice to each other . great prices and we 'll kept pool tables	4595
1	i was n't expecting much ... c'mon it 's in metro center ! but i 'm 2 decades removed . the place is clean ! has decent food to offer , tvs are abundant . the bar is efficient and friendly . try to find my new friends sean or alex ( andria ) stress free , lots of billiards darts etc . just a happy place !	4595
1	it was a good time ... the had a jukebox amd the drinks were strong ans cheap ... lol the vibe was causal and care free and the food was good for `` bar food '' ... the bathrooms were clean and that 's a plus ! my only complaint if i forced myself to give one were the tables seemed close together ... i have n't played pool much so this could just be the set up ... none the less it was nice ... like a step or two above your local hole in the wall but still feels local and inviting .	4595
1	just a pretty cool sports bar near the metro center area . everyone here are pretty friendly and the waitresses always make sure you 're taken cared of . on saturdays at a certain time they 'll dance on the counters and everyone seems to have a good time . a pretty good place to grab a beer and catch up with friends .	4595
1	if you are a pool player , then this is the place to go . there is a good selection of diamond `` bar-sized '' tables as well as regulation 9 ' tables , and they are all very well maintained . keep an eye out for tournaments and league nights to make sure that the tables are available . i managed to find great competition each night even on the practice tables against the registered tournament players . the beers were large and well priced , and the burgers were excellent . i was in town for three days staying at the hotel across the street , and i had a different burger every night .	4595
1	came here to play pool on my birthday got my ass kicked in the game very enjoyable atmosphere the chicken wraps were phenomenal and the drinks were very good	4595
1	i thought this was a pretty cool bar that has lots of pool tables and even darts ! the drink prices are very reasonable too . $ 3.50 for a mug . the food here is so so , it 's typical fried , burgers , wings . nothing special , but edible , price is n't too bad . the vibe of this bar is good , different mixes of music and everyone is just having a good time .	4595
1	metro is the place to be if you like pool , darts , and sports . they have plenty of tvs to watch and always have some sort of sports on , no matter what time of day it is . they have a pool tournament almost every night , and it 's fun to watch people play good pool . the staff is friendly and the drink pieces are great . big mugs of cold beer ! the crowd that does there is always entertaining and plenty of funny people to chat with . would definitely go here again !	4595
1	i love this bar ! waitresses & bartenders are fantabulous ! victoria is the best , always smiling and very attentive . great food & cold drinks !	4595
1	best bar hamburger ever ! quick service , friendly staff , nice and dark , excellent drinks ! will definitely be back !	4595
1	absolutely phenomenal ! ! ! ! everything was great , from the food the service and the drinks . a lot of tvs which is a plus . the drinks price on thursday 's are outstanding ! ! ! ! hands down my new drinking spot on thirsty thursday !	4595
1	my favorite local joint , tuesday is the best day to come ! $ 2 draft tuesday monster mugs ! ! ! !	4595
1	never done me wrong , never noticed any drink specials and sometimes it takes awhile to get a drink but they have a million pool tables and a nice big patio	4595
0	took forever to be served and the place was dead . waitress tends to hang out at the bar versus wait on the tables . once we got the first beer waited forever again to place food order . so , if you are thirsty or hungry ... head to bww around the corner	4595
0	the bartender a young white male was rude to us talked to us once and did n't acknowledge us once after but took care of everyone else around us ... overall bad attitude	4595
0	went on a monday night and the place was slow . orded drinks through out the night and the service was slow or just straight up ignored me . bar tenders gave dirty looks to my group and made us feel unwelcomed . would not come back or recomend anyone to waste time at this bar .	4595
0	this place sucks the bartender slash manager pulled a glass of beer out of my cousins hand and pulled out mace and sprayed us for no reason that chick is nuts had to call police very unprofessional	4595
0	i 've been here at least a handful of times , and every single time , the service is horrible , the one waitress on duty has an attitude with her body language and a look on her face like she does n't want to be around , and it seems like a hassle to ask anyone here for anything . not to mention some random stranger impersonating as the doorman . super uncomfortable from the get go . if you do n't care about the quality of your beverages or the quality of service , stop by . if you care to spend your money at a place that gives a shit , then keep on driving .	4595
0	terrible service ( waited 30 minutes at 11pm on a thursday night ) just to see a waitress . beer was a great value . but bartender was upset when i told her that i needed to see a waitress ( after 30 minutes of waiting ) . even with the great beer price , i will not go back . also the cash only bar was a terrible surprise .	4595
0	thank you buffalo wild wings for opening up 200 yards away . i will never go back to metro now that there is another option . service is horrible . only have 1 good place to watch the tvs , any other spot in the bldg you ca n't see . greatest feature- walking distance to buff ww	4595
0	place was fine at first . but after going here for over 2 years on and off i think this place is just crap . i would n't waste my time . the service sucks , management is terrible . they dump your drink ( it was a full glass never touched ) close you out and refuse to give u another drink or a refund ( its was my first drink btw so this was n't a situation where intoxication affected the situation ) i tried it mutilple times and i 'm done . i suggest you do n't even waste your time . p.s . the wings are flavorless	4595
0	this place is dive bar with cheap beer and that 's it . the service is terrible , all bathrooms feels like you can buy drugs or get mugged in them . i could forget all that because there are places that make up all their negatives with their food but the worst part about this place is the food . all the burgers and fries ordered bland and burnt , appetizer ordered chicken quesadilla still had uncooked cheese . do n't go here there is hooters next store go there instead .	4595
0	love to come play pool or darts but why is the bathroom a mess every time i go . also why let someone play cornhole in front of all the dart games ? this place is large enough for everything . nice atmosphere for a sports bar . too bad it seems like the place is not cared for .	4595
0	the waitress could n't tell me which shock top they had on tap , and did n't know that a mudslide is n't always a frozen drink . and thanks place only takes cash . fuck this place .	4595
0	greeted the bartender with a friendly 'tres heurese ' ( french ) , anticipating possibly a degree of 'bonhomie . ' nope . do n't have 'boners ' on the menu today ' ( also do n't need no education at this bar ) large , expansive sports bar-type motif . service was substandard . unable to place food order , as there were no servers / bartenders available . noticed a peculiar stain , accumulated foreign matter on the bar surface . incredibly gross . enough to gag a maggot . saying 'au revoir ' to the metro .	4595
0	this place sucks . wow . games on the tv from days ago . no live games on a saturday . they could n't figure out the tv 's or sound . waitress was clueless as can be , asked if we wanted a tall or short whiskey on the rocks ... ... . service was non existent . did n't stay . place is a dump . if you want a sports bar , go elsewhere ! ! ! ! ! !	4595
0	metro sportz bar is really a pool hall that also acts as a fade-away sports bar . the layout is sprawling , as audra mentioned . unfortunately , this has a negative effect on the service , as i waited at the bar for five minutes with nary a glance from the bartender . and then ten minutes near the front tv wall . there 's several chain bars and two other sports bars close by , so it really does n't make sense to come here unless you 're shooting pool . the inside could be redone and made into something really nice , but i would n't hold my breath .	4595
0	bad place found bugs in my beer and they refused to acknowledge it , waste of money ! ! ! ! !	4595
0	put $ 20 in the jukebox was there from 9pm to close it did n't play any of my songs talk to the manager she said she could n't do anything about it , sevice sucked . definitely not going back .	4595
1	they gave me my smile back ! everyone is so friendly , especially christen who was gracious even when i was very grouchy , never see her without a warm 'hello ' and ready to help . claudia is an artist with crowns , never impatient , always seems to enjoy your appointment . dr. chi takes his time with you and is gentle . that 's an important trait in a dentist cuz i 've always been nervous . mariana always comes in and makes a point of saying hello .	4596
1	the staff was amazing and sooooo knowledgeable ... maria , maritza , mary and the whole staff made our trip easy and pain free ... .	4596
0	sure the staff seems fun and friendly but appointment started at 1pm ... 2 hours later and only an x-ray was done and waiting for 1:30 hour . we just left .	4596
0	horrible customer service they take no emergency walk ins made me wait 1 hour to tell me they cant see me to make an appointment my filling came off i was in pain and they did not care do not go here for emergencies or walk ins	4596
1	never late printing saved me ! i needed resume paper and retouch ... the staff was very friendly and professional . i was in and out within five minutes and on my way for my interview . i highly recommend never late printing .	4597
1	i mean ... how do you rate a print shop ? i needed resumes done so i went in with my external hardrive and ... viola . staff was really friendly ... if i needed a larger job done i 'd absolutely feel compelled to return but other than that , not much else to say . oh , they had some friendly pooches in the left office , if you want to pet pooches while you wait . is that a draw here in vegas ? pet a pooch ?	4597
1	ralph and team at never late printing saved the day for me ! they were completely professional , kind and made my very critical , last second print job stress-free and better than i ever asked for . the did an absolutely perfect job and potentially saved my biggest client account , as a result ! i am so grateful and will use them every time i 'm in vegas . i would wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking for professionals who are attentive , fair and who deliver an exceptional product .	4597
1	never late printing really impressed us . we gave them a pretty big order with a very small window to make it happen . rob and his team got us ready for our conference within 2 days . while there were some small errors in the final product , they were extremely responsive , attentive and flexible . despite the few errors , we will definitely do business with these guys again soon ! !	4597
1	rob , ralph and sani , all are a pleasure to work with and they make my clients happy ! if you 're in vegas use these guys and it will make your life a lot easier !	4597
1	i have been using them for quick business cards because they 're about the same price as vistaprint , except i can pick them up locally within a day or two of ordering . digital prints are n't as high-res as lithographic printing , of course , but i rarely have that kind of time or budget . for cheap cards fast , i love these guys .	4597
1	these guys are amazing . in town for trade show a day airline lost our luggage . we called them at 9pm on a sunday and they were abl the to get us vinyl banners , business cards and posters by the next day . they even found us a place to have last minute shirts and embroidered . the owner himself stayed late so we could pick up extra cards later in the week when we needed to pick them up after hours . thanks for the incredible service !	4597
0	no ... ... we never received a quote or even a call back for that matter even after we had left several messages . if they would have gotten back to us like they said then we would have paid the down payment or decided to go elsewhere like we eventually did and never would have written such a negative review . we can not speak for any one else but in our situation this company was extremely flaky . that 's why they get 1 star .	4597
0	i wish i could give 0 stars . terrible experience with this company . my first batch of labels cut off letters . 2nd run they put it on the wrong material . now i 'm stuck and they wo n't fix their wrong . very disappointed . anyone know of a reputable printing company let me know ! ! ! !	4597
0	a terrible company.. went to get business cards for my new small business..talked to travis the graphic designer about what i wanted and he seemed like he was happy to help but now a month later and after multiple calls i have heard no response..should change their name from never late to never received	4597
0	what a horrible experience ! i made a logo with the paint program but needed someone to help with the sizing and resolution or whatnot for business cards so i talked to the graphic designer whom i assumed did things like this before with a $ 35 an hour minimum charge but after waiting weeks and receiving no quote , call back , or a simple email telling me it could n't be done apparently my project was swept under the rug and forgotten .	4597
0	unprofessional establishment . printed the wrong information on my business cards then what i provided for them . i emailed back and forth with lorena the accountant there . she apologized and informed me corrections would be made and they would reprint them . i showed up to pick up my cards and they printed out the same ones that were incorrect . i will not pay for horrible services . a refund is in order . horrible place , horrible . i have a big event tonight so it should be fun showing up without my business cards ! enjoy your day yelpers . lead me to the four stars .	4597
0	the worst customer service . can get anything right , i do n't think they should be in business if they ca n't return a phone call back !	4597
0	they were cool the first time but i returned and there was a big guy that was very unhelpful and rude so i wont be back .	4597
1	this place is wonderful ! ! ! ! they have the cutest fabrics for such great prices . also got some great fabric for recovering some pieces for the living room and dining room . so pretty . just be willing to dig through and look . the people were also very nice . this is my fabric place from now on !	4598
1	the women working on tuesday were very nice and informative ! i went in with an idea of what i wanted to do but everything changed once i walked in the store . there were way more options than i anticipated . i 'm very green at craft projects so all of the help that i receive was great ! i will return for future projects . i can see how people can spend hours in this store	4598
1	i have used sas for all my costuming needs for a few years now . it is awesome ! it has been perfect for sewing school show costumes . you can buy bulk fabrics , trims , and embellishments for reasonable prices . the staff can be helpful , but they are often busy . this is the kind of place where you come to get inspiration or great materials . it is not the sort of place where the staff is there to educate you . the merchandise is always changing , so you never get bored ( no matter how many times you visit ) !	4598
1	best prices on fabrics ever . such a huge variety , and i feel like they get new stuff in all the time . i 'm not a fan of them being closed on sundays , but you ca n't have everything . i have been going to this location for a long time . i wish i had more time to shop but this place gets fairly busy . best time to browse is right at opening .	4598
1	this place has a huge selection of fabric with good pricing . the person behind the counter would not sell me the fabric i wanted because he said that the shop was required to keep at least a yard for themselves.i thought that was truly odd but what can i tell you .	4598
1	my absolute favorite place to get fabric ! ! tons of fabric for clearance prices . never leave empty handed . options may be limited compared to other fabric stores but the affordable prices make it worth it .	4598
1	love this place have been going my whole life . as a child my mom would take me there and the piles of fabric were amazing and wonderful , a dream come true . my mom and i still sew and go there often and find lace and fabric to alter dresses and make creations . i still love going and take my daughter now . best prices on fabric anywhere in town . digging through the piles of fabric is always amazing .	4598
0	big fabric selection but their customer service is non-existent and is horrible . i asked for help and one of the ladies just rolled her eyes while the older lady responded with a nasty attitude ' well , what could you possible need help with ? ' i am not familiar with fabrics and i needed help locating a certain type and all they said was 'well is over there ' pointing at a big table with hundreds of rolls . to the employees -- it does n't take more than a minute to help a client out find an item .	4598
0	bad customer service ladies had me go back of the line twice lol rude but the price here or ok not clean but ok ... more like a second hand store for fabric	4598
0	worst customer service ever ! the sales people here are terrible . i asked one where something is located in the store and she pointed to the general direction of the whole entire store ! then when i asked another one she completely disregarded the question . then they make a rude announcement that they are closing . i understand that you need to let people know that they were closing but they began to do so a half hour before and made it seem like no one was welcome there . i recommend going to another store but this one , even if you have to go to a different city . i can not wait to see this business fail due to the economy .	4598
0	the store has a lot of fabric . odds and ends . but what they call quilting material , is very thin . the store is a mess . most of the staff can be rude	4598
0	this place is a mess . fabric scraps and remnants thrown on tables and piled up to the ceiling and what a fire hazard . you ca n't find anything in this store because it 's all piled up on top of each other . if you are looking for scrap material , it 's great . but try to find anything on actual bolts or rolls , and you quickly give up . very disappointed .	4598
0	rude ! my friend and i went to pick our fabric to reupholster my dining chairs last saturday and we could not believe how rude one of the employees was . i wish i would have gotten her name but she 's an older woman and her mom works there as well . apparently we were standing at the wrong counter ( the place is an absolute mess ) and she refused to help us so her elderly mom had to cut our fabric for us . we will never return here .	4598
0	horrible customer service ! been shopping for about 45 mins when my toddler asked to use the bathroom . i asked the guy at the counter if we could use the bathroom and he says it 's not available for customers and to go elsewhere . i go on to explain i 'm potty training my child and she wo n't make it on the drive to another place . he proceeds to tell me `` that 's not my problem '' ! not sure i would come here again even if they have a good selection .	4598
1	got my nails done by blu and really loved . she does such a great job . if you feel something is n't right she will take the utmost care and make sure it 's right . my polish looked nothing less of stellar and my nails as well ! i really recommend her ! !	4599
1	had the best pedicure ever and mimosas . i recommend this place to anyone looking to be pampered . it was clean blue and bree were patient and had the best customer service experience ever ! ! ! great job ladies and thank you for making my mother 's day a great day !	4599
0	$ 35 for a gel manicure would be acceptable if it was immaculate ... mine unfortunately was n't . super overpriced , only one person knows designs , and poor manicure service : / i almost left after the first few minutes . i had bumps on almost every nail . to top it off , the nail tech was bashing on my previous gel manicure and promised my gels would last 3 weeks . no . no gels last that long . and guess what ? 2 days later , my gels started to peel due to his shaky hands . i wo n't be back . do n't waste your money or time .	4599
0	i had a good experience even though it look about two hours to complete a gel manicure . i was really happy with the initial job done but two days after my nails already started to peel off . i attempted to call to set up a touch up appointment but could not get in contact with them at all . definitely would not pay $ 50+ to get my nails done here again .	4599
1	cleanest laundromat i 've ever been in . they even provide fruit , bagels and ice tea . a variety of washers and dryers . all seemed to be in good condition . $ 1.75 a standard size wash load . $ .75 for 30 min in small dryer . open 7 days a week 7am to 9pm .	4600
1	someone said it was $ 1.25 a load but it is $ 1.75 . other than that the place was clean . the guy was nice . he opened the door for me and helped me unload and load my car . i saw him put someone 's laundry in the dryer when they were n't there . there was ice tea and candy laid out for the patrons . i would come again if necessary .	4600
0	save your money and go somewhere else . dryers do n't dry half the time . place looks like crap . chuck just keeps raising the prices and wonders why no one comes in . fix your machines ! ! !	4600
0	worst place i have ever been ! do n't go here ! dirty washers and dryers that do n't dry ! we spent $ 40.00 and still have wet , dirty clothes !	4600
1	if you 're looking for an amazing class that 'll keep your heart rate up and burn those calories fast you want to make sure you take nichet 's zumba class . she does sensazao zumba , which is a little more intense than regular zumba . absolutely love the class . it 'll kick your butt , in the best way possible .	4601
1	i love golds ! i see some reveiws below about `` old equipment '' , and yes it is older but its always working ! and the monthly rate is only 10-20 dollars a month , its so affordable ! they have any machine you could want or need , there is a womens room for people who want the privacy and there are men and women locker rooms with a sauna ! i 'd say i definitely get more than i pay : ) its a great deal ! and gerry trains my friend and she 's lost so much weight !	4601
1	i love gold 's at north scottsdale . they have a women 's fitness room so that women can lift without feeling uncomfortably scrutinized by aspiring body builders , a group exercise room , and a spin room . there are tons of ellipticals and treadmills as well as all of the staples of a gym : weights , kettle bells , medicine balls , etc . i mostly come here for the classes . i 'm obsessed with tracy , paul , and becky 's spin classes . paula 's body pump is also really good .	4601
1	time to sweat ! this place is hit or miss but i ca n't judge yet bcuz we still have the new years resolution crowd in attendance ! : )	4601
1	i 'm a pretty frequent gym goer and gold 's is an excellent gym . all the equipment i could need and an extremely friendly staff . very impressed with them so far . would recommend to anyone needing a gym in the neighborhood !	4601
1	the spin room plays movies ... its a unique gym with a good set up	4601
1	i am not there to shower . i can do that at home . i am there to workout and they have plenty of great equipment to use . from several squat racks and bench presses to heavy bags and chin up bars . you name it is there . there 's a separate workout room for the ladies if they want to be away from the guys . spin classes . the works . at a $ 5:00 sign up fee and $ 10.00/month everyone can get their butt to the gym !	4601
1	i 've been to this gym for a good week or two.and i 'm enjoying it so far . for the price , .its.pretty good . the place is clean , the staff so.far , are great , only complaint is i wish they had more machines with televisions .	4601
1	this golds location was my gym for about three years and it was good for the price we paid . we have since moved out of the area and had to discontinue our membership . what i am going to miss most is zumba with the amazing nichet ! she is awesome and golds needs to realize that her talent is probably worth way more than they pay her ! if you are looking for a gym for a low monthly rate , i would definitely recommend this golds gym .	4601
1	i have been a member 2 different times here and am pleased . it is up to the members to clean up after themselves ... face it.most of humanity is lazy which is gross , so jus wipe down equipment before and after use ... perfect pricing , especially when they have such awesone classes like yoga , zumba , spin etc etc !	4601
1	yep . a five star review . this place is exactly what i was looking for in a gym . it is inexpensive without being cheap . no contracts . great classes . very clean . the childcare is very good . if i could change anything it would be : -the dumbass airpark drivers who wont let you make a left-hand turn out of the place -more yoga classes -their yelp page that says `` not good for children . '' are you kidding ? the child care is the reason i found gold 's to begin with .	4601
1	this is where i get the permission slip to eat , i use a personal trainer here and in 30 minutes , `` i almost cant finish this '' i am toast ... ... just go in and ask for `` death by gerry '' that 's what i call it ( the effectionate term ) for getting blasted , a full body workout that will not overwork just one muscle , and you will be satisfied . ( and finished ) i am not a group fitness guy , but im not against it either . i just happen to get a great workout from having a 1-to-1 coach like gerry , he is a cool cat..	4601
1	i am going to keep this review brief so i do n't accidentally write some smart ass comment about steroids or orange skin and have some giant gorilla beat the sh & # out of me in the parking lot . the membership deal is a good value . it 's not too busy . they have decent equipment . they repair broken machines rather quickly . they have plenty of convenient parking . and a nice location near a whole foods and costco .	4601
1	one of the the greatest joys in my life is to sneak away from work at lunch and lift heavy things until i 'm ready to pass out . to wit , i need a gym close to the office . this gym is beautiful ! the equipment is well maintained , the locker rooms are clean and private showering is available . anyone that 's been to la fitness will understand what a joy it is to not have saggy old man-bits smacking you in the head . gold 's is open 24/7 , which is very nice considering my somewhat sporadic schedule . all things said , i 'm very pleased with my new gym !	4601
1	we live in va and visit scottsdale every winter . always look forward to maintaining our workout routine at golds . trent is very helpful and the rest of the staff are always friendly .	4601
1	just rolled from chicago , as usual classic golds never fails ! equipment is solid and super clean . more than enough dumbells that u never have to wait . the high ceilings and open air atmosphere i really like as there 's never a foul smell lingering as happens as quite a few other gyms i been too . hammer strength machines by far are the best in the industry . this gym is not the closest but def the one i 've been looking for .	4601
1	have been looking around the area for a gym now for almost two months . took advantage of visitor passes at nearby gyms . golds was by far the cleanest and best maintained gym i sampled in the area . when i decided to join i dealt with the general manager trent kay . i found him to be incredibly personal and paired me with a great personal trainer . two months into my membership now and i honestly cant complain , i 'm really enjoying this gym .	4601
1	i like this place . it 's super cheap . the place is huge . and most of the people that go here are serious workout people . not too old of a crowd either . this place motivates me to workout hard .	4601
0	do n't join ! if the deal sounds too good to be true , it is . they fail to disclose a lot of what 's in the contract . very shady . must cancel before your billing date , or they charge you for an extra month ( after you 've decided you 're done ) i.e . billing date nov 1 , cancel on nov 2 and they 'll bill you dec 1 for your membership to finally end jan 1 . there 's also a $ 25 cancellation fee if you cancel within 6 months of joining . read all fine print because there is a lot of it .	4601
0	if you 're interested in hidden fees and poor customer service , this is the place for you . otherwise , run away ! you can thank me later ...	4601
0	gym is awful ! ! the workers are so mean and judgmental . the meat head managers are disgusting and judge you and are always checking otu women and making them feel awful . i worked out here but waited until my gym membership was up and gladly walked away . i am not high maintenance and had an awful experience here . the workers have no interest in helping you . disgusting , scottsdale trash . better off spending an additional 20 and send your business elsewhere . it is a corporation , not a fitness center . they do not care about updating the eqipment , more concerned with being sufficient .	4601
0	instructors are terrific , admin staff not so much . not all that friendly ever and body pump equipment , the weights have sand oozing out of most pieces i.e . losing their `` weight '' . participants have asked for new weights for over 2 yr . is n't that the job of management . .to manage the equipment ? the body pump/yoga/zumba room desperately needs the floor cleaned . deep cleaned . this facility is now eos , let 's hope for a better run place .	4601
0	the gm here ( trent ) has zero customer service ! he 's needs to get off his high horse and learn how to treat members/guests . how he landed this job baffles me . he thinks his s*** does n't stink and is demeaning to women . i would go back the day this clown gets fired ! no customer service what so ever ! !	4601
0	i go to north scottsdale gold ' gym . the gym and the equipments are excellent . me and my husband are enrolled in 2 year contract . while signing the contract they said we have to pay 23 per person/month . they never mentioned that there is some semi annual fees in between.. and i have been charged 37.99 and 40 for my husband this month . beware of the hidden charges they have . soon i am going to cancel my membership .	4601
0	so obviously someone from gold 's read this . they have made some improvements in the last couple of weeks . employees have begun to pick up/arrange weights . all the urinals in men 's room now flush ! yay , does n't smell so much like an outhouse in there . keep improving golds ...	4601
0	do n't join ! if the deal sounds too good to be true , it is . they fail to tell you there is a $ 25 cancellation fee if you cancel within 6 months of joining . read all fine print because there is a lot of it .	4601
0	very disappointed in the way members are treated at this gym . their desire to get as much money out of you as possible while providing poor services is apparent and blatant . management has no customer service skills , they do n't even try to hide their lack of care . personal trainers for the most part are as useless as the rest of the staff . given the fact that they offer $ 9.95/mo membership the gym is overcrowded . found drug paraphernalia on the gym floor and in the locker room . stay away !	4601
0	over sold with the 9.99 a month membership , trainers are rude and need to workout more themselves ( a female trainer was enjoying her latte while working with a client ) equipment is crappy ( tears in the bench coverings ) definitely will be finding another gym ... .	4601
0	warning ! ! ! ! you will not be able to cancel canceling gold 's gym is like pulling teeth . they actually rejected my cancellation saying that i did not have sufficient reasons because my new address is 24 miles away from the gym `` as the crow flies '' ... we all know in az that nearly covers the whole valley . the process is asinine- you have to mail them a certified letter and await a response . this is a horrible way to do business and is evidence that they are bleeding membership . stay away if you do n't want to get into a contract more binding than a marriage !	4601
0	just to follow up : now that the weather is cold/cool outside , the air in the gym is stuffy , warm and humid . no air circulating and it smells ! the equipment is still rickety/broken/poorly maintained . do n't they read their reviews ? ? ?	4601
0	i think this gold 's gym is great for guys who want to lift & run on a treadmill , but it is personally not for me . after being a member of lifetime & going to the village and mountainside , gold 's just does n't compare . the facility is much bigger than it looks from the outside . they have lots of machines and weights as well as a women 's only room ( machines and weights ) , spin studio & group class studio . it 's really affordable compared to the above gyms but it is just missing an x factor for me .	4601
0	if you do roids and like to leave weights on machines instead of re-racking then this place is for you . the only people left at this gym are people too cheap to go to lifetime or hardcore steroid users . i thought my acct was canceled several months ago only to just get a past due bill . they are losing members and appear to be doing everything they can to make it difficult to end your membership . i recommend avoiding this place . there are much nicer gyms in the area .	4601
0	take a few classes there . 2 must do asap ... start and end classes on time . they often start late and the instructor assumes attendees can stay late . sorry the client is the paying customer and should not be expected to bend their schedule for instructor . also , instructors who have produced exercise videos , do facials , etc should not shill their second business to golds clients ... ..very tacky and unprofessional..	4601
0	i was a member of golds gyam simi valley , ca . for years , i moved to az a month ago and wanted to continue my membership with golds here . i was extreemly shocked as to how dated the facility looked . no flat screens , horrible ventillation , old equipment with crackeling material . i stayed on as i was told i would not have to put a down payment and they took 5.00 off my membership . when i find a job and resume a steady income out here i am moving on sad to say .	4601
0	dirty , old fitness equipment that always has one or more pieces a visit that is out of order . i am actually canceling my membership today . my wife really enjoys body pump classes . she would rate it a 4 .	4601
0	every other machine in this gym is broke . sometimes they stay in disrepair for over a month . the bathroom cleaner smells like turpentine . the self cleaner spray bottles are always missing . the staff turnover here is ridiculous .	4601
1	i am coming to this office for past two years and very happy with my dr and my treatments .	4602
1	i have been under the care of another pain specialist for many years but had insurance changes that forced me to find a new provider . dr. ryklin and his associate , claudia have completed diagnostic tests that i have never had with my old provider . it was found that i had a problem that could be treated and , hopefully , a relief of pain i 've been struggling with for years .	4602
1	i rarely write reviews . dr. ryklin deserves 6 stars but i am only allowed to give 5 stars ! he is professional and caring . last year i had horrible shoulder pain that he fixed . my pain is gone and i have full use and range of my arm again . i went back this year with neck and back problems . i 'm getting treatment now and can already see the difference . i 'm never left waiting for my appointments . i can definitely tell you this dr cares . he listens . he 's never too busy to give you 100 % of his undivided attention .	4602
1	dr. khan has been great ! he understood my pain in my lower back and has me on a path of treatment to help . dr. khan has a great bedside manner . the office is very busy but , there goal is to help . also , the office staff are nice as well . i go for my 1st set of injections in 3 weeks . upon receiving the injections they only helped a little but now they have me on another treatment plan . there nerve oblivion helps more than any of the other procedures . i left the practice because i felt like a number and not a patient . i feel that there not staffed enough for there patients .	4602
1	dr. asim khan- dr. khan delivered to my day a complete uplifting experience . absorbed in my pain and difficulty , he swiveled my head around with an optimistic outlook by making a positive program of treatment . my prospective has improved 180 degrees . he listens thoroughly and at the same time takes charge and makes plans . compared to many others , i have a lot of confidence in him .	4602
1	emily rush is back with the clinic again , and she is very attentive and thorough . will continue to see her in the broadway office , much better atmosphere than the vineyard office . the difference in staff attitude is like night and day .	4602
0	staff is courteous however i still feel like they care about the all mighty dollar than they do the patient . my notes and request for last procedure were simply forgotten . as were any messages left . i feel as if i am not a priority because i 'm not in as much pain as others and i 'm not a difficult patient . you will be told what you want to hear not what the truth is . super disappointed . if my visit tomorrow is n't successful i will find another pain dr. as far as i 'm concerned one star is too good .	4602
0	went for consultation with ryklin with same pain i had about 6 mos . ago after seeing dr. song at orthoarizona . naturally they had to check with medicare to see if shots were approved -- again . did n't hear for almost 3 months ! ! while sitting in waiting room wife noticed how badly place needed cleaning . what appeared to be white dog/cat hair all over the floor , part of mop caught on bottom of chair , dust everywhere . after reading other complaints , will probably seek help elsewhere after these shots wear off . how can a doctor 's office be so dirty ?	4602
0	had mri done in january ! never heard back from their office . called and left several messages and none have been returned . it 's already july ! ! ! everything was great in the beginning but since then nothing ! neck pain is back and even worse ! thoracic back pain constant ! limited to medications i can currently take so pain is out of control !	4602
0	emily rush left the practice , and she was the only reason i stayed with this provider . will have to look for another one now , because the new nurse practitioner at the vineyard office , rhonda casey , is flat-out racist . i plan to report her to the state board .	4602
0	if they recommended a back brace ... ... be careful . i picked up the recommended one . by the time i got home i realized i could not function with it on . i tried to return it on my next 2 visits and they refused to take it and could not tell me how much it would cost . i got my bill ... ... . $ 2190.00 before insurance ... my cost $ 876.20 . for a velcro back brace . ridiculous ! ! ! ! ! !	4602
0	awful . filthy place . small waiting room . over booked , have taken my mom here now for her last 3 epidurals and they have run 2 hours or more every time over the appt time . i 'll suggest she go to my pain specialist in the future . this is ridiculous .	4602
1	ambience 5/5 service 3.5/5 food & drinks 4/5 the patio is a great place to hangout for drinks after work . the couches are a great place to relax and chill . the service was kinda meh . had to go up to the counter to order drinks . we were n't given a food menu . only ordered the fries as a snack . good variety of drinks . will definitely come back next time to try their food .	4603
1	the walrus has such a great atmosphere . i came with colleagues after work for drinks . the drinks were a bit pricey , but not outrageous . we also grabbed some appetizers -- the deep fried cauliflower was amazing , so good i 'd go back just for that . overall , a very good experience for a bay street bar .	4603
0	last minute lunch date with a couple of work friends during the week . we did n't have a reservation so we sat at the bar ( which was perfectly fine ) . the bar staff were friendly and the service was very prompt . however ... . the food was passable at best . we tried the calamari starter ( one piece of calamari on some greens ) , chicken bites ( really small shriveled bits of chicken with a lot of garnish ) , fried chicken sandwich ( ok-ish ) and the burger ( also ok-ish ) . the fries on the side were good . i experienced no reason to return .	4603
0	nice atmosphere , good service- but the worse gin and tonic ever served . and it was not cheap . did not have anything to eat , but even when they tried to fix it the drink it still tasted like lime water . the bar we went too was supposed to specialize in tonics , but not sure there was any tonic there . the gin was also weak .	4603
1	my prescription was faxed over to a different walgreens branch . the pharmacy tech at this location gladly offered to fill my prescription , so i did n't need to drive farther . quick , efficient and friendly .	4604
1	just in the neck of my woods . i mainly go here for medicine , bathroom esstenials , false lashes red box that 's located outside and their candy isle ! every trip for me here is a must stop by the candy aisle for me and my daughter . other than their candy isle having the best prices in town , most of their items are a little pricier than other convenient stores but its hard to say no , since its so close to my house . yep , i 'm a regular .	4604
1	3/2016 stopped here the other night , was on a mission to see what was marked down from christmas ! there was still items left surprisingly and it was new years eve , i have been to this walgreen 's many times before . i did find some good stuff to buy ! the store was clean and the christmas area was still pretty neat even though it was getting picked over and a lot of empty areas on the shelves . the employees were friendly when asked for help . great location to stop by !	4604
1	this walgreens is always busy ! ! but even though there is always a line their workers are so friendly ! i do n't mind waiting ! they ask how my day is and sometimes engage even further . the pharmacy workers are nice too . very grateful for their workers . thank you for being amazing ! !	4604
1	i frequent this one its close to my house i get my pictures , vitamins , milk etc ... and outside when i need a movie there is a redbox kiosk	4604
1	i 'm here all of the time . i 've made this my neighborhood store . very friendly ! and helpful ! one cashier even helped me change the battery in my car key ! photo staff was very helpful when taking passport pictures for my kids . they always call for a back up register clerk when the line gets long . tina is adorable and always helps me in cosmetics . great store . always has what i need at a moment 's notice ! ( side note : all walgreen 's should stop selling cigarettes like cvs promoting good health )	4604
1	the pharmacy guys were great . you can use the drive thru or stop on in . i noticed they had a phone ahead service also which i guess all the walgreens have . not much more to say about a walgreen 's .	4604
1	everyone that works here is more than nice . people that work with the public need to go into the store and just observe how these employees treat customers . always smiling , complementary , and so helpful . the manager or employees will always approach you to make sure your finding things ok . the photo department knows what they 're doing , unlike some of their competitors .	4604
1	my go to whenever i need something asap ! great customer service : )	4604
1	they walgreens pharmacy team was patient , understanding , and helpful during my recent trip . currently i switched over to my husband 's insurance - and i was having issues with the information my husband 's insurance had of me , so i had to pay out of pocket for my prescription . michelle , and christine kept trying to get ahold of my insurance , and kept checking the status of my insurance . after all was said and done , christine was able to help me out . customer service top notch .	4604
1	my pills worked . they are cool in my book . one of the cleaner walgreens but other than that exactly what you 'd expect when you walk thru those sliding doors and the ac smacks you in the face . : )	4604
1	mr grouchy pants at the front counter is gone ! ! yay ! ! ! i no longer dread an expedition to this store . and i have not had anymore pricing problems either .	4604
1	the customer service and staff here are great , at least from my experience ! all the employees that check me out are always very kind , energetic , and bring good vibes . even the staff at the beauty department are very nice . one of the staff members even helped me pick out a perfect foundation shade , she mentioned she worked in the makeup department for years . i thought it was nice she went out of her way to do that . this walgreens does get pretty busy at times especially during rush hour , but that 's expected . however , the staff are always ready to pitch in and help with checkout . love this walgreens location !	4604
1	jackie in the pharmacy is the best ! i 've been playing phone tag with the pharmacy and my doctors office to get my refill and finally jackie offered to call my dr 's office herself , got a verbal approval to refill my prescription , and called me back to let me know it 'll be ready today . great customer service - thank you jackie ! !	4604
1	the staff is great ! ! the manager is fantastic . they have all the products in stock i am shopping for most of the time . the store is super clean and in a great area . i actually live closer to the walgreens on cactus , but they are just awful compared to the store on blue diamond . i just love the walgreens on blue diamond , keep up the great work ! ! !	4604
1	stopped at the pharmacy to pick up a few prescriptions . i use my walgreens app and was confused since one of my prescriptions was over $ 300 and rheina was amazing and solved all my problems getting my rx . i did n't ask her to go above and beyond for me especially when i 'm sitting in the drive thru but she did that all on her own . thank you ! it only sometimes takes 2 extra steps to make sure your customers get the best care and she made my night . my prescription ended up being only 12 bucks	4604
1	this place is really convenient for me . if i need a prescription filled this will be it . if just need to drop in for a pack of gum , this place is right at a busy intersection with convenient parking just off the road . the only thing i dislike about this store is the short hours that it is open .	4604
1	i always go to this place eversince i move here in vegas . and this young asian girl alea had been very loyal , happy , cheerful and most importantly helpful . she remembers my cigarette . everybodies cigarette . she always smiles and greets customers . she make sures she hooks you up with much more discount that the store can give . managers are very pleasant makes my experience very unforgetable .	4604
1	well lit , well stocked . came in here looking for a specific self tanner the sales associate or girl on the floor was very helpful . i showed her a photo of the tanner on my phone and she walked me right over to it . she also reminded me to grab rubber gloves . customer service is spot on here and the lines move fast	4604
1	great service through the prescription drive thru . pulled right up with no wait time at all . customer service was friendly . a+	4604
0	i wish i could give this walgreens pharmacy a negative star review . the customer service here is horrible . i was rushed and made to feel like a complete pain in the ass because they had to put my insurance card in . if you do n't like you 're job then leave , do n't work in a customer service industry if you are awful at interacting with the public . walgreens should reexamine who they have working in the pharmacy here . i have n't interacted with all employees but the asian woman in the pharmacy is the worst . i wo n't be returning to this location for anything because of this .	4604
0	this is my second time going in there and today it was made clear that i 'll never go back . bought a box of cookies and was excited because they were disney themed . to my shock , when looking on the side , it had an expiration date of 2/27/17 ! feb 2017 ! last i checked it was a june . yes , it 's a small box of .79 cent cookies , but still , this box is like 4 months past it expiration . god only knows what else is expired over there if they ca n't manage to inventory cookies !	4604
0	the drive in was slow let me wait 5 min while they waited on people inside before me slow ... .	4604
0	this is the rudest pharmacy i have been in my life ! i transferred most of my prescriptions to mail service . thank god . if insurance is not accepting my prescription , you have a duty to explain what is showing in your screen . after 3 years here , glad i transferred to mail pharmacy service if you are so unhappy working there , find another job !	4604
0	this is for the pharmacy . they have by far the worst customer service . i hate coming to this location , there rude , and have no customer service skills . you do n't want to be treated badly especially when your not feeling well .	4604
0	this walgreens has some great employees . janice , however , is one of the most dismissive pharmacists i 've ever met . i will be taking my business elsewhere .	4604
0	21 minutes on hold . when somebody finally answered , she said she ca n't hear me and hang up on me .	4604
0	way to overpriced . and employees are incompetent and made me feel uncomfortable closing the store while i 'm shopping and making me put my items back . why would you even let me in in the first place and not tell me you were closing when i walked in	4604
0	robby and mehgan you rock ! if it was n't for the absolute best service from robby and mehgan i would n't go back there again.the butch female with a guys hair cut and flesh tunnels in the photo department . you are a mean person .	4604
0	well , it 's the only store in mt edge . luckily for them . every time i have ever purchased anything on sale it rings up at full price . they rarely have what i need . and the same grouchy jerk has been the cashier for the whole time i 've lived in this neighborhood . i actually told him if he 's that unhappy he should find another job .	4604
0	came here the other night 15 minutes till close and the walgreens employee was standing outside the store smoking a cigarette and not letting anyone in . when i showed her it was 15 minutes until close she said my iphone was fast ... interesting because 2 people came up after me and all our phones were the same time . horrible representation of this popular store .	4604
0	this pharmacy is a joke . third day in row i keep coming back for simple prescription . they keep ordering wrong once . and even tried to sell me expired pills . hanna called saying the prescription is ready . after sitting here for 30 min they informed me it same mistake ordering wrong . now selling me one 3 times more expensive cause violet said it 's not competible . if you can avoid no joke avoid it .	4604
0	generally ok , but have had issues with pharmacy being out of stock on some of my regular prescriptions . has never happened with this frequency at other drugstores . it has me thinking of moving my rxs somewhere else .	4604
0	i would give minus five stars if i could . no joke this pharmacy is awful awful awful . i have a sick child , & honestly have never had any other problems anywhere else . my son is critical ... i need somewhere close to my house , so my options are limited . they have given me the wrong medication more than once . now last week something was supposed to be ordered for my son & what do you know they have no idea what happened or what i 'm talking about . once again on hold over 30 minutes . clearly it 's time i go elsewhere , you should as well .	4604
0	one lane pharmacy and waited 44 minutes before being told drive thru closed at 6pm ... so much for service or signs	4604
0	this pharmacy 's techs are so slow and have no customer service . rude and not friendly , it 's been this way for awhile ... guess walgreens does n't care .	4604
0	disappointed in the lack of customer service and phone etiquette the pharmacy has . when handling inquiries i recommend you have patience and choose your words before talking with your customers or prescribers . i understand you have a high volume of people to take care of but one prescription/person is n't more important than the other . by refusing to take the information over the phone or provide me the information that is needed . discussed this with terry who was assisting my staff . some additional training is needed .	4604
0	this pharmacy is a joke . third day in row i keep coming back for simple prescription . they keep ordering wrong once . and even tried to sell me expired pills . hanna called saying the prescription is ready . after sitting here for 30 min they informed me it same mistake ordering wrong . now selling me one 3 times more expensive cause violet said it 's not competible . if you can avoid no joke avoid it .	4604
0	this is the worse walgreens in town ! it is the only drug store that services the mountains edge area along with all the other homes in this area . it is always busy . and at the most there are only two cashiers manning the registers . so a store that is supposed to be a convenience is actually tremendously inconvenient . i always end up waiting in line for longer than it takes to find whatever i need . also this place is only opened til 10pm ! for a 24 hour town this seems a bit ridiculous .	4604
0	rudest pharmacy staff ! i love this store , but i 've tried and tried to give the pharmacy a chance , and they are so rude and dismissive . they also always try to switch out prescriptions for generics , even if the script had no ab equivalency . walgreens bonuses them on generics ! at least be polite to your customers .	4604
1	i love this little bakery . great dim sum , good steamed buns , and terrific homemade baozi .	4605
1	ivy has everything - buns , pastries , egg tarts ( nom nom ... ) and even zhong zi ( sticky rice things for duanwu festival ) . i 've ordered cakes as well ( matcha green tea with red bean , mango mousse ) and both were delicious . her egg tarts are the best , and ivy is the sweetest . i 'd say her pastries are very authentic ( more taiwanese style ) . delicious !	4605
1	coming from new york city to pittsburgh for college , i always need to find good chinese food around the neighborhood . my friend introduce me to this place and i have to say that the bakeries here are equally as tasty as bakeries in new york such as taipan or fei da .	4605
1	i got introduced to this place by an asian friend of mine , and i checked it out for the first time today . they are one of the only places in pittsburgh that sells asian buns ! i am originally from new york , and i loved the asian bakeries there . i am glad that i found something similar in puttsburgh !	4605
1	i love the owner that works there . cute little taiwanese lady , she is so kind and helpful . when i went there for the first time , she lets me try some samples and everything is oh so delicious and authentic . i went back once or twice when i craved for asian pastries . the price is very reasonable as well .	4605
0	the pastries were flat and did not have much filling inside . they have room for improvement . i tried several of the buns , with high hopes for the red bean , but it was disappointing .	4605
0	after a long day of devouring snacks i was in desperate need for a bubble tea . this was the first local store that we came across and decided to go in . the restaurant was messy and cluttered with god knows what . the woman working there seemed to be the only one there are , however she was incredibly nice ! when it came to the bubble tea i ca n't say that it was very good , or good at all . it was way too milky and artificially flavored for my taste . also one of my favorite things in bubble tea is the bubbles , which the tea was severely lacking .	4605
0	service shows a lack of professionalism . out of pork buns , she brought out a batch she was going to throw away- which she deemed were `` unsell-able '' quality yet decided to charge me . further , when i only offered to take one , gave me a fit that i should pay for all the bread she was going to throw out ... i can not say anything to the quality of the goods sold here , but i question the degree of service and professionalism at this establishment . however , i have heard positive comments from others about the actual `` sell-able '' bread ... just go at your own risk .	4605
0	i swear i 'm a nice person ... .i just have a low tolerance for stupidity ... i know its bad to review something that you have n't even tried but the lady was just so mean ... really hard to do business with someone that has such a huge attitude problem ... i would of purchased something in any case..but the sweets just looked outdated and stall ... the manager did n't like how i asked questions about her products ... which is pretty redugless ... .so i didnt buy anything ... the place is small ... and the area smell funny to me ... .	4605
0	the actual store is not what you would expect from the website . the store is very disorganized and they do not have many items available . i only had the baked char siu bun and it was okay -- the filling was very little .	4605
1	cathee has been doing my hair for 5 years now . i love her and the salon . i finally got up the nerve for a blow-out and love it . my hair is soft and takes no time at all to look awesome . i would n't let anyone else do my hair .	4606
1	i had a keratin treatment ( through a groupon ) done with with cathee and i love it ! the salon is was very nice and everyone working there as well as the clients seemed very happy . cathee was accommodating to a scheduling time snafu and she handled with great customer service and professional attitude . she is a great conversationalist and the time flew by when she was doing my hair ( which looks great ) , will definitely be back !	4606
1	i was a rolfs customer for such a long time . last week they could n't take me so i used my friend 's hair stylist cathee . everything happened for reason ! i got in and out with my dream color and price was very fair compare to rolf salons . like really good price . cathee is very quick , knows her business and very friendly . buy rolf !	4606
0	this lady is very unorganized . she never calls you back . after many texts , i finally was able to schedule an appointment . i decided to text her the night before to confirm my appointment for the next day since i had a weird feeling . still no response from her so the day of my appointment i sent her another text asking her to please confirm my appointment in the afternoon . she finally replies `` i do n't have an appointment for you . i am crazy busy . '' umm , yes crazy . do n't waste your time with this stylist .	4606
0	very dissappointed . i had brazilian done end of june with cathee , through a groupon . i 've had several brazilians done before , all which lasted 2 to 3 months . cathee said her treatment would last 4 months , so i was excited . but it did not even last more than a week after i had the brazilian done with cathee . i wonder if she even used any straightening keratin treatment . so i was extremely dissappointed .	4606
0	not as advertised . she needs to take off the word keratin and call in a blowout . she claims the treatment should last 12 weeks , mine lasted two weeks and yes , i used the correct shampoo and conditioner . she is a nice lady but this is not a true keratin treatment . a true keratin treatment takes up to 3 hours and i was there less than 45 mins . very disappointed .	4606
1	i recently used beehive ceilings and they did an absolutely wonderful job ! the job went on for several days . they were on time , cleaned up each day -- completely did what i was told they would do and in the timeframe promised . i would recommend them to anyone and would not hesitate to use them again should i ever purchase a house with popcorn ceilings again	4607
1	a friend recommended beehive , and we are so glad they did . what an amazing job they did removing all the popcorn ceilings in our house and refinishing everything and left no mess behind . these guys are amazing and know what they are doing ! ! ! ! ! ! they are as good as it gets ! ! ! ! thank you beehive ! ! ! ! !	4607
0	i used them and never again . too big of hurry to get to the next job . read there complete contract before you use them . they put the ceiling fans back up and there all out of balance . broke part of one and instead of fixing it they told me to get some super glue and crawl up there and fix it . i have bad arthritis that why i hire this stuff done . i 'm not wasting anymore of my time listing the stuff ... i have nothing positive to say about the owner or his company .	4607
0	driving down the road with my children and dog in the car and the driver for beehive ceilings in a white older four door silverado flies past us and cuts me off , literally within feet of hitting us on the front side . wow ! really says a lot about your company . hope you made it home safely because we barely did !	4607
1	i have to say i have n't had any issues in this wal-mart . just do n't like the feel of it . of course the prices are fair but it is wal-mart .	4608
1	hands down barry in optical saved my life while i was in ohio on vacation getting jerked around in the eastlake ohio location by staff ... ..the ophthalmologist was being awful with giving me sample contacts till i got home in vegas because my right lens tore ... .hands down ... .i 'm so so pleased ! ! ! ! ! ! the man saved me 2,300 miles away ! ! ! !	4608
1	i 've waited 3 months before writing this , so i can give an honest review . i love it ! ! ! i 've been to this walmart at different times of the day , and the best time especially for me is when the doors first open at 6:00am . this local neighborhood market is very clean and well stocked . if they do n't have it on the shelfs you can ask a store associate if they could check the back for the item . i really like the fact that it 's big and everything is reasonably priced as well ( cause your girl on a budget ) lol .	4608
1	i prefer to go early in the morning , less crowded . the lines are not ridiculously long like the regular wal-marts . i like the prices here they 're very cheap in my opinion . they have pretty much all i need . i wish they 'd expand their bakery some more though . it 's close to my house i will continue to shop here .	4608
1	the neighborhood markets are a blessing in disguise . nah myo renge kyo . its smaller the aisles are spaced out and well stocked . and the prices are cheaper compared to other grocery stores . i love the neighborhood market . especially when they sell the hot chickens late at night for 1.00 and they keep well in the freezer . they do tend to shy away from cashiers and have more self checkouts which can be a pain unless it spits out more money then what you put in . which has happened to me and is awesome . lol	4608
0	the store manager dave is by far the rudest manager that i have encountered at any wmnms . he isnt helpful and makes you feel like you are inconveniencing him when you ask him a question . because of the way that he talked down to me , i will never revisit this location and be sure to tell others not to either .	4608
0	store employees seem like they hate there job , after hours lines are nit lit to indicate where tabaco purchases can be made and they expect you to wait in a 30 min long line after already being in a 30 min line horrible service horrible people , that 's walmart	4608
0	no respect for the disabled . my father fell at their store and all they cared about was the cans he knocked down ... ... how nice of the employees to care about the cans instead of their customers . there lines are always extremely long , machines are always breaking down . the workers take for ever to do anything , and i could have sworn as a cashier , you are n't supposed to demand the customer `` remove items off the belt '' because you are too lazy to pick them up and move them over to the bagging area .	4608
0	as others have mentioned it takes forever to check out . long lines always . prices are not so great . i have found albertsons right across the street to be cheaper on every item i purchase .	4608
0	if your looking to get an upset stomach and salmonella than this walmart is the place to go . bought a rotisserie chicken today 11-19-17 . cut it open getting ready to eat it and noticed it was pink and bloody . any body with a common sense should know that pink and bloody means raw . i dont get it do you not check your chicken for the proper cooking temperature . i should call thw health department and file a lawsuit against yall	4608
1	i 'm so grateful to the guys that work here ! i called in for a price quote for replacing my rear tail and brake lights and the gentleman on the phone was very kind and helpful and told me that they would actually be able to replace my lights free of charge ! i could n't believe it because i had called another local auto repair shop and they quoted me $ 70 for the same service ! ! unbelievable . so i went in to sun auto and they finished replacing the lights in a matter of minutes . excellent service ! ! ! thank you ! ! : d	4609
1	i 'm writing an update since yelp filtered out my original review for some reason ... . ( # yelpfilterfail ) this is still the only place i 'll take my car in las vegas . fast , friendly service that i trust wo n't scam me on stuff i do n't need . it seems like the negative reviewers either do n't know much about cars or they drive a piece of $ hi # that is going to break down even if the rolls-royce dealer had worked on it .	4609
1	another family owned business with personable and helpful staff . best price i found for oil change . walked out with free tire rotation and oil change 24.00 . by my work and a location by my daughter in henderson . very quick and convenient .	4609
1	i had an issue with my car involving some minor stuff . carmax referred me to sun auto since they also cover the insurance i have on my car . it was the best decision i ever made . johnathan was a great help with everything . they had my baby back to me the following day all fixed up .	4609
1	having car trouble is never fun , but sun auto helped me by being friendly , accurate , and professional ! ! it 's nice that it 's right down the street too ! they were very thorough with diagnosing the car issues , and even gave me a lift to work ! ! thank you sun auto ! i also had my oil changed for $ 40 less than jiffy lube right across the way . hat tip to all of your team	4609
1	i love this place . these are the most honest guys in the business . they genuinely care about your experience and the quality of their service . i have felt like i was in genuinely good hands at an auto service before . now i can say with confidence that i am . i would recommend this place to any of my friends or family .	4609
1	i have been going to this location for over a year . they are always honest with me and very competent . they do not try to sell you on unnecessary maintenance or repairs like dealerships do . all the employees are knowledgeable and polite . i deal with jeremy the most and he is wonderful ! i definitely recommend this shop ! !	4609
1	devin was awesome ! ! ! he took care of me . the staff here are friendly and truly treated me like family . i always come here for my car 's needs ! ! ! ! ! highly recommend sun auto !	4609
1	i 've been dealing with this repair shop for over 5 years . in all that time i 've never been disappointed . you can trust them to work with you and not oversell an unnecessary repair . ask for alex . he 's the manager and has been there forever .	4609
1	i have been going to sun auto for over a year now , and have had both minor and major repairs done on my old car . i find them to be honest , fair , and reasonable in what is needed , what is recommended , and what should be considered in the future for preventative . they do n't push a lot of work that is not necessary , and communicate well . in my experience , this is rare in this industry . they even offered me a ride - i will be their customer always , and highly recommend them .	4609
1	very happy with their service ... have had both my vehicles ( jeep and van ) serviced there over the past few years . they seem to be very competent and honest .	4609
1	took my car in last minute to have the tire pressure checked . the guys there were all super accommodating and professional . quick and efficient , they took care of the issue right away and got me back on the road in less than 10 minutes ! honest and friendly service , i highly recommend sun auto service !	4609
1	awesome customer service devon is very helpful and kind , lots of good reviews from other customers , i just moved here from cali so i wias looking for a honest place , ,think i found it ! !	4609
1	these guys were great ! how wonderful it is to find an auto repair shop i can trust . as a woman i ca n't count how many mechanics have tried to bull-s # # $ me . not these guys . they were prompt , professional & really nice ! answered a couple questions honestly & did n't try to sell me stuff i did n't need . i highly recommend this place . in fact , i wo n't take my car anywhere else !	4609
1	very friendly staff and i appreciate the fact they did n't try and rip me off . i did n't like what i heard about my car but glad they were honest with me about it and did n't just want my money . i will be going here from now on with all my vehicles	4609
1	i have been coming here for years , and this place is the best ! great service , super nice , affordable pricing and extremely honest . love the guys that work here , most have been here for years and stand by their work	4609
0	i went in for an oil change which i was told would take 45 minutes , ended up taking an hour and a half , they tried convincing me to basically rebuild my car from the ground up and then once i got my car back realized the alignment was suddenly dramatically off . im guessing to try to get me back into the shop . they are scam artists . no .	4609
0	brought my vehicle in for ac service ( leak ) in march . i was told the schrader valves , both high and low were leaking . i was told the `` o '' rings had to be replaced . service included flush and recharge as well as red dye added to freon . by june the system was again not properly cooling . brought the car to another well known shop in henderson . what they found . incorrect `` o '' rings were installed and the high side schrader valve was damaged . the technician used the uv light to show me where the freon was actually bubbling out . i do not recommend this shop for ac repairs and analysis .	4609
0	if only i could give somewhere 0 stars ! dishonest thieves ! they have charged me over $ 2,000 to `` fix '' repairs on my car , just for them to come back days later . each time they find a `` new '' problem to tack on a few hundred dollars . i hope this place gets shut down before they rip off more people . what sleezy scam artists . women especially beware ! these smooth talking mechanics will have you believing your whole car is broken . sickening .	4609
0	came in for an oil change , and left with them telling me i needed $ 2,000 in repairs . thankfully i had the presence of mind to ask for a print out and had him itemize the price on each different repair . got a second opinion , and found out that not only were they going to overcharge me , but the `` total overhaul '' on the power steering was total bull . i paid less than $ 750 for the repairs i actually needed and my car is running great . i wo n't give these guys any more money !	4609
0	these guys did n't keep two of my set appointments and they forgot to attach something with my brakes not once but twice .	4609
0	lied right to my face twice . do not take your car here for anything . a basic fluid change and they did not even check the fluids . i know because when i checked the fluids were not full . awful and unlawful	4609
0	had my car towed here because it would n't start . after they looked over the car , i was told i needed a new fuel pump for the car at a price of 2500 . not willing to pay that much . i had it taken to another shop and cost me $ 18.00 for spark plugs . be aware of these guys because they will take full advantage of you .	4609
0	terrible experience ! these guys do n't give a shit and will gouge the hell out of you if you let them ! ! ! go somewhere else ! ! ! !	4609
0	unprofessional rude service , customers service even worst they do n't care about customers . stay away from this place people , this is my advice . btw they rip you off	4609
0	be careful high prices and sometimes repaires done to the result rather than the cause ... was charged for wheel bearing 700 $ without repairing the shocks which was the cause	4609
0	quoted an outrageous price for brakes and rotors . went elsewhere for the same service for half the price . do n't appreciate people trying to take advantage of us .	4609
0	this auto shop will try to take advantage of your lack of knowledge around specific parts of your car . they tried to charge me $ 800 for a part that lists at $ 89 through other retailers . the guys seem nice from the front desk , however they are totally in it to scam you .	4609
0	went to sun auto for a check engine light and was called and told i needed to replace two sensors . w as quoted 499.00 dollars with the `` engine diagnosis '' thought that that was a bit on the high side and checked auto m.d . was given a list of shops and the high was 200.00 and low was158.00 . do yourself a favor and do n't just take it for granted that this is the best shop , look aroud and you will find places that do great work and do n't try and rip you off ! ! by the way it cost me 75.00 including parts to have my car fixed and needed just one sensor not two	4609
0	i brought my old ford taurus to change or fix the steering pump and left the car with sun overnight . i was very specific saying , i need to fix the pump before i sell the car . they said , we understand . next day i came , they gave me an estimate $ 1959 ! this is for a $ 1000 car ! in the estimate , they offered to change each and every steering part . as a result , i had to drive the car without the pump back home and you know how hard it is .	4609
0	had an oil change and tire rotation ... one of the tires was put on with two lugs missing . i noticed it when returning to my work parking lot . they had to replace some parts and i was given three coupons for a free oil change by the manager . i went in with the first coupon and that manager was fired and the new one would n't honor it .	4609
0	they dont really deserve 1star . make sure your problem is actually corrected before you pay them ... ask a thorouh explanation for what is going to be done and ask old for parts back . i am a 66 yr old woman i paid $ 1100.00 to repair my vehicle and when i left after paying i still had the same problem plus a dead battery !	4609
1	this is the best dentist i 've been to in las vegas . very honest and professional staff . dr. chuy is very gentle when giving shots . i could not even feel it . easy location to get to right off of the 215 and rainbow . nice and clean office , and i did n't wait long in the waiting room to be treated.. you wo n't be disappointed here . i am a cash patient , and the prices are reasonable .	4610
1	the office is professional and they make you comfortable . everyone is extremely empathetic and patient . they think of their patients needs and consider your finances . i 've finally found a dental office .	4610
1	i came upon arroyo dental through an ad and took the opportunity to avail of their free exam , x-rays and consultation . i was not disappointed at all . the dentist , dr. nguyen , is a very amiable person who thoroughly explained to me my situation . the staff very caring . from my experience , i certainly would recommend this dental office .	4610
0	not a fan at all , dentist assistance focusing more on watching tv then take care of the patient . dr. does n't have time or the patience to explain the procedure , or spend to much length of time on difficult procedure . looks deceiving , meaning try to be nice , treat you once and then telling you that they ca n't see you anymore ! they charging on items that should be part of the procedure to make buck on you , and they are really disrespect in a way they speak about politics and other sensitive subject in the office , my tip , found different doctor !	4610
0	it was too bad that ownership has been changed . this place was used be affordable place for cash paid patient but not anymore ... .	4610
0	warning ! ! ! do not go to this dental office . the staff and the dentist do no communicate well with each other and the price is ridiculously outrageous , the front desk staff do no know what they are doing .	4610
1	i 've lived in this community for the last 5 months , it 's been the best experience that i 've had leasing apartments . the leasing specialists are the best around ! everyone is so friendly and welcoming . i 've lived in birkdale , and camden , and both do n't compare . go see the girls in the office they 'll treat you with respect and answer any questions you may have . thank you megan , morgan , mary elise , and nancy ! !	4611
1	thank you brittany for showing me the property last week ; you left a lasting impression ! the property exhibit kitchen is phenomenal and it seems like there is a strong connection to the community and your resident events . great amenities and you represent the property so well !	4611
0	parking is a major problem . staff does n't care because they met minimum requirements for a permit . residents have trouble parking to get home and guests will get towed if they do n't park in one of the maybe dozen visitor spots segregated in a back corner of the complex . the gym finally opened and the staff is already threatening to restrict access . i doubt the 2ft pool will open this season .	4611
0	this place looks gorgeous on paper but the property is poorly run ! they make their own rules daily . as of 4/12/2018 , they sent a message out to their residents that they no longer offer guest parking . they have made it clear that there is no parking permitted on the road outside the community and on neighboring properties . so where are guests going to park ? ? do not live here !	4611
1	i brought in a small box of 8mm films plus a roll of 16mm to have transferred to digital files i could edit . my grandmother gave me these films back in 1999 and they date between 1961 and 1980 . the costs for transferring films was so expensive fifteen years ago that i did n't even bother to try . but today is a different story . i am more than pleased with the speed , quality , and professionalism got memories provided . they even put all 25 films in the right order based on the little stickies i had on each can . i would do more business with them but i am all out of films ! thanks !	4612
1	stellar service and quality . care about what they are doing for you . available by phone if you have a question . anyone posting less than a 5-star review of them needs to consult the psychotherapists section of yelp .	4612
0	beware ! ! ! ... phillip , the owner/ceo , put the video i brought them to transfer on youtube and other sites ! ! ! he had no permission from me and simply used my personal property for his own purposes . clearly this is a business you can not trust with your memories ! ! ! !	4612
0	very misleading ads and prices given by this outfit . initial prices indicate a reasonable price for film to dvd transfers , but quote comes back with many additional charges that jack up the price considerably . extremely glib telephone rep could sell ice to eskimos . beware and expect to pay double the per foot quote .	4612
1	give this man a raise or make him a manager ! ! ! brad matsuoka ! ! ! he took care of me real quick and professionally ! ! ! i left t-mobile on cimarron and sahara and blond haired guy gave me the worst service ever thx to brad he mad my day and purchase better make sure you see him ! ! !	4613
1	i went in to t mobile today at boca park . amber help me to transfer the data in my old phone to my new phone . she was so excellent in all the help i received . i will go back again and hope to talk to amber if i have any more problems with my phone . she was very knowledgeable and kind and taught me things about my phone that i needed to know . she made updating my phone a pleasure . if you have problems with your phone go see amber , she will take good care of you .	4613
1	so i 've been to many stores looking for a sim card for my old iphone 5s . went to best buy a few other stores and nobody had it . i should have known to just come straight to the actual t-mobile store . obviously they would have it if anyone would . the staff was very helpful friendly enterprise is average where you would find it at any other store that carried it . i 'm just happy to finally have gotten the sim card i needed for my old iphone and now i can play around with it and use it for music tv shows movies etc .	4613
1	i was helped by bob , very friendly and extremely knowledgeable . made my visit quick and simple . ask for bob ! ! ! thanks bob ! ! : )	4613
1	outstanding service ! my salesperson , lance was attentive , knowledgeable , polite and spot on with information . what more can i say ... great company .	4613
1	expect excellent service ? request crystal at boca park if you want excellent service from a person with a professional attitude and total product knowledge , seek assistance from crystal . she is as pleasant as accommodating as any cellular sales person i have dealt with . and kudos to chad . he helped me with the transfer of data from one phone to the upgrade . i 'm a verizon refugee after 11 years . i hope i will not be disappointed by switching to t-mobile .	4613
1	these guys were great for my wife and i . bob and arthur were really helpful with everything that we were trying to do . if you go here ask for one of those guys .	4613
1	great customer service and t mobile finally got the iphone ! i felt soo good throwing away ( recycling ) my outdated android !	4613
1	outstanding customer service each and every time i visit the store . everyone is so knowledgeable and friendly . i highly recommend the store .	4613
1	what a great store ! been there several times . these guys know what they are doing ! i was a verizon person for 12 years . t-mobile has a better signal in vegas ... and the price is so much better . thanks for being so great guys !	4613
1	i went into the store & someone greeted me right away . cindy helped me open the account & helped me set up my new phone . she was so nice , she stayed after 8:00pm after the closing time . i really appreciate her professional help . : )	4613
0	terrible customer service . i have been in there 2 times and the people always . always have such an attitude . the one on sahara is much nicer	4613
0	not very good service . was greeted when i came in but the young man helping did n't know what he was talking about . did n't sell us on anything and ended up driving 20 minutes to another store instead .	4613
0	would give zero stars if allowed . worst employees ever ! they will do everything in there power to not help you . dread anytime i have to step inside this store . they should fire everyone associated with this place and start over .	4613
0	i am new to tmobile . i went to the store to get some questions answered about a plan i saw online . i started talking with a young man who was helpful and polite . cindy then came over and took over the conversation - she is a bully and very rude . it was amazing ! i finally left . do n't bother with this place unless you can get someone other than cindy . she really should not be in customer service - she should have to stay in the back , in the warehouse area . my interaction with her made me rethink my tmobile account - i will be getting rid of it at the end of this month .	4613
0	sleazy sleazy crooked sales reps here . avoid this place if you are looking to get any assistance with your account . `` i 'll remove the insurance on your account after you upgrade the line . '' this seriously came out of the mouth of a sales rep here . you 're telling me that you ca n't remove the insurance because i 'm telling you to ? i have to upgrade to get you to do something for me ? hahahahhahahah these crooked sales reps have serious balls to say this to people . do n't be suckered and either call customer service or just do everything online . i 've noticed t-mobile stores have the worst sales people of all the carriers .	4613
0	worst customer service ever ! i came to the store with no network in my phone , 3 guys tried to figure it out and nobody of them did n't know what to do , after they spent my time they told me to go home save all my pics and other stuff i have and reset my phone .. they said try to do it yourself at home and hopefully it 's going to work , i left the store while they making fun of me .. unbelievable stuff.. what a shame for t-mobile	4613
0	horrible customer service ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! every time i go and i mean every time i go when i walk in i 'm not greeted the reps are talking to the customers about everything else except for business which every now and then is ok , but if you 're talking for like 10-15 minutes after your transaction is complete and you see there 's a line you should rush it . it 's a t-mobile business people ! ! !	4613
0	terrible customer service every time i have gone into this store . i switched from sprint several months ago and have had only problems .	4613
0	worst manager elena ever ! would never go back to this store . messed up our phone - zero help- and she was proud to say that she 's the manager . t-mobile needs to really know this girl .	4613
0	it 's understandable to be busy , i do n't expect the associates to stop what they 're doing to help me out but at least acknowledge your customers with a simple greeting . let me help y'all out , `` welcome , we 'll be with you shortly . `` .	4613
0	hope i 'm reviewing the right place . had the worst customer experience ! to top it all off , i think andrew , who was helping me was the suppose 'manager ' at this location . awful , i got a phone here and it 's not charging . apparently it 's the battery which i was told is not under warranty but the phone is ? crazy . he basically told me it 's my problem to take care of	4613
1	conveniently located next to the convention and conference center in the heart of downtown . great furnishing and modern up-to-date amenities one would expect at a westin property . big full head rainfall shower and comfy pillow and mattresses to relax after a long day	4614
1	such amazing service , found our room to be damp from a running shower . upgraded our room in a timely fashion	4614
1	we are packing now , were here for an academic conference on new guidelines being implemented throughout the states . the beds at the westin are very comfy , as are the pillows . i thought it was a nice stay . ***wifi is $ 15.95 a day**** this is highly annoying . this is not per room it is per computer . my husband paid the fee and the network only connected his computer . when he is away at the conference , i have no access to wifi . the television seems to also go black several times during programs .	4614
1	the westin convention center is located downtown of pittsburgh . i reserved a city sky view room on the 18th floor with twin beds . i got a perfect beautiful view of the city from my windows . the room was clean with a large lcd tv , but the sink is inside the bathroom . if someone inside the bathroom , i ca n't brush or wash my face . i hardly got any sleep at night from the loud clinking plumbing sound from the next door usage of the bathroom . addional indoor parking cost $ 19	4614
1	still a great hotel but be warned : if you do not want maid service knocking on the door at 8 am to see when you are checking out , put the do not disturb sign on the door . only made that mistake once ...	4614
1	pretty good hotel . right there in the center . parking is expensive 20 $	4614
1	stay here a few times a year and love it . never had a problem . their customer service goes above and beyond . i get an email before my stay ( from a real person who i can respond to ) if there 's info that i need to know . for example , just got one today for a stay this weekend to inform me that a bunch of streets will be closed on sunday due to the pittsburgh marathon , along with specifics about how to get to/from the hotel during this time . ca n't beat that !	4614
1	the hotel is kept clean and the room rates were very good . the service from the staff was excellent . interestingly enough the restaurant in the hotel has the best sushi in pittsburgh .	4614
1	nice hotel . check-in was extremely smooth and quick . hotel is very clean . room is nice . shower drain kind of sucks but i can deal with that .	4614
1	we stayed at the westin convention center at the end of june 2013 . the front desk staff was very friendly . he helped us out with toiletries ( since my bags were lost ) and great locations to eat . he upgraded our room to one near the top floor with an amazing view of pnc park and heinz field . since we were staying there for a brewers-pirates game , this was a huge bonus ! the hotel had a free shuttle that took us to the baseball game . do n't bother with the pool - it is tiny and you have to sign in and out to use it ... very odd .	4614
1	the westin is in a nice location downtown . easy walking distance to both stadiums . walking distance to some restaurants and bars as well . the rooms were adequate but nothing special . they were clean they could use additional electrical outlets as there were hard to come by . the bathroom was ok but could use a refresher . the restaurant was quite over priced . we paid $ 25 for a vodka and a gin drink . across the street we paid $ 11.50	4614
1	the employees here are nice , hotel room is clean - i like when the towels smell fresh/bleached . shower stayed hot .	4614
1	this is a fantastic hotel . i went to a convention here at the end of june and loved the setting . the convention center is well setup and the link between the hotel and the convention center works really well , especially if it 's raining . my only complaint is that the elevators are slow during busy times .	4614
1	stay on 6/12/15 friendly front desk staff . when we arrived to our room the bathroom was dirty and there was hair all over the place ( shower & floor ) . we went downstairs and asked for a new room . the front desk staff was apologetic about the situation and gave us a new room . nice room with a great view of the city and pnc park . nice gym and okay pool . we really enjoyed the location . walking distance to so many things ! would stay again	4614
1	great room , great view , definatley top notch hotel , although some odd stuff with key cards in the light switches and other strange stuff that seems like a finger juggle for having the guests get more involved with their counting .	4614
1	modern , convenient and comfortable . my one quibble was that the room i checked into had every light in it burning upon my arrival . the thermostat was set at 60f - freezing ! the duvet was so heavy that you could n't use it as a blanket . this is supposed to be an energy efficient hotel ? my check in clerk did n't even bother to explain the food credit for waiving room service . i overheard it . otherwise a pleasant ( if pricey ) stay .	4614
1	i wish we had gotten there earlier as we had a very late check in and wife and i were only staying one night . the hotel is beautiful and the room was big and fantastic . we were on the 19th floor and had an amazing view of pittsburgh . the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful . i would definitely stay at the westin again if in the area	4614
1	great location , close to the convention center and many fine restaurants in the strip district . love the heavenly beds and the shower with multiple heads . spacious , clean & attractive rooms . loses a star because the free internet is slow as hell , clearly to entice you to pay for faster speeds . ugh . if i 'm on a business trip , i want to be able to work in my room , and having to pay extra for the privilege of working efficiently is not cool .	4614
1	great hotel . close by to convention center and easy to walk to dinner or lunch . check the elevator doors ( inside ) for current promotions to see how you can increase the points you earn . convenience store inside the hotel closes around 11pm and starbucks closes at 5:30 pm .	4614
1	stayed overnight and was pleasantly surprised . very clean and staff was friendly . rooms were large and the bed was extremely comfortable . only knock is the underground self parking lot is very poorly marked and difficult to spot until you have committed to pulling into the valet parking . i drove in circles until i gave up and pulled into valet , and then i saw it . also , the rate in this lot is the same regardless if you are staying at the hotel . $ 22 for 12-24 hours . other than that , nice place . i would stay there again .	4614
1	elizabeth at the counter was extremely helpful , professional , & attentive . my fiance took me me out for a night on the town , she directed me to the bathroom , in which time she asked my fiancé why we were there . he told her we were in the city to treat me to a night before he had to go out of town . she really took to heart why we were here , and gave him a room high up with a beautiful view to make our night complete . she had great salesmanship and service all the way around . fed a shout out to the door guy , mark , very cool and helpful guy !	4614
1	4.5 stars ( but you ca n't do that so five ) . every employee we talked to was super helpful and pleasant . took the staff elevator due to heavy conference intake . staff service just exceeded all expectations and everything was enjoyable . no issues and great location .	4614
0	really not up to the westin standards ( although i 'm finding more and more of them are sub par ) . the rooms are shabby ( hey starwood - putting in . a rain shower head is not an upgrade ) only two outlets , visible dust on the towel racks , shower was either scalding hot or freezing cold , front desk people were dismissive . if you have other options , i would investigate them and go here as a last resort . i did not see any vermin during my stay .	4614
0	i was sooooo disappointed with this hotel . i 'm not sure what they use to wash their sheets and towels but the sheets were so dry and harsh i could barely sleep . we asked the front desk about it . they offered to replace our sheets with `` brand new ones '' you ca n't even tell the difference . the ac barely works . our room was stuffy and hit the entire time . bottom line : it was way too uncomfortable for costing as much as it did . i 'll never stay here again .	4614
0	had our parking validated after today 's pirates game . we had a senior citizen with us who was resting for a few minutes due to exhaustion from the heat . fifteen minutes to get the car out is not enough time for everyone , and the person at the speaker was no help . enjoy the eight bucks ; it will be the last money you 'll ever see from me .	4614
0	this westin is conveniently located near the convention center , but the low relative rank amount of stars is deserved . i am in a hotel once or twice a month . this westin is bottom tenth . the coffee maker is disgusting and smells . the beds are constantly short-sheeted , mostly with poor effort . the phones and clocks are gross . i gave the management a heads up , and it was not fixed . bottom line ... they do n't care , so do n't frustrate yourself and risk the dirt . on the bright side , a woman on the elevator was insistent something bit her last night , and i seem to have dodged that bullet .	4614
0	bartender questioned if i stole beers from the bar . had not returned since to ask for a food or drink order . presumably , i am being treated as a thief , however i have paid and heavily tipped for my service . will not be returning . i am currently a platinum status starwood preferred guest . will share my poor experience with my coworkers .	4614
0	beautiful rooms , excellent meeting spaces . the beds are like clouds and the double shower head in the bathroom was amazing . however , the customer service lacks excellence and the wifi is completely unreliable .	4614
0	facilities are very nice , beds are a little small for a couple . at six am on 3/21/14 the neighboring room 's alarm ( 1106 ) went off and cut right through the wall waking everyone up . i called the front desk at six thirty asking them to send someone to stop it , she said they would have to `` involve security '' . 8am now and it is still going full blast uninterrupted . great start to a vacation courtesy of weston .	4614
0	unbelievable ! ! ! ! ! ! on 11th floor , people have waited over an hour for elevator . this hotel is not equipped to handle crowds	4614
0	tried for two hours to make reservations at this hotel . use the option specifically for making reservations . on hold several times for long extended periods of time . finally called the operator at the front desk . was told could book online or wait until monday as apparently reservations can not be made with the person on the weekend .	4614
0	i requested an early check in two months ago when i booked my room , yesterday i called and they confirmed . when i checked in this morning no room and currently still waiting . i explained that i 'm very sick , i 'm currently feeling the effects of a terminal disease and that was why i requested the early booking . but yet , here i wait in the lobby trying not to barf . i doubt i 'll ever stay here again , nor would i recommend staying here .	4614
0	this hotel does not live up to the westin standards i 'm used too . i stay here for business purposes only but would never recommend this place to anyone to stay ever ! the hallways smell as do the rooms and they are not clean at all . below are a few photos from my most recent stay .	4614
0	marginal at best for the money . the whole place really does not seem up to the standard of other westin properties i have stayed at .	4614
0	when i think of westins , i think of business-classy , nice and modern . this hotel has a classic feel to it , but definitely not very updated . unfortunately , it reminds me of the staid-ness of pittsburgh too much . the check-in desk was super slow during my stay there . i do like the fact that there 's a fish market downstairs . i do n't like the fact that it 's the convention center hotel , so it can get pretty crowded . that said , it 's within walking distance to the strip , and downtown , so you ca n't deny the convenience . still , i think there are newer hotels that provide the same .	4614
0	the westin was not up to the westin quality . the room was dirty . the toilet had pooh in the bowl . the bathtub had hair and grime on the side . the shower had lots of hair . it was just disgusting . i definitely do not recommend .	4614
0	the service was terrible . they know how to charge for a room , but service is better at motel 6 .	4614
0	this is my 2nd stay here and since i had to unload my car at the valet and bring my own 5 suitcases to my room on a valet car i am already disappointed in the service . i actually had to get on the elevator with my own luggage with other people with this big cart . disappointed that the fairmont had no vacancies . ditch this hotel .	4614
0	had to have my sheets changed when i got to my room . stains on some towels . worst elevator system i 've ever come across . should tell you all you need to know .	4614
0	worst service i 've ever received at a hotel the manager was rude and totally unprofessional . i wo n't be staying here again	4614
0	valet lost my car keys and have been incredibly unprofessional ! completely unacceptable and i would warn everyone about using valet services here . disgusted .	4614
0	really poor service and way overpriced . you could make much better choices.they do not keep to a high standard of service . the rooms are not worth the money .	4614
0	from someone who loves hotels - this is by far the worst westin i have ever stayed in - truly the brand should take its name off of this property . from the substandard housekeeping to the truly poor service , i can not recommend another hotel choice enough . disappointing at every turn .	4614
0	good location , nice lobby bar but rooms are old , tv is small , bed was old ( not a normal heavenly bed ) feels very dated . front desk has no fast check in for elite members and you ca n't get your room key sent to your phone	4614
1	i got acrylic nails , i do n't say it was a perfect service but if i consider the price ( less than 40 it was very good ! the guy did my nails and he was a bit rough , plus he did it with bare hands , so if you do n't like it , i do n't recommend . i normally do my nails by myself , but if i need , i will come back to this place .	4615
1	really nice place , i got a pedicure done and it turned out great . they have a large colour selection . the lady who did my nails ( her name is apple ) was really nice and always made sure to get my approval about everything ( color , nail shape , etc ) .	4615
1	the absolute best experience i 've had at a nail salon in quite a while . thank you ann ! i only had a limited amount of time to get my nails done and they were as accommodating as one can be . i called in 10 minutes prior to the appointment to book it and was immediately assisted upon arrival . as soon as i told ann that i had a midterm right after my manicure she worked even faster , while delivering high quality work . thanks again , this was truly a 5 star experience !	4615
0	i 've been here a few month before and the service was decent . i came back and they change the stuff and owner of the place . it 's dirty , they ruined my nails taking off the previous shellac cause they were rushed to take in as many clients as possible . pricy , rushed and terrible service . stay away	4615
0	upon changing names to natural beauty nails , the quality of work and new staff members have gone downhill . manicurists and slow and sloppy . prices have also gone up from $ 15.00 to $ 18.00 ( for regular manicures )	4615
0	charged me $ 10 for shellac removal . i think it 's fairly standard to charge $ 5 , this was a rip off ! ! ! ! !	4615
1	kinda bummed to see the negative reviews . the kids working here seem to know what they are doing . the several times i 've been there they have been helpful and friendly . if the item you need is unavailable they always offer to order it for you . the only person i feel is a little rude is the manager/older woman who seems to be in charge . she 's a little rough around the edges . other than that , its an easy place to shop .	4616
1	even though we walked in right at closing time , and i hated doing that , we received excellent , patient service . she brought out several colors and styles , gave her opinion and advice regarding their care , and made sure we got what we needed . it 's their busiest time of the year and we could not be happier with their service and merchandise !	4616
1	it 's sad that people write negative things about other business.. i went in to campus club uniforms and taylor was so very nice to me and my son.. i 've been in there three different times and each time i 've been there they show so much respect and are the kindest people i 've seen.. even the manager came out and greeted us.. i will continue to buy my sons uniforms from that store always ... thank you so much for the niceness and helping us find what we need ... sincerely denise bain	4616
1	reasonable price for a uniform store . think it is $ 15 for my girl school polo 's	4616
0	they love to argue with customers and tell them they are lying . they give us the wrong stuff and tell us it 's our fault for not specifying . and they argue . the wife bought my kids school informs there , they had the tan skirt in stock , which is what we wanted ... we also wanted that same skirt in black ... and it came a different skirt . how much more do we need to specify than `` i want this in black. '' ? they also argue about other less important stuff . spare yourself the headache and try someone else . we will not be going back .	4616
0	terrible customer service . an employee got very rude with me over the phone because she misunderstood my question . totally unnecessary . the employees do n't know what they are selling and do n't communicate well with the customers . one employee was on his phone when i came in and would n't look up at me until i had to address him twice . they rarely have the right sizes and styles in stock and they want to argue and be rude when i have questions or clarifications . it 's a headache to get my uniforms here because of the employees .	4616
0	we went here for a simple medical uniform . they called us twice to come pick up our order . the first time , they told us that our order was at the other store on the north side even though we specified pickup at this location . the second time they called us only half the order was here . we needed to go there 3 times to get our complete order . this simple order took 12 days to fulfill . incredible incompetence . avoid this place . they have their heads up their a**es ! !	4616
0	horrible customer service ! only gave 1 star because i did n't have another option . do n't call a customer and tell them their order is ready and then when you show up tell you its only a partial order . seriously i have better things to do then waste my time . the the manager wanted to argue with me telling me i was a liar that their message said it was a partial order . seriously i know what the message said and it said nothing about being a partial order . way to accuse and then argue with a customer . if that happened at my business someone would be fired . guess it 's time to go to classic kids .	4616
1	good selection of clothes , from basic tees to flannel shirts and floral dresses . the store was a bit disorganized . i tried on the skinny low rise jeans , they fit great , but were too long and bunched up around the ankles . i needed a 29/30 but could n't find them in the right length . i ended up getting a few tees , and some flannel shirts . i think the sizing runs small , because i 'm usually a 6 or 8 , but had to get a 10 in the flannels .	4617
1	my kind of cloths . trendy cloths at decent prices , that 's h & m . the particular location can be a bit dirty at times . only cus there are dust bunnies in the changing rooms and makeup on the cloths .	4617
0	seriously the worst customer service in the world . as a former employee of this specific h & m , i understand how frustrating it is to deal with customers day in day out . that being said , there 's no reason to make someone feel like an idiot when they are trying to do a simple return . clearly this company needs to reassess the way they address a customers questions , as opposed to responding in a sarcastic and degrading way .	4617
0	lazy ! ! ! too lazy to do a return . the employees need retraining or need to be fired ! ! ! !	4617
1	very helpful staff . we had a bunch of questions and bonnie who helped us never had us feel rushed . store is clean and well displayed . only thing i would add is an entertainment area for kiddos .	4618
1	i switched from verizon to sprint on the iphone forever plan . chris helped me out every step of the way and kept me up to speed on the entire process . i have complete confidence in sprint . chris is an awesome representative and everyone should ask for him .	4618
1	knowledgeable staff . i just do n't understand how customer service , official sprint store and authorized dealers can all tell you different things about your bill etc . they are never the same answers . frustrating . this location seems to be somewhat organized though .	4618
0	bait and switch - told us we 'd have free hulu w/ migrating our 2 lines over from verizon ... asked twice to confirm in separate phone calls , on separate days . was told both times that hulu was included . not true . you have to pay an extra $ 30/mo w/ the 'freedom plan ' to get the hulu	4618
0	buyer beware . be prepared to fight often . you will not be told that your bill is due every 30 days , which means a different due date every month . plus they will put you on the insurance plan , even when you specifically say you do n't want it . they will also try to charge an activation fee months after you started your service ... out of blue . and of course you will be faced with super heavy non american accents when you reach the foreign call centers .	4618
0	save your time and energy and head to the arrowhead store . my husband and i walked into this store and were totally ignored while it was n't even busy . the employee at counter was talking about how he is only `` faking being nice '' to customers . the other employee proceeded to pass by us to help a new customer that just walked in . we had enough and bought our 2 phones at the arrowhead store which was polar opposite to this place ... .busy , professional and helpful .	4618
1	the front desk girl is beautiful , they cut your hair beautiful , and the place is beautiful.basically the best . make sure u check out ben .	4619
1	more than thrilled with the ending product of my hair ! exactly what i wanted and more ! i 'm so obsessed with it and ca n't thank hairstylists cassidi crump enough for the wonderful job she did ! i recommend this salon & casssidi	4619
1	request for tony , he 's an amazing hair stylist and very down to earth ! i will update with my hair results soon !	4619
1	always a friendly and helpful face up front , awesome selection of products , and overall great ambiance . it 's a nice change of pace from those stuffy salons ! oh and if you 're addicted to lashes like i am , kristina is the best ! cassie the owner is the only person i 've trusted with color for the last 5 years	4619
1	love this place ! kylie is bomb ! ! ! always gets the color right & she 's freakin awesome ! love coming into a nice , clean salon with nice people that work here . guys & gals this is the place to get your hair done in vegas !	4619
0	one person cutting hair , promptly states that she could not cut my hair because she was `` slammed '' , no apology or any explanation . never coming back .	4619
0	it 's probably best if they included the hours for the barber in this yelp page . this is the second time i 've tried to come here to get a cut only to find out that the barber closed early .	4619
0	i give one star because of the woman who attended us ! i went with my boyfriend for the first time and the woman did what she wanted to my boyfriend has , rather he had a long beautiful black hair and wanted to keep the length , after telling the woman a couple of times not to cut much , my boyfriend came out with a very short hair . horrible ! never again , no with her	4619
0	barber called in sick on the first time i tried to go . they did n't even contact me that he 's sick and wasted my time to go to the shop ...	4619
0	one person cutting hair , promptly states that she could not cut my hair because she was `` slammed '' , no apology or any explanation . never coming back .	4619
1	come here almost every weekday am . love the atmosphere with the starbucks music track and subtle conversation of the patrons . gets me ready for a work day . wish they had more than one man restrooms . this is a coffee place , after all . they never put enough toilet paper for the am rush . parking is available , but can be crazy at yimes . however , i 'm sure this building is at a premium , because of the location . therefore , it 's accepted . many happy returns .	4620
1	the service was so awesome , and the coffee was great as always . my mom can be very difficult with her selection process , but the barista remained friendly , professional and pleasant . when i 'm in charlotte , i 'll definitely be back !	4620
1	i did n't find the unhappy bunch that faith d and jeff g mention . i thought they were really friendly , especially when i got quick `` happy valentine 's day '' on the way out the door . other than a little more cheerful perkiness , i 'd say this was a typical starbucks with decent outside seating with a view of the parking lot . guess you ca n't have it all .	4620
1	this is a nice little starbucks , it 's near my college campus , and i like to come here to work on my homework/projects . free wifi is the best ! the people working here are always pleasant , and i 've never had any issues . they have ample lounge seating as well as taller tables with stools , and small two person tables with chairs .	4620
1	absolutely obsessed with this starbucks literally the are the nicest representatives of any company i have ever dealt with . they are personable , so sweet and fast . they know my name , all about me and have my beverage ready for me as soon as i walk into the door . i know all the names of the employees because they talk and actually get to know me as a person . they always make my drink to perfection and if you have n't made this your primary starbucks to go to , you should !	4620
0	ordered blueberry oatmeal yesterday and it was missing one of the nut packet . when i asked an employee for it she told me that has never come with the blueberry oatmeal and turned and walked away . so rude ! what has happened to starbucks 's employees that they ca n't be nice anymore ? i am in that store several mornings a week for my coffee . you do n't care about people or customers at all do you ? very disappointed . looking for alternatives to starbucks lately ... ..not that i think it will matter one bit to that employee .	4620
0	alan not her . coffee brewer broken , no free refills . so i ordered give gingerbread latte with skim milk . good , but no refill on regular coffee . get it together , starbucks . got to have a running coffee brewer .	4620
0	oh , how sad that this starbucks in a great location has one of the rudest cashiers i 've ever encountered . in general he is dismissive of customers , as if they are there to serve him instead of the other way around . on my last and last visit he relieved himself of a loud and long yawn right in a customer 's face as he rang up the sale . some of the nicest people i know work in starbucks . how this one was hired and why he stays is a mystery ! sorry , i 'll take my gold card elsewhere .	4620
0	clearly at this starbucks mobile orders take precedence over customers who have ordered in line . i waited there for almost 15 minutes before getting my drink all the while watching the barista crank out 10 or 15 mobile orders . my order seemed like an afterthought . i 'll avoid that starbucks in the future . very frustrating !	4620
0	horrible they argued about how i ordered my drink when i have order the same drink at a different store for 5 year with no problem . mike you are horrible and should not be in customer service	4620
1	we appreciate your coverage of the news , especially at 11 pm . your reporting really prepares us , especially for the traffic on project neon and the esports arena on friday . the halo tournament was a blast . thank you channel 13 .	4621
1	i 've been here a few times on the morning blend , and i have to tell you , the experience is always great . everyone from management to the producers are friendly and sincere . the show itself is great for business and the hosts are welcoming . i will come back to the morning blend .	4621
1	what happened christmas eve ... we went to strip to see decorations ... nothing..no 60 ft tree no lights no entertainers ... saw lots of police ... was there a terror threat ... ? i ca n't find any info on this ...	4621
0	fake news perfect example today is sunday and the news at around 8:45 or 8:40 p.m. reported three different times in the news report that that football player from seattle was arrested on the strip when he was detained for 10 minutes and let go ! i 'm sure they 'll have a retraction next week sometime	4621
0	i hope management at ktnv channel 13 caught the 5 pm sunday news cast . it set a new low even for weekend reporting in this town . mistakes in every segment , it was an absolute disaster !	4621
0	count the amount of times that yasmeen says `` right now '' when she does traffic . it 's absolutely amazing . i guess she was out the week they taught similar words in college like `` currently '' or `` at this moment . '' maybe she picked it up from that huge graphic they use that says it .	4621
1	great shop ! nice manager . knowledgeable , helpful staff . matt changed my oil and let me know some other things to look out for . not condescending at all but met me at my level and politely let me know what he saw . thanks so much !	4622
1	this 5-star rating is well earned . the new store manager went out of his way to make up for my last two experiences at this location . i had vowed not to give them my business again but another location could n't get me in today so i made the call to this store . i 'm so glad i did ! matt explained his approach to customer service , introduced me to his staff , all of whom were polite and professional throughout . they showed me what services they would be doing and why . i received high quality mechanical and customer service , and walked away with my trust restored . great job !	4622
0	we got new tires put on , left the store only to find our car was vibrating terribly . we called right away - just to be told that their alignment machine was out of calibration - but they let us leave the store without telling us that . i 've heard from other people that the mechanics are on a commission - meaning that the more problems they can invent for the customer , the more money they make . i would not trust this place ! ! ! !	4622
0	the positive ... nice sales person/manager , convenient hours the negative ... ..super expensive ( almost $ 35.00 ) to remove a screw from a nearly new tire and plug it . slow service ... took over 30 minutes to do the aforementioned task . never again !	4622
1	i pulled into hot shots to have my car washed . i have driven by many times but did not realize that the cars are washed by hand . and that makes a huge difference . the employees are fast and thorough . my guy srcaped the tar build up off my car . i was so happy . i hate doing that . my tires were polished and my car sparkled . i will be back . they do interiors too . i will utilize that service in the future . $ 8 and something cents for a carwash . a great car wash .	4623
1	really great . i came here after several mediocre washes at danny 's just up the street . at hot shots , they take a lot of time with your car no matter what wash you pay for . the physical layout of the place is a bit strange ( i never feel like i 'm waiting where i am supposed to ) but the guys are great . they open early and do take credit cards , but remember to bring cash to tip .	4623
1	this is a car wash that i would highly recommend . they do a great job , and pay attention to the details . it costs a little more at hot shots , but it 's worth it . it takes a bit more time , too- but worth it . the main reason i would recommend this place- they do an outstanding job and are consistent every time .	4623
0	i ca n't even give them one star ! first they were closed an hour and a half early . second they do n't even have signage to help you know where to go if you 've never been here before . and third the big guy inside was kinda rude in letting me know they were closed . definitely wo n't be coming here anymore . not very customer service oriented .	4623
0	i used to go here exclusively - they were awesome and reliable , but since they 've changed owners the service has been inconsistent at best . one time they left my car sitting there , forgotten about , without drying , it so they had to wash it again . most recently , my husband brought his brand new car in for its first wash , and they scratched it ( then refused to admit that they had done it but it was obvious , and the owner never called him back ) . i 'm looking for another hand car wash place now .	4623
0	this place would n't take my money at 4:30pm because they close at 5:30pm and that 'was n't enough time ' . my wife spent all day calling the place to make sure this was ok , but no one picked up the phone . i will not be back .	4623
1	came in for a timing belt change . service department was awesome , everyone treated me nicely . nice clean waiting area . free popcorn i think , i 'm not sure , it it did smell good though . there 's a discount if you use them for all your services .	4624
1	from the beginning there is no pressure . i could n't believe we were at a car dealership . jack was thorough in all the car details and helped me find the car that i could afford and love . although we ran into a couple snags but jack and the dealership fixed them . they truly to follow their motto `` we want you to be a happy satisfied customer '' . i would recommend them and in the future will go back !	4624
1	still the best car dealership and service department i 've ever been to . they do n't ask for reviews , but they really deserve it ! not only the best volkswagen dealership , but literally the best car dealership i have ever had the pleasure of knowing .	4624
1	keith did an amazing job at accommodating my schedule with last minute notice and taking care of my needs . he arranged a loaner vehicle within a short period of time . i did n't even purchase my vehicle from the peoria dealership and i was truly brought in like family and given vip treatment . i will recommend this dealership to anyone interested in a new vehicle . i am grateful to all the staff that helped make a stressful situation completely stress free . such friendly and genuine people . i wish i would have come to you guys 3 months ago ! !	4624
1	as a young woman , a car buying experience can be uncomfortable and intimidating . despite my initial fears , i had a great time purchasing my new jetta se . the purchase price was much lower than i expected , the apr was extremely low , and their customer service was exceptional ! ! i was treated fairly and with respect . what a great dealership . i will recommend this vw dealer to anyone !	4624
0	i went to get an oil change . i was 1st in line at the express lane . i waited almost 3 hours to get a damn oil change , and this is not the first time . i came here to get an express oil change i do n't have all day to waste at the dealership . to top it all off i paid $ 90 for an oil change and they do n't even have the decency to rub it through the car wash . this is ridiculous , and i will never return again .	4624
0	ended up being charged $ 36,000 for a $ 26,000 car . found out not one penny of the $ 7,500 downpayment went towards the car . they are slimy with their dealings . they really dishonor the vw name . it 's hard to believe vw would allow them to do these things .	4624
0	the service department foreman was unresponsive and lacked the knowledge needed to get the job done . if you do n't know something go and get the person who has the knowledge to respond to your customer needs . this place has taken a definite turn for the worse . only the women in the cashier area were friendly . would not buy another car from lunde 's . too bad ! ! ! ! !	4624
0	linde volkswagen has the worst customer service i have ever experienced . vw . or even living up to their buyback program for cheating the us public . after a year of hassling with hem they decided at the last minute they wo n't buy the vehicle back . i would highly suggest purchasing any other vehicle than a vw .	4624
0	my wife has been sold a car ... really a lemon . two major incidents that require major repairs in 3 months . this dealership refuses to work with her and make it right . the gm will not call her back , i 'm assuming because they know the sold her a lemon . lots of `` we do n't know '' and `` there 's nothing we can do '' , referring her to volkswagon care . if you are considering a volkswagon , stay far away from this dealer . i 'm sure there are other dealers in the valley that you can purchase from .	4624
1	5 stars does n't really do star orthodontics justice ! i could n't be more pleased with dr. davis and his amazing office staff . marlana specifically went above and beyond to accommodate our families ever changing schedule and always with a smile ! payments are affordable and service is impeccable ! you ca n't go wrong with star ; )	4625
1	i ca n't remember our hygienists ' name , but she was awesome ! ! my daughter was a little nervous when she went in for her check up . when she left , my daughter was in the best of moods . the dr. was welcoming and also worked well with my daughter . i would like to see a cleaner reception area , but the service was amazing .	4625
1	we 've been going here for a few years and have been very pleased ! unfortunately my kids just got their first cavities . i know i was more nervous for them than they were when we went for the appointment to get them filled . i was truly amazed with how great they were at keeping the kids calm and hiding any pointy objects so they would n't be scared . they were patient and gentle . my kids have a completely different view of the dentist than i ever had and i thank them for that ! i almost wish they had scared them just a little so they would brush better	4625
1	april 7 2018 my sons first dentist and my daughters fourth apt the kids were happy and dr. vanna was great along with jessica very patient i 'm very happy with our choice we will be coming back thank you star orthodontics .	4625
1	really an amazing overall dentist . we found them after a horrible experience with a dentist off bonanza . star 's waiting room was clean and had tablets for the kids . you can go with your kids to meet and talk with the dentist crystal bill dmd was amazing . my son was able to watch tv that was above him and she was so patient with not only my son but me as well . i will recommend them again and again .	4625
1	scheduling was easy . staff were friendly and professional . doctor was very informative and great with my son . the office is very clean with fun decors . they have ipads in the waiting room to entertain the kids , even though the wait was not that long .	4625
1	i am working mom with a crazy schedule . the staff at star made scheduling my kids appointments an easy and convenient process . which is not an easy task ! during the appointments i found the staff to be very helpful and friendly towards not only me , but to my kids as well . dr. davis took his time answering my notebook of questions and never once made me feel rushed . we will for sure be back !	4625
1	took my little guy here and they took real good care of him . the nurse and doctors were super nice and hade the patients to put up with my son . thx again	4625
0	they have poor communication and do n't care about their patients . i specifically said i did n't want sealants put on my daughters teeth because they are made of questionable material and they did it anyways because my insurance covers it ...	4625
0	if i can give zero i would it 's ridiculous that they charge $ 60 for a missed appt when there was an emergency for my other newborn baby . i 'll never return back . no sympathy . nor do they care .	4625
0	customer service is a major reflection on what type of business you run . starting from that first call to make an appointment ! your staff needs to learn some respect ! after a rude encounter with just the front desk staff i do not trust they have the best interest in my sons well being .	4625
0	called to ask about a type of service they quoted me $ 100 but had to wait 1 week . so i made the appt . when i arrived for my appt they said $ 450 . the receptionist quoted me wrong & did not deny it . they would n't honor their original quote now my retainer is damaged further thanks to them . that was a typical bait & switch on their part . i had my kids scheduled for same location now i 'm cancelling it cause i no longer trust them . scam	4625
0	i was trying to become a new client and had my appointment cancelled not once but twice , the day before the appointment ! and they did n't even apologize . what a terrible customer service experience for a busy mom . would n't recommend !	4625
0	my daughter has been a client for over a year . staff is rude and we always get promises that her braces are coming off on the next visit . they have been saying that for eight months . this is just a few ongoing concerns with this place . save yourself the headache and go somewhere else .	4625
0	avoid this place . 45 min wait after your appt . so unorganized and unprofessional . seems like they only care about money	4625
0	dr crystal bill has sold this location to another group . it has went downhill since . office seems disorganized and messy compared to how it used to be . new dentists seem very impersonal and treated like a number . my daughter hates it there now as well . appointments are often cancelled by them on same day after i already took off work to take my child to dentist . our family will be looking for new dentist . do n't trust them .	4625
1	good prices for manis and pedis , and once they sit you down , they are so quick and efficient at doing your nails , and they do a good job . $ 15 for manicure , $ 35 for shellac . it seems like they 'll never turn any walk-in away , although that does mean you might have to wait for a bit , but they never give a time estimate of how long you 'll have to wait . they just smile and ask you to pick your color .	4626
1	the person who did my pedicure was named lily . she was really nice and friendly . nice environment and she does a pretty good . i would definitely come back for a pedicure . i would recommend this place and find her to do your pedicure . i brought my own nail polish to use . i love how it 's walk in . if you 're paying by credit card you 'll have to pay tax . pedicure $ 25	4626
1	nice place , i used to do my mani pedi at this location after i found something better . very friendly and nice stuff but always busy .	4626
0	came here a second time for a pedicure , manicure and eyebrow wax . at first i was impressed with how two girls were working on me at the same time . however the girl giving me a manicure cut my finger pretty badly . luckily the place seems pretty clean . while she did apologize i did n't even get any hand cream or a massage at the end ! i also was charged full price by the owner which was pretty disappointing because while i know the girl did n't mean to cut me she still did and i would have expected the owner to comp me something . i will never go back now .	4626
0	i had a manicure and pedicure done . such a bad experience . the manicure was done at the same time as the pedicure . i was n't asked of this option to do the services together or separately . i felt rush and it was not relaxing . there was a young lady that was doing my pedicure , and when it came time to shaving the heel , she shaved too much skin which started bleeding . when i got home it was still bleeding and now i have a sore heel and then i apply a band aid . i do not recommend this place .	4626
0	for a quick change of colour or shellac they do an amazing job ! i do n't like the way they do my manicure the ladies always ignore my specific instructions of being gentle with my sensitive nails . so decided to stop going since there 's is literally over 50 place around the corner .	4626
1	amazing and delicious cakes . i bought a birthday cake there and have been sending people there ever since ! yummy !	4627
1	ella and neil are fantastic bakers . they have made their beautiful tasty confections for so many of my special family moments that i feel like they are part of the family now . everything from their cheesecakes , red velvet twinkles , brownies , sugar cookies and custom cakes have always been the crowning moment of our get togethers thanks for being consistently great !	4627
1	love it ! chocolate chunk cookies are the best . coconut bars are the bomb ! ca n't get enough of fruit tarts either : ) if you have a sweet tooth , this is the place to be . inside of the store is beautiful , the displays of cakes are amazing . ( i ca n't believe they are actually cakes ! ) they also carry a huge variety of teas that you can pick up to enjoy with all of the baked goods . staff is super friendly and helpful . i will be going back to this bakery time and time again ! ! ! !	4627
1	cake was good and they have some interesting decorated cakes inside . it was a nice surprise we came upon .	4627
0	very frustrating - not open during posted business hours . they turned the lights off after i knocked . hopefully no one else was trying to pick something up .	4627
0	the service was horrible . tried to talk to the man behind the counter with curly hair . he was severely short and acted as though he did n't want anybody in his store . bought three macaroons anyway . they were tasty but did not have the right texture . wo n't be going back .	4627
0	did n't care for the bad customer service . we were excited to come in and get some treats but honestly the lady behind the counter was not very friendly . i would n't spend my money at this bakery . i asked a few questions , and i felt like i was bothering her . wo n't be back . maybe try being friendly to your paying customers , and would it hurt to smile ?	4627
0	i bought a small 6 inch chocolate cake with italian buttercream frosting and a small 6 inch apple pie at about 4pm on monday october 22 for my husbands birthday . the gentleman i purchased from made it clear his desserts were a cut above . we were so disappointed . the frosting had a nice flavor but it was dried out . the chocolate cake was very dry and seemed stale and old . the apple pie was also very dry and not very favorful . given the cost of almost $ 30 for the two , i certainly expected more . safeway desserts are better . wo n't shop here again .	4627
1	this place is quite honestly ugly but it is a golf course this is cheap and easy to get a walk in tee time , even during february and march . the staff is very , very friendly . it is also cash only . the course is easy and fun to walk for a hack golfer like myself . hole 3 is the only hole that presents much of a challenge . but it is a par 31 9-hole course . they also have a lighted driving range and it is $ 1 off buckets from 4-8 . bottom line- you ca n't beat the value , availability and friendly staff , just realize this is n't a troon golf course .	4628
1	i am biased as i live close by and was part of the movement a few years back to save this course from the city and giants , but so glad we prevailed ! this community gem in the rough is an asset to the area - thanks to mr henry gailbraith who first deeded this land to the city and then fought to protect the destruction of this course . i see grand parents with one and two generations down walking around this course - just hacking away and having a great time . over time this course will continue to improve and with it the areas around it . the driving range is great too ! long live coronado gc : - )	4628
1	i really like the driving range . reasonable price and it 's lighted at night . they have happy hour when balls are cheaper and they sell beer . nothing is better than beer and golf ! the people in the store are all really nice too .	4628
0	come on guys . join the 21st century and take cards . it 's pretty silly that you get here and a ) you take only cash and then b ) you do n't even have an atm on site . pretty sloppy business ownership . pay the .23 cents in credit card fees on your $ 10 bucket of balls for the sake of your patrons . # cheapskates	4628
0	garbage . it 's 2017 and you do n't accept cards and do n't have an atm on site . take your business to a nice place that is accommodating to their willing patrons . kid behind the counter sat on a chair 10 feet from the counter , did n't greet anyone , barely looked up from whatever he was playing with . lazy and rude .	4628
0	only accepts cash ! ! would of been nice to know before i drove there . the course is a dirt field and the manager is a prick .	4628
1	first day of spring ... have to go and get some ice ! rita 's is the place . did not realize that on the first day of spring all rita 's nationally give away the italian ice ... went in early evening and they were out of some flavors but man oh man was the raspberry wonderful !	4629
1	saw this small quaint custard joint driving down the street . pulled in , stepped to window and was greeted by a friendly courteous young man . he offered samples of anything we wanted to try . after doing the samples my wife decided in cheesecake custard & i opted for the black raspberry custard . the servings were generous and prices were mire than fair . rita 's is a small place so keep your eyes peeled to pull in and enjoy a great dessert	4629
0	how do you have the seasonal flavor advertised ( pumpkin spice ) everywhere but , do not offer it all season long ? ? ? huge disappointment ... .	4629
0	i could n't help myself ! rita 's was my first and still longest job ! i love this place , and have so many fantastic memories here . i stopped here for a kids chocolate ice . it was chunky and freezer burnt . i do n't think they mix the ice enough to keep it smooth . would n't recommend this location . it 's certainly not like it used to be under the previous owners .	4629
1	this place is great ! i tried it with a groupon , and it was very clean , plenty of options , and the staff is fun to talk to . they did a great job with my gel pedicure . it 's a little tucked away behind the walgreens ... they just bought this place a little over 6 months ago , any reviews older than that are for a different owner ! i 'll definitely be back with friends	4630
1	i 've visited this nail/beauty salon twice now and both times i was a walk in appointment . the first time , i did have to wait ~20minutes for an eyebrow wax , but she did such an amazing job , i stayed for a pedicure ! their paint/polish lasts a long time , several weeks if i recall . i went back for another eyebrow wax and once again , amazing job ! wish this salon was closer to my home , i 'd be a regular !	4630
1	went here for the first time today . i had a mani and pedi . they did a great job ! my nails came out perfect . the pedi was relaxing and not rushed . everyone working was very friendly . will definitely be going back here .	4630
1	staff was excellent . took great care of me and my husband . we both had pedicures . i had a great refill	4630
1	i have been getting my nails done for over 30 years so i would say i have an expert opinion.. i have been a regular customer for 4 years . i drive from east phoenix to get my nails and pedicure done . never do i have an issue with my nails breaking , lifting , chipping , etc.in my opinion they are the best in the valley . ann and mary are a dynamite team . give them a try . i guarantee you wo n't regret it .	4630
1	i got my nails done by jimmy , who does a beautiful job . he 's so gentle and focused , my nails came out beautifully . although because i 'm deaf , soft spoken and a heavyset woman , i was n't given a second look . : ( but the ambiance is simple and soft , the staff are really nice and can really do great nails .	4630
1	been going here for a couple years and visit often with a close friend who gets her nails done as well . they do my eyebrow waxing which i love . i always have a pedicure done and i have acrylic nails so they do my fills , back fills , and new sets when i need them . i usually see mary for my nails and i do not have a regular person for my pedicures . i have n't had a `` bad '' experience here . i have been a little underwhelmed by the service when they 're really busy though . i guess that 's to be expected when it 's crowded .	4630
1	great place to go for a manicure . the staff there are friendly and polite . must check it out !	4630
0	it 's closed and 4 lease drove up yesterday and all equipment is there but it 's got a for lease sign in the window	4630
0	these guys are horrible . i had a gel pedicure and gel manicure , paid way to much for what i got . my feet are still rough and the massage we all look forward to , did n't happen . i 'm actually going to another salon to have my manicure redone ! ! their customer service is also horrible . who has the time and money for this ? beware ! ! they are thieves ! ! helped themselves to adding $ 6.00 onto my credit card that was not authorized ! ! ! that is theft ! ! ! !	4630
0	this place was super dirty and the customer service was poor they did n't even clean up the extra stuff around my nails will never go back again .	4630
0	very dirty i would not go every again	4630
0	since 0 stars is not an option i had to give you 1 star , which you do n't deserve ! ! ! first of all your employees are incredibly rude , ruff and completely inconsiderate of patrons ! ! ! i am completely shocked that your business is still open due to being so unsanitary ! ! ! the health department will be my next stop ... i hope if someone is planning a trip to your salon they read all of the reviews of your business , and choose against it .	4630
0	these guys are horrible . i had a gel pedicure and gel manicure , paid way to much for what i got . my feet are still rough and the massage we all look forward to , did n't happen . i 'm actually going to another salon to have my manicure done ! ! their customer service is also horrible . who has the time and money for this ? beware ! ! not only are they horrible ! they are thieves ! ! they took it upon themselves to take a $ 6.00 tip that i did not authov , which is theft ! ! ! !	4630
0	i went to this place today for a pedicure and to my surprise they could take myself and my boyfriend at the same time . i was impressed , their service was very friendly however i wo n't be returning due to the lack of cleanliness .	4630
0	rude ! do n't go here . nail salons are so hit and miss . with most being not good . this is just another nail salon that is n't good . this is a service field , learn to treat customers very well as they are paying you and keeping you in business . do n't deal with rude entitled employees and go elsewhere . i suggest pink polish in chandler . beautiful salon and very clean and hip . best gel manicure i 've ever had .	4630
1	been going here since 1990 . in today 's world , you always get a good whiff of overpowering skunk weed permeating from various patrons ! such is life . besides that , the music is always enjoyable , great place to people watch , and enjoy a libation or two ... small , old time , classic blues club . a legendary phoenix landmark to say the least . gets very crowded , go before 9pm on the weekend if you want to get a seat ! groove essence with laydee j is always a treat ! check it out , especially if you 've never been !	4631
1	stopped in on a mini vacay in phoenix . i had a great time at the place . the service was awesome and the music was phenomenal . i especially like that the owner was in the building and was walking around shaking hands . its a diverse crowd and everyone was having fun dancing and listening to music . get there early because its a small place and it gets packed . if i am ever in phoenix again i 'm coming back .	4631
1	this place was awesome ! ! fun with good entertainment ! ! a little small they should definitely expand they 've got plenty of guests , i 'm sured there would be more with more room . overall though it was a great experience - we will be back with more of our friends ! ! ! !	4631
1	`` i went out a dancing with a tennessee dear , they had a fellow there named handy with a band you should hear and while the folks gently swayed , all the band folks played real harmony . i never will forget the tune that handy called the memphis blues . oh yes , them blues . '' ( wc handy - memphis blues . ) great blues bar . dark and dingy place with new blues bands daily . super diverse patronage . fun place to hang and listen to them blues ... oh yes , them blues .	4631
1	made the trip to chars last saturday for my first time . had an absolute riot ! we saw larry bailey , who plays there every wednesday as well . really , really enjoyed it . it was by no means traditional blues , more a mix of r & b and funk with some classics in there , but the band was rocking . great time , great place , i will be back .	4631
0	had to give it only 2 stars because of the racism in the place . music was great wait staff was excellent but some of the clientele was very racist and made the experience very uncomfortable .	4631
0	first time here it was packed and i do n't mean in a good way . the place is tiny and you ca n't move past the front door but the guy at the door is still taking a cover charge and not giving refunds even though you ca n't fit more people inside the tiny bar . the music sounds great but this place is a fire hazard because i am pretty sure they are not supposed to have that many people in there . they should consider having a outside venue .	4631
0	good music but it get seriously packed quickly . headed here after our christmas party and stayed there drinking and dancing until they closed . accidentally left my wallet after giving our waitress an extra tip since one of the guys in our party was being cheap . we were the last people out and i got there the next night as soon as the gates opened . i found my wallet had my id and cards . cash was gone . hope whoever the thief is gets a bit of karma x10 . few honest people left out there . very disappointed . i wo n't be back .	4631
0	music fantastic , soul power band was outstanding . place is way too small and gets very congested and no room to breath , always bumping into someone , tables and chairs are way too close to each other . expensive watered down drinks . cocktail servers not to pleasant , always expecting tip . what 's up with the tables having little signs meant for 3 or more people ? ? it 's a joke to have signs on table when clearly there is always a jam packed crowd . a world of advice for the owner ... ... get a bigger place to accommodate the crowd	4631
0	i am sorry to do this , but the gig is up . i 've been to chars a few times in the past noticed something was off but good times . tonight..i ordered a few drinks again and for sure was correct ' watered down liqour . i am a certified bartender and know my liqour . i order 2 doubles of scotch both tasted off and no buzz . asked the bartender and he got offended and said that illegal , well.yes sir.. i know . i ordered a different liqour , same thing . i know for a fact they are watering down drinks .	4631
1	i have a tried a few things they have at enroute coffee shop . if anything else tastes half as good as the chocolate chip cookies i want to try it all .	4633
1	can i just say how incredible her cake and scones are ? and marlena is far and beyond one of the sweetest people i have ever met . i ordered a cake for a baby shower i hosted for our good friends . oh my goodness ! the cake was so moist and so delicious . not only was that cake delicious , her pumpkin spice scones i had at enroute coffee shop were to die for . she definitely hit a home run on those scones . they are so much better than starbucks ' pumpkin spice scones . i would recommend marley 's bakeshop to anyone !	4633
1	the cookies are my favorite . rich and chewy peanut butter and the chocolate chip are to die for .	4633
0	last year my daughter got a lovely chocolate mint cake for my birthday . because it was so good i recommended that my son in law purchase my daughters birthday cake from marleys as well . this cake was totally different . the decorations were ok , but not to the standard i would expect from a custom bakery . the worst thing however was that the cake was so dry . it crumbled when you cut it . we alerted marlene to see if she would offer some sort of refund and she offered 10 % off our next purchase . i can assure you we wo n't be purchasing again .	4633
0	if i coiuld give no stars i would ... looked this place up on google to get the address and it had wonderful reviews . followed the gps.to the `` location '' which was never found . there is a coffee shop there , but not this place . called the location at least 3 times , to get a new address or explanation , no answer . do n't waste your time with this place , wherever it is .	4633
0	so after i posted this review , we were offered 50 % off our next purchase instead of a refund . i wo n't be using this bakery in the future . i will look for a business that stands behind their product and values their customers . it does n't make sense for me to trust her to do another cake .	4633
1	i 've been going to mcclintock animal care ( dr. karen claus ) since 1998 and we have always received spectacular care here . every single encounter , every single person , every single phone call , we have always been treated with truly remarkable professionalism and compassion . i could n't ask for a better vet !	4634
1	i am continually amazed and impressed with the professionalism and compassion shown by the veterinarians and staff at mcclintock animal care . our experiences over several years confirms that this may be one of the best operated service providers of any kind . we love our pets and do not trust their well being to just anyone with a degree in veterinary medicine . our primary veterinarian is dr. marnie duplissis . we love her . however , we trust and respect all of those who have contact with our pets . they can treat our pets , anytime .	4634
0	i am not a stupid person . yes , this is the correct place no matter what you claim re . not finding my files , etc .	4634
0	brought my dog here for years , seems like they care , but he came away from a teeth cleaning with a leg injury . then my new dog was n't diagnosed properly . took her to another vet who charged much less , and took the time to diagnose her correctly . extremely disappointed with the staff at mcclintock animal care .	4634
1	hey , if you need a cdl medical card , this is the place to go , they are cheep and quick ! they also have several locations for your convenience .	4635
1	went here to renew my dot physical . not my first time using the company , but my first time in this new location . waiting area is small and can get crowded because many cdl holders come here . staff is always friendly including dr paule . they have a process and it works well . dot physical is only $ 35 and includes everything . get there early , even if you have to wait a few minutes before they open , it will save you wait time in the long run . parking area is also small , but adequate .	4635
1	good place for cdl medical card at only $ 25	4635
1	no problem great service yeah the wait is alil long but hey if ur a trucker u should b used to it . quit ur bitching ! !	4635
0	we had to wait 5 hrs for a 35 $ dot exam . really ? it is the most expansive dr dot exam when you factor the very very long wait . it wo n't ever happen again . not worth it ! ! !	4635
0	expect at least a couple hour wait time , there over 3 hours for a physical in the middle of the day	4635
0	unless you want to waste the whole day waiting on a physical . do n't come here , trust me . just pay extra to get it somewhere else . parking is horrible , location is horrible , waiting time is horrible . the staff is good but the wait times are atrocious .	4635
0	going on a 3 hour wait . ridiculous . got here at 930 and the dr did not show up until 1030 . not worth the discounted price to lose half of a day .	4635
1	got my haircut by tamim yesterday . he 's excellent . i have been to every barbershop in toronto ... at least 25 of them in the past year or so . i get my haircut once a week and i am super picky . by far the best haircut i have received . i would highly recommend this shop and ask for tamim . he 's one of the few barbers that can use scissors professionally . he listens to exactly what you want and is precise . tamim is the man .	4636
1	on point with appointments ( longest i 've waited is 10 mins ) cool team and atmosphere my go to guys are mez ; tameem or aaron ; the others look like they do a great job too . overall-highly recommended barber shop . full disclosure : i do n't know any of the guys personally and i 've been going there since first month of opening a few years back ; have n't needed to change since ! keep up the good work !	4636
0	they do n't know how to cut . lousy place . i do n't recommend it to anyone who cares about their appearance .	4636
0	made an appointment , and when i arrived the barber gives my slot to his buddy . waited around for 25 min after my appointment time and never got so much as a greeting from anyone . would not recommend . i wo n't be back .	4636
1	this location is the main borders in the las vegas valley . they have the largest book selection and that is all they sell . do n't expect a large music or dvd selection as this one primarily focuses on books .	4637
1	this is the first borders i 've been in where someone actually was friendly/asked if i was finding everything ok ... . i bought alot of stuff here probably spurred by my son but also saw another woman bought this huge amount/box of items : candles , books , frames , knick knacks , burt 's bee 's stuff , lotion/hand soap ( as did i ) . i have to keep up with the jonases ! ! !	4637
0	i used to go here for tech books a lot . i went in and the section for tech books is half the size it used to be , completely disheveled , and contains no organization beyond the dummies books all being together . it looked like no one had even done basic straightening in months . very sloppy . i will not be back again	4637
0	today i drove here from henderson , and was disappointed . this used to be an enjoyable border 's to hang out in . wow ! things change . and when this border 's eliminated their cafe it was a change for the worst . this border 's now resembles a large walden books . i understand that border 's is having financial problems . however if they intend to close their cafes , then border 's may become another retail memory . this would be a similar approach to chuck e cheese eliminating their arcades . btw , this store has an attentive staff and a good selection of books .	4637
1	ran into this store to buy their vanishing bottom panties 10 mins before they closed and greeted by two super helpful ladies ! they helped me grab exactly what i wanted ! and made great recommendations . love my new no show undies ! ! thanks ladies !	4638
1	i like this store , i find what i need . i get excellent service from taylor and angela every time i visit . i love that they have plenty of `` unpadded '' bras . when you are a double d , you do n't need padding , there is natural padding already there . i do n't need to look like i am a stripper . the prices can be a little steep , but if you wait and sign up for e-mails you can find great deals .	4638
0	store manager is extremely rude . go to another location even if it 's a longer drive from your house , it will be worth it not to have interaction with her .	4638
0	wow ! ! the customer service at this place is horrible . two sales reps chatting amongst themselves never even acknowleged that i walked into the store . i stood at the sales counter and waited for them to finish their conversation . they did n't even stop talking ! really ! ! love your product but will definitely stick to fashion squares soma !	4638
1	kim does an excellent job on my nails ! she is precise and pays attention to every detail to make every full look absolutely perfect . my nails last without breaking and the salon itself is very clean , cute , and welcoming . the whole staff is friendly and nate is a great owner/manager . i tried somewhere else for a quick fill ... .nope ! stick with pedi lounge and ask for kim , the absolute best !	4639
1	i have been a customer to tiffany for three year now and follow her wherever she goes . she is absolutely amazing at what she does and is always is a happy mood each time i see her . i bring my mom now with me and to see tiffany and she loves her . wo n't go any where else . the people here at pedi lounge are always friendly . they offer us water , coffee , wine or champagne while we wait . make us feel like vips . i always refer anybody that need to get their nails or feet done to go to pedi lounge and to see tiffany .	4639
1	amazing service ! accommodates to what you 'd like and the prices are n't bad at all , and the people are so sweet ! i docked off a star because the person i had was pretty rough on my nails , but i will definitely be coming back because my nails turned out amazing regardless !	4639
0	i am a regular customer . ..have been coming since the doors opened . even though it seems the nail techs do n't stay long i hung in there . today i had an appointment and the girl was an hour late . to add to that the discount available through yelp ( 20 % ) off was not given to me . nate , the owner , said i could only use it a couple of times . i see nowhere on the yelp site that there 's a limit . who knows maybe i 'm blind . with a nail shop on every corner , guess i 'll be going elsewhere . i would like my business to be appreciated .	4639
0	i came in for a gel pedicure . the polish looks nice but she did n't wash & exfoliate my feet . and the massage ... literally timed it . 2min of patting my legs and feet . i got a better massage from the chair i was sitting in . do n't waste your $ $ .	4639
0	terrible ! staff was less than attentive , the lady who did my nails just used acrylic stick-on tips . one of the tips broke off the same night ! i 'm royally pissed about this . as well as having been traded nail artists in the middle of my appointment so that the lady could service some woman ( who was white and let me note i am a medium toned filipino woman ) next to me . so come here if you want to pay $ 50 for nails that break and have them drop you mid appointment because who the hell cares about customer service ?	4639
1	we had driver john harper take us to & from our holiday event . he was so friendly , professional & helpful . silver fox has the nicest luxury transport in the city & is always s safe bet . i will be using again !	4640
1	i 've used quite a few limo companies and silverfox went above and beyond through the whole process . reservations were easy and quick , the whole night everyone was on time and ready , and mark , our driver was kind , professional and fun ! def . my new go to for the charlotte area .	4640
1	i was in a serious bind . 15 year old was on a re routed flight and we needed to find him a ride at the last second . joan and the team jumped into action and made sure he was taken care of . i was calling from california and she made me feel secure knowing he was being well taken care of . all this excellent service and a fair price too . i am extremely pleased with this transaction . thanks so much ! !	4640
1	as a visitor to charlotte , i used your service for the first time today and was extremely satisfied . i made the reservation online , it was acknowledged and then confirmed very promptly . your driver micah riley arrived on time , was professional and very courteous . absolutely stress free reservation and ride to the airport . it could n't have been any easier or better , and i would recommend this service to others . s. kunkle new york city	4640
0	while driving down 51 , one of their limo driver 's just rolled right through a stop sign . i had to apply full brakes because they cut me off in 5 pm traffic !	4640
0	horrible company . how do you run a `` limo '' service that does not even have their limo in service ? ! ? . completely ruined a very special christmas suprise for my girlfriend who has never had a limo rides before . thanks for nothing ! ! !	4640
0	if i could give zero stars then i would ! ! ! dealing with these clowns is an absolute nightmare ! ! the people in the office are so rude and unprofessional , only had one good experience customer service wise and that 's with an office guy named dan . for the amount of money they charge , the customer service should definitely be more on point ... instead just frustration and a huge bill at the end ... going to be using five star limos from now on ! do n't use these people ! ! !	4640
0	i was pulling onto an entry ramp to 485 on providence road . a silverfox limo cut me off and nearly hit my car , then drove like a bat out of hell on 485 , probably hitting 90 mph . this was saturday , june 23 at 4:15 pm .	4640
1	these guys are awesome . they were able to come out same day . they did everything . weeding , edging , tree/bush trimming , and lawn mowing . they were fast , they were professional , they were affordable . lili was a pleasure to work with ! highly recommended !	4641
1	did a great job with my yard . they were punctual , gave a fair price and got the yard cleaned up beautifully after it had not been taken care of for a while . i would recommend them and use them again .	4641
1	sun of the valley did an amazing job on our yard ! their employees were so quiet working on our yard first thing this morning . i had no idea they were there until they used the leaf blower towards the end . the owner , lili , was able to swing by my house last minute to give an estimate on the yard . she took the time to understand what we wanted done , and also provided some recommendations on what would look good in the yard . then she was able to fit my project in her schedule very quickly . great customer service ! their prices are also very reasonable . i highly recommend hiring them !	4641
0	setting a poor standard right from the beginning ~ set up an appointment for an estimate and review of what needed to be done ~ told someone would be here between 8-9 am ~ even called the business day before to confirm ~ just called them at 9:30 wondering what happened ~ `` oh , i should have called you , the guy is going to be late ~ how about this afternoon ? '' and you want our business ? ? ? ? i guess `` anytime '' works for retired or unemployed but for those of us who arrange work schedules to accommodate vendors ~ not a way to run a successful business .	4641
0	requested information from them , they asked to schedule me a meeting and when i gave them my availability lilliana sent me this `` heather i want to apologize but we ca n't help you this time because we are too busy . '' interesting they 're too busy to help with a 2-3 month time frame . would never do business with them . fast forward to today when she updates a comment and lies about what she said . that 's what screenshots are for . you most certainly did n't say you would reschedule . you said verbatim what my original post said .	4641
0	responded to my request and we set an appointment via email for 11am 9/4/18 . at 940am on 9/4 i receive an email from lillian asking if i was available the next day . since this appointment was set up a week ago i had put aside the 4th from my work schedule and was not available on the 5th.i responded at 10am explaining i was not available on the 5th and if she was cancelling today 's appointment . i received no response..or phone call explaining anything . while i understand last minute issues can happen but not to contact me or respond to 2 emails is not the way to conduct a business . like your time lillian , mine is of equal value	4641
1	first came here on a groupon . my husband and brother loved it ! we were back yesterday and they make you feel like a friend not a customer . the owner gave us a discount and signed up for their reward program . how else can i convince my husband to get a great cut while enjoying his favorite beer . oh they also have video games !	4642
1	this gentlemen lined my man 's hair up very nicely . i love it ! ‍ too bad we did n't catch his name	4642
0	haircut - not good . there seemed to be a major disconnect with what i wanted and what i got . no matter how much fixing she did to it - it just was bad . very bad . the place - meh . the concept seems great on paper - but was n't executed well . very confusing when you walk in - no one to greet you or ask if you have been there before and what to expect . sorry - i wanted to like it .	4642
0	heck of a way to run a business.. walked in and asked for a haircut and beer.. nobody at the beverage counter.. waited 5 minutes . lots of barbers sitting and watching sports.. doing nothing . great idea ruined by business model	4642
1	located inside the sunset station hotel casino . this extra swanky bowling ally has great deals both on bowling and food . if you find yourself on the eastside and want to take it easy this is your place ! live it up , you are in las vegas for cryin ' out loud !	4643
1	sometimes it 's pretty crowded and the staff is not too friendly ( stress ? ) . other than that , they have a lot of lanes so i 've been lucky to not ever have to wait . the cosmic bowling is a lot of fun and the prices are pretty reasonable too . the snack bar offers a kids menu , i 've been to a few differnt bowling places in vegas and hawaii and i 've never seen a kids menu . this was a major plus ! all around this place is great !	4643
1	this is a great place to take family and friends for bowling . there 's a ton of lanes so you never really have to wait to get a game started . there is also a mini arcade , pool tables and a snack bar if you must ! i usually come on tuesday or thursday nights ( 9pm-midnight ) for the $ 1- $ 2 bowling/snack deals ! a must if you 're a local or a visitor : )	4643
1	this bowling alley is adjacent to sunset casino in henderson . i was invited at the last minute by a friend . it was a cool environment , nothing out of the ordinary for a bowling alley . they have a lounge area with a full bar called '' king pin '' lounge directly inside for you alcoholics out there . plenty of tvs to keep up with the games that are going on . food and drinks at the snack bar . they have a pro shop for all those super great bowlers too . however , i am not . i think i got a 140 . i 'm ok with sucking ! lol	4643
1	very nice bowling alley ! went with a few friends tonight and had a great time . it was $ 1 games and $ 2 shoes after 9pm . best deal in town ! also $ 1 food and drink specials ! nachos , beer , margaritas and few other things for a buck ! ! nice bar and deli set up also . ca n't wait to go back here	4643
1	i 've been to the new orleans bowling alley and this one , and i would go out of my way any day to come here instead . this place has a way better atmosphere in my opinion . open 24hrs and with quite a few lanes , you rarely have to wait to bowl here . they have $ 1.50 games during the week and sundays . their customer service in the front is n't the best , but it 's not terrible either , so i docked a star for that . other than that , you are bound to have an awesome bowling experience here .	4643
1	a place to go in a casino and not spend a lot of money ! strike zone bowling center is located in the sunset casino . we walked into very very clean lanes . there are an abundance of lanes with a modern bar and snack bar on the opposite side . luckily with our schedule , we can take advantage of their specials . monday through friday from 8am-noon , they offer $ 1 games . talk about cheap entertainment ! i 'm not sure if this is offered at the other station casinos but it 's definitely worth checking out .	4643
1	we stayed at sunset stations this weekend while traveling with my son 's baseball team ! the hotel had sadly closed the pool without notifying us so we were forced to find other activities for our kids . we went to strike zone . they were so great and really helped us out with keeping the boys occupied . when i struggled with getting one lane set up costing the other player value play time . cody ( the desk manager ) gave me another round for the kids . very nice group of folks working there !	4643
1	came by to get a few games in . got ta keep the lane skills sharp . no line to get a lane , cool . not too crowded , good lighting , just a bit humid up n here ! enjoyed the atmosphere , snack bar refreshments pretty good too . wings n fries do well when working away on these strikes ! ! !	4643
1	$ 3.75 adults before 9 on fridays $ 4.75 after 9 for cosmic bowling ... awesome bowling experience with projector screens that play music videos add to the atmosphere and black light bowling is so cool . love this place ! the best place to bowl in vegas	4643
1	a little expensive but the neon bowling was a total hit with the kids ! a must !	4643
1	first timers here and decided to bring the kids for cosmic bowling . over seventy lanes , very clean , great music , kid friendly and great options at the snack bar . plus they offer military discount , so instead of paying almost sixty dollars we paid under thirty . that was for four shoe rentals and two rounds of bowl .	4643
1	great atmosphere and fun place to bowl . might even see a celebrity or two .	4643
1	love these lanes , always good condition , clean and the pro shop is top notch ! ! they have drilled and maintained my equipment for years , and since johnny took over it has gotten even better . i moved over here for leagues this winter and have not had a single regret .	4643
1	cool place to get a few games in , been a while so got here and lanes are n't too busy tonight . late night and looks like lanes were recently cleaned and no oil or other unidentified stuff on lane ( good thing ) . nothing like knocking down a few pins , been working on curve , got four games in and lil food to hold me over.. got the rust off the elbow and staff was cool , keeping the comedy going late night .	4643
1	i take advantage of their daytime weekday special , a price that 's not matched by any other bowling center i know of . the lanes are in very good condition . the pro-shop is staffed by friendly and knowledgeable people . the snack bar is okay . the bowling front desk is staffed by normally courteous and accommodating people , however there is one that i find impatient and unfriendly which is the only reason why i rated this place with 4 stars instead of 5 . it 's a good place for children and the lanes on the left side is normally set aside for them .	4643
1	cosmic bowling - yes ! beer and foods - yes ! good prices - yes ! clean shoes - omg yes ! awesome staff - katherine is the best ! i only wish they had more options for balls . other than that - this place rocks as a bowling alley !	4643
0	unless you have all day do not go there . played 3 games and had to make 7 , seven , trips to the desk to have resets . netnet had such poor service ! ! ! !	4643
0	the past year , this place has gone down ! we 're league bowlers on multiple leagues . but this is the last year ! lanes constantly breaking down . hotter than he ! ! all the time , and so smokey ! ! tables are always dirty and if u ask somebody to clean them , you get attitude . management use to `` mingle '' with everyone not anymore ! i would rather drive the extra distance and go anywhere else .	4643
0	paid for cosmic bowling and been here since 9 . due to leagues which i think is bs its just regular bowling until they are done . well you should charge for just a regular game and not cosmic prices since this isnt cosmic .	4643
0	everyone who works here is super nice . but i went cosmic bowling and all they played was the saddest breakup music . like , who hurt you mister dj ? ! ? did n't even want to play our second game . the vibe was awful .	4643
0	this place was awful . unfriendly food court workers . they seem to hate their jobs . it 's super hot and we tried complaining about the heat and they said nothing could be done . i 'm only giving 2 stars because the chicken fingers were very tasty from the snack bar . also not to many options in beer . very dissapointed with this place . especially the heat . my whole gang was sweating before we even started bowling .	4643
0	i 'm gon na make this short . to start off i just wan na say your job is n't that hard so i do n't understand why all the girl employees have such horrible attitudes . they act like your annoying them when you ask a simple question . secondly the lanes are always breaking down or not returning the balls . then again when you hit the service button they get all pissed off . third thing is they always over charge my debit card ! i bowled 3 games with 2 people and they charged us $ 88 ! sunset station has just gone downhill . as a weekly bowler me and my family will definitely not be returning to this facility .	4643
0	first time bowling in a league here and will not be back . one night our lanes broke down 10x 's before we were finally moved to another lane . water leaking from the ceiling onto the lanes . will not be back for another league . the lanes at sams town are older , but we never have a problem there .	4643
0	every time i visit this bowling alley there 's always a complication or more in my game . when i call for assistance , instead of the employee coming to the lane they want me to leave my game and go up to the front desk and explain to them what 's going on.. customer service requirements are low .	4643
0	if your idea of fun is being assigned a lane the staff knows is messed up then staring waiting for staff to reset the lane then this is a four star bowling lane . there were an abundance of open lanes - there was no reason not to move us . now i know why other nearby locations are always so crowded .	4643
0	the worst waited in line for over 23 minutes just to get a lane . old guy behind the counter would n't call for additional help as the line kept getting longer and longer . other bowling employees just wandering around . zero sense of urgency with the staff . for a busy sunday , they should 've had more help . the lane kept getting messed up . i 'll drive to boulder city next time .	4643
0	horrible ... not much more i can say . the staff is rude and they never have lanes available , even though there are many open lanes . wildfire a station casino is much nicer without the hassle . minus the cosmic bowling .	4643
0	i love this place when it comes to bowling . but the music for cosmic bowling is just upsetting . i came out here for a good time and my friends are getting emotional with all these songs . can we get some big sean , j. cole , future or the weeknd playing ?	4643
0	the wait is too long ! 15 minutes in line to pay is ridiculous . i 'm impressed in how big the stations casinos are and the fact that they ca n't hire more employees to run the establishment . next time i 'll drive the extra 20 minutes to sam 's town . smh . very dissapointed .	4643
0	cosmic bowl suppose to start at 5pm ... did n't start til 5:50 and music 1st played was 60 's ? ? ? ummm not exciting ! then everyone raved about the food and options for kids , no separate options fir kid sizes and only 2 employees on a saturday nite ? ! ? ! boooooooolol	4643
0	the bowling center is good . i 'm here for the tnba national tournament . during tournaments normally the snack bar , and bar staff up to handle the massive amount of bowlers . not the case here . 1 bartender on duty . there is simply no time to bowl and wait 15 minutes to be serviced at the bar . the bar is missing out on a lot of sales . since this is vegas and a tournament , the above is important . for that reason 1 star	4643
0	i really enjoy bowling , and my partner and i do this often , lately it seems that this place is getting slower in staff by the minute . we have waited for over and hour to check in and they have half of the lanes available ? i do n't understand that ? ! after almost two hours , we left . poor service !	4643
0	line is too long and they appear understaffed . no sense of urgency by the staff to clear the line . over an hour to just check in . do n't arrive on time for cosmic bowling unless you have several hours to just kill . i 'll be surprised if we make it through this line in less than an hour and a half . it takes them forever to just get get through the line . division of labor is way off .	4643
1	great petro prices good frendly employee 's best price if you add the car wash bring an empty tank lol	4644
1	open 24 hours , brightly lit , clean inside and out ( including a very clean , indoor bathroom ) and a little area to sit and eat plus very friendly employees .	4644
0	bad customer service , rude . i went to get my car washed and was going to use the nevada water save coupon and was told they do n't take them from funnys . if i could find the site i would complain to headquarters about this . the water district here in las vegas says they are to be use form water recycling business . this happend today 9/22/17 about 3:30 pm today . kid was kind of a smart azz .	4644
0	horrible ! ! they hacked my credit card number and was trying to buy everything they could ! do n't trust them	4644
1	i had to wight a review for one of my favorite consignment stores in the valley . i love this shop . the staff that i have interacted are always friendly and very helpful . i always find items in all price ranges and high quality pieces.i frequent many resale shops around the valley and this is on my top five list of go to shops . i will continue to visit and purchase items from this wonderful store .	4645
1	unique inventory , good prices and wonderful people . we were furnishing a condo and found a few unique items that made the place . now on our must-visit list when we 're in town .	4645
1	one of my all time favorite consignment stores . i shop fab finds on a regular basis because i always seem to find exactly what i am looking for ! the store is well laid out -- with tons of high end/high quality items . every time i visit- there is new stuff -- inventory is constantly changing . the people that work there know their stuff , have helped me time and time again to find just the right thing	4645
0	i tried to go to this place but they where closed even though the sign on the door said they should still be open . i could see a person inside and the dog barked but no one let me in . i would be coming back .	4645
0	went to this store and saw a couple of things i might have purchased , but the woman running the place was so rude , we just left . also , the `` barking '' dog inside the store evidently owned by the staff working there was a great annoyance to any normal shopper .	4645
0	i just called this store and spoke to the most rude man . he would talk over me when i was trying to tell him about the items that i was interested in have them consign for me . i would never go to this place . and i will not give it any stars ... . : (	4645
1	was here a few weeks ago and the gentleman who assisted me was quick , professional , and very friendly . he made the transaction painless and enjoyable . another gentleman even offered me a bottle of cold water . excellent service ! thank you !	4646
1	orlando was amazing ! great customer service and he opened up an account for me with great perks and superb details of the account benefits ! not to mention he made the process very time efficient . yaaaas orlando !	4646
0	when i use a bank , i 'm very choosy which branch i use , based on customer service . for wells fargo , the best branch to go to is on 3002 north central avenue . this branch ( 5033 north 7th street ) is the worst . they have two kinds of customer service ; sales pitches and rudeness . occasionally , a banker will be argumentative . sometimes the sales pitch will be obnoxious .	4646
0	please do n't go to this branch ... mgr devon richardson is the rudest branch manager and thinks its ok to talk to customers any way he wants..he needs further customer service training . i pulled our business relationship with wells because of him and i am working on getting our whole families ' personal relationship out of wells fargo bank and brokerage . i refused to be disrespected when i am the customer who has the money ! ! ! i ca n't understand how these uneducated people can keep their manager level jobs..	4646
1	felicia is the only one for my hair ! ! ! also everyone is warm and inviting . love this location ! !	4647
1	i assure you i was not the stylist involved in any incident like this . i take my guests and my salon very seriously . i truly apologize for any bad experiences and hope for a chance to prove ourselves worthy in the future .	4647
1	been coming here for 5 years ! amazing staff and great management ! feleecia is the best ! : d they always give you great customer service ! this place is always spotless and there has never been a time where i have walked it and they are not cleaning their station and sanitizing their clippers ! no place i would rather go cause trying new barbers in vegas is a huge risk !	4647
1	best place in life , always great service . feleecia is always the best 5 stars . i come in every week for a cut , trim and wash . they make it a great experience in a professional manner . i will not go to any other store because they are the best and know what i want when i walk in .	4647
1	i have always had a great experience . leann is my favorite person to color my hair . great price and service !	4647
0	do not go here until they fire the current manager and hire a new crew . i will never come here again . horrible customer service . rude . lady who told me 15 minutes pointed out to manager i had been waiting for over 40 . manager said he will just have to wait . all this while everyone could hear . who does that ? there are at least two dozen haircut places within five miles . color me gone for good	4647
0	this place is a joke i walk in to make an appointment the lady stated i am the only person working and one person ahead of me so i made an appointment less than an hour . when i come back to the appointment i was told there are 3 people in front of me and the same women was in the chair and the wait was going to be 45 minutes more after waiting 15mintues past my appointment . i would never come here again . can believe this is how they treat customers .	4647
0	i 've come here twice , 6 months apart , to have my 5-year-old daughter 's hair trimmed . nothing fancy , just cut off the dead stuff and even it out . not sure how you mess that kind of a cut up , but two different stylists did . they must be taught a method here that just does n't work . i will never return to this salon , and definitely suggest that no others do . maybe they would be ok doing a men 's hair cut , but i do n't trust them to be professional enough to handle long hair anymore .	4647
0	just everyone here was more focused on singing and complaining about the radio than they were with asking clients what they wanted from haircuts . a bigger woman wearing a piercing in her lip was rude to my boyfriend and just buzzed off his hair and did n't listen to what he asked for , he wanted a gentleman cut and got a buzz cut .	4647
0	my boyfriend and i stopped by here on the way to work , sure there was a longer wait as we did n't have an appointment but that 's to be expected . however the hairdresser rushed his cut and had a rude attitude as we were leaving . once i had gotten home i noticed i was charged more than the amount i signed for . will differently not be returning to this location of supercuts , it was n't worth the overcharged price .	4647
1	mclean is a very caring animal hospital with great staff .	4648
1	i spoke with the office manager ( who was actually from another location ) , and reviewed this situation with her . she provided me with some insight , which explained some things ... and she also fixed the issues i was having . just goes to show , that with some excellent customer care , you can win customers over and bring them back . i have to give them kudos , they have me back as a loyal customer ... . thanks mcleans !	4648
0	way too casual to impart any impact of medical authority . after two $ 350 appointments ( incl bloodwork ) , i had to pro-actively suggest a diagnosis , which was later collaborated by the vet over the phone ... having completely missed the opportunity to physically examine my cat for the same . felt like i was dealing with a high school kid . not again	4648
0	initially thought place was nice , overly pushy on unnecessary meds and procedures . high prices did not translate quality of service or care received . classic negative vet experience .	4648
1	dr. robin j . has been amazing and knowledgeable about wife 's treatment , we have been seeing lots dr 's after 2 brain surgery , and all i can say is when you find a dr like dr. robin you hold on to them and be grateful that such individual still exists in this field of medicine . thank you dr . robin ! !	4649
1	glendale location-recommend . front office staff very nice ! dr saran takes his time to get to know you and jim is thorough . thank you !	4649
0	walking into pain clinic with my wife listening to people in wheelchairs screaming that they 're in pain and the doctors are not helping them another woman was escorted out because they give her less meds that she 's used to seems to be a reoccurring problem here . bathrooms unsanitary	4649
0	i have went to this clinic since 2012 and i miss one appointment that was n't my fault was the veyo driver and they did not want to send a script to my pharmacy for refill on a non controlled substance was not able to get scheduled till that day the next month	4649
1	great service , fun place to by scrubs , and they new what size and ordered me 5 different colors it 's now the only place i will go	4650
1	great service , fun place to by scrubs , and they new what size and ordered me 5 different colors it 's now the only place i will go	4650
0	the worst costumer service . the girls that work here are so rude . i was charged incorrectly and when i returned to sort out what happened i was treated horribly , met with nothing but attitude.will not return .	4650
0	terrible service , poor choices in scrubs , if you need a uniform go else where . the owner was there and when there was a complaint he laughed and told them to have a better day . he didnt care at all . after seeing that , i will not go back .	4650
1	love marshalls . they have some good finds . they have clothes to home goods and shoes , purses , make up & more .	4651
1	im obsessed with finding a great deal and i am a label whore ... haha but really , its one of my favorite place to get coffee , and other nicknacks at a great price ! yeah , so you may have to dig to find what you are looking for but in my eyes shopping it self is an adventure- so enjoy the treasure hunt !	4651
1	marshalls is my go-to place when i need to find gifts . you 'll always find something unique that you wo n't get anywhere else .	4651
0	employees do not abide by return policy . and if they decide to , they blatantly act as if they 're doing you a favor . i understand working at marshall 's is no dream job , but 95 % of the employees ( particularly the ones at the register ) are some of the most unenthusiastic and unpleasant workers i 've ever come across . comparable to the dmv .	4651
0	1 star for manager bill who proudly proclaimed that , `` as a manager , my job is not to make decisions for people but to enforce the company policy . '' - wow ! thanks bill ! you 're a real winner , and really helpful to boot . 5 stars for the store manager dave who apparently shares a different view of what being a manager means . thanks to him , i 'll definitely return at some point in the future !	4651
0	terrible service from the manager dave at this marshalls location . i tried to return something and he literally yelled at me and belittled me in front of a line full of customers for not having everything i needed to return the items . get the hell over yourself ! it blows my mind that the customer service at these establishments are so terrible considering how much competition there is in this day and age ! not only was he rude to me but also to the woman that was trying to help me do my return . will never shop at this location or let anyone i care about give there money to this shitty store .	4651
1	great parking lot and the wifi reaches out quite a ways so i do n't have to use my data !	4652
1	thoroughly enjoyed my stay here . the staff could n't have been nicer and more accommodating , and my room was bigger than my apartment . i really enjoyed the amenities . the pool is very nice , clean and big enough to swim laps . and the continental breakfast actually had eggs & sausage ! when was the last time you saw that ? ! plus , for the coffee and tea drinkers , there 's a 24 hour station in the lobby for refills . loved it . will definitely be coming back for the comfort and exceptional service .	4652
0	my wife and i travel the country for our jobs and stay in 1 hotel a week usually . this is one of the worst we have stayed in . there were no luggage carts for us to use , which is hard when you have a lot and are on the 3rd floor . two of our three rooms smelled like smoke and we had to get new ones . our bed comforter had noticeable stains and there was hair on the blanket below it . not a very clean and comfortable hotel here . i would not stay here again .	4652
0	paid a decent rate $ 79 for a suite each night over the weekend , but after the kids swam in the pool and in the hot tub over the weekend , they all got sick with 'hot tub rash ' . tried to contact the hotel management and they would not call me back after multiple attempts . continental breakfast was good , but avoid the pool !	4652
1	got a quick bite to eat before my flight . i ordered the veggie supreme on a baguette- toasted . $ 8 . veggies included cucumbers , lettuce , roasted peppers , tomato and onions . it was topped with a veggie cream cheese . overall the sandwich was a little messy , but once i rearranged the veggies it was good to go . very good taste and the bread was soft . service was fast and the staff was friendly . the cashier even complimented me on my necklace . they have a decent size cafe area with chairs and tables , but no plug ins if you 're trying to charge your phone .	4653
1	first time at the charlotte airport and had a bagel craving . ordered a supreme sunrise on an everything bagel and boy was it good . on my stop coming back i 'll definitely be back .	4653
1	on my way to my gate , in concourse b , at 6:00am , i came across the great american bagel bakery . and , i am a sucker for a bagel with cream cheese . after checking out the large variety of fresh bagels , i could n't resist ! everything bagel , toasted , with cream cheese . they offer a variety of items , breakfast and lunch sandwiches , juices , coffee and more . my bagel was toasted to perfection and tasted great ! the employees were all so sweet and the place was well staffed , especially for the time of day . i will definitely remember this spot when i am at the airport .	4653
1	in all my year of air travel ( first commercial flight was in feb 2016 ) i have never quite felt comfortable with airport food ; it all seems too little for so much . but i am hungry and tired and about to miss another meal so i try a california turkey on a toasty cinnamon raisin bagel . hand-and-a-half sandwich with meats and cheese and veggies and a bagel cut both ways for less than a sawbuck ! compares favorably to local free-range bagel sammiches for cost and taste . skipped the flavored sugar-water and crunchy carb bombs and went for a small bucket of water and some filberts ( yumm ! )	4653
0	horrible horrible horrible . if there are negative stars i 'd give that . dirty snarky horrible place . glacially slow service . do not make my mistake and come here	4653
0	terrible service . they forgot my order , then the screwed it up . did n't have enough time before my flight because i was waiting so long to correct it . for someone who had a great experience in chicago o'hare 3 years ago , i was really disappointed this time .	4653
0	cheap store ! ! ! ! we spent about $ 30 worth of their coffee and breakfast and none of the ladies bothered ( wanted ) to provide a simple cup of water ! ! ! the humanity ! only because they want you to pay for their overpriced bottled water . their only other option was to buy their $ 4+ small one . shame on them . it is not nice to rip customers off only cause it is audience that do n't have choices . but wait : we did . we just crossed the aisle and went to starbucks and they did provide us .	4653
0	$ 1.59 upcharge for a `` premium '' bagel . got the chicken salad and i 've never been a picky eater , never send food back , but this was so gross i threw away a $ 10 sandwich .	4653
1	i love this place . friendly people and great service . i usually get their $ 21.99 deal and that is where my problem is . i wish it was a little cheaper but my truck does come out looking really good . they gloss all my black moldings and pieces on my truck and they do it well . another set back is the speed of it all . it seems like there are n't as many people working so the service is a little longer than usual . still highly recommended .	4654
1	i 've used friendly bear car wash now for 15years . today is the first time they wash my new honda pilot . wow ! what a great job . express detail and wash was perfect . best deal in las vegas !	4654
1	was met with quick and friendly staff . indoor waiting area with a snack bar and massage chairs . same parking lot as a gas station so you can fill up right after/before . dudes drying my car were sweating up a storm in the 116 degree heat working hard . went with the 22 $ wash , came out great . no complaints .	4654
1	been going here for 20 + years . just got the $ 200 detail , the manager knows us after all these years . he gave us a $ 40 discount , so $ 160 . the wheel wells are spotless , my bed cover and full bed interior was cleaned and fully armor alled . every bit was fantastic . over the years on basic washes they miss a bit like a bit of bug spatter needing a bit more elbow grease or a mirror or window not perfectly clean . they fix it right away . they have been good to me all these years . between the wife and i i bet we have been there 150 times . good place .	4654
1	few things in this world make you feel as good as when you get your car detailed every time i come here i 'm always taking care of well . service is always friendly , the prices are reasonable depending on the package , obviously the more you spend the more work you getting done the better your car looks the better you feel . but even at the lower prices the work is still incredible . if you come here as for marco he does a great job	4654
1	for my first time here , i can give it a 5 . not bad . my truck gets dirty from the daily commute for work not to include the fact that my kids in the truck can get messy . i do my best to keep it clean and very little eating in the truck but if the kids are hungry and your on the go , they got ta eat ! ! ! i have to say friendly bear did a good job , paid attention to children mess detail , did great on the windows and even vacuumed really good . was skeptical but they surprised me . keep up the good work and you 'll have repeat customers ! ! ! !	4654
1	hands down , best carwash on the east side . friendly staff , low prices , and a quality wash . i got the mini detail for $ 39 on my new civic . when they were finished , it looked nicer than when i drove it off the lot ! ! i will definitely be back here .	4654
1	good people , good car wash , good price , it took about 30min not bad good for me ; ) ... cashier very friendly . . clean location.. thank u	4654
1	not the fastest wash in town . however , they do a really decent job . go to the website and go to the promotions page . there is a coupon page located at the bottom to save a few more $ $ $ . one issue here . the windshield chip police are always on high alert . they want the upsell , be firm and tell them no .	4654
1	these guys always do a great job on my tundra , keeping it like new ! superior attention to details , with no workers ever standing around . you 'll find multiple guys on one vehicle at times to help out with volume . military , emergency workforce discounts are available .	4654
0	i used to love this place but they suck now ! i drive 30 minutes just to come here and the job they 've done the last 2 times is awful ! ! i wo n't make the drive again . hand waxed and bird poop is still on afterwards ? ? ! ! rims still dirty . just an all around bad job ! ! any suggestions for hand wash in the green valley area ?	4654
0	this place used to be a great car wash..key word used to be . $ 20 for a wash & my interior is still really dirty . idk what happened to this place .	4654
0	i came here before and they did an amazing job on detailing my car so i figured i 'll come again . this time it was not the same thing . i brought them my car at 7:30am and was told to come back at 2:00pm , well let 's say i showed up at 3:00pm and my car was not ready nor was it ever touched . the manager told me that the guy who told me 2:00pm was in no position to give times and that i can come back the following day , no thank you ! ! !	4654
0	last time i come here ! yes it 's super convenient for me since its up the street from my house but the service sucks . i should have just just cleaned it my self and saved $ 18 . i uploaded pictures to prove it . i 'm so disappointed .	4654
0	i just left this car wash and i will not be back . i spent $ 26.99 plus a $ 10 tip and there 's still dirt & crumbs on my dashboard .	4654
0	i wanted my car completely detailed the worst ever when i asked the manager for a number to his boss he refused to give me the info i payed 200 dollars for the worst car wash ever no attention to detail and when i pointed out what they missed they got upset i will never use them again and will tell all my friends and my wife who is retired navy will also let all her friends	4654
0	i 've been calling here everyday since the accident and they still refused to connect me with the owner . the girl behind the counter keeps giving me the run around saying he never comes in . i 've finally had to write a complaint with the bbb .	4654
0	shitty car washing even if you spend 40 dollars + do n't bother and look somewhere else . they do n't clean very good the interior of your car so good luck with that and your car carpet is not well vacuum either .	4654
0	just came back from friendly bear where i 've been taking my car for a long time . they did n't vacuum under the front seat arm rests . the steering wheel and the turn signal lever were sticky . and there were 7 small paint chips in the paint . i know , i ca n't prove they put the chips there but they were not there before . at the very least they are not washing their rags and something must be wrong inside the automated wash to put those chips there . they have lost this customer .	4654
0	i have been to this car wash many times over the years . my recent experience was the worst & i will not ever be returning . my usb was stolen out of my truck . i called back within 5 minutes of leaving to inquire . i was told they would look into it and call me back . they did n't call me back i had to call them . i was told by the manager they looked for it and could n't find it . he did n't offer an apology or compensation . if you decide to patronage this car wash take your valuables out of your car ! ! !	4654
1	karaoke karaoke karaoke . the crowd there is awesome on the karaoke nights . ambiance is sorta divey meets hipster ( they are about the same thing anyhow ) . its hit or miss but more hits than misses in my experience . complaints ? the only thing i 'd change is knock the booze prices down a few notches . please !	4655
1	i do n't know what else i could ask for in a karaoke bar . the drinks are affordable , the crowd is super friendly , and sometimes the bartenders get up and do a song . they earned their 5 stars . i 'm definitely going back	4655
1	popcorn is on point . beers are legit . get smashed and sing some songs . take a chick home before the lights come on . pretty sure i met ed sheeran here .	4655
1	this little spot gets lit , karaoke singers all night every night ! stopped in for my friends birthday and was pleasantly surprised by this little dive bar . bartenders were super friendly and attentive the house mini pizza is actually quite delicious ! the atmosphere is friendly and relaxed . karaoke singing regulars are fun and entertaining . i had a great time at this spot will definitely be coming back .	4655
0	just sat here and watch the dj dude cook 6 pizzas and not wash his hands without gloves . sick pig ...	4655
0	found this place online and was excited about karaoke . it says it starts at 7p online and in the bar . here we are 750p and no karaoke . we are the only 4 in the bar but they do n't want to start because there is n't enough people but also because other people do n't want to have a personal show . we are the only 4 here ! ! at any rate we are leaving after just average drinks . had high hopes but wo n't be back .	4655
0	the guy running karaoke only let 's the people he wants to sing . i mean it 's supposed to be fun and not serious . when he was confronted about pushing our songs back several times he said he did n't know what rotation was . never will be going back super rude people working and unpleasant bouncer working as well .	4655
0	my trip to corky 's in lakewood ohio was not a good one . the bartenders were really snarky and rude to us , and flat out refused to serve us on the basis of not tipping ( which we actually did ) . they cut us off and kicked us out after making several offputting comments about us to our faces . on top of that , the lounge was dirty and not taken care of . we were sitting in filth and stickiness for the short time that we were there . we felt very unwelcome and we will not be returning . i would consider going to a different bar if you are a paying customer that actually wants to drink .	4655
1	great place for a quick haircut . i keep mine simple tina did a great job very friendly . will definitely be back . good value for the men 's cut .	4656
1	rhonda knows her stuff . skillful , hardworking , great eye , fun to talk with . i 've always gotten good haircuts at this fantastic sams .	4656
1	jenn , thank you , its been four years of trying to find a hair stylist . finally , so happy with my cut and style !	4656
1	thank you thank you michele for fixing what another location messed up ! i 'll be back to this location again and specifically coming for michele .	4656
1	very clean ... ... took my daughter here to get her hair done ... . staff was very kind ... . shelly was very kind of my daughter in which has made me come back get my own hair done today	4656
1	have been looking for a place to get my hair cut for a long time . walked in and was seated immediately in michele 's chair . she did a fantastic job ! my hair needed some rescuing and she effectively and efficiently came to the rescue . i will definitely be going back to see her again !	4656
1	went to get a haircut today after seeing the 9.99 yelp special on haircuts . they were n't familiar with the yelp coupon but gave it to me anyway . autumn was very knowledgeable and asked me how i liked it and then gave me options . will definitely go back for the next haircut .	4656
1	ok , for a chain store , what do you expect . however , for past 2 years now , they have had a consistent staff and very nice team servicing the clients . this is what makes the place so worth it to come to , seeing the nice team there treating you like family ! i say support this place as much as you can . i do !	4656
1	i went in for a pixie cut and got exactly what i wanted . clean location and friendly staff . i could n't be happier with my haircut . thank you michele sheffield ! ! !	4656
0	not a great experience . was made to feel like i was an inconvenience for getting a simple trim that the girl spent less than 5 minutes on . then when i got home i realized she missed a whole chunk of hair that i had to cut myself . if you want an inexpensive haircut go across the street to supercuts .	4656
0	update : management called me today . thank you for your response . i still hold out hope the establishment , but not the stylist . thank you management and ( i believe the stylist that fixed my sons hair was ) megan , kudos to megan for stepping up ... it was a challenge , believe me . i hate to point fingers , but management needs to see every head leaving the establishment , this could have been rectified on site , immediately . ( it really stinks because we actually followed cat there from another location ) . you live you learn .	4656
0	hair got destroyed . hair stylist was lazy and i paid for the next day when everyone saw it at work	4656
0	okay haircut . the stylist did not bother to clean up her station from her previous customer , so i had to step over all the hair . she did it super quick too , which resulted in details being off . she 's friendly , but obviously not very considerate of her clients .	4656
0	i 've had my hair cut here a couple of times by a younger black girl with an accent and loved the way it came out , but i got my eyebrows done recently and the lady did n't listen to a thing i said . one grows in thicker and i asked her to clean that one up a bit and that i fill in the other to match to the thicker one . she somehow heard the opposite and made them both very thin . she also did n't even do the area in between my eyebrows . it was a young white woman with long brown hair .	4656
0	stylist had terrible body odor . she pulled my hair out twice and rammed her clippers into my ear . terrible hair cut had to be fixed . will never go back !	4656
0	laughable customer service . was n't even noticed for 5 minutes . no wait time estimate , no greeting , just a `` phone number ? '' and told me to have a seat . no further acknowledgement . i walked out without even receiving a cut after waiting over 20 minutes . wo n't be returning .	4656
0	i sent my 17-year-old daughter with a 12.99 coupon for shampoo condition and cut . i told her to add on letting them blow dry it . when i went to pick her up they had scammed a kid in the tune of $ 38 later . they proceeded to scream at me when i questioned it . tell me i just do n't want to pay . every stylist in the establishment was screaming at me . it was the rudest place of business i have ever been in in my life . and the haircut they gave her was terrible and the blowout was even more terrible .	4656
0	poorly ran hair salon . not very professional the salon is not very clean . i will be reporting to nv state board	4656
1	rented a car to drive to atlanta . rented a midsize car and it ended up being a buick . nice clean and comfortable car . basically new . service was good and it was super quick . i ended up needing the car a couple extra hours and they were able to accommodate with no issue . they emailed me receipt per my request . i love renting cars here .	4657
1	i rented a car from enterprise on gold hill road for a weekend trip . check in and out was quick and easy . got a great rate on a toyota corola . it was clean inside and out ran great and had no problems . customer service was great very professionaal and courteous . the web site where i made the reservation was easy to use . if i need a rental again i will use them .	4657
0	broken commitment reserved a car for 4:00 pm and called 2 hours early to ask for a pickup at 4 . they asked if they could come get me at 3:30 pm instead before it got busy at the office . they said they 'd give me a call when the rep was on his way to pick me up around 3:30 . 3:40 pm came and i still did n't hear anything . called them 15 times over the next half hour only to be put on hold and disconnected each time . 4:15 pm now and still trying to call to get through to talk to someone to pick me up .	4657
0	i went through the website to rent a car because i had totaled mine & was stuck at a body shop about 30 minutes from home . i called to confirm & was on hold over 10 minutes . the guy finally answered & told me they had no cars but he could get another enterprise to come get me & it would take 2+ hrs . i waited then called the other enterprise & they told me they could not come get me because it was too far . so 3 hrs later and i 'm still stranded . guess i 'll just pay double for a cab since enterprise wont come pick you up because they do n't have any cars .	4657
1	needed something actually edible at the airport . got the ham , cheese , and egg croissant at brioche and it was actually delicious ! ! best airport breakfast i 've ever had . also got a vanilla latte with soy milk and a strawberry and cream cheese danish . all were great ! staff were really nice too : )	4658
1	the have great soups and iced tea ( sweet and unsweetened ) . try the chicken kale , chicken noodle or tomato soup . the staff here work really hard and orders get out fast , so if you have a tight connection in e , stop by and grab a soup or sandwich .	4658
1	airport food , amirite ? then brioche dorée steps up and offers a damn fine sandwich : the turkey , apple and brie on baguette . not just baguette , freshly toasted baguette that softens the fruit , runs the cheese ( just enough ) and warms the bird . as i run haphazardly from the tip of concourse e to the tip of concourse b , i wholeheartedly believe my usual staple sustenance stop of bojangles will be bumped in favor of this tuck away counter service that toasts sandwiches better than any stale quiznos .	4658
1	i originally chose this place over the starbucks across the way simply because that starbucks oddly does not have a microwave . in search of a warm pastry , i visited this place instead and i have n't turned back . all of the food i 've had here has been amazing - the pizzas , the pastries ... if i 'm in concourse e , this is where i 'll be . to echo others ; the spinach and feta croissant is great ! ! the staff are hit or miss ( as with anywhere in an airport , it seems ) , but the people are friendly and smile are awesome ! !	4658
1	quick and friendly service . the turkey and brie sandwich is quite yummy ! ! ! i was pleasantly surprised ! decent cup of coffee as well ! in e concourse .	4658
0	i hope the woman behind the counter was just having a bad day and not always that rude . remember seinfeld 's soup nazi ?	4658
0	probably the worst airport food i 've ever had ... . and i 've been in a lot of airports . fortunately , the crack service team here had no idea what they were doing .	4658
0	what ? no parmesan , no red peppers ... . what you going to say next , your going to tell me you do n't make these pizzas fresh ? exactly . they come ready to bake ... ... no way	4658
0	just not happy with the food places here - they were slow - nothing was ready and i ended up not being able to get anything as i could n't wait any longer ! hopefully things will improve in this area of the airport !	4658
0	i am giving this a 2 1/2 star review . i had the egg & caramelized onion croissant for breakfast and it was not good . after i ate it , it immediately made my stomach hurt due to the access grease . i chose this place because i did n't want a greasy burger from burger king & still got ibs . if you have other options get something simple like a bagel & coffee from here but not the croissants . my colleague had the ham & cheese croissant and she can attest that it was not good .	4658
1	mindful brewing co. is a must for all craft beer fans ! great selection of mindful brews ( +/- 18-20 ) on tap as well as another dozen from guest breweries . available in drafts & samplers as well as take-home crowlers & growlers . on top of that there are easily 1000 varieties of bottled craft beers for sale . and surprisingly , even with such a great amount of choices , there are many reasonably priced options . the food menu is outstanding also , with pizzas & wraps at the top of my list . the spaces are well designed and there 's adequate parking even at peak times . servers and bartenders are friendly and accommodating . a good place for families .	4659
1	when i walked into this bar i knew i would have a great time . it was mostly because the amazing tattoo 'd bartender with long hair and haunting eyes . he explained to me it was his first shift , but with the comfort and ease he delivered my beverage you would think he had worked there for years . this is now my favorite watering hole in pittsburg . greg will serve you a beverage with a joke and a smile . plus , the place has great beer ! come here , and make america greg again .	4659
1	went to this place around noon on 10/04/2017 and it was my first time there . this is a modern drinking place for people that like tables that feel like their outside but inside thanks to the garage doors that stay open during nice weather . i had the garden vegetable pizza , nicely priced for it having fresh ingredients and a taste you ca n't get from a typical pizza place . erica , the manager , was warm and inviting . she was knowledgeable about the many different beers and food items they carry while offering personal suggestions . i 'd highly recommend for anyone that likes a wide variety of beers and tasteful food .	4659
1	the beer here is amazing . everything i had from brewery was solid . food is very good . the fried chicken ( any style ) or wings are both great . i thought the chicken and waffles is best in town ( yes better than meat and potatoes ) . place is great to hang out , watch a game or get dinner . really an all around well rounded place .	4659
1	i was glad to see they were able to repurpose part of the old building for a new restaurant . the food is good and the atmosphere is really nice . i just wish the parking lot was bigger , but unfortunately due to the location there is probably not much they can do about the parking issues . we had to park a few blocks away on the street .	4659
1	awesome pies , awesome beer ! we ordered a full array of their beers and there was n't a single one that did n't deliver exactly as described . each one was full flavored and held to the traditional style one would be accustomed to when ordering their favorite brew . and the pizza ... o. m. g . ! ! ! if you ca n't foresee what it 'll be like when you walk through the door and smell the dough baking you are either dead or just do n't appreciate great food .	4659
1	pretty good beer here , and the food is good too . the place is usually pretty busy which is annoying . i wish they would open a second one or something so you could go here without always having to wait . i guess that 's a good problem to have and there 's a reason for that . definitely a must-eat in castle shannon . but as for the south hills in general , i 'd stop if you 're passing through .	4659
1	what a gem ! recently visited for the first time and was incredibly impressed . great beer selection , distinctive menu , great food , and awesome service . this will be on our short list going forward for sure ! ! ! !	4659
1	pretty close to perfect . upscale , sleek , very cosmopolitan ( reminds me of toronto ) . great menu , and could easily bury the competition with an extensive selection of beer . too bad i hate beer , because they seem to have everything , with good bartenders to boot . ca n't find fault with anyone that can do really good wings ... and boy , they are : meaty , juicy , really great flavors . just try to keep me from coming back , even though a bit pricey .	4659
1	we have enjoyed the food and beer here every single time we 've visited . the menu is wonderfully interesting , has lots of options for vegetarians , and is made with great ingredients . there is a wide range of beers available , so everyone can find something they like . the service has been good whenever we 've been there , however , it is unreasonably busy during peak dining hours . either use the no-wait app to get on their list ( as we usually do ) or avoid peak hours . otherwise , this place is one of our favorites !	4659
1	great atmosphere , selection ! `` chicken sammie '' was really good , chicken fantastic , was light on tomatoes , lettuce , mayo ... . still really good though . med . salad also good , coulda used more feta , quinoa . beers were great , plenty to choose , and good cocktail menu . glad to have a place like this close by !	4659
1	love it here ! the pizza and wings are my go-to foods paired with the biggest selection of beers you could ask for ! i highly recommend the sweet thai chili wings !	4659
1	this is one of my favorite places to go ! the staff is super nice , the food is phenomenal and not overpriced and the beer is good ! they have a great selection of both beer and food and you ca n't beat their happy hour ! would definitely recommend .	4659
1	went here tonight for my son 's birthday . called ahead as they sometimes take special occasion reservations but you can also use no wait app and we were seated promptly . everyone loved their meals ... we had chicken sandwiches , pizza , chicken and waffles and spicy chicken ... .food came out quickly and was delicious . for dessert we had boston cream pie pierogies which were excellent ! we will definitely be back ...	4659
1	i have gone to many craft brewers in pittsburgh and in various states . what sets these guys apart is their food and beer prices . my wife goes with me but is not a fan of beer . however mindful has great variety of food and some of their drafts are 5 bucks . weekends are busy but do n't let that discourse you . go enjoy	4659
1	to start , i highly recommend using the no wait app if you want a table . this place is nuts right now ! i stopped on saturday night with a few friends and the wait for a table downstairs was 3-4 hours long . we were lucky enough to get a table upstairs ! the beers are excellent , and i 've got ta say the food is even better . fried chicken and mac & cheese was perfect ! i do n't want to forget that we had really good service ! the bartenders were filling orders fast and our food did n't take as long as i thought it would with how busy it was inside . we will definitely be back !	4659
1	found a table upstairs after about a half hour . we had a fabulous dinner , though the appetizer was a little small ( nachos grande ) . the burgers were flavorful , but my husband had the salmon blt and found the bacon flavorless . the beer selection was a mix of the house beers and a selection of international selections . very happy with the food and service .	4659
1	when some friends asked us to meet them here we were expecting a little hole in the wall . when we pulled up and found mindful brewing we were very surprised . what a great place to watch a football game . the tacos were amazing . and the beer was very good . anything with the word putin in it clutch . plus the bottle selection was huge . and not to mention they have crowlers . which means they can make any beer into a can . great place .	4659
1	excellent gluten free pizza ! ! we love there food . always cold in there . i have celiac so this is my go to for pizza ! have n't had any better yet ! it 's not cheap but worth the price .	4659
1	my first review was a two-star affair + while i still think the location + parking situation are one-star ... the actual place , beer and food are now a four in my book . i really appreciate a solid menu with vegetarian options . they try to be creative without going hipster . the beer is solid and if you are not into drinking mindful brews they have a wide assortment of other crafts and wine . looking forward to going back again , but perhaps i 'll take the light rail and avoid rt . 88 and the parking issues .	4659
1	went in for father 's day and i left as one happy vegan daughter . the roasted veggie wrap was great and the portabella burger ( swap the brioche bun for gluten free bun or no bun to make it vegan ) looked like a masterpiece ! the fries were perfect too . my dad and i had plenty of food , he got a free draft that day , and the bill was very reasonable at just over $ 20 . great service , pleasant atmosphere , and no wait at all on what we thought would be a very busy sunday afternoon	4659
1	this place stands out among the burgeoning gastropub scene . i know beer and this beer is well executed . the above average farm to table style menu is also a big plus . prices are also reasonable .	4659
1	this is my favorite place to go ! the food and beer are always excellent . i 've tried almost every beer and a lot of the food items . all excellent . this place comes up with the best beers and they own everything they do . also all of the bartenders and servers are incredible and they remember you even after 1 time . i would definitely recommend !	4659
0	too many times this place has had a private event for 50 % of their space already occupied . they need to clearly state on no wait or social media when most of the restaurant will be closed . it affects the wait time , the service , the food time , and the overall experience . two appetizers ( that they graciously comped ) took 45 minutes to arrive . i do n't want free food to make up for long waits and bad experiences , i want an enjoyable evening from a place that has shown the service before . this place can do much better .	4659
0	second time eating here ( after mediocre experience in first week it was open . not very busy , but food still took a long time to come out . burgers ordered medium were overcooked to medium well ( but had the wooden picks saying `` medium '' in them ) . plating still very uninspired , making meal look very plain and portion look small . sad to see a business not learning from its mistakes and not trying to improve .	4659
0	second time here.. i liked here when i had a pizza last time . today i tried fried chicken . the worst fried chicken i ever had . it was soo dry . it must be sitting on the counter for a long time ( cant no be . i was there 11:30 on sun ) or it must be a left over from last night . if you order one make sure it is freshly made . i regret i didnt complain abour it . i should have .	4659
0	food is terrible . i 've been here three times and each time was very disappointing . twice i 've i ordered the steak salad thinking maybe it was just a mistake the first time . they ask me how i like my steak , and i ask for medium rare . both times the steak was charred completely well done , and not enjoyable . if you 're just coming for a few drinks , you 're better off .	4659
0	it was just ok. long wait ( 45min for a sunday ) long wait after we ordered 1hour , and just ok food . bar service was n't great . overall disappointed .	4659
0	this place is overpriced , crowded , and just all around awful . the food is bad , there are too few tables for the space ( leading to a 2.5 hour wait ) , and the atmosphere is pretentious and cliched .	4659
0	this place is horrible - bad food , bad service , they have no control over wait times . i 've been here twice - the first time i waited for two hours and the second time waited for 1 1/2 . i got sick off the food ( mushroom pizza ) the first time . the parking is horrible as well- this is a poorly planned concept and they opened way too early without much testing . they should have done a soft launch to figure out all their issues . would not recommend at all - go to spoonwood instead .	4659
0	giving this place a 2 , and honestly they barely deserve that . the food is n't that great , and pretty overpriced . the main reason for this rating is their seating situation . they do n't accept reservations , and just do call ahead seating , which i get . but if you have a party of 8 coming in , and there is no wait , why would there be a 45 min wait all of the sudden ? they need to at least accept reservations for larger parties since they have very little seating available .	4659
0	beautiful building ; unfortunately the open space and reflective surfaces make it loud during busy times . the beers are n't really much to write home about , but they are wet , cold , and served with a smile . huge selection of bottles , and limited selection of draft beers from other breweries . did not try the food .	4659
0	the food is okay , but unless you 're going for the craft beer go elsewhere where you can probably get the same selection at a better price . long wait not worth it and no spirits there .	4659
0	left without ordering . waitress played with her hair , could n't explain any beer on menu and was totally clueless . beer menu printed extremely small print . no fountain drinks so if your the designated driver you are out of luck . dissatisfied	4659
0	the beer was good . the rest of the experience awful . was almost in car accident in parking lot due to total chaos . once i finally did get a spot the experience inside was brash and unrewarding . with so many other options with less drama it might be awhile till i return . i do n't need to get into an accident simply trying to park .	4659
0	went to mindful brewing to fill a growler . asked for samples so i could pick the beer and was charged over 5 dollars for it . complained about the charge and was told they dont give out freebies . ill never go there again .	4659
0	i really wanted to like this place . beer and fried chicken ? sign me up ! i 've gone in 4 separate occasions and 2 of them we had to get management involved just to get the food we ordered . by the time we did the food was cold and stale . management offered a discount off the bill which is too little too late in my book . i wo n't be going back . their house made beers are n't that great but they do typically have a great draft selection from good breweries . do yourself a favor and go to spoonwood instead . better food , better service , and their house beers beat mindful any day of the week .	4659
0	great beer selection . drafts were delicious . the nachos were less than average with just chunks of onion and a cheese sauce . the `` fresh cut '' fries were good but they seemed to be more of the fresh from a freezer bag variety . my medium well burger was rare . my husband 's medium burger was well done . very nice place . the food has some kinks to work out .	4659
0	first impressions are everything . ordered my food and waited about 40 minutes till i got my food . shakin ' my head . 2.5	4659
0	parking stinks . the design of the restaurant is not inviting . cold and sterile . bar is in a weird spot inside the restaurant . bartender service is non existent . nachos with chicken were terrible . chicken was cold , not grilled or anything and thrown on top . chips and whatever sauce was on it was cold as well . terrible . beers were weak . not worth the hype at all .	4659
0	the good part about this place is that they have a good selection of beer but that 's the only reason i gave them more than one star . the food is terrible they have a vegan burger but the bun that it comes on is n't vegan so i had to have a plane over lettuce and it was disgusting . we used no wait ... it said 2 hours and we got there and had to wait another our more . just awful .	4659
0	my food was so over cooked and on top of it my waitress was no where to be found . we had asked for her they could n't even find her . we went during the week and not packed so we decided to eat there . our hummus had a bunch of water in it . my shrimp was so over cooked and they forgot to put the sauce on it .	4659
0	delicious beers . extremely mediocre salty food . do n't ever get the wings and pizza here .	4659
0	we went to mindful when it first opened and it was packed ! as such we were understanding of the poor service and crummy food and decided to give it a try again after the newness factor wore off . alas , the service was still poor . the bartender was rude and stuck up as was the manager . i also tried their nachos which was chips with melted cheese and cubes of chicken . nearby spoonwood brewery is infinitely better . their food is better especially their nachos and their staff is far more professional . i will not be returning to mindful .	4659
0	new place still working out logistics . tried to use the nowait app ... 2 hours prior . got there around our suggested time and still waited an hour . with 4 parties ahead of us we decided to leave after hearing people leaving waited 2 hours to get there food . got a text 30 mins after we left that our table was ready . there was an extensive beer selection . but ca n't really comment on food or service .	4659
0	wanted to sample a beer before i purchased . was told that would be $ 2.50 . seriously ? to have the honor of trying a splash of beer i need to pay $ 2.50 ? what if i do n't care for it ? with as many breweries as there are in pittsburgh i 'll take my business where customer service is more important than squeezing money out of my wallet . a brewery that does n't offer free splashes ... forget it ! not looking to get a free buzz , but when i 'm paying premium prices i do expect to try the product . anyway , i wo n't have to ever see rt . 88 again or deal with the parking .	4659
1	i have only been once . the gentleman working was very friendly and helpful . it was clean . i personally had a hard time relaxing and shutting my brain off . i think i could get better if i return . prices are a bit high . over all glad i tried it .	4660
1	a very unique holistic modality useful for treating variously aches & pains . the facility is clean & relaxing .	4660
1	what a great experience . best way for me way just no light and no music . inside the tank you can choose different colors and music they play on or off . the whole experience was comfortable , quiet , relaxing , and the place is really clean . i would love to come back soon .	4660
0	my girlfriend made an appointment for a float during december 2016 . we showed up on time but nobody was at go float yourself . the lights were off and the door was locked . we called their number and left three messages . to this day , they never returned our calls . if you want to float here , i would suggest that you call them right before you leave to make sure they are open .	4660
0	i would be much more tempted to try go float yourself if the lazy salesclerk ... was more enthusiastic , more cheerful , healthier looking ... just to name a few.. she acted as if she was doing me a favor by giving me a quick tour of the facility	4660
0	run do n't walk away from this place . went there with a friend and 75 % of the equipment was broken . while the front end staff was very nice and assisting , they are not the ones responsible to make sure the equipment is working . the pods have mold on the inside which makes me wonder since you are inhaling this salt mixture if you are also inhaling mold . the neck rest is uncomfortable and both my friend and i suffered still necks and back pain . i notified groupon and now i am sharing with everyone ... .do not go there .	4660
1	great customer service , they always go above and beyond for their clients ! asu uses their service for the inter campus shuttles and their equipped with the best ! the buses offer wifi , comfortable seating and cleanliness . thank you , silverado ! i also want to add that the drivers are caring and take the time to make sure everything is up to standard .	4661
1	all around great service from the customer service given to me about the employees to the driver who was very flexible and friendly . silverado stages is the first company i will call when i want a luxury motor coach .	4661
0	terrible bus company . used them once last august 2017 and wo n't use them again . bus driver and management were unreasonable very unprofessional . bus driver pulled over to the side of the road mid trip and said she would n't take us because she heard from dispatch or management that we requested she not take us back home . company sent us another bus which put us behind two hours . complained to management and never got a call back . i just received an email from a sales agent about using them again . yeah right !	4661
0	worst company ever . do not use them . cancelled high school trip less than 24 hours before departure horrible and heartless . i was told `` things happen '' . ridiculous ! !	4661
1	i 've received nothing but great service in the year and half i 've been using these guys . kenny g is always up front and honest and has a wickedly wonderful sense of humor ! i could not be more pleased . thanks for a job well done ! !	4662
1	brought in the wife 's jeep for an oil change . fast and friendly service ! in and out in a timely manner .	4662
1	i bring my vehicle to tread quarters for everything . they have always been honest with what needs to be done now and what can wait , which as a woman who has been taken advantage of in the past for not knowing much about cars is much appreciated . kenny g and his mechanics are absolutely amazing and i would not bring my vehicle anywhere else !	4662
1	great service , great staff and decent ( starbucks ) coffee just next door . plus the service was super fast . the jimmy johns of oil changes ! i will gladly return .	4662
0	bought four michelin for my suv.the prices where better by far than any in rock hill.i waited for my car for a reasonable length of time paid and left on the way home i noticed the car road like a tank checking my tire pressure a had over 40 psi of air recommended by acura 32.i adjusted it my self not wanting to drive back.the next day i looked at my aluminum rims and notice they were gouged.this mechanic supposed to have 10 years experience.after calling the mgr.he agreed to fix my rims which was done to my satisfaction.i think most of there problem is they only have 2 employees.one mgr . and 1 mechanic.i will not go back till they hire some experienced help .	4662
0	went for scheduled tire balance and rotation for tires purchased at tread quarters , upselling was obvious . first time i 've heard free tire rotation does n't include balancing , that 's another $ 10 per tire . after `` inspection '' was told of 25 % discount if i got an alignment but quoted `` sale price '' was $ 20 more than i could get elsewhere . received smart comment when i passed on alignment .	4662
0	stay away ! i went in for an oil change and he wrote `` female '' on my service order . i left , to return in about 2 hr . kenny g called to tell me i also need : tires - true drive belts- false battery- false steering fluid is black- false ( my mechanic showed me that it was clear ) air filters- false this place scams people , especially women . so glad i have a mechanic who is honest and does n't overcharge me or do repairs that are n't needed .	4662
0	today is the second time i have called to get a price on a set of michelins for one of my cars i ask for a quote out the door which i wanted the total price.i was told around 128.00 per tire plus plus and what ever that means i wanted a total price.i was ask why do i want michelins.that is what i always buy.needless to say again i bought them elsewhere.you need to train your people to sell your product .	4662
1	i 'm new to vegas and i am still exploring places ... i was looking for a tanning place close by me and came in here . the girls were so sweet ! i love nice people ! ! ! they never tried to over sell me and they listened to what i wanted . the one girl even gave me the number to her hair girl ! the beds are nice , the place is clean , the prices are great ! ! !	4663
1	customer service is great . i usually get anthony ? i 'm not 100 % sure if that 's his name but he 's amazing . greets me every time and is always in a good mood . the prices are a little on the high side and i 'm a little bummed that you have to sign up for memberships or you pay as you go . i just wanted to buy maybe 5-10 tans before my holiday party but they do n't offer deals like that .	4663
0	had a horrible experience here . i 've been a customer for over a year . part of the vip program which my girl can tan for free if i 'm along . was told as long as one person is in the fgt bed and one in the level one it 's ok. then after a month of doing it that way , was told by the manager jordan that i ca n't and if i had a problem with it i can call corporate so first off your incompetence of training your employees and you have zero customer service .. if corporate does n't accommodate me i will be going elsewhere .	4663
0	horrible experience from corporation policy . they are super rude when you try to cancel your membership status . other customer reviews were right . if you want to join one month , you should pay membership fee and two full month without notice . thanks yelp . i learn a lesson .	4663
1	i am new to scottsdale ranch . i just went to mercado dental care at 10135 e via linda in the mercado and everything seemed to go fine with me . they are a small operation with only one dentist which seems so far to work for me . i saw the dental hygenist breanne who was great and dr. jordan karren is the professional dentist . brittany is so helpful with questions and the front desk . dr. karren did a nice job on my crown so far . still have the temporary as i just went there . please be sure to tell them i sent you ! beth	4664
1	i have followed dr. karren from lavern to scottsdale . he is worth the 40 minute drive from my house to his office . the entire staff is beyond amazing and you can tell they are happy to work there . from the front staff ( super warm and welcoming ) to the assistants ... . i ca n't imagine going anywhere else .	4664
0	i think they 're out of business . no one has answered the phone for three weeks . every time i left a message asking for a return call . no response . today i went to the office . it 's dark and the door is locked at 11:15 . i left a message this morning at 8 am asking them to return the call by noon . no response to that call , either .	4664
0	this dentist 's bedside manner was inappropriate . he actually started bullying me when i said i did n't want over $ 3000.00 of work done . i would not recommend him . probably wo n't be there long anyway .	4664
1	what i like about this place is that they have a really big parking lot ! thats always a plus . only downside is there is always a line ! ! but the staff is very freindly !	4665
1	i recently moved to las vegas to buy a home . the management and staff at this branch were exceptionally friendly and helpful . after only a few visits they greet me by name . i needed to prove to a mortgage company that i had made a deposit in the bank of america . the manager went out of his way to see that my funds had cleared and provided me with a statement to give to the mortgage agent . it saved our deal . i will probably drive all the way to this branch from summerlin if i need to go to a bank in person .	4665
1	very nice location , customer service is very good . i mainly come in to deal with the business department , the wait is kind of annoying but hey i did n't schedule an appointment . daisy the rep is very nice and knowledgeable .	4665
1	i was shocked that almost all of the vegas bofa locations i came across had drive up atm machines , which was awesome ( super convenient ) . we need these in cali ! ! ! !	4665
1	i have been coming to this branch for years . i am always helped right away . i always look on the app for an appointment but they are always booked yet they still find a spot for me without waiting too long .	4665
1	service is usually slow but very friendly . lines can be long . i had to stand in line to get checked in and then wait again for service . seems redundant . also seems like they need more help . but when it was my turn finally the actual transaction took three times longer than it should due to too much chit chat . maybe they do n't need more staff but just to expedite the processes their using . friendly is good until it 's so friendly it makes me late back to work .	4665
1	this location despite being very busy has some good directorial firces that makes it run like a well oiled machine . in particular , sahar arghavan , one of the managers , is a sweetheart and does a phenomenal job of making sure the tellers are doing their job well , people do not wait too long , and explain things in very detailed manner . i had a very easy job opening an acct with no minimum fees and got alotta advice on why to open a savings acct and what interest rate . ill be banking here for a longtime when i visit vegas .	4665
1	susan r. must have been there on a bad day . i find this to be one of the best locations to not have to get out of the car . 2 drive thru atms that move very fast and no crazy traffic around . a very convenient chinatown bank	4665
0	this is my worst first time experience i stood in line for half hour with 10 other people waiting to simply cash a check ... .they had one teller . service is absurdly terrible . but what can you expect from this bank ... not to mention their ceiling is deteriorating .	4665
0	i walked in and was told 45 mins to see a rep . it 's been an hour and i still have n't seen someone , there is no way everyone who came in after me had an appointment . i guess i have to look inpatient like these other folks just to get service ...	4665
0	this has to be the absolute worst bank in town . 20 people in line before they added a third clerk . how can a bank function seeing people come in and walk right out . passing by from out of town and losing precious travel time . inquired in why not more windows opened for the rush . suit guy could n't respond with nothing more than a 'im sorry ' . ugh	4665
0	my first and only time ever coming here . 1pm and about 20 customers in line and just 1 teller . no sense of concern by the bank manager . just terrible . this day and age to have to wait an hour in line at b of a is ridiculous . i wish i could give negative stars .	4665
0	honestly this is the 3rd time i 've used this bank . every time i go there there is a line of 15 people and it barely moves ! if this branch is this busy they need to open all the windows . i 'm usually in there on a friday or saturday so naturally busy . i just do n't understand why they do n't hire more people ! we love using bank of america cause so late staying open on saturday . the bosses need to do something about the wait .	4665
0	only two windows open while there are more than 20 people in line . people walking by ignoring the situation no one trying to help .	4665
0	who would think a bank would be busy on a monday lunch . anyone except these guys apparently . one teller even with the line out the door and a bunch of employees stood round chit chatting .	4665
0	never have seen lines this long . people complaining . apparently it is normal to wait 30 minutes to see a teller the people in line told me . six windows available only two in use . i 'm going to uber to another bank rn . in vegas , us bank is a good alternative . lots of locations , friendly service , and no waits .	4665
1	they did the most amazing job on this place . your child will not feel like they are at the doctors ! super friendly staff and great service . will definitely be back if i ever need to bring my little one to an urgent care again .	4666
1	terrific urgent care experience ! the office staff was courteous and timely . the aprn was thorough , gentle , and took the time to be patient with my hesitant son . we live on nellis and i will drive the extra 45 minutes to come here again .	4666
0	took my little one because she was n't feeling well . if the pediatrician was n't too busy flirting with my husband she would have diagnosed my daughter correctly . instead she sent us home and said that she will be ok in a day or so . went to different pediatrician office for a second opinion and she had a sinus infection . my poor baby was suffering , she should have looked at my daughter instead of eying my husband .	4666
0	the office was clean and the staff were helpful . however , the doctor i saw was extremely rude . rather than just treat my child and do her job , she was very belittling and insulted the fact that i `` let him '' get sick . i left close to tears . the last thing i needed was judgement and rude remarks .	4666
1	you will not be disappointed going to this place for a fun hangout . i had celebrated two of my birthday parties here in the past years for 20-50 friends and everybody had a blast ! ! ! bartenders are attentive and good , brian , is our favorite . karaoke every wednesday night from 9pm-1am is the best in town hosted and dj 'd by matt . best place for birthday party or any kind of group fun . affordable and food is good ! ! !	4667
1	i really like this place . we moved in right up the street , so it 's a great place to unwind in the evening ( or early morning if it 's one of those nights ) most of the bartenders are great . they serve take out late from the restaurant next door too , so we order out when we are desperate for decent food late at night . over all , it 's a great neighborhood bar and i will keep coming back !	4667
1	so.. the only reason i 'm giving this place 5 stars is because it 's close enough to ride my rollerblades there . but to be honest , it 's the biggest letdown of my life . # buzzkill	4667
1	just finished my dinner here , had the ham steak dinner ( $ 13.75 ) with grilled onions ( $ .75 ) and steamed veggies ( $ 1.99 charge ) . way too delicious , i 'm tellin you . our bartender was paul and i forget the servers name but they were both really polite and chill . my girlfriend and i enjoyed watching the steelers destroy the chiefs on their hd flat screens they have in the bar . just a heads up though , they allow smoking in the bar & the bar and restaurant/food side are separate from each other . there will be two different bills so remember to tip accordingly and be generous cause yolo .	4667
0	i guess this place is ok if you live nearby but there is no reason to go out of your way and this place is definitely out of the way.. dark , depressing atmosphere . usually dead inside . food is just ok and actually overpriced . i ordered a tuna melt for i believe $ 8,95 . i got the smallest tuna melt i 'd ever seen . seriously , i left still hungry . and oh yeah ... this place has the tightest video poker machines in all las vegas !	4667
0	what a gold mine this could be . all they need is draft beer , shot coolers and more tv 's . i 've seen several people walk out when they found there was no draft beer . could bring in so much more revenue for the owner too as well as positive feedback to the patrons friends . as a business owner myself , give the people what they want and they are happy and you make more money . what a shame !	4667
0	1 star review because i ca n't leave a zero ... first time i 've ever been here and i live up the street . bartender would rather take shots with his friends then take my drink order . he did come over at one point while i was playing $ 20 in the machine saying one second but made no effort to come back . guess i 'll continue to go to rounders instead where they 'll take my order .	4667
0	worst possible service there . i work in a bar and like to visit other bars to help bartenders make money , and time help their gaming numbers . the bartender , who seemed to be the manager , was not only neglecting but rude when he did choose to come around . acts like he 's too good for anything . it was my 3rd time giving this place a chance and my last . figured i leave a review so others could at least have a warning . rather drive the extra mile to near by bars .	4667
1	i moved here in july of 2017 and really like it . i love how clean and quiet the community as a whole is . the maintenance staff deserves an honor for their prompt response to everything , their professionalism and politeness . the office staff are very nice and friendly but mandy is the best ! she has responded to all of my concerns very promptly and has worked efficiently in resolving every issues i have had which are not very many . she is very pleasant and follows through with everything . she 's a leader ! so thanks palm villas i feel very content and happy .	4668
1	we lived here for 3 years and i can not say enough about the staff here . starting with mandy in the office and the quick response maintenance employees our stay could not have been better . the grounds were always being looked after and i saw the security staff many nights walking around after getting home from work . the location ca n't be beat , walk to everything ! had we not bought a place we would have renewed .	4668
0	the office staff sucks . old neighbors were annoying . you think it 's secure but nope . my car was stolen , and the office staff did n't even seem to care and did nothing . do yourself a favor and look into the other apartment complex right across from it .	4668
0	if you 're debating between this apartment complex vs another . please choose the other one . trust me . this apartment complex may seem great , but you 're just signing yourself to the devil if you end up here . don't.do.it . do n't .	4668
1	very helpful folks . found my part , sent me a photo , then shipped it out . could n't have been easier .	4669
1	i needed an inner fender for my 67 cutlass hardtop so i used the dvap website . i received an email 2 days later from justin explaining pricing and shipping . i agreed and got a call within 30 minutes . buying oe classic car parts could n't be easier . an email was sent with pics showing the part and now it 's on its way to me and they even saved me money on freight . ive already been recommending dvap to my friends with classic cars . thank you justin and dvap	4669
0	this junk yard is more interested in making a tv show than they are at selling used auto parts . when i called to buy a fender and a door for one of my cars , i was told that he would call me back . after a week , i called again only to hear that the parts were located in another city in arizona and that it would take weeks for me to get them . i ordered my collision shop to fix my fender and door . i will never waste my time calling this junk yard again .	4669
0	these guys are a rip off ! one day they charge you $ 25.00 and then the next week for the same part they wanted $ 75.00 ! they are total jerks and no one should use them !	4669
1	sears was very good . luiz and justin were very professional . they were on time , gave me a very fair price , and my rugs came out very clean . great job ! i recommend them , and will use them again . tom	4670
1	the carpets came out great and dried quicker than expected . i wanted to give them 5 stars , but luis was clearly disappointed when i did n't go for the upsell .	4670
1	i bought a 1968 classic house . i think that the ducts had never been touched , , as such very dirty . i greatly appreciated the professional guys who worked on my house . during the inspection i learned no filters had been used for years and the coils were full of dog hair , , the sears crew were able to revive this health hazard and immediately i noted good airflow . i can recommend this service , worth the investment .	4670
1	i 've used sears carpet cleaning for the last 4 years and they do an amazing job ! luis is their senior technician and he 's professional , friendly , and knowledgeable . i ask for luis every year i get my carpets and tile cleaned !	4670
1	the carpet cleaning service is , of course , affordable ( especially with the valpack coupon i used ) , prompt and professional . but what really sets sears apart is the customer service . i had a dispute with my landlord over who paid for the rugs to be cleaned upon move-in . two years after first using sears , i called to see if i could receive a copy of the invoice . within minutes , the rep , maryse , emailed me a pdf of the two-year-old invoice . through it all , they were very pleasant and helpful . highly recommend !	4670
0	one of the worst in the country ! they are not actually sears employees , they are independent contractors . they wanted cash payment , now i know why ! make sure you pay by check or credit card . they never fully completed job . sloppy , thieves , liars !	4670
0	i would not recommend this company for carpet cleaning . i was scheduled from 12-5 and around 4:30 , i still had not received a call that they were on their way or even running late . i contacted them for the manager to tell me he possibly could be there around 5:15-5:30 . well 5:40 came and still no call from the technician . i called the company back to cancel after waiting 5hours and 40 minutes for them to never show . ridiculous and very disappointed with customer service . i would have never expected that from a company on sears level .	4670
0	had my tile and grout cleaned last week . left a big mess on the tile , did n't clean the corner of the grout were it meets the walls . when asked to do it the moron got an attitude and ran out of the house like a 2 yr old and squealed the tires on his truck and took off ... needless to say when we called in to complain , the office said the manager was `` out of town for the weekend '' i 'll hold my breath for a phone call back ! glad we wrote a check . stop payment ! !	4670
0	i had the coupon for $ 79 for 3 rooms , my family room-high traffic area , my office and bedroom . while they did a half-ass job on my family room entrance , matt tells my daughter it is from water damage . we have not had a flood in our family room . i came home , sprayed resolve in the middle of the still dirty area and it came out clean . i will be calling them in the am . poorest service ever . will definitely pay the extra $ 30 for stanley steamer to come out and do the job right the first time ... .. do not call them unless you want your carpet half cleaned .	4670
0	-10 stars but i have to give at least 1 ! i have used sears before to clean my carpets and got excellent results but 2 young kids came to clean the carpets & the carpets look as bad as they did before the cleaning ! these kids talked us into so many extras yet the results were nil ! do n't use sears if you need clean carpets !	4670
1	was visiting a friend in mesa and had one international letter i was waiting to mail once i got home . she told me there was a post office closed by and gave me a direction . it was really easy to find and there was lots of parking spaces . inside was clean and my clerk was pleasant and nice . we 've moved from small friendly town in texas and use to friendly services but was n't expecting this in a big town . i was very please to find this post office and my clerk:13 .	4671
1	if you need to mail something , i would highly recommend using this location . they have a mailing kiosk where you can process your package yourself and not have to wait in line to speak to an employee . i went at noon and walked right up to the machine . i was in and out before i could complete my yelp check-in . the only issue with this location is the access . it 's in a neighborhood so you have pedestrians and slow changing lights to contend with . i will definitely be returning to this location for all future usps needs i have .	4671
1	nice post office , centrally located in the center of downtown mesa , though not on the main street , adequate parking , no problems . kinda reminds me of my po back home .	4671
1	i had to mail a parcel after 5 pm . i was so impressed with the process and design . the boxes where there ( all sizes ) ; the price is clearly marked on each box . i utilized my credit card to purchase the postage necessary for this shipment . great job usps .	4671
0	they do n't believe in having great customer service here . take your business to the ups store on baseline and country club ( nw corner by frys ) . it 's worth the drive , and they have amazing customer service ! !	4671
0	this post office is terrible . i have had 3 packages that were not delivered . when i call to investigate they are rude . they tell my that they will look into the matter and call me back and of course they do not . moving soon and glad that i dont have to put up with these people anymore . there is def something shady going on at this location .	4671
0	extremely slow and not kind at all . barely helpful . have been here multiple times and always dissatisfied : ( i am always told to get back in line ( address written incorrectly , tape is wrong , etc ) . everyone in line is always shocked by the rude words and gestures made by the employees . has yet to be a good experience : (	4671
0	been here since 400 and it is almost 420 . there are 20 people in line in front of me and another 10 or so behind me . 2 people are processing our packages/mail , and they ever so politely dealing woth the idiots who want to pay $ 5 for a 30 pound box and those who have kids who think that their kids entitle them to a cut to the front of the line ... .with all the stamp price hikes , you would think the usps would get smart by putting an extra person behind the counter to get the line moving . but here we wait . signed , # 20 in a line of # 35 and counting .	4671
1	awesome dentist . dr.ho personally greets each of her patients and really listers to what the problems are . follow up is awesome the next day the hygienist called and did follow up the next day . the following day after there closing hours dr ho called and followed up . very very professional and they set a relaxing tone . nice to find a dentist who cares about you and not just a paycheck . recommendation five stars . highly recommend this dentist .	4672
1	our first visit was today . my daughter saw dr. ho and she was very nice and did a great job of explaining the treatment plan . we will be back to see them soon to get her cavities filled .	4672
1	i am extremely pleased with the outcome of having to have a double root canal procedure . i am coward when it comes to my teeth . i had to have this procedure completed in two stages , and had pneumonia on top of it . the staff was very understanding , and this was very painless .	4672
1	the office staff is absolutely wonderful . they are friendly and welcoming as well as very informative when it comes to explaining the overall cost and payment options . i am also so impressed with how well the dentists manage pain . i am someone who does n't respond to numbing but they always made sure i was completely numb even having to continually give me more . i 've been afraid of the dentist but not this place !	4672
0	0 stars and a consumer warning ! they run this place like a car dealer finance department . a lot of upselling , keep you waiting in a room then give a horrendous $ $ $ options- i was lucky to get out of this place .	4672
0	the dentist was very unprofessional . she did n't introduce herself and she was with me less than 3 minutes . i am guessing she was dentist ho . she did n't even ask if i had any questions . i 'm so disappointed and so dissatisfied . i ca n't recommend this place at all . she even gave me the most incorrect advice about breastfeeding . if you are a professional and you do n't know something just do n't give your opinion . that makes you look so unprofessional and uneducated .	4672
0	this place is a joke and they will try to sell you every type of procedure under the sun . they have a finance person who tries to get you approved easily but the whole process is unprofessional ... .. stay away ! ! !	4672
0	i was excited that it was close & offered $ 39 first time patients but the staff is so new that it took a few extra try 's to get thru the x-rays . my hubby & i thought cleaning was about a 5/6 ... no extra detail or wow factor . poor girl at front is so new she forgets to give you a copy of your treatment.. here 's hoping time will help them .	4672
1	great flower arrangements been going here for many years and my mom always likes there flowers more .	4673
1	excellent service ! they did what i asked for a reasonable price . i needed flowers asap they were able to deliver it and go beyond what i expected 5 stars and highly recommend them !	4673
0	bad service . i cancelled an order 8 minutes after ordering online . brandon the owner said i would get a refund back but because they were busy with orders , he would only refund me back the money on monday ( 3 days after the cancellation ) . i trusted him and told him it was ok and that i would wait till monday . its thursday now and i have not got my refund back and he 's not answering or returning my call . each time when i call , his assistant would say brandon is not in . do n't buy at this store - they are scam ! !	4673
0	very disappointed in flowers that were delivered . my selection was supposed to come with roses in the arrangement , ribbon around the vase and a full size card . instead the roses were replaced with carnations , the full size card with a large piece of paper and a plain vase with no ribbon . when i called the manager he said he would speak to the designer and call me back . that was a week ago !	4673
1	when in with my wife and she was looking for a bra to match the one she loves and the staff there was very very very helpful . they brought her in to try on different ones and she tried on about five she picked two out and they were helpful in showing us where they were and my wife picked out one beautiful new bra .	4674
1	there was the sweetest lady working at vs with purple lipstick not only did she make me want to get purple lipstick but she was the sweetest and cutest thing ever ! love this store !	4674
1	my girlfriend needed an adjustment to a receipt from a previous purchase . friendly group of employees and they handled the transaction promptly and without question ! it 's no secret , this is a great store !	4674
0	some of the associates were friendly , while others were not . one forgot to come back.one associate was making fun of someone . i went to look in the teen - pink section to find something for my daughter who was in the dressing room and the associate told me i was looking in the wrong section . she thought i was looking for me ... come on ! i would make the trip and go to the one in blakeney where they are super friendly and helpful . they are very intuitive , always help you find what you like and take the time .	4674
0	came here today to buy a new bra . did not end up getting one thanks to the despicable condescending wretch who was working the fitting room . this woman should not have a job working with people .	4674
0	i was here yesterday and they were having their big holiday sale . they threw a whole bunch of products into a bin and i picked a few out and went to the counter to check out , where they told me they were n't on clearance . then she tried to get me to buy it at full price . it was disappointing and i still do n't get why things that are n't on clearance are in clearance bins ...	4674
1	having been to gentlemen 's clubs hundreds of times from vegas to new york to la , i must say that i have never been to a club that does it as right as christie 's . from the staff to the beautiful women ( even the food ! ) this place rocks !	4675
1	went on a slow weeknight ... ... went on a thursday night . not many people there . had some great conversation and dances from the ladies . my buddy did an hour in a private room and was not disappointed . one thing ... ..the chicken strips my buddy ordered took over and hour to get and i ordered a shrimp cocktail which landed up coming with the shrimp sitting in half melted ice water . it was soggy and lousy . waitress tai was great ! ! !	4675
1	i actually enjoyed my self , it was very very mellow , the dances are hot they were very friendly , the manger was so nice and showed us around and explained to us what everything was they played very good music it was very diverse no drama just a relaxing place i seriously did love it i had a blast ... ..that place is in fact off the chain if you never been there check it out..there is plenty of space its very big ... .the entrance fee wasnt to bad ... ..it was a good time a good time to hang out with friends and watch sexy ass strippers of all ages . races and all that jazz check it out merp	4675
1	i like strippers sorry , just had to counter amy : )	4675
1	i want to thank christie 's for the wonderful vip treatment . we had a wonderful time and memorable bachelorette party . the staff was excellent . the venue was beautiful .	4675
0	0 zero stars if i could . you must keep your hands on the couch . wtf is that . bouncer came in and yelled at me for touching her ass . what a joke .	4675
0	stripper tj stole $ from my friends wallet . when we told fat bouncer he laughed . this just after our friend saw him walk out to car with her . nothing but scams running here ! beware ! this place used to be good , now it 's just just another dirt hole .	4675
0	strippers from here need to stop giving out their phone numbers from this club to increase their business and stop sending nude pics to the men . eventually these will get in the hands of wives and children and can wreck marriages . and as soon as the wives discover , consider that client lost forever ! besides , when these women take off their fake wigs , fake eyelashes , fake eyebrows they are not much to look at in the face department in my opinion . so men , do n't drink so much . you might inadvertently take a number and wreck your life !	4675
0	where to begin ? first of all , big girls luv christies , but we do n't love how small the stalls are . what 's the dilly-yo ? am i supposed to wipe , solo ? there are a few times in a persons life , when you can look back confidently knowing that you did , the right damn thing . as i turned on my heels , glanced backwards knowingly that , their parking lot was the right place to defacate . you wo n't silence my anymore , abraham , hear me roar .	4675
0	went there with a few friends .. the girls are great but be careful .do not get drinks from the girls . i drink jack daniels exclusively and after i tasted it .. i sent it back with the same shit results ... from that point on i got my drinks at the bar . $ 200 to get a friend on stage and embarrass them is crazy high . only use cash .. i gave a card and in 10 minutes the cc company called me with stupid charges . i locked the card and complained that they screwed up my card . the girls were very polite and i 'm sure following orders . ask what something costs first .	4675
1	excellent selection of doors , drawers and bbq 's to choose from . they also have smokers . very good customer service and answer all of your question and even ask you question in making sure it is being hooked up correctly .	4676
1	possibly the best place in the phoenix area where you can by virtually all level of smokers , pellet grills , high end bbq island components , fireplace components and accessories . i 've found mike , the owner , and his team to be very knowledgeable , friendly , and helpful . i just purchased a pellet grill from them , late in the day on sunday . steve , the manager , made sure that the grill was delivered to my home the same day . great service ! if you 're looking for quality grills , smokers , and accessories , these guys will take great care of you .	4676
0	this will be as brief as i can , not sure why i even go into this place ! just there and not one person even acknowledged me ... .no one if i had questions there has not once that i 've been in any one to check and see if they could help ! they 'll stand around and talk to each other and let a person wander around till they leave ! i 'm in the market for a vertical smoker yet no help here this no answers is there a place to get a new pit ?	4676
0	forget about using the phone number to call this place they never pick up - they force you to go down there and in the end your better off buying the merch on the web better prices no mark up and better service	4676
1	i personally believe that this is one of the nicer ge in the area . for some reason the inner-city ones seem dark and dingy . also , i was at the waterworks last month and they are renovating this to make it a market district . if you do n't know , now you know ; )	4677
1	i really enjoy the restaurant in the new market district . i 've been here twice for brunch and both times i 've been extremely satiric with my meals -- i 've had the omelet and the breakfast burrito . the portions are very generous . every table has an electrical socket , and the wifi is free , so it 's a great spot to get some work done too .	4677
1	i love this grocery store . excellent selection of organic produce , a lot of prepared foods , nice salad bar , a decent amount of ethnic groceries separated by style/country , and a great butcher . the cuts of meat here are better than most grocery stores in the area . the only better quality i 've found is at whole foods , but you pay the price for it ! the cashiers are overall friendly . i also frequent the pharmacy and the staff there is very efficient and helpful ! also , there 's a starbucks in the store ! nice touch . : )	4677
1	i 'm a fan of market district ! ! far less pricey than whole paycheck and a lot nicer ! much better variety too ! fresh vegetables and fruit is delicious ! ! ca n't go wrong with their selection of sauces and international foods ! !	4677
1	wow the place was amazing it 's one of the nicest food stores i 've ever seen while traveling . it gets a 5 stars and if your in the area it 's a must stop . i thought it would be really expensive but i got good deals in the deli on giant eagle brand meats and cheeses plus a slice of homemade pizza is only $ 1.99 . i could keep writing but it will do no justice to how nice the place was it 's a must stop if your in that area	4677
1	been to the market district café a couple times for breakfast and it 's been great -- huge delicious portions . i 've had a custom omelet and the breakfast burrito . both were amazing . tonight i stopped for dinner . i had second thoughts because there 's a lot of good choices in the waterworks , but went to market district . i got the salmon . it was incredible -- served over rice with sautéed fresh vegetables . better than anything i could have gotten at a traditional restaurant .	4677
1	all roads into pittsburgh , old and new 28 were blocked on thursday night . traffic followed by the worst rainstorm . i thought well they have food at giant eagle market district . i 'll eat something and wait out the traffic . the serve the best veggie burger i ever had . check it out !	4677
1	i had limited time for dinner . i ran in hoped for the best . i ordered the fish tacos without taco shells and ice tea . $ 13 . not bad . look at this meal that was delivered to my table with a real plate , cloth napkin , and metal silverware . i expected a takeout box and plastic ware . good job giant eagle . i will be back .	4677
0	way over priced , poor value and quality deli ; lots of weirdos hanging around , a lady and kid was kidnapped from this parking lot the buses bring in trasnsients with pity party signs and pan handlers ; go to aldis and trader joes !	4677
0	worst customer service ever at the pharmacy here . ridiculous . no wonder giant eagle customer satisfaction is down seven percentage points this quarter ( thank you , post-gazette ) . avoid at all costs -- inefficient beyond belief . i will not be back .	4677
0	it 's what happens when giant eagle steals its style from whole foods and wegman 's , but does n't do it nearly as well . also , what happened to all the sandwiches ? you ca n't buy any prepared food after 9pm except some chicken in a plastic container anymore . the best ge is the rt 8 one , which still has the `` hot asian bar ''	4677
0	this review is for the pharmacy . very few of the employees are helpful and kind . most will not help you and are quite cranky . i left to go to another even though it 's next door to my home .	4677
0	this is unquestionably the worst giant eagle as far as customer service is concerned . most of the personnel at the customer service desk are condescending and unwilling to help customers . on more than one occasion i have asked to speak with a manager and they call the manager rather than paging the manager . apparently the managers at this giant eagle are not interested in interacting in person with customers . so avoid this giant eagle completely .	4677
0	went to the starbucks inside market district . the lady at the counter had zero personality acted like it was a chore to ask what i wanted . the people after me got their drinks first . very disorganized at this location . and there are bugs flying around in the dessert case . thanks but no thanks .	4677
0	i do n't expect much when i go to s grocery store , but i do expect a grocery store to have fresh bread . they did n't . the grilled cheese made for m my son was burnt black , so i took it back . they gave me another burnt sandwich . they are not buttered either .	4677
0	i 've eaten here several times and they are not very flexible . they ran out of their special in 20 mins and did n't offer any substitute . how hard is jt to make a salad ? how do you run out of that ? you are a grocery store	4677
1	the most amazing cookies ever ! ! white chocolate macadamia is ridiculous . we bought a couple dozen extra and froze them , they 're super good frozen too ! !	4678
1	some of the best cookies i have ever eaten . i am a big fan of oatmeal cookies and my favorite so far is the oatmeal peanut butter chocolate chip ! yummm ! it is a chunky cookie filled with lots of good stuff and tastes like just out of the oven . the owner says they do mail orders and also gluten free . the shop is charming with unique one of a kind items . owner is friendly and welcoming . the shop seems like a comfy place to sit and enjoy your cookie and tea . maybe next time i will try their cookie sundae with ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce .	4678
0	well , trying to figure out what all the hype is about , was able to try the cookies last night and have to say , they are way to dry and crumbly ... after wanting to try this place for years i was very disappointed . cute place , friendly staff , cookies not that great .	4678
0	i was looking to have a cup of coffee today when i was in downtown glendale . i 'm came across coyote oaties . i proceeded to order a coffee . i ordered a black coffee with milk . $ 3.75 for a 16oz ? that 's latte price in my opinion . i asked for it in a mug . no mugs ? srsly ? i quickly realized there was minimal seating options . so got i was stranded outside in 90 degree heat with my $ 3.75 cup of coffee	4678
1	i am a seasonal resident and have been having my nails done all around scottsdale to try and find a favorite and i finally have ! ! ! desert nail spa is not only beautiful and clean the nail technicians are well trained and take great care to make sure you get exactly what you want . you are always recognized immediate at the front desk and made to feel welcome and comfortable . i love to have my nails done in quiet , so the only recommendation i would have is to leave one area `` cell phone free '' so those who want to enjoy the experience peacefully may do so .	4679
1	there is a reason why u see this place rockin on a sunday afternoon , great atmosphere , service , vibe , and of course great pedicures and manicures ! ! 12 pedicure stations and 12 people enjoying the expierence ! i also see 8 manicure stations and 7 of them are full ! plus , people waiting ! great business ! lana is my favorite and my wife loves vivian ! easy , light hearted , clean , smiles , and friendly people ! have i said enough ? just try this place and u will see for yourself !	4679
1	really nice nail salon ! it is big and spacious . very clean in there and i liked how it was almost set up like a bar where you get your nails done ha . i went here with a gift certificate today , it was my first time here . it was actually pretty busy , but they were able to help me right away . i went for sparkly yellow/gold and it turned out pretty ! the lady doing my nails did really good and was friendly . overall a good experience , i would come back .	4679
1	i made an appointment to get a pedicure here based on yelp reviews . i feel like $ 24 for a pedicure is a great price . and while they do try to upsell you , they were n't pushy about it . i did end up getting the callous remover and would get it again , it was very effective . this will become my go-to pedicure spot from now on . bring cash because they have a very small credit card fee . and if you do pay credit , they ask that you tip cash .	4679
1	well . as promised i am updating my review ! i did have better luck this time ( though i asked what everything would cost as we went along ... ) and will be back . my advice is to just make sure that you ask the cost before saying yes to anything . also , they do have wine but if you do n't know that going in , you might not get it . seems like they never mention it or offer a glass so just speak up and ask for one and you 'll be all set .	4679
1	just got my christmas red gel nails and absolutely love this place . great service and very friendly ! !	4679
1	i love this place ! second time here . never a wait despite how busy they are . very clean & friendly . super modern decor . almost like you 're at a `` nail spa bar '' ! great music from lounge to soothing spa ! highly recommend this place .	4679
1	great little find . my first manicure in the us ( recently relocated from uk ) and very pleased with the results . technician was friendly and did a wonderful job . will definitely be going back and trying out different services . the only thing i can really point out is the selection of colours for the gel polish was n't vast but there are some nice shades .	4679
1	love this place . the customer service is superb , the atmosphere is practically spottless and they offer a complimentary adult beverage . only downside , a bit pricey . but worth it . literally the best pedicure i ever had ! i highly recommend !	4679
1	i stopped in while i was in town for business . i did n't have n't time to get my nails done before i headed down there . i got right in and the girl did a quick and fantastic job . that was august 19 . i just took the remaining gel polish off today , 3 weeks to the day without a single chip or blemish . i would have left it , but it was growing out . excellent manicure !	4679
1	vivian did a great job on my nails ! love the atmosphere and the staff was really friendly .	4679
1	best place to relax and get your nails done . really reasonable prices , and they take their time to make sure you are always happy with the results . ps : it 's gorgeous inside !	4679
1	this place is the best . came here on a whim with a friend that lives in the area ( i do not ) and it was amazing . i 've been coming here now religiously and have someone different every time , but all the nail technicians are great , and fast . their new remodeled salon is gorgeous ! definitely give them a try .	4679
1	great pedis . got my last one here and it 's held up well . the customer service is great too . the massage was the perfect amount of time and so relaxing though when she got to the hot stones she merely rubbed one quickly on each leg twice , literally lasted 15 seconds . that disappointed me cause i love the hot stones and i 've never had someone be so lazy with them . other than that it 's great !	4679
1	ask for lee she will take very good care of you ! the entire team does a fantastic job and always assures your satisfaction ! go pamper yourself at this great establishment !	4679
1	found on yelp . wonderful pedicure and fill . extremely efficient . will absolutely come back when i 'm in scottsdale again !	4679
1	this nail spa is the best in phoenix . everyone is so nice . it is clean and very well managed . it is family run and operated and you can tell because they have a lot of pride in their business . i would never go anywhere else !	4679
1	my daughter and i where visiting phoenix for the weekend and came across this beautiful salon . we experienced amazing service ! my nails look great . i loved the decor and ambiance as well .	4679
1	excellent service & mani/ pedi . very clean , friendly , relaxing environment . best foot massage ever ! thank you vivianne !	4679
1	this is the best nail spa in town . i have been going there for 10 years and they consistently do a great job ! no chipping in between pedi 's , great foot massages and nail care . and they always check when i 'm paying to see if i was satisfied with my nail service . desert nail spa is the best ! !	4679
1	nice facility- clean , friendly and well organized . made an appointment online for my daughter and i to get mani/pedi . they were great with her and made sure we sat together . spent $ 100 for the two of us . i highly recommend them . only issue is parking- it 's hard to get a spot close by .	4679
0	beautiful atmosphere with rushed , pushy employees . cute that they put girls up front that are not from abroad but embarrassing that they are condescending to staff that seem to all be vietnamese . embarrassing the way they treat employees .	4679
0	from my understanding these sns manicures are supposed to last 2+ weeks . i 've gotten sns manicures on numerous occasions and they 've lasted me for longer than 2 or sometimes even 3 weeks . not worth the $ 40	4679
0	sadly i used my mother 's day gift card from my son on this place . i walked in happy and looking forward to a `` dip manicure '' and pedicure . the entire experience was terrible the lady did my manicure standing the entire time . she did a horrible rushed job on my pedicure . she was rough and then right before it was tip time she had the nerve to ask for my name . i think they intentionally misprinted the ad to draw business in and then did n't even honor it .	4679
0	this place is not clean ! had my nails done there yesterday but noticed that the nail stations and towels were dirty . my nails look good but if i get fungus i will sue . i wo n't be back .	4679
0	i had a manicure and pedicure here ! the staff very unprofessional ! it was the last hour and they were more concerned about their own nails than customers ! they were applying nail polish for themselves and least concerned about the customers .. pedicure was done just like formality which i could have done at home as well !	4679
0	i had a standing appointment , and i received a call the day before my recent appointment . karen , `` bumped '' my appointment for another patron who had history of booking more appointments than me . very unprofessional and extremely poor customer service . there are too many nail spas who would n't have done such a thing . i will never go back to desert nail spa .	4679
0	had a pedicure from `` nancy '' . she was horrible ! she was an older woman . maybe she was the owner or manager . during my pedicure , she was constantly looking around at everyone to see what they were doing . she never looked at me , never spoke to me . she just slapped my legs every time she wanted me to move . when she was finished , she gave me my ticket & walked away . when i got home my pedicure was all smeared . i will never go there again .	4679
0	today i went into desert nail spa with a coupon , the person at reception told me it was a misprint and could not use it . no other coupon offered just told i could not use . will not return .	4679
0	the absolute worst manicure i 've ever had . nails are filed unevenly , crookedly and got too short from trying to fix them . as a result , my fingers are aching and there is a chunk of nail growing underneath my index finger from filing it incorrectly and going way too short : ( . the only good thing was they voided my transaction without having to ask .	4679
0	had been coming here for over 2 years now , even got a gift card for my birthday since i love it here so much ! the place has always been beautiful but unfortunately this is the second time my gel nails that are suppose to last 14 days lasted only 3 days and completely peeled off by day 6 . i have never experienced this before and was very upset about it . please use better products so people will be come back . measure up to the place you have and do n't got cheap . i would drive up here just for the ambiance and service but it 's not worth it anymore since the products are not top notch .	4679
0	i really liked the atmosphere of the salon but i paid the most i have ever paid for an sns dip manicure and after 4 days it is lifting around the edges . very disappointed that $ 45 got me a manicure that has last such a short time . i tried to contact via the website and i have had no response after 2 days .	4679
0	not a fan . it felt like they tried to get as many people in and out as fast as they could . it was so busy and packed , my pedicure was n't relaxing at all and the pedicure itself was so fast . i have had much better pedicures in the area for the same price . if you want a relaxing experience , do n't go here .	4679
0	this place is fine for a quick pedicure and their online booking is a nice feature , but their gel manicures are awful . the nail techs are so quick to move on to the next client that they pay very little attention to detail . i gave this place a few shots for gel manicures but they were never good . this latest gel mani lasted less than a week before it started chipping on almost every nail . they 're definitely one of the pricier gel manicures in town , too . to top it off , my nail tech sat there and counted the tip i gave her before i had even gotten up from the table .	4679
0	my best friend from denver and i went to this nail salon when she was in town based on the perception that it served wine with a pedicure . nope . we were not even offered bottled water , and while more expensive than those offered by other similar nail salons , the pedicures we received were subpar and our nail techs were not the least bit friendly . there is such a selection of nail salons in this vicinity , i will not be returning the desert nail spa .	4679
0	avoid this place . they do not take any pride in cleanliness . every tool was taken out of her kit and put back in . there was no liner used in the tub and no disinfectant used . i 'm disgusted and horrified . this is how people get foot fungus and very sick . i will never come back here . i wish i had read the last review in this page before coming .	4679
0	spa chairs are older and in need of replacement . been a client for many years , seems they are making alot more $ $ $ and becoming not as customer service oriented . some rude technicians/staff .	4679
0	i got a full set and a pedicure . both ladies seemed very annoyed and in a rush . and as a result , my nails honestly looked better when i walked in than when i walked out . will not be returning . i want to have a good experience , not just mediocre for the money i am paying .	4679
0	went to get gel nails the other day . they did a very sloppy job . nails lifted after the first day and white tips were very uneven . will never go back .	4679
0	fungus city ! will never go again . so many workers , feel like a number . 1/10. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -	4679
0	terrible experience . was very rushed and not even enjoyable . the foot massage was maybe 5 minutes . my nails were uneven . definitely not going back .	4679
0	i really wanted to like this place . i get a pedicure every month or so and decided to try some new places just for fun . great reviews and cute place but the pedicure was terrible . i do n't have a `` regular '' gal here but still ... it should be good . my gal was rough , cut my nails unevenly , left nail polish around the nails , the massage was painful and rushed ... when i got home i had to recut a few nails and tidy up by removing excess polish around my toenails . all-in-all it looked like a 7 year old did my nails ! not a pleasant or relaxing experience . *sigh*	4679
1	i got a keratin treatment from ashley and the results were absolutely incredible . i have naturally really curly hair and it 's been over 2 months and my hair still dries straight . and when i blow dry it , it turns out pin straight ! soooo worth the $ $ $ , the best person i 've been to for this type of treatment . this review is sooo long over due , but even months later my hair still looks bomb and frizz-less .	4680
1	my stylist is cassie and she does such a great job with my hair and my hair extensions ! love the way they look and feel . she stays on top of all my future appointments , so that i do n't miss a beat with my hair . i 've been going here for almost a year and i could n't be happier ! call and ask for cassie for your hair extensions .	4680
1	i had the best experience at bomb hair 2 ! ! ! my favorite and talented hair stylist i recommend everyone to go to is monterey ! she is the best hands down . she can turn a terrible hair do into a beautiful amazing hair do and make you walk out of there feeling brand new ! i hope everyone reading this books your appointment with her and has the best experience as i did ! jaclyn	4680
1	got my hair done here by tammy & she is amazing ! super friendly and she knew exactly what to do with my hair . also the price is reasonable : )	4680
1	i was a walk-in and i 'm so thankful to have dominique as my stylist ! she did an amazing job ! my hair was blue/green and i wanted to make it normal with a hint of pop . oh boy did she deliver , not only does my hair feel awesome ; but it looks like a million bucks ! ! ! i finally found my hairdresser !	4680
0	the worst color job anyone has ever done on my hair ! ! ! ! it ruined my extensions . the color began to fade ( after aprox.3 washes ) into a weird brassy color , so if that 's the look you are going for and you do n't mind getting overcharged ( ask for anna the co-owner ) then that 's the place for you .	4680
0	i started going to this hair salon about a year ago or so . at first the service was great my stylist was amazing . however when the salon apparently changed management the customer service went out the window . the few stylists that were there , that are amazing , have since switched salons . unfortunately now the stylists that are employed there are very inexperienced . i am not the only one unhappy with the service at bomb hair 2 . a few of my friends have also stopped going there . i do not recommend this salon to anyone .	4680
0	one of my worst hair experiences here . i went here to get my hair done . it was horrible and my hair was fried and ruined . did n't even get a fraction of what i wanted . and spent a butt ton of money . i 've heard it 's hit or miss with this salon . i guess i did n't get lucky . because of this experience i 'll just do my own hair and probably never set foot in a salon again . i just ca n't seem to find a good salon in town . over it	4680
0	this salon had good reviews so i booked an appointment and got diana . she was very sweet but i should have done my research before , not everyone can execute hair color . i was overcharged and was very unhappy with my results .	4680
0	it 's like playing russian roulette here . who 's going to get a bad haircut today ... butchered my hair , you do n't mess with a lady 's hair , will not be returning .	4680
1	nice , clean , well stocked 7-11 . their floors are always dazzling clean . the staff is pretty nice as well . always polite , even during the early morning hours when i pick up my red bulls to help me get through my day . 2 for 1 doughnuts are splendid as well ! get them fresh = )	4681
1	every time i go into this 7-11 it is very clean . the associates here are also always friendly . i would have to say this is my favorite 7-11 not to mention slurpees are the best tasting thing to ever grace our presence on planet earth . thank you slurpees .	4681
0	apparently they close because the worker just waved me off sitting on a chair outside .	4681
0	the owner of this location has decided that he will not accept 7-eleven coupons that were sent to me directly by 7-eleven . so i guess he 's not a `` real '' 7-eleven . after all the money my family has dropped there , we will be going to green valley grocery in the shell station directly across the street . they have slurpees also . he got to keep his dollar bag of 7-eleven chips that i had a free coupon for . i do n't frequent stores that have no respect for their customers !	4681
1	this is my go-to grocery store . outstanding customer service but a little pricey on some items .	4682
1	i usually hate grocery shopping , but this fry 's is different . you walk in , they offer sushi samples they have the best selection of any of the fry 's i 've been too they have 8 self check out machines , and its quick check out , even when its grocery store rush hour . the pharmacy is quick and the staff were patient and friendly plenty of parking.. really everything thing you want in a grocery store .	4682
1	while i tend to get lost in the new frys grocery store , the customer service has been exceptional . i forgot my fry 's card ... .i forgot to use a coupon that came with a bottle of wine ... harry ( the self check out attendee ) noticed , found a frys card and he got me quite a nice refund !	4682
0	horrible customer service rude pharmacy people esp barabra would not do her job had to travel down to mill and southern where the pharmacy took 4 minutes to fix the issue that she could not even bothered never shopping there again horrible	4682
0	weevils ! ! ! ! ! i 've been burned twice now with weevil infested products.. i wonder how many weevils i 've unknowingly ate.. bought a ribeye from there that tasted like ammonia once also.. there 's a nice old lady that works the register , thus the one star..	4682
0	over 20 minutes of calling this place trying to get a hold of someone . i have tried 5 different departments . there 's not much else to say because i never did get anyone to pick up the phone . you 're awful , the end .	4682
1	been here so many times ! every time was good , whether it being service or friendliness . food could be better ... but once you 're buzzed , any shizz taste good.. lol	4683
1	i have been coming to take one since high school . always a good time with happy hour and night time service . just found out they expanded the happy hour recently from 1-9pm daily and the price is still $ 10 per person including 2 non alcoholic drinks . i come more often for night time and you usually need to spend a minimum to get a room but is totally affordable when you share with friends . you can use the budget to spend on alcohol ( like the new flavours soju ) or food ( my fav is the cuttlefish balls and instant noodle ) .	4683
1	discovered a new karaoke place after mix2 was closed . place had been around since 1994 and was n't very full on a sunday afternoon . 10 $ from 1-9 with two drinks included . song selection was fair with new hits ad well as japanese , korean , english and chinese songs . checking in gives you a basket of chicken wings and snacks range from 2 $ + . i would definitely come here again soon because of the value ~	4683
1	i actually want to give 6 stars for the place . had a birthday party and everything was just awesome . love the app for selecting songs on the phone . everyone had so much fun . the service was the best from the beginning till we left .	4683
1	awesome service - love the digital ktv app that everyone can search songs on their phones . newly renovated rooms with great service . do n't forget to check in using yelp - you get a free basket of wings	4683
1	happy hour was awesome . good service and song selection . it included two non alcoholic drinks and we got wings through the yelp app . the sound system is controlled through an app which is very convenient .	4683
1	been here numerous times . friendly staff and will try to accommodate you as best as possible . happy hour until 9pm ( starts 1 pm ? ) for $ 10 a person ( includes 2 basic drinks ) . what a great deal ! they also gave you a coupon for one person free on next visit . on one visit , other people 's voices were broadcasted in our room for a few seconds intermittently - perhaps something to do with the signal . not too big a deal ( maybe 3-5 times an hour on average ) we had a good laugh over it .	4683
0	what is the point of having smoking and non smoking rooms if the vents are all connected and we are filled with second hand fumes in the non smoking room ? equipment is buggy and songs are n't as updated .	4683
0	what the hell did my buddy drink ? flaming lamborghini ? how bout flaming corolla . this place might as well be closed .	4683
0	bad service . not a great selection of music . the food was pretty bad too and the drinks were made like whoever made it gave no shits . it 's a cheap price for what you get i guess but this is definitely not a great place .	4683
0	we ( 4 people ) spent almost $ 200 for the smallest room for about 3 hours ! the staff kept selling us alcohol and the price is not what we had agreed . worst experience ever !	4683
0	worst karaoke lounge in markham . washrooms are gross and always out of toilet paper . sound system always has issues . rooms are old and dirty . the only thing i like is that it has many rooms and it 's kinda like a maze in there .	4683
0	this place sucks ... aint got shit ... ordered 5 dishes ... waiter came back and say we dont have anything ... .how the hell ya run a business without so many things missing on the menu ... .wtf ! ! ! ! ! if i can give a negative star i will but yelp does not have those function ... ..i wad forced to give one star ... ..	4683
0	i saw the 3.5 stars so i tried here . very old and low song ordering system.. ca n't believe the good reviews ... and the waitress was so rude . do n't spend your time here .	4683
1	pulled in with an undriveable car ( turned out the brake caliper was loose ) on my way through town . they got it up on the rack in 15 minutes , replaced a missing bolt , checked and tightened the same bolt on the other side , and did n't charge me ( beyond the $ 22 . inspection fee ) . friendly , polite and really helpful to the traveler ! thanks guys !	4684
1	john is simply one of the best car mechanics i 've ever worked with . he 's a straight shooter . he showed me the issues with my suv is and showed me the cost of the parts and explained labor charges . his problem solving and willingness to look into alternative solutions to fixing my ac saved me hundreds of dollars . my bill was reasonable and the work was done in a timely fashion . overall the communication from everyone at midas on university was exceptional . i took in another car after zimbrick eastside said the front brakes needed replacing i will be taking my cars to john as long as he works there .	4684
0	this place is a joke . i took my jeep into them because the brake pedal was going all the way to the floor . they charged me for new pads and rotors , and when i left it still did the same thing . when i took it back , the manager offered to drain the lines for free , and when that did n't work , he goes , `` oh well , probably something in your abs '' . you think they could have told me that before i shelled out $ 400 . thanks a lot asshole .	4684
0	thanks midas for requesting to speak with me on yelp and then not following through with a phone call . i can see now that the great business practices come straight from the top .	4684
1	i am a regular at quail dry cleaning in highland creek ; it 's close to my house and their hours are convenient . i have never had an issue anything i 've taken in , and i feel like they do a quality job . the staff is nice , prices are reasonable , and service is excellent .	4685
1	love this cleaner . we used the one near our old house and we were happy with them . so when we moved into our new house i made a point of going to this one , not near my house but i would rather deal with someone i am used to . service is fast and they do a great job !	4685
0	dry cleaning cost : fall coat - $ 15 , tuxedo shirt - $ 5 , sport coat - $ 8 . i expected it to be high but this is egregious . you pay when you pick up your stuff and now i see why .	4685
0	prices for drying cleaning business suits extremely high $ 25/per suit-unacceptable . will find another cleaner	4685
1	bill , the mgr . offers excellent customer service . went in for a oil change and they found a leak on a radiator hose . they do a through check with their oil changes , was shown where the leak was and my resivoir was empty . no scams here this business is very trust worthy . give the guy a raise	4686
1	in and out in 30 minutes to get my tire patched . also received $ 10 off for joining their reward program .	4686
0	walked in and there are 4 people standing around , one on the phone 2 on a computer trying to figure out something , and the 4th person walked in from the shop area . not a single person greeted me , or acknowledged i was there , i would of probably waited if someone would at least said `` hi welcome , it will be just a moment '' walked right out after just a minute of awkwardly standing there .	4686
0	horrible service ! ! ! ended up bringing in the car for an oil change and the window regulator- should have been 200 out the door- ended up costing us 700+ and 6 days without my car . thought that was the end of the issues now come to find out that the ac wire was damaged and the oil plug and pan were both damaged during the oil change ! ! never again ! !	4686
1	very nice atmosphere here . very chill , open , comfortable vibe . pricing was great for the quality of the coffee which was a great caffeine boost ! seating is limited so i can see it clone coming packed at peak hours , but overall it has a very homey feel great for a sit down coffee and chat .	4687
1	great service ! and they serve unsweetened lattes , which is just a relief as i usually get some overly sweet syrup in my milk when i ask for a latte .	4687
1	love this place ! ! ! this area needs an independant great and friendly place like this ! ! love the music they play ! ! and the coffee is fabulous ! also the best muffins around even vegan . so good .	4687
0	i passed by this little shop a few times and finally decided to give them a try ... the atmosphere is gorgeous , but the product nothing special ... i bought a coffee which was warm and i asked the 2 ladies ( a big boned asian and a little gothic indian girl with a nosering ) that it was lukewarm ... i was offered another coffee only less warmer than the previous one . i returned the coffe and said `` dont worry about it '' . they never cared or asked to brew a fresh batch or giving me a refund , but instead just ignored me . i left quitely and vowed to never return	4687
0	cute coffee shop ! unfortunately they do n't carry any decaf espresso or brewed coffee .	4687
0	not sure if i will go back . passed it on the way to somewhere else and was curious as the decor is nice ( laid back , comfy yet trendy ) but i found a hair in my cheesecake brownie ! yuck ! i think the treat would have been better as a brownie or cheesecake but was a bit of a miss as both ( living up to neither food experience ) .	4687
1	today i found my small town garage and from the looks of the cars in the bay i am not the only one . mr tire was just what i was looking for . they were cordial and very attentive to my needs . they fixed my tire for free for my first time visit assited me in getting a credit line so i can have my car repaired there and it right down the street from my townhome . everyone was pleasant and the repait was quick . this is where i will be taking my car from now on .	4688
1	this place has changed names several times since i 've been going here . however the great customer service has never changed . honesty , reliability and competitive prices will ensure i continue to keep going here . would recommend .	4688
0	visited shop with a discount coupon for a wheel alignment . was told it would be $ 84 . several minutes later it became $ 100 with the discount . i declined . i went to precision tune in pineville and got a discounted alignment for $ 69 with no hassle ! .	4688
0	pitiful . first of all they called after my car was in to tell me they had to order the oil filter ? wtf ? then after waiting a half hour as the only car they ca n't get the oil plug out . what a joke . ca n't take the oil plug off ?	4688
1	i have been going to cabarrus eye center for the last twenty years and see dr. harper . i go annually and he is always kind , thorough , and addresses any concerns . i would recommend him highly as well as any of the physicians at cabarrus eye . the ladies in the contact lenses department are also very responsive and patient friendly . i had issues in the last year with my contacts and cabarrus eye worked me in quickly and as always took care of my needs .	4689
1	i have been coming to cabarrus eye center for many , many years . the wait is usually long , especially in the afternoon . the way to fix that is to book your appointment for first thing in the morning . i feel dr. harper takes time to answer my questions and explains things in terms i can understand without a medical degree . thank you for such excellent service !	4689
0	there are some well-qualified , very gifted physicians there -- but you pay a high price getting to one . the clinic is the most impersonal place you 'll ever have the misfortune of visiting . you feel exactly like a part on an assembly line at cec . horrible place . you feel devalued .	4689
0	one of our boys ran out of contacts . it 's the end of school- he has tests and soccer club tryouts . i do n't want to pull him out of a pertinent class to get to the eye doctor when his grades count for college . they will not refill the contacts to last until our next appointment which is in two weeks . it puts our son in a difficult position . of course i made the first mistake which was rescheduling the yearly exam , but i thought it would n't be a big deal- just get him to summer time . we will not be back to this place .	4689
1	i love when they have their 50 % off sales because i 'm always finding things that i miss out on , on ebay i really enjoy the store and they really have some great employees there .	4690
1	i love to see all of the new styles and seasonal colors on display . it truly makes me happy . the very best part is the sale wall all the way to the back . it 's a glorious oasis of size 4 's just waiting for me to come by and pluck them , like ripened grapes from the vine : ) delightful ! this actual location is n't as fantastic as the one at the south outlets , but it 's good enough for me : )	4690
0	shoes are very nice but please stay away from the socks . it 's does look good but the feeling suck . it 's keep slipping down to the middle of my feet when i walk . and also left a uncomfortable mark after couple hours using it . look at my picture below .	4690
0	so the manager of the actual store ( victoria estrada ) contacted me via email on 4/22 and stated `` we take consumer issues very seriously and always strive for an amazing experience in our stores . '' i replied to her request for information by advising her i had already provided it to the corporate office . i have n't heard back from her . it 's been 10 days . so apparently they do n't take consumer issues seriously .	4690
1	dr. rosenzweig is amazing ! excellent bedside manner and a fantastic mohs surgeon ! i would highly recommend her to anyone needing surgery , general dermatology , or cosmetic dermatology . she is a botox and filler magician- a stranger asked me if son was my husband , i look awesome .	4691
1	i came here for the first time for a skin check . i did n't wait long at all . everyone was very friendly and it was all very organized . my doctor was friendly and answered all my questions . i got what i needed done . i had to call back the next day to ask a question and i left a vm . i was called back in an hour . so far so good !	4691
1	miscommunication but all worked out for the best of all involved . i 'm very pleased with the outcome	4691
1	highly recommend dr mantooth ! this office is clean , professional , and the front desk and dr 's assistants are all very knowledgeable and friendly .	4691
1	i turned to them when i had a massive acne attack at the end of high school and then again in my early 20 's ( i am still in my early 20 's ) . i went to dr. mccleod both times and after a couple months my face was lovely and smooth . i have gotten great results on both occasions . i only wish i had gone in sooner so i could have done without those few months of painful cystic acne that ruined my face and confidence . i would recommend them to any of my friends for acne treatments . i do not know about the surgery as i have not had any procedures done .	4691
0	i will never go back to ppsd - all they care about is money , not the patient . i paid my bill upon leaving the office , then i get a statement in the mail months later stating i owe more - they say it was my insurance company that says i should pay more ! whatever the reason , dr. yanez was in and out within 2 minutes for a full body check..that is so unprofessional . he must be able to see 30 patients an hour going that fast ! suggest one find a smaller practice and not go to big groups of physicians in order to get better attention and service .	4691
0	dr yanez was rude , short tempered & rushed us through.. offended patient & spouse . he was supposedly behind schedule per nurse but not our fault . btw , patient 75 yr old vietnam vet with melanoma from agent orange . can not recommend . we need a new doctor ! does n't deserve one star .	4691
0	i wish i would of had the opportunity to be seen . but i was called and rescheduled not once but twice . i had already requested the time off of work . it seems that the patients time is not of value to them . very disappointing .	4691
0	this clinic refuses to file routine yearly well visits to the dermatologist as general wellness which my insurance will pay for the office visit if filed . i talked with my insurance company who advised me to just have them refile with the office visit coded for general wellness ( preventative ) .there insurance department employee named heather said no she would not . she told me that my insurance company was wrong . i have been having routine yearly dermatology check ups for over 15 years and all have been covered and filed as preventative wellness . too bad as i liked the doctor mantooth but will not return for followup since they refuse to submit the insurance code as they should .	4691
0	after being a patient for several years , i found myself in need of a refill of a simple psoriasis treatment that i have been using for some time . because i have not been in to see the doctor in more than 12 months ( clinic cancelled the apt ) , they would not refill . they said i had to come in for a follow up . kicker , i am deploying with the army reserves to afg in a few days , and obviously can not make an office visit . thanks for sending me overseas prepared . looking for another dermatologist ...	4691
1	my favorite dottys . kelly on swing shift during the week is easily one of the nicest , outgoing and friendly clerks in town . she welcomes me every time by my first name , knows what i drink and makes every visit enjoyable .	4692
1	having a bad night so came here to get away from everything . the gentleman working tonight is absolutely amazing . he kept checking on everyone to make sure they were okay . i won pretty big and he watched me walk to and get in my car to make sure i was okay . i only regret not getting his name i 'd like to call and let the manager know what great service i received at this location . oh well , i 'll be back !	4692
0	no customer service in 45min . ( anyone ) i use to go there at least a few times a month and have great service but now it 's like the strip and not treated like a local . very sadden by the way everyone was treated tonight	4692
0	horrible ! ! brittney johnson is a scammer and a lier do not go to or do any business with dotty 's ! !	4692
1	staff and was friendly and paid me better than another local store . i also like shopping here , but you do have to carefully inspect items as i have seen faint stains on some . they have great sales though and i 've found several like new , name brand items .	4693
1	good selection . well laid out ... just not very stroller friendly in some places . fair prices and pays cash for items to consign ! love to come here !	4693
1	this store was a relief after dealing with the horrible customer service at the park road location . i 'm glad that i went here and gave this organization a second chance . the lady with the longer blond hair was very sweet and efficient . she gave me all that i needed . thank you for treating me well ! i will never go back to park road location with customer service rep ( erica and derica ) . but will go back to this location , keep up the good work !	4693
0	i wish that they checked the clothes more thoroughly , i am constantly finding stains ( `` water spots '' , holes , food , formula ) on items that i pick up in the racks . the prices can be crazy , for example sub par gymboree outlet clothing priced more then retail . lack of toys for boys ages 4-10 . it always comes across to me that no one over 20 is running this store , their customer service and southern hospitality is lacking . i also had an entire rack of clothes fall down on me , it was overloaded .	4693
0	i was disheartened by the small amount of money paid for brand name clothes we took in . it was a waste of time and a joke . i took back somethings we had just bought this year from them and they would not even take those back . i agree , something has changed and it is not worth the gas to take your clothes there anymore .	4693
0	i gave them 1 star because there was n't a no star option . the absolute worst customer service from the young ladies working there . there was no greeting , no other customers , and no courtesy . one of the ladies was smoking in the front door way when we entered , and during check out , the other asked if i had a pen to sign my receipt . to top it off they were walking around without any shoes . i guess no shoes no ( customer ) service !	4693
1	see da'vante . wow . fairly new therapist but was truly one of the best massages i 've ever had in 10 yrs of getting massages . his touch was amazing , extremely relaxing , specific , and intuitive . 10 stars for this guy ! ! ! daniel is exceptional he will listen to what you need and is very accommodating . he is a very kind intuitive person . he gives great pressure and is skilled .	4694
1	love this place ! i always walk out feeling amazing ! great customer service and a convenient location !	4694
1	i hate the pain but i love the way i feel after james gets done with me . i wo n't go to anyone else . i like the membership plan it 's not a bad price and the staff is very friendly and quick to assist . location is great and is hours are convenient . pay these guys a visit and ask for james : )	4694
1	just finished my massage with bobbi , she was amazing . very kind and amazing at what she does . the perfect amount of pressure , and it was very thorough for the entire 90 mins . i 've had many massages before , she is by far the best i 've ever had . if you are looking for a great therapist bobbi is the one to see . i 'll be back in a couple of weeks to see her again ! ! thanks bobbi -dana	4694
1	absolutely fantastic . it was my first massage ever and it was amazing . the receptionist were very helpful , nice and not too pushy when it came to memberships . and james the therapist did an amazing job . he was very calm , knowledgable and did a fantastic job . any knots i had in my bad were gone and there is no more tension either . i will definitely be going back monthly . also when you get checked in you sit in a very comfortable and aromatic waiting room where they offer you water or hot tea complimentary which was an awesome touch . the rooms are very clean and organized . no hassle , no worry , and an awesome experience .	4694
1	great massage with anna ! ! ! ! in town for a quick weekend from cali and they fit me right in even though i am not a member . very pleasant and accommodating !	4694
1	anna is awesome ! i like her technique . the rest of the folks here are nice ad pretty laid back . they take care of me when i am there . the lobby is clean and zen-like . they always work with me so i can see my therapist . my husband is a former massage therapist and calls massage envy the `` walmart of massage . '' i honestly do n't feel that way here . i think they are good at what they do . i recommend this location and anna !	4694
1	prices are fair for the most part and you 're able to get an appointment fairly quickly . i 've been here a couple times and was happy with my massage .	4694
1	this place is awesome ! i called last minute to see if they had any 90min massage appointments available ... & within 30 minutes i was laying on a table ready to relax ! noel gave the best massage i 've ever received . everyone was so helpful , upbeat , & friendly ! i ca n't wait to come back again . thank you for making my service personalized !	4694
1	the customer service was great ! it was my first massage and they made me feel comfortable and they were very knowledgable . i had nikki who did a great job hitting my stress spots .	4694
1	i 'm visiting from out of town and i needed to get a massage to get back massage in because it was hurting from my travels . so i called four other locations before i found one that had openings . i 'm a massage envy member so i use my massages world wide as i travel on business and leisure . i had a great experience at this location . my therapist was name tat . he did a wonderful job , focused on my neck , shoulders and back like i asked . the entire location was very clean and welcoming . i would recommend this location to everyone while in this area .	4694
1	been to several envys in multiple states . this one is newly remodeled and looks great ! the staff and therapist are very friendly . the remodel is very well done . let your contractor know they did an excellent job on the project . cant wait to see the other stores get the new look ! !	4694
1	i have been a member at this location for years and have tried a number of therapists . without a doubt , paula is absolutely the best ! she gets 5 stars from me each and every time . she an incredible therapist , the consummate professional .	4694
1	great place and easy to schedule . i have gone to many massage therapists and this place continues to impress especially for the price . i recommend . btw : just like any massage place you have to tell them what you want in terms of pressure and where and where not to massage .	4694
0	an update on my previous review . the first time we booked a massage since we reinstated our membership and they cancelled on us again ! so frustrating .	4694
0	i could have massaged myself better with one hand . the decor is not inviting , really plain and clinical feeling , i prefer a plushy and comfy warm feeling atmosphere . the therapist did not use any pressure and did the same stroke up and down my entire body even though i requested deep tissue . then they try and sell you a package which is bullshit . i would not waste my time at this place .	4694
0	beware of darren , the manager who will threaten you with collections even when you do n't owe them any money and who will refuse to give you his name when you ask for it and will hang up on you when you insist . if you want to join massage envy , go to a different facility . keep your blood pressure low . avoid darren . and if you 're wondering how i got his name ? i had to call my home facility to call this facility to find out his name . yes . seriously .	4694
0	massage therapists very but are usually okay . not great . the location . and i have not been to any others is horrible . canceling your membership is a nightmare . hard to reach on the phone and there automated services are useless .	4694
0	the massage was okay . i just hate being pressured into memberships . it 's hard to resist after getting a massage because you 're so light headed . you ca n't really think straight . all i really wan na do is-go in , get massage/relax , and pay and get the f out . i do n't need you stressing me out , trying to push a membership on me . over all my experience was alright . i 'm sure there 's better .	4694
0	i have gone to other spas and i have to say for what you pay not good . the water they give is room temp . the therapist take you back when they get to it . i had a 3 pm appointment got to go back at 310 and did n't get full hour got harassed when i was done for membership . said no and the lady up front had attitude . i will pay for the membership and hand a stone instead less pushy and the therapist i had was better all around out at lone mountain and scottsdale road . no more massage envy for me .	4694
0	do not sign a contract with this spa . i thought i had everything settled by canceling due to a move . however , they continued to charge my account for months . now i am in the hassle of trying to recover those expenses . what a waste of my time for people who ca n't keep their word .	4694
0	sitting in the waiting room listening to a bunch of girls loud gossiping when this is supposed to be a relaxing place . i do n't want to hear about nipple and boyfriends after a long day of work and paying to relax . very disappointing experience !	4694
0	this may have been the lamest massage i have ever had and i get them regularly . being from out of town , this spot happen to be convenient . first , i called for the appointment and they asked if i wanted deep tissue- i did . so they gave me a choice of therapists . the guy i got either did not do deep tissue or massage envy does n't know what deep tissue is . either way , lousy experience . a rub down with no deep pressure on the paraspinous muscles . he kept asking if the pressure was ok ? there was no pressure !	4694
0	the staff is completely incompetent . friendly but incompetent . ive had problems multiple times and received horrible customer service .	4694
0	do n't get sucked into contract with massage envy moon valley - their services have really gone down hill . the atmosphere is far from relaxing , it is a cold corporate experience , the staff just going through the motions -- and not well . as a long time member , my experiences have steadily declined . in addition , after complaining , they do not stand behind their product . unhappy customers are offered the run around instead of a quality massage or acceptable solution . you , the patron , are stuck ! t do yourself a favor . pass	4694
0	just further customer service issues ... sent an e-mail to massage envy as requested from the previous business response . i received an e-mail a couple days later explaining that it was simply a bad match between me and my masseuse . they wanted a good time to call my phone and discuss further . i replied within an hour . it 's been a month and i 've not received another e-mail or phone call . the poor communication just goes on and on .	4694
0	ok massage . not very relaxing atmosphere . i could hear the music in the room next to me ans the toilet flushing three rooms away , also , the staff kept walking by the door chatting . also , i hate being pressures into memberships ... they give an ok massage if you do n't mind all the noise or pressure to sign up .	4694
0	the front staff is amazing and helpful in every way . and went into deep detail about how it would all happen . now my masseuse on the other than must have not gotten the memo , because when i told her i needed more attention to my neck and shoulders , she spent little to no time on my neck and shoulders , unacceptable in my book for those prices .	4694
1	excellent , fast , reasonably priced , dependable cleaning and alterations every time . my white shirts always come back pure white ! i have been coming here since 2009 . they are especially good at making difficult sewing repairs , and always for a very reasonable price . cleaning time is 2 days , ready on day 2 between 4 and 5p . most simple alterations are made within 3 or 4 days , up to 1 week for more advanced repairs like zipper replacements . i give them a triple a+ rating and 5 full stars ! try them .	4695
1	best cleaners and alterations in las vegas . five star service ***** . the prices are reasonable , i trust them with my dry cleaning , and they do expert alterations . nice people : )	4695
0	i came here to fix my dress and also hem my husbands pants the guy that works there is so rude i asked if they did alterations he did n't answer me so i thought that was weird . i asked him again he said ok weird i put on my dress to measure it and my husband tried his . when we picked it up it was to short and my husbands pants were to tight he took so much off he did n't even care charge us and did n't say sorry . my poor dress and pants of his ca n't wear anymore i will be calling someone . i would go somewhere else	4695
0	one employee ruined this place for me . he refused to mark my stained shirts , and of course they all came back still stained . he was then defensive and started arguing with me ... the paying customer ! i would rather visit a friendly business where i get service with a smile , and not have to deal with arrogant , rude , argumentative , and lazy people !	4695
1	i came here for the first time recently on the recommendation of a friend . although i called in advance , i still had to wait half an hour . i could tell they were trying to rush , as they did the polish of my hands and toes while sitting in the massage chair , and forgot to put a base layer on my toes . i suspect things would be better if i did n't come during a peak time . at $ 25 , you really ca n't complain ! ( for the record , ivy nails is one of the more sanitary looking nail places in the junction ! )	4696
1	i recently got a shellac mani/pedi and let me say i was quite happy with the service . i love the massage chair , best so far and the lady that was doing my mani/pedi did a great job on massaging my legs and feet , i only wish i could have a bit more of that ! she was very detailed on cutting my cubicles and cleaning underneath my nails and since i 'm a florist , that matters to me . as for the shellac polish , its been 5 days now and it still looks amazing . i think i just found my new go to mani/pedi place .	4696
1	ivy is the absolute best . i 've been going to ivy since before she opened his place . she 's always amazing . the salon is clean and welcoming and you really ca n't go wrong with a $ 25 mani/pedi combo	4696
1	the girls do a great job and have taken me within 20 minutes every time i 've walked in . there is a tv to entertain you , and some wild massage chairs if you 're looking for a pedicure . they are not all super talkative but that 's how i prefer it . as far as i 've seen , you can not beat the price , speed and quality of their shellac manicure or regular pedicures .	4696
1	this place is seriously as good as it gets for 3 reasons . 1 . price is really competitive . a mani is only 8 bucks , and a shellac manicure is only $ 20 ! ! ! 2 . tons of colour selection . when i saw tons , i really mean it . took me almost 10 minutes to decide on a colour . so many pretty colours 3 . very clean salon when i came there was already a group of regulars in , the employees were quite friendly . the only downside is because it 's located in the junction , you will need to find parking . definitely recommend this place . i already got tons of compliments on my manicure .	4696
1	i 'm a huge fan of ivy nails . compared to all the other nail salons in the junction , ivy takes her time and is actually an artist . not to mention , she has great taste . i usually just tell her to `` pick my colour '' . love that woman , love this place . ca n't recommend enough !	4696
0	the vibe to this place is very unwelcoming and the lady i had ( seems to be the boss ) was very rude . i will never go back here .	4696
0	my waxing was not done properly , it is cheap but the service is rude and i was left with a job interview for next day and no eyebrows . this happened two weeks ago and im still mad at the situation . probably the main business which is nails is good , but people be aware that this is not the place to get your wax done .	4696
0	do n't get acrylic nails done here . i usually go to lucy nails but they were n't available that day . i asked for acrylic refill and ended up with bumpy unevenly textured nails . the girl did not shave off the original acrylic enough before putting on the refill so therefore it resulted in the new layer not bonding well with what was underneath . and therefore it was bumpy and uneven . i '' m not sure about their other services but do n't get acrylic from ivy 's .	4696
0	you should never get acrylics here ... it was advertised $ 15 but they charged me $ 25.i went to pick my colour and it took a few minutes , told the lady i was done and she said to wait ( i waited half an hour ) . there were not organized at all . my nails were mushy , cuticles untouched ... i think you get what you pay for..	4696
0	i just got a mani and pedi from this establishment . the service was polite but definitely lacking in skill . granted i have not had a pedicure in a couple years . but i would expect that at least the dry skin on my heels would be taken care of if i am paying for this service . i left with pretty nails and what i thought were soft feet ... until i got home and removed my socks to see that my heels were just the way they were before i went in . only paid $ 25 plus tax and a $ 5 tip . but even that was too much . will never go back to waste my money there again .	4696
0	this place is great when ivy does your nails but totally crappy when you get one of the other girls . just came for a birthday manicure and left with cuticle cuts and no polish because the girl butchered my nails so badly . really disappointing .	4696
1	i had a great experience here . the sales lady tashika was very nice and helpful . she was willing to work with my budget and made good recommendations . the management also honored the ticketed sale price even though the sale was over which showed me they cared about more than money !	4697
1	this is store i believe is mainly geared toward black women , and girls . though it is owned by people of asian decent it 's all young african american women . they are usually kind and very helpful . though there is always one in particular who seems she 's to good to help others . they have a wide variety of things in this store . ranging from cosmetics , beauty appliances , jewelry , fashion apparel , and all things hair . they have a specific section for wigs . and usually have good sales . they also have a in-store salon that has a wide variety of services .	4697
1	great customer service . overwhelmed with all the products in the store . had a young lady assist me to match the right hair colour for clip in hair extensions i was after . found a great sale and i was very happy with the outcome	4697
0	these people will not do in-store credits even if the product is defective , and returned within 14 days . happy to take your money while treating you like a criminal , and will not return it even when it 's the right thing to do ( they have a very specific and narrow definition of `` defective '' that no other reasonable human beings would utilize ) . buyers beware .	4697
0	went there yesterday to check out wigs with the wife . the lady manning the wigs section was very uncooperative and seemed like she was having the worst day . she seemed happy chatting with her co workers but when we approached to ask , sudden change of mood . seemed like she was n't happy being asked about the products she was selling . the men 's clippers section was good , though i did n't need any help around that . staff there need to be trained more to handle customers . if it was possible to give a no star rating , i would .	4697
0	yikes . they sold me a unit ( diana ashanti ) that had huge gaps between the tracks , which i did n't notice because the demo unit was n't styled , but left in its natural texture ( which imo does n't look good on most people ) . incredibly deceiving ! i got home and styled the unit.. upon further inspection : half the tracks were cut 1-2 '' from the weave , so it was only half the amount of hair of a typical wig . no exchange , no store credit . might as well light your money on fire !	4697
1	best price easy return adjusted bill	4698
1	no lines to wait in , counter clerk was pleasant , offered to sell me the extras but was not pushy . very quick process . the clerk in the garage was very helpful and friendly . the minivan was clean smelled nice and handled very nicely . will absolutely pick alamo next time i am in pittsburgh .	4698
1	it was super easy pick-up & drop-off with alamo , really pleased with how friendly the service was , how quickly i was checked in and then also how easy it was to get my car and drive off . i also got a water bottle . i 'm also glad that i took the option to fill up gas from them - the cost per gallon was $ 2.21 gallon and the cost at the nearest gas station was $ 2.46 so definitely more cost effective . would totally recommend using alamo at pittsburgh airport ! note : # 315 of yelp 100 challenge for 2016	4698
1	alamo helped save the day when our flight home to detroit was cancelled and instead of being stuck for 4 additional days , we caught a flight to pittsburgh . our original rental place had left for the night but luckily alamo was open until 1am . they got us a car quickly and large enough for our party of six . it was great when we still had a four hour drive in the middle of the night .	4698
1	i rented a car for two weeks . i received a last minute deal through email . could not beat the price . car was decent . great experience overall . will definitely rent a car from them in the future .	4698
1	i travel for work . alamo/national has : best price they will use my debit card ( i do n't use credit at all ) easy check-in great staff the correct class of car i reserved - no hassles or up-sell pick any one you want from the row easy return accurate bill i use them almost exclusively . absolutely no avis or enterprise . they have stranded me too many times . alamo/national is always there to bail me out . now i tell the admin that books this stuff to use them exclusively .	4698
0	this company is severely lacking . there were about 10 customers that had rentals with alamo . we called from lax and told them we were 2 hours delayed . when we arrived at the airport in pitt no one was there . many people called the number to speak to a supervisor and they told us we could sleep in the airport and someone would be there at 6:00 am . their customer service is horrible ! we will never ever use them again . they did not even offer us a free day or anything . do yourself a favor and do n't use alamo ever !	4698
0	alamo is one of the few rental services even open past 11 pm , which is important when flying into pittsburgh from the west coast . overall the prices and service were very good but the airport check-in service was painful . there were two clerks occupied chatting away with customers about their travel plans , favorite restaurants , children , grandchildren , favorite teams . those of us in line were forced to wait at least 10-15 extra minutes just to sign our forms . worse , nobody mentioned the construction and detours between the airport and downtown pittsburgh which were poorly marked and extremely confusing .	4698
0	yuck ! the car smelled like smoke . they must have had it aired out just before i picked it up because i could n't smell it until it sat overnight . i called to see what they could do but because i was n't near the airport , they would n't help . too bad .	4698
0	despite the sticker right on the center console indicating `` no smoking '' , this car reeks ! such a disgusting experience . with so many options at the airport , they are clearly taking their customers for granted . they lost this one ...	4698
0	terrible . the woman working in the booth in the parking lot could n't have been ruder . would n't even entertain the idea of me switching to a different car after they put me in a beat-up old nissan . adding 1 star for the 2 other employees i worked with who were courteous .	4698
0	the car i rented wa nice except it looked like they forgot to vacuum it out before putting it back into service . the was crumbs on all the seats and water spots all over the windows as well as the mirrors . not very impressed for a major car rental company .	4698
1	i do n't know what is wrong with these people leaving negative reviews regarding dv towing . all i have to say , is i was treated very professionally by the office people and when i got my car all of my belongings were still there . i 'm talking about my smartphone , jewelry and even prescription medicine . so with that being said a++ dv towing ! ! !	4699
1	my daughter was in an accident and the car was towed to dv . i called , spoke with kevin , the manager and he was great to deal with , and he really helped us through a difficult time . he let me know exactly what needed to be done to handle the situation . thank you !	4699
0	this was the worst customer service experience i 've ever had . a manger kevin , let his frustrations out on me by not only raising his voice , but also slamming a door in my face . he also mocked me when my eyes were swollen with tears . dv towing is awful and has rude , incompetent employees . i would n't recommend this place to my worst foe in all honesty .	4699
0	cutting people off repeatedly on the highway in an effort to drum up business ? definitely did n't advertise well for me . crappy driving does n't say `` you can trust me with towing one of your most valuable possessions '' ‍‍	4699
1	i had an incredible experience here with the birth of my 3rd child . if you 're looking for an intervention-free , natural birth , this is the place to go . the midwives were all compassionate , caring , and knowledgable . i was able to deliver my 2nd vbac at phoenix baptist and it was the perfect birth experience . i had poor experiences with my prior medication-free deliveries ( unsupportive staff in particular ) and this could not have been more different . my only complaint would be that the facility is old , but the care made up for it .	4700
1	awesome place some changes since i 've been going there since 2000 but overall i still love the midwives & doctors there . wishing the birth center was still available that was the reason why i started going there . i recommend the place if you are all about treating child birth as a beautiful and natural event . i had 4 natural deliveries and one c section while receiving my care and felt very good about it .	4700
1	i had an annual pap smear . they answered my questions adequately and politely about my concerns and were kind and efficient during the exam . it was my first visit and i was in and out of there within an hour . the staff was polite and the office was clean . i would not hesitate to go back there	4700
1	it 's an old building but nothing but the best of care . love the np cindy rosek and the doctors are caring helpful and i trust them with my care .	4700
0	this facility to appears to be underfunded and the issue presents itself in several ways . in my experience , this seems to be a characteristic of the quality of services received . the health providers lack knowledge and experience that you would not typically see in better facilities . if you have other options available to you i would explore them first .	4700
0	these people are scammers . first time i went here they told me i could n't get an ultrasound until 20 weeks . with my second pregnancy i thought i give them another chance . but turns out after five months they tell me they do n't deliver babies . and have no female doctors that deliver babies . biggest waste of my time .	4700
0	horrible wait time i was so not impressed with their customer service ... will not be going back dr said `` you have two weeks to get these exams done or you can look for another doctor '' yup i will do so ! ! !	4700
0	dr james jew , m.d . obstetrics and gynecology was very rude with me.said he was waisting his time talking to me about my health . unprofessional conduct . said he was frustrated due i didnt agree to have his way during surgery . this dr is a private practicioner they have no complains grievances in office so im calling amb .	4700
1	incredibly delicious wines and knowledgable people . i 'm usually a cab girl but the zinfandel was so satisfying that we had to buy a bottle for dinner tonight ! the cherry on top was the cellar environment that is staged for weekly concerts and events . perfect for a first , second and third date !	4701
1	been here a few times . once for a music event which was awesome ! i love their wine and their decor is so cute . we came back to get some wine corks to decorate our homemade wine table pattern after theirs . also bought the select wine and had a tasting . this is a fun place to visit . there is no food served but i 've been told that you can bring in your own .	4701
0	pittsburgh winery conducted an event today called the vine rewind . it was poorly organized . it was not nearly what was advertised for this event ! there was no wine tastings , you had to buy wine by the glass $ 5-7 and the wine was not very good ! there were no tents to cover the common zone so it was hot the sun beat down you while you try to consume alcohol which is a very bad mix . the music was not very good at all . this was the worst way to spend my sunday the last day of my weekend ! i will never go again !	4701
0	this is such a charming location with very nice wine . i and my friends were however told to shut the f* up by a sound guy or dj ; probably an employee of the winery . i will never go back nor recommend this establishment due to the disrespect from the staff or hired staff . respectable establishment do n't speak to paying costumers in such a way ... . a winery is supposed to be for civilized people and my party was treated in an uncivilized manner	4701
1	i 'm excited that they demo racquets . now i just have to see if a babolat racquet is for me or if i should go for a wilson as usual !	4702
1	if you or your so are passionate for tennis , this is the place to shop for any tennis racquets , shoes and outfit . the staffs here are knowledgeable and really know their products . the website they have has all the pricing and you can do your research before going to the store ! if you want more personal services , i will suggest coming here instead of sporting life !	4702
0	so i took in my receipts and got a refund after the line items were scrutinized by 3 employees , but the clerk somehow found it appropriate to lecture us on why paying twice was our fault . say what ? there was much sighing and acting like we ( the victims ) had ruined her day .	4702
0	staff is well informed . but i may never visit again ... a member of the staff / weekend manager made an *extremely rude* comment on our last visit ... so much so i 'm motivated to take my business elsewhere and encourage members of my club to do the same ! prices are on the high end anyways .	4702
1	ask for natalie or krystal ! best customer service i 've ever received ! i was having cell service issues and after speaking with tech support , two supervisors with customer care and three different sales associates at the blue diamond location all of which fed me excuses , natalie and krystal were the only ones who offered me a solution to my problem ! prior to seeing natalie and krystal i was contemplating switching providers but thanks to them i 'm still an at & t customer !	4703
1	great service ! ! jordan and his team did an astonishing job with helping me out today . we went in the store with a phone that was acting up and some questions . with this they went above and beyond to see what they could do with the phone and they figured out what was wrong . also , they did a great job with answering our questions and hooked me up with some deals with direct tv . great customer service ! totally recommend to go to this at & t instead of the blue diamond one .	4703
1	i had the best service today . i came here on saturday to get help with my phone that came in mail from insurance . the gentleman that helped me said `` you will have to send it back it does n't work `` he seemed irritated and unwilling to help . i decided to go back today in hopes of getting someone else . today i had rachel helping me . what a blessing this was . rachel was so patient with me and got the same phone working and helped me get all pictures and contacts into my new phone . thank you so much rachel for the best service at this location ever ! ! ! ! i appreciate all the help .	4703
1	i went in here expecting a long wait and trying to get a new phone set up to take forever we 'll that was not my experience they were very friendly and helpful took me all of 20 mins to get a brand new phone and walk out the door	4703
1	got to the store around 6ish and it was pretty busy . it took 10-15 mins just to check us in then we had to wait another 20-30 mins to be helped . but while the wait , it gave us time to browse and decide what phone we wanted to upgrade to . so it was n't too bad . we also had a great agent , rachel . so that made up for the wait time as well . she was knowledgeable and funny . she says she 's not funny but she is lol . it 's nice to have an agent who has a sense of humor . makes the process not so boring and pretty quick .	4703
1	my mom got what she came for , just a pay as you go plan for my uncle and it was quick & easy . the only complaint i have is the person who helped us , chase , was rather rude , unsmiling , and he gave a little bit of an attitude to my mom , who kept asking questions because she was trying to clarify . very irritating .	4703
1	i received a great service from natalie . she has an excellent customer service . since she has lots of knowledge , she took care of my request promptly . very impressive ! !	4703
1	amazing service . joy helped me with my screen protector on my phone and transferred my contacts and pictures onto my new phone . everyone in the store is nice .	4703
1	just switched from verizon to at & t . joy was amazing . primos was amazing for 3 of us , two numbers ported over and adding a new line with buy one get one phone free . so wellllll see how service is and as well as how our bill comes out . we 're supposed to be saving $ 70 a month . we 'll see !	4703
1	thank you charles denson for helping me fix a problem i 've been trying to resolve for over a year . through your listening skills and attention to detail , you were able to truly grasp the situation , used your experience and resources , to find what was needed to get the job done . i 'm am so glad that you were there to assist me that day . i will never go to another at & t store besides yours . thank you so much again for all the help !	4703
1	this store was truly amazing . i was acquiring about buying either an android or iphone and natalie schlaff was able to go above and beyond and answer all my questions . she recommended me to her coworker marie agulilar to answer any further questions i had . marie was amazing as well and was very personable . i would recommend not only this store , but these two associates as well . the store and associates went above and beyond to answer all my questions . truly grateful .	4703
1	we just bought a new phone from this location and the employees are friendly , knowledgeable and helped pick out the right phone with the right plan . we appreciated their honesty and would definitely shop here again .	4703
1	came in for an upgrade and had a pleasure to have rachel as a sales rep today , very nice young lady . although i would have to say the manager robert or whoever he is , was very weird . he watched me and the sales rep throughout most of the transaction which made me feel very uncomfortable and after i got the sales spill from the rep ( rachel ) , robert decides to come over and give me the same exact same spill as if it would change my mind , `` very pushy and annoying . '' i do n't mind a sales pitch but you should know when enough is enough as a seller .	4703
1	there was a ridiculous 15 minute wait time for a customer service rep , yet there were several reps just standing around . would have given this place much lower rating had it not been for jazz . she was extremely helpful and friendly .	4703
1	they 're awesome ! charles is amazing ! they got me in and out so quickly on my lunch break ! all with a pleasant attitude ! i really appreciate it guys ! will def come back to this location	4703
1	the customer service at this store specifically is outstanding . i came in with a question about my phone and they not only answered it but they went in to great detail about other things i can do to improve my data storage and phone performance . will come back to this location for sure .	4703
1	napoleon restored my faith in att afer a dreadful experience at the blue diamond location .	4703
1	my wife wanted to upgrade her 6s to the 8 , and this location had the red iphones so we popped over . charles d. helped us ... he was a fantastic saleman ... very professional & friendly . she was able to het her red iphone with no problems & charles let us know about an ipad deal associated with her upgrade , so we added a new ipad , too ! we are very happy with our purchase and the service we received . when it 's time for me to upgrade to the x ( 10 ) .. we 'll be calling charles again .	4703
0	i came in here wanting to either buy or order an iphone but the customer service or lack their of was very apparent . one helpful kind lady was trying to help me before she was rudely interrupted by other employees . she asked me what i was looking for and i said a new iphone and they were mockingly saying we have the iphone 3,4,5,5s and laughing at my face .	4703
0	i 've been with at & t for over 8 years & i must say that this particular store is severely lacking . they rarely answer the phone & the wait is always outrageous . the only polite employee there is the young lady who greets & checks customers in , i ca n't remember her name . she was so friendly . other than her , i would n't recommend going to this store . there are many other at & t stores that have much better customer service .	4703
0	this place gets worse and worse , besides the products breaking . i know that 's not there fault . the service is always horrible . blake did n't want to help initiate a warranty repair , he just told me to go online . i had questions about other products , he told me to go online . the brochure was right in front of him , i am sorry i wasted some of his precious time . might need to check out cricket , if i 'm going to be treated like a piece of shit , i might as well save money .	4703
0	horrible service , i went in there to buy a phone and they would n't let me because they thought i was a fraud . it took me 2 days just to get a phone .	4703
0	bad and rude costumer service here . i have $ 30 refill card for att phone but i need exchange to $ 60 refill card i asked costumer service to trade to $ 60 and pay the difference . hostile service and giving attitude that they would not exchange the refill card .	4703
0	this place is horrible we had to sign in and wait over 20 minutes while danielle stood there in the front doing nothing ... she was n't helpful at all .	4703
0	this branch is ridiculous . they make paying customers form a line outside in 100 degree weather while the store inside is practically empty . i am seriously considering leaving at & t after being with them for over 7 years . on my way to bestbuy right now to see who has the best package for me . i was going to add my husband + upgrade is to the iphone 6 . i 'm taking my business elsewhere ! ! !	4703
0	can someone please tell me how two bitches who came in half an hour after me got helped before i did ? the employees at this store seriously suck ass . one of them even flirted with one of said bitches and asked for her instagram . what the fuck . it 's a shame you ca n't give negative stars on yelp ...	4703
0	there 's no customer service now a day , came in for a simple question and this a-hole associate named charles was just so arrogant and rude , he did not even take time to listen to our problem or concern and demand our phone number even when we were trying to explain what happen , because he did n't listen we ask to talk with another associate and he just got up and leave and say have a nice day , how immature .	4703
0	this should be zero stars because we did n't even get service when we walked in . i went in 2 weeks ago on a saturday or sunday . i wanted to upgrade my phone . my husband and i walked in and no one even acknowledged us . we wandered around for 20 minutes and after absolutely no eye contact from anyone we just walked out . at least a `` hi we 'll be right with you '' would 've been nice . it 's not that difficult to say . this place is terrible .	4703
0	called this store to get something fixed and another store gives me a way better solution then the manager crystal . do no go there .	4703
0	this branch is awful ! the wait is unbelievable , all while employees are walking around doing nothing ! they need to get it together ! customer service is important !	4703
0	worst customer service ! been an at & t customer for almost 20 years and the manager cindy enciso is making us re-think our loyalty , and possibly switching carriers .	4703
0	this store has been closed all weekend . kind of a joke when people go out of their way to go . this is the second store to randomly close on me . att is n't as reliable as i thought .	4703
0	what an experience . the guy standing at the door was over the top rude . we said we were looking for iphones , and he was like `` ca n't show you the iphones because our display one was stolen '' he rattled off all the different colors they carry and when i said `` oh i think i need to see it in front of me '' he said `` oh well ! '' ... the words i 'm typing do n't do his demeanor justice . we turned around and left .	4703
0	no interest in helping current customers . it 's all about the sale or upgrade . well guess what , i pay 200 a month for my two phones and tablets . you will lose that business in two months when contact is up . oh and i am adding two more business lines , opps .	4703
0	my wife and i walked into this store ready to purchase an iphone 6 plus to upgrade her phone . we entered the store and waited 20 minutes and not 1 of 5 employees acknowledged us and said i will be right with you . i live 0.3 miles away from this store and i will never enter this store again . like other reviews do yourself a favor and drive a mile down warm springs to go to the at & t store on rainbow and robindale . you 'll receive that any consumer would expect . i wish i knew the operator of this store because it 's a good location but terrible service !	4703
0	worst att store ever.. they never answer their phones and they make 10 people wait outside for iphones and locking the door .	4703
