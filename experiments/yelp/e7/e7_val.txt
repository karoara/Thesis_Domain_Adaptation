1	i give this coffee bean 5 stars because it is so consistent ! the girls that work there are always nice and give me the mall discount . my drink is always made right and tastes the same each time . i always order an iced vanilla latte but i think i want to try an iced tea lemonade next time . just to try something different !	2204
1	great doctors and staff . dr. eze is very knowledgeable on pain management . they also have a medical spa and do quarterly presentations . i attended the nov presentation on liposuction and liposculpture . this was a lot of fun and i learned a lot . he is very knowledgeable and skilled in this area as well .	1780
1	best place to buy bed in gilbert . josh helped us find best bed for us at a great price .	679
0	waited in line for over an hour . there were eight people working the counter but only three or four of them were actually helping people . no idea why this is so slow . no excuse for making people wait in line over an hour to rent a car . will never use budget again .	2134
0	this place got such great reviews on yelp so my son and i went to check it out . we both ordered pho because it 's our favorite . the beef and tendon was nice and soft . the broth was very average and the noodles were really sub par . too bad . we wanted so much to find our new 'favorite ' place to eat pho . we are new to scottsdale and will keep looking . not good enough to go back unfortunately . : (	205
0	a group of us decided we want to give them a shot . all signs said they opened at 11:00 am . we arrived a little early at 10:55 so we waited in the car till 11:00 , went and tried the doors , locked . we waited till 11:15 and still locked . even a couple employees were trying to get in and could n't . so we waited till 11:20 and gave up . we went to bw3 right next door , great food , great service , and they open when they said they would .	1094
1	the best cupcakes i 've ever had ! very busy place and best to go early . worth it . my favorite flavor is salted watermelon ! yum ! do n't be fooled by the main st parking . parking and a entrance is also available in the back .	2335
1	this place is super fun ! had a great experience here a few months ago looking for a low-key hangout in downtown phoenix . i was pleasantly surprised with the live latin jazz and the food options were great too ! i recommend if you 're looking for a smaller place free of heavily intoxicated people , this is the place to go .	190
1	tv stations need yelp too and i 'm excited to be the first one to give it ! i watch 3tv for most of my news , especially mornings and weekends . they do a great job of providing useful , entertaining and to the minute news as it 's happening . i know i can always count on 3tv and they do a good job of hiring friendly and entertaining reporters and anchors . they also have news on the most out of every station so i know i can always turn to 3tv . that 's about all i can think to say but if you need a good news source , turns to 3tv !	3585
1	never had a bad experience here ! quick , yummy , and excellent customer service . i have even had the food here and was impressed . will continue to be a patron ! : )	2572
0	i have been there many times and they never say hi and thank you to customers . they have the worst customer service . i wo n't come back !	2965
0	the worst dining experience in my entire life . i 'm not talking about the foods , but the quality of service . the dim sum lady was rude , we asked three times to not serve food that we did n't want and she still ignored us . i spoke to the general manager and she seemed not to care or even at least saying sorry .	0
1	beautiful new office , amazing staff and marlena the assistant is awesome ! dr. blank is wonderful as well !	3767
1	i have n't been to this car wash in quite some time since i have moved from the area . today i needed a wash and they were close and i was happy to get in and out of there . quick , excellent service and very kind people . kendra , the young lady who ran my transaction was very welcoming and seemed happy to be offering good service . thank you guys !	3250
0	we went there around 6:30 pm ... all the tables were empty.. ordered pad thai and chicken fried rice.. the waitress swapped spicy levels , when we told her , she replied that chef has swapped and she had nothing to do with it ... i told her it looks like pad thai but did n't taste anything like that as it was very spicy.. she replied people from our place wo n't like it and started explaining how it tastes ... i was shocked to hear her response.. paid $ 32 bill and come out hungry.. i have been to thai house , basil for the past 7 years and never had such bad experience.. never going back to this place again..	50
0	this company did the flowers for my wedding . the woman we worked with was ok and gave some decent suggestions , but when the big day came , the flowers for one side of the family were all say off color . they were supposed to be a shade of pink but they were more red . now when i look at the photos i just cringe because it does n't match . the flowers of the colors for the grooms side essentially were not the color we ordered .	1132
0	not a huge fan of this place , although the $ .99 margaritas are pretty good . great place to come on a friday afternoon for a liquid lunch . i though their food was bland for mexican and rather uninspired . if you are n't a huge tequila fan , there are better laces out there in phoenix .	1346
0	november 20 , 2014 at 5:17 pm jeff warwick , the manger on duty refused to serve me . i left a shopping cart full of items and left . i 'm complaining to corporate . i will follow up if i get a response .	2520
1	best dive bar in the neighborhood . debbie and taylor are the funnest bartenders you 're going to find in the area . it 's a dive bar , take it for what it is . but the atmosphere makes the place	1688
0	i came all the way from california for my birthday too try this bar out and i got the worst service from the bartender billy . he was clearly ignoring us . we came for the happy hour 5 cent beers and waited for 20 minutes and the bartender never even acknowledged us . super disappointed in this experience . i would n't recommend coming here .	637
0	worst service , worst dessert ! ! ! fake 許留山！！！he server service is bad ! ! ! i wo n't be returning unfortunately ! ! ! so do n't treat your customer with this kinds of food and service ! ! !	1062
1	minute clinic logging in from internet and showing with no wait time up to a nurse practitioner who actually knew medicine . excellent ! we used to air-evac people into hospitals , so i have a limited bit of knowledge in these matters . the np had worked in a hospital for quite some time and had a good working knowledge . did not over prescribe . just right . both my wife and i have been to this clinic . two thumbs way up	70
0	just so you know . they will tell you it will be a 15 - 30 minute wait at the drive thru ! swear , i just left at 2:30am , 3 cars in front of me & told to wait up to 30 minutes ! insane	221
0	i am a high level healthcare executive and went to this group for my personal care . they are all about the $ $ $ and not about care . they have denied requests for refills of over the counter drugs like ibuprofen and acid reflux medications saying i need an appointment . ( prescription drugs are actually cheaper under my insurance than the over the counters ! ) i am relatively heathy and have been seen in the past 6 months ! find another practice who actually cares about you and not co-pays !	938
1	great addition to south charlotte options ! the avocado and lime grain bowl was fantastic ! good size portion and nice and tangy ! the kids menu is great , we had two clean plates for once ! the assortments of lemonades are a nice touch as well . we will definitely be back !	1269
0	i used to love virgin america , but no more . very unreliable and unfriendly service . no notice of delay whatsoever . plus their staff at las is constantly asking people around to upgrade their seat when the flight is delayed . not happy at all .	1623
0	sooo anoyed . heard an advertisement for holiday special . i stopped @ the bank to get cash so my husband would n't know i got him a massage for christmas . ! st the soecial was not what was advertised on the radio , then they would n't accept a $ 100.00 bill . i had my newborn with me so i was not going to run around trying to cash my bill . went to a spa closer to my house instead .	3862
1	an outstanding classy place . i would say this is the best marriott i have ever been to . we went there as a basketball tournament , and got a group rate . peggy rates as one of the top salespeople i have ever worked with . professional staff , clean rooms , good location , easy access to airport , the breakfast buffet rocks . would stay there again anyday .	230
1	this store has mostly everything for the sports fan . i admit that their prices tend to be more expensive than other places , but they definitely have a better selection . one thing i appreciate is the return policy - they do n't hassle you when you need to take something back . my son could spend hours here , and we find ourselves going here more and more often for all sports related gear .	3911
0	i 'm trying a new laser technician this time because the usual girl dawn is just awfully annoying . she tells me about all the money i would save if i signed up for a membership , but i did the math and in my situation i would n't save any money . i always leave feeling bad about myself . hopefully the other girl is better .	343
0	whatever these assholes quote you ... double it . congrats , you got my money . but you'll never see another penny . p.s . the home button was installed incorrectly . way to go .	3817
0	stuffed pizza is great stockyard is my favorite but the regular pizza the dough is so flat and tasteless i might as well eat cardboard with cheese on it	192
1	i have been a real estate agent for 10 years and have had the pleasure in working with diana gomez-mcgurk and homeowners financial group in several loan transactions . diana always answers her phone , replies back to my emails , and provides great customer service to all my clients . i have been referring business to her for many years and will continue to work with her in servicing buyer 's and making their home buying process experience as easy as possible .	2518
0	i was a first time client and went on a sunday afternoon for a basic manicure and polish . i went strictly because it was convenient and i was in the area at the time . the staff was relatively nice - however i was not impressed with the quality of the manicure . some of my nails were filed crooked and 2 of my nails had polish that were smudged ( not of my own doing ) . i probably wo n't be going back here again - and if i did i would not use the same manicurist .	3369
1	i have to say , the girl who helped me toady was amazing and i wish i knew your name , i tested the bean ( vegan ) soup and it was amazing ! i felt the service was quick for our lunch time rush an she took the time to help me make an awesome decision ! i may have been missing some onions on the salad but thanks ! it still was very good !	1259
1	beautiful hotel . only a mile from the airport . free shuttles are available through the hotel both to and from the airport . the building was clean , inviting and well maintained . i would recommend and stay here again !	2872
1	jeff and his assistant manager ( cant remember her name ) were seriously f-ing awesome . the customer service is a+ in my book ! ! the next time i am in need to rent a vehicle ... .i am coming to this enterprise ! !	2373
1	i had dr padley and could not be happier . a real down to earth guy . spent plenty of time with me explaining what my shoulder problem entailed . i ended up needing rotator cuff repair . every appointment i went to was on time . seems like you never wait long here . great bedside manner . just comes off as a real caring dr. not much more to say other than my shoulder feels great 3-1/2 months post-surgery . just went on a golf trip and played great !	2755
0	literally the worst e.r you 'll ever find yourself at . you 're already having a horrible day ... and this place will make it a million times worse . they not only take 35+ minutes to take back critically ill people , and wo n't let you in until you finish their insurance paperwork no mater if someone is dying , but they then do n't even let one family member go back until after the doctor visits ... you 'll wait another hour+ for that ... .. literally the worst hospital and biggest death trap you 'll ever find yourself at . avoid even in dire emergency ... . you can drive 30 mins further and you 'll still be seen faster ... .	1010
1	la fitness member from out of town . came in for a tour ( and to check on the kiddie club ) and the staff was so incredibly positive and kind ! excited to return .	2066
0	i would like to say the receptionist megan was nice- second the set up was all right , thsy definitely need to update their free weight it reminds me of old school . the trainers seem to be out of shape to be personal trainers . the bathrooms soom to be not clean garbage overflowing , lot of old creepy dudes staring with mustaches and only have one weight scale . no towels provided didnt see sanitizer spray for the machines .	3446
1	very happy with staying here , the lazy river is an added bonus though between running around the strip and seeing free shows , we did n't really have much time enjoy it thoroughly ... the lvb location is set further out from the strip to give you more of a resort type of experience . there are plenty of entertainment onsite , pool , jacuzi , lazy river , pool table , air hockey $ 1 , dvd rentals ( $ 3 ) , foosball and several arcade games for kids ...	1057
1	my go-to-place for everything related to the home . the prices are not cheap - but they have everything you may need and more ! the employees are helpful , even if you speak english ( which ca n't be said about all shops in the plateau ! ) .	1577
0	just a follow-up . had 6 people for 50th birthday celebration . i paid for two people on amex ... got ta love amex they fought for me and i got a refund for that . but , four people i paid on visa debit and unless i go back to vegas and file a small claims suit i will never get a dime back ! so no refund from this bullshit company ! i will keep posting about our horrible experience until they shut down . if you read these reviews and still give them a try then shame on you . no drinks , no admission , no vip . no refunds !	2122
0	i 'm not picky or ever put up reviews but the fish i bought was so gross and old . do n't even bother going there .	1595
1	no better band program with almost 90 % of it all financially funded by the people !	3006
1	stayed here last weekend thanks to a great travel zoo deal . we had an excellent experience for the bachelor party celebration . the princess suite was very large , the customer service all around was outstanding , the room service prices were cheap and delicious , the pool staff was awesome ( they even poured our glass beer bottles into plastic cups for us ) , the main strip was super close and the other guests were friendlyas well . i 'd highly recommend checking it out next time you are vegas ! great value !	2973
0	my vet sent a prescription here for my cat . i was told it would be 3 days for delivery . it is now a week and we do n't have the prescription . this place has horrible customer service . the `` supervisor '' is no help at all . apparently the real manager who is also the owner is out of town and they will have to look into the matter . meanwhile i have a sick pet with no meds and they could care less . avoid this hack pharmacy at all costs ! ! the imaginary owner obviously does n't care and leaves her business to be run by a bunch of incompetent workers .	2827
0	we just checked in and this is the state of the room , ugh ! it literally gives me the creeps . i will not sit on that stained couch with holes in it . i am looking at a all nighter without sleep afraid if bedbugs . i have never been in such a gross room . nick at the front desk put us in a nice room , we think ! prayers for a good sleep ! in the new room the tv in the sitting room does n't work and my husband just killed this bug on the bed ! ! ! gross ! do not stay here !	3802
0	once again , walked in to calgary cycle to make a purchase and ask a few questions . great looking , beautiful store but many items are behind glass , or require a sales person to access . unfortunately , in 10 minutes of being in there , i was not acknowledged once , except for someone wheeling a bike past me , and so i walked out again . waste of my time ... i 've purchased a mountain bike through them before , but if their staff can not be bothered to greet customers or ask if they can help out , this will be my last visit .	227
1	the take care clinic is a life saver ! ! last weekend i was visiting my family for mother 's day weekend . i stayed 2 nights at a hotel and was attacked by bed bugs . fortunately , i did n't bring them back to arizona . seven days after the initial contact the bites have swelled and become painful . dr. lani said my bites became infected due to a bacteria one of the bugs was carrying . gross ! ! ! ! ! ! i showed up without an appointment and without insurance . an hour later i was seen by the doctor and given 2 prescriptions all for under $ 150 . thank you walgreens take care clinic .	1641
1	two lunch items : a goat curry and a jerk chicken . the former was fairly straightforward , the latter had a distinctive flavor different than other jerk recipes ; it 's not too hot for those unacquainted with caribbean food to try . i 'd definitely order it again . i 'd recommend it more for dinner than lunch . the husband and wife combo who run the place are very nice .	54
0	the sign says lash lounge . it is crystal lash lounge . i asked if i could have a discount they said only if you rate us online i did n't think that was fair so i just paid full price i went in and got a full set of lashes she put some strong glue on it said it would mildly affect my eyes i was pulling the lashes off all night long they were burning so bad i asked for my money back they said no i disputed it they ended up winning never again ! ! ! learn how to communicate in english ! ! i told a lot of people to stay away .	2685
1	i love this place ! ! they treat my baby buddy like he is their own puppy . i took my male dog here since i got him november 2012 for all his shots , etc . then i took him daily for approximately 3 months before i moved into my house . i trust them completely ! ! thank you sienna ! ! ! i feel bad for those who had problems . i love them and highly recommend sienna ! ! ! ! !	1700
1	found these guys on yelp . was quoted a price and since it was my 1st time here ( no trust yet ) i called the dealer to compare and they were in fact offering a very fair price and good service . highly recommend this place	1604
1	i love the patio on 8th ave , great for people watching . oj 's has pretty good drink specials , especially the $ 6 2oz mojito on monday . the food is n't amazing.. my fries were luke warm and the burger was a bit dry ( but big ! ) but the atmosphere here is really nice . my friends meals seemed really good , especially the fish and chips .	427
0	no call , no show twice ! ! ! i 've scheduled a time for an estimate two different times and they have n't shown up or called either time . i 'm done wasting time with this company .	827
1	great products ! ! i 'm using the eye collection for 3 weeks and the results are amazing ! !	35
0	actually like the one in mayfield on wilson mills much better . the night i went , parking was limited . their were kids running all over the place with no supervision . it was after 9:30p too . that 's not necessarily their issue but , they should say something to the parents for the other guests comfort . our server kept forgetting to refill drinks . she told us to not tip her well . really ? the kids running around was so distracting that i ca n't even tell you if i enjoyed the food . i believe i got a better portion and burger at mayfield too . not sure if i 'll try again .	496
1	the shop was super clean . they clearly know what they are doing and have a strong knowledge base . the gentlemen that did my piercing did a much better job than i had previously in the same hole . it matches the other ear perfectly . he was explanatory , friendly , and quick . great facility !	2895
1	this place is huge and cheaper then the places ive been to . really cheap glass pipes tooo !	1025
0	consumer beware . if you do not give them a `` perfect '' on their service survey -- -- you will be blackballed .	3065
0	this place never answers their phones or messages . it 'd be nice to use my groupon before it expires but no one ever responds to make my appointment . terrible customer service in my opinion to not answer after a minimum of 12 attempts to make an appointment .	2647
0	umm straight out they are a huge scam . every time i would bring by vehicle in for a simple tire rotation , they would seem to always find an issue with my car . ever since i stopped going to them , have n't had a problem since .	76
1	amazing food guys , it 's a must go ! we had chicken fried rice , red curry & eggplant tofu . everything tasted so good . we are already planning to go back !	1361
0	deli service is always lazy ! dirty ! management needs to step in and make some changes ! ! !	2316
0	honestly , waited in line 20 minutes . had nail in tire . asked for them to rotate and balance as well . they said an hour and a half to 1 hour 45 min . over 2 hours later i returned ( went next door to culvers for free wifi to get work done ) . not done . said it would be done in 10-15 min . overall , over 2 hours to fix a nail in my tire and no time to rotate and balance .	3158
0	fruit tea was great ! it was a little too sweet for me so next time i would like to get half sweet . the sweetness was n't like sugar but instead it tasted like honey so i feel that it 's a healthier choice for teas ! ! ! the mango bingsuu did not look right . i felt like i have almond slices instead of mango bing su . i like how they use fresh mangos instead of frozen mangos . i do n't like how the server kept eyeing at our table and trying to rush us out the door when we have n't even finished our drinks ! !	1182
0	this place sucks , it sucks so bad . i have nothing else to say . negative 5 stars if i could . it 's almost impossible to find good shawarma anywhere north or steeles .	678
1	the absolute best bao in toronto . awesome old school hip-hop soundtrack . stiff drinks . my only quibble : the kitchen does n't understand timing ; orders rarely come out together . but the food is too good to be polite -- eat and order some more ; hopefully by that time your guests will have theirs too .	688
1	very good music and the appetizers were delicious ! the waitress was wonderful as well . overall the experience was great and we will definitely come back !	190
1	brad smith will go above and beyond to provide excellent customer service and do everything possible to make your car buying experience the best possible . he is extremely friendly and knowledgable and is someone that you will want to work with .	3688
1	just picked up a box of coffee this morning , called it in last night , everything went great . someone needs to add store info ... not me	1216
1	i had to swap a class from chandler gilbert and replace it with a mcc class and everyone i encountered was super friendly and helpful ! ! ! the people helping me made me feel important and like they really valued me as a student ! they made everything super quick and easy ! ! the guy helping me helped me bypass all the lines and i was in and out of there in about an hour ! i have no complaints ! ! !	2787
1	this was such an amazing massage i 'll definitely be back ! i had a 90 minute massage with firm pressure with dominic and it felt like heaven ! i could n't recommend this place more , worth every penny and will be returning for another massage this month ! 5 out of 5 stars for this gem !	2455
0	wow . i just called to speak to someone about my car . not only would he not let me finish talking , he spoke loudly at me and then told me that i needed to let him talk and started putting words into my mouth . all i wanted to know was if i could take my car in for them to check it out . i will not ever go to this business after this phone call . if that is how you speak to someone and treat them when they are seeking help from your business , i want no part of it .	3632
1	my 18 month old daughter had her first dental visit today with dr kim . she was able to do a thorough exam , floss her teeth , and applied fluoride . she also offered me tips on how to take better care of her teeth at home . the visit was very pleasant and we are looking forward to going back in 6 months .	1304
0	if i could give a zero , i would . i have been dealing with this worthless dealership for over 5 months trying ( unsuccessfully ) to get a refund from my cancelled extended warranty . i filled out the cancellation form in september of 2015 and was assured i would receive the refund in 2 months time . it is the end of february and somehow , nobody knows the status or whereabouts of my cancellation form/refund . i have called at least 3 times per month since december with empty promises of returned calls . i guess the next step is to go to the dealership and not leave until my issue is resolved .	1424
1	thanks brandon for getting the chairs in the outside sitting area replaced . it 's the small details that make a difference . still the best carwash in summerlin , esp on tuesdays when the full service wash is upgraded to the next level at no extra charge .	2198
1	i come to this starbucks only when i come to the costco . for the most part i like this store . it 's clean , staff are friendly , and plenty of seating . the one thing i have noticed is the couple of gentlemen that do work here always get my order correct and i 'm not having to repeat my order 3 or 4 times . the girls on the other had always seem a little scatter brained , i 'm always having to repeat myself . my iced coffee is always made correct and made in a timely manner . overall this store rocks !	2417
0	the staff is friendly but the doctors are ridiculously cautious . they refused to treat my daughter who fell playing tag on the playground and needed a few stitches for a laceration on the side of her head . we then had to take her to the er to get this simple problem taken care of , thus incurring two medical bills . if you need meds for a cough or cold , this is your place . if you need actual medical care , avoid this place and find a doctor who is willing to actually practice medicine . parents - this is not the place to take your kids .	2870
1	my car looked great . customer service is usually great . heard a comment about my dirty car ( had just returned from a 4,200 mile roadtrip . i mentioned the comment to the manager and she was very apologetic . i will use them again .	2198
1	must visit here ! i love tje atmosphere and the massage is very good . i truly loved the ezperience here !	735
1	wow this place really changed the game for what to expect from a nail salon . such a relaxing and spa like atmosphere ! mellow classical/spa music playing , nature slideshow on the tv screens and very professional staff . they offered my something to drink , water , juice , wine or a margarita even ! supper comfy pedicure chairs that actually gave a good chair massage . fruit in the water i soaked my feet in . but the best part was the quality pedicure i received . she really took her time and did a great job , not just a quick 20 minute pedicure here . this is definitely my new go to place .	265
0	my mom , myself , and some friends went here for lunch . what a mistake . the waitress did not seem to really care that it took us an hour to get our food . i get it is friday and lunch but tables seated after us were surely given their meals way before us . my mom called and spoke with gentleman who said he would take a message and have the owner call us . we never heard from them . we will for sure not be back . lousy customer service , and the waitress brought are meals out to us one by one , and in 10 minute intervals , hard to have everyone eat at the same time .	1510
0	not professional , too much papers in this digital world . very old school . the interviewer did not seem to understand the tax form at all . i never get chance to meet with steven and interviewer does not have good knowledge about taxes . i asked for how much tax filling will cost me and interviewer told me that go to his website and figure out yourself .	3144
0	bad customer service at this location . there were nearly 10 employees , 3 customers and the 2 girls at the register were talking and not making eye contact or helping me . i stood there for 2 minutes and they did n't acknowledge me . disappointing , guess i 'll go to chipotle next time .	1365
0	the food is decent but their customer service leaves something to be desired . as one of the last customers of the night , we were annoyed when the cashier began vacuuming the floor near us during our dinner . after asking her to stop until we were finished , she told us that they have to clean a half hour before they close . then she continued vacuuming and even went on to sweep right next to our table . as a former server , i know that is no way to treat customers at a restaurant .	875
1	i feel like james franco in 11/22/63 when i walk through the doors to this joint . if you like cigars and old antique shit , you will pop a boner when you walk through the doors . smoke cigars , drink fine whisky ( or beer , or wine ) and take a load off in this kick ass establishment . i do n't know about the food they serve , did n't eat any . if they served dog turds covered in cheese whiz i would still fuck with this place heavy .	1683
0	i 've been in twice and i can say the service is very poor . the first time i was looking for a amp and speakers for my karaoke machine . the sales guy answer couple question and left . i wanted some advice but did n't get a chance . second time the two salesman was too busy chatting . i felt like they did n't want to help me out . the price is expensive from other places . never again give kmmmku	2682
1	contacted them to take my parents to the airpprt in september and they were on time , had the best rate , very clean van and very nice driver . so easy and using them again when they come back in town !	1814
0	went for the van gogh experience -- one screen was n't working and those entering the area were n't told -- not good ! i enjoyed viewing/listening ; it was interesting and a different experience , but come on , museum , do n't be charging extra for this exhibit when it is n't 100 % working ! appears this is a museum for kids -- most adults i know would n't be interested very much in the permanent exhibits .	3891
1	the people r nice and the dr is nice to is not a long wait and i came in with pain and the dr and the girls help me to get in to fix the pain	3618
0	market . where ? circles . what ? grill . pasta ? no calamari . no zucchini . no cheese on chicken parmesan . the mussels on the house are excellent . not sure why they serve you a different gravy with chicken . ravioli was not fresh . disappointed . sauce was good . will we come back ? sadly no . too pricey for meh .	161
1	had an issue initially , but they worked with me to get to a resolution that i thought was fair .	3171
0	pros : - affordable prices . - staff were friendly and accommodating . - food was filling . - bathrooms were clean , which is a rarity ... especially since they were basement bathrooms at an asian restaurant ! cons : - the food was average . nothing super special . - we ended up getting stomach aches after eating our meals . - complementary side dishes were mediocre .	396
0	i came here during my break between classes and their lunch `` box '' or bento was mediocre . the tofu in the miso soup tasted like plastic and the salmon teriyaki i ordered came smothered in teriyaki sauce and burnt on the bottom ! probably wo n't be coming here again .	408
0	this place is way over priced and the hair stylists take when to long to hair peoples hair i love jess and lexi with a burning passion but i no longer can do this anymore i would wait because the price was right now there is no point time to find a new place	2522
1	**cake purchase only** wow ! total blast from the past ! carvel is still alive and kicking ! this was the place for ice cream in new york back in the 70 's and 80 's . remember fudgie the whale and cookie puss ? yes those really cool , retro ice cream cakes ; they still make them . little shop right next to harris teeter with fast service . cones , sundaes and all the usual suspects . the cakes are very similar to dq with cake/cookie crumbles layered in . good stuff ! ! ca n't speak to the bad service reviews as we just picked up a cake .	1201
1	i think anyone giving this place hell is either working at another head shop or knows someone working at another head shop . sounds like sabotage to me ! no one has ever been rude to me and ummm the parking situation ? there 's parking in the back and a few places in front . the only thing i do n't like is that the floor is n't very sturdy and when you walk on it and everything shakes .	3403
1	i had a great experience in this store . felicia helped pick out the perfect color and curl pattern of hair to achieve the style in was looking for . she was extremely personable and patient . great customer service !	3676
1	great food and service . the owner is very kind . wish they were in south charlotte : ) . imo , they have the best pho	947
1	had to get a check engine light looked at and this place was able to accommodate my busy schedule . shawn was an excellent person to deal with . he helped make everything clear and earned my trust with his professional demeanor . anyways , he said the component that was causing the check engine light would take 3 days to acquire and fix and he lived up to it . within 3 days i got my car back with that pesky light gone and a fresh oil change which i also requested . will be going back there to get an oil change again this friday since my 3000 miles are up .	3196
0	after recently moving across the street , ancora has a new menu and they ditched their levelup rewards . i 'm pretty bummed out that their breakfast sandwiches are all quite a bit more expensive than at their old location . i get that they are no longer confined to using a microwave , but geez ! $ 8 or $ 9 for an english muffin egg sandwich with no sides is really steep . between the de facto 10 % price increase by ditching levelup , and the 50 % + increase on their food , i 'm out . what was a daily stop is now unaffordable more than once a month .	1070
1	this is my favorite theater to see movies at . i love coming to the jb-x theater - it has a wonderful sound system that does n't cost any extra . they also have som really good deals . on mondays , tickets are only $ 5 ( except sony pictures ) , tuesday 's are 2 for $ 22 - 2 tickets , 2 drinks , and a popcorn for $ 22 . thursday 's are $ 8 for a ticket , drink , and popcorn ( though you must show your palms card to get this deal ) . love this place !	491
1	had a shellac french tip manicure done . love it ! ann , had me in and out of there quickly and made sure i liked the thinness of the tip lines .	3452
0	i called to simply get a price quote and schedule of classes for cpr bls training . yikes ! the woman was incredibly rude and short with me . thankfully i found a much better place to get my cpr certification that ended up being much cheaper ( a student discount ) and the staff there was actually kind and helpful .	2315
0	horrible service no idea how they make any money after waiting 15 minutes for a haircut the barber that was available sat back down and got on his phone i 'll never go back and if u want haircut that 's not the place for it .	3469
0	the first time i had one of thier gigantic pizza 's i was in heaven . it was so so so good . since then i have ordered pizza from them twice and it just has n't been that good . the last time the sauce on the cheese pizza was spicy and my kids would n't eat it . i will not order from them again .	417
0	do not use this doctor . she gave my son the wrong diagnosis and medicine that made him very sick . it made his situation worst and it went on for months . this doctor and her staff never seemed to care . my son refused to go back to her so i found a very competent doctor who cleared up his situation in three days .	2526
1	i recently purchased a dining room set from this location . i am so happy with my beautiful new furniture and the purchase was handled efficiently , everyone was courteous and i would highly recommend this furniture store to anyone .	439
0	dont go here for phone repair the guys working here have little knowledge about phones . they are very unclear about what 's causing damage on my iphone and kept changing words and costs . they are very unprofessional and i would not recommend this place to anyone .	2930
1	coffee and wine ( & beer too ! ) served from the same counter ? yes , please ! note : this 5* rating is purely based on the addition of alcohol from the regular ol ' coffee bar that the other whole foods have , a seemingly larger salad bar area , a nicer , larger seating area to enjoy your food/coffee/wine/beer , and just more selection of product as compared to my home store at square one . why does square one not have this alcoholic beverage option ? i think it would do fairly well there ! i feel a 'suggestion ' email coming on ...	3271
1	my best friend referred me to chris and they have serviced both my cars and did an excellent job- they are on time and fully complete with your service . they can do oil changes , new tires , detailing etc . i appreciate them and recommend them to all my friends .	3125
1	an old gem that we crossed into . it 's in an old shopping complex . got there right when they right as they opened . we ordered beef eggplant , ginger chicken , ramen noodles , and thai iced tea . everything was great with large portions . food was flavorful and came up pretty quick . service was good and price is where it should b. thai iced tea was refreshing . before we left we order a mango smoothie and that was the bomb . they used real mango ! hopefully we get to come here very soon .	1103
0	food was good but service was horrible . the hostess was nice and seated us quickly . the waiter seemed lost and confused . i do n't know if wait staff was under staff or what . they were horrible . got our food order wrong . do not go here unless it 's a slow time or better yet not at all . i would never return . our servers name was charlie .	560
0	damaged the bumper on my car , did n't tell me about the damage and wo n't return my calls to get reimbursed or repair damage . do not use !	1098
1	delicious . all the ingredients are flavorful , fresh , and very tasty . i ca n't believe some people choose qdoba over this place . i could n't stomach it after trying chipotle . 5/5 all the way .	1328
1	i highly recommend using this company for all your stone needs . they are extremely friendly and accommodating . i was in need of counter tops before the big game and national stone came through big time for me . thank you for the amazing experience .	2090
1	sat on the first floor . cozy and intimate . the food was absolutely amazing . delicious wings & cold slaw and fried chicken . we were n't too hungry so three of us split these two dishes and it was perfect . lots of fun and delicious drink options . the beers were delicious too ! did n't stay too late because we had other plans , but apparently upstairs becomes a fun dance club at night . would definitely recommend to young people looking for a new fun place to try . you 'll probably end up coming back : )	1583
0	pretty terrible , the waitress was rude and the salmon was over seasoned . i would not recommend this to anyone . i have not eaten a meal this bad as far as i can remember . unless you love the taste of salt then avoid . thanks for the hype and the expense .	429
0	dumb little kid has no respect for customers . really need to fix service to get more customers .	797
1	efficient staff , cheap prices and good quality work . place is a little spot in south common mall . it 's not a high end place but it gets the job done . i 'll be back . got gel polish change and toe polish change for $ 25 .	3592
1	sat at the bar service was decent , nice bartender . fried pickles were ok..bit too greasy after the top few . cajun chicken pasta was good , spicy which i liked but did n't seem hot from the kitchen . fajitas were average , hot out but had to ask for lettuce . place seemed loud and no music to drowned the sound . will i come back ... only if last resort . it is convenient to area and highway .	178
1	really awesome salon ! so polite , great service ! even let me come in at 5:14 on a sunday when they close at 5 and we 're already packed full ! i will be back !	1388
1	i love this salon . i had my pedicure last week with lee . she is gentle and very thorough . she was very patient - i felt like i was her only customer the whole day - not rushed and enjoyed her conversation . i am going to request her from now on . thank you !	3682
0	terrible customer service . we mentioned to the waitress is our first time to dine . the food has no flavor as your typical thai dish and spice . during the course the waitress never checked on us . there was only one customer besides us to say the least that she was busy . horrible food and customer service . !	1366
1	this place can be a little rough sometimes but i 've always met nice people willing to share a drink with you . tacos are cheap and beer is decently priced .	704
0	i 've been going to flare cleaners since i moved here 11 years ago and when complete cleaners took over my shirts have been dingy around the collar . i was told that they do not pre-treat collars anymore , the prices has also gone up . i wo n't be using complete cleaners anymore.it 's a waste of my time and money .	2947
0	if you are in a hurry do not come here . doctor appointment scheduling is never precise . it 's more of a wish . bring a book ( you may be able to finish a novel while you wait ) . one bathroom available in waiting area . health professionals scream out your name . you would think they would have a better way to announce who is next to be seen . overall a typical sterile and impersonal medical facility that is something to endure .	2735
0	i do n't want to give them any stars ... .tried to take back a printer that stopped working after 25 days . they would n't take it back because it was past their 15 day return policy . i would expect a printer to last more than 15 days so we will never shop at any best buy ever again .	3192
0	just got an oil change at pep boys , and the mechanic notified me that i need to replace the driver 's side cv boot asap ( and eventually the passenger side one as well ) . that said , i have strong cause to believe the cv boot was never replaced at tony 's ( even so i was charged for the part and labor ; see previous review ) . i always had a suspicion that he never made any repairs at all and just charged me $ 500+ for nothing .	3924
0	eh , i did n't like this place much either , especially when i had been craving mexican . the sopes were ok , the salsa was pretty good as well , but the tacos coapa were flavorless . we did n't stay for dessert due to the crappy seating , the bad lighting , and the inept , slow service . not recommended .	1330
1	we started going to kobe for over a year . she cuts my husband and two boys hair . she is the best at the location by far .	3025
0	worst experience ever ... i will not be going back to this place ... your nails end up looking the same as if u were to do them yourself or even have a 3 yr old do them . money wasted and not worth it ! ! ! ppl there are rude not welcoming at all !	2929
0	worst experience please do n't go this shitty place long wait for order delivery .for fucking sandwich they took 1 hour , the bartender is very careless and replied to me `` i am not making it `` . damn worst service in my entire life . manager is also worst and racial .	705
0	i have been going to hannahs for about 6 months . i am a guy and have had 5 hip surgeries in the past few years and have a hard time reaching my feet . the last time i went in the owner refused to give me a pedicure , saying i needed to go to the doctor and that my skin was to dry . i was n't going to write anything but i have n't had a bad customer service experience like that in a while . good luck . no men	2886
1	nice mall . it 's what feels like about an hour and a half trip from the ne side of akron , where we are , so we rarely get out to that side of town . but at least you do n't need an automatic weapon or a platoon of bodyguards to walk the place after 3 pm on a saturday . and you ca n't argue they 're not miles ahead of chapel hill these days . as others have said , let 's hope the slimy underbelly does n't devour this place like the other mall casualties of 21st century akron ohio .	2511
1	after years of services at jiffy lube & after having a bad experience at right toyota , i brought my 2013 4runner in for routine service at avondale toyota . i have now been back 3-4 times and could not be happier with the service . tyler young has handled my service each time . i have been so happy with how quickly , cost effective and smooth my car is taken care of . the customer service is great and does n't have the dealership feel at all . i am grateful for and highly recommend avondale toyota and tyler young ! ! !	307
0	went here last night to get some sweets . peanut butter cookie was stale and bland . it seemed to be overloaded with sugar and was extremely dry . i also got a dark chocolate caramel and milk chocolate caramel ( 3 each ) . these chocolate caramels were stale . period . all for the price of 18.95 . honestly , when i took a bite of that cookie i almost matched back in with that garbage to return it . coming from la , where there is a huge food scene , this place seemed like a tourist trap with low quality food . foodies avoid . only go for the free chocolate tasting for the experience .	3722
1	i chose this restaurant for lunch today and i 'm really glad i did . i got seated quickly and ordered the build-your-own sampler with jalapeno bottle caps , mozzarella cheese sticks and a cheese quesadilla with sour cream , marinara and pico de gallo sauces . the food arrived at the table quickly and everything was tasty , hot and fresh . kathy was a superstar waitress ... she knew when i wanted something and she knew when to leave me alone . ; ) i 'll certainly return here for the yummy food , the great prices and the friendly , cozy atmosphere .	1262
0	i 'm writing his post because you do n't want my wife to . very very very slow service . people were getting served their food that were seated 30 minutes after us .	1558
1	love the local 30 % m-th . the bathrooms could use a little extra tlc but the services and sauna were great . will definitely go again !	2651
1	wow really good and fun ! we picked the topping and sauce and within minutes we had an amazing pizza . i want to go again the possibilities are endless .	282
0	tough sell here in arizona . when i heard about the death metal comment . i 'm good ... . blaming others etc . godbless and good luck	3393
0	the worst experience i have ever had at a nail salon . the short guy that works there is very rude and ruff . he filled my nails and painted the gel on all over my cuticles , my 10 year old could of done a better job . and when i told him to fix it he was kind of mad at me like it 's my fault he ca n't paint . basically i just made him stop and literally walked out . so do n't waist your money . i should of reviewed the comments before walking in there .	2922
1	date night . we ate @ picea977 last night . everything was fresh and well-made . the service was very good , helpful and friendly . the salads were delicious . i had the beet salad and he had the arugula . and yes , the pizza did take a while , but we preferred the atmosphere to libretto or terroni 's where i feel like people are looking over my shoulder to see if i 'm almost finished ready to take in more customers .	257
0	one step above a hole in the wall buffet place . food was edible . very bland , service was very un-attentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot . i 'll take my money elsewhere .	1264
0	i was greeted by a fleeting `` she 'll help you in a sec '' , followed by a silent head nod , which i guess was my prompt to order . i wanted something with meat , but the smell in here drove me away from that . my brc was good , typical pepe 's quality , which i love , but the weekend morning crew need to step it up a little bit	857
0	just left the tropicana movie theater there was roaches everywhere in that snack bar area in the ginger punk in the front is just a full-blooded idiot	611
1	after a miserable experience with yes a.c a few years ago i was pleasantly surprised by the professional , and rapid service performed by dr . cool without any upselling attempts . our ac went out and i expected the worse . i filed a claim with ahs and immediately was referred to dr . cool . i called and bruno arrived with 40 minutes . he expertly diagnosed the problem [ a bad condenser fan ] , replaced it , checked the system and was done in around one hour . i will use these guys from now on for all maintenance and service work on our ac and furnace . i trust these folks and recommend them .	2776
1	this is a great place to enjoy `` taco tuesday '' . they have cheap amazing tacos and their house margaritas are delicious . i normally would have something negative to say about a business , although that is not the case here . you can definitely expect me here more frequently .	1346
1	been here twice in the past two days - and ordered the thai chicken salad each time ! it 's just that good , and the portions are huge . great view of the pool and shaded , with fans to protect from the heat .	1299
1	excellente place que vous passiez juste prendre un bon thé ou café ou que vous vouliez vous asseoir et manger un brownie décadent ou un grill cheese aux oignons caramélisés . le personnel est sympathique , pas stressé et ne met pas de pression pour consommer . les enfants sont les très bienvenus et ont de quoi s occuper ! !	184
0	never fun to negatively review a place that has so much potential . the view , amazing , the service and food ... less then desirable . the wait for your food is very long and when it finally arrives it is sub par . it 's a bit like the twilight zone at times , no apologies and almost like its normal for a sale to take 45 minutes . time for new management , chef and menu .	751
0	used them a lot and generally , i never have a problem . but one caveat -- if you book online , you are required to prepay your parking . if you ever have to reschedule your parking dates , or cancel them , you can almost never get a refund , despite them saying that they will refund you . even after you contact them and they tell you in writing via email that they will credit the refund to your credit card , they do n't !	2531
1	flew allegiant airlines from eugene , or to lax . people who checked us in were friendly and helpful . flight attendances were friendly also . it was a pleasant experience and felt no different than any other airline . plane was a little cramped , but what do you expect for $ 49 ? i will definitely fly with them again .	3127
0	under construction ! ! ! the hotel and downtown scottsdale ! was awoken @ 3 am to the sound of heavy equipment and @ 4 am the jackhammering began . it maybe okay again in the future but i would avoid staying here for the next several months .	3843
0	do n't go there at night you might get robbed walking out . bartender called the cops and me out to be the bad guy ... will not be back	1295
0	went in a couple months back to try to sell some gold and diamond jewelry..no luck . the place looks like you 're walking into an 80 's pawn shop..very outdated . the young pretentious guy was long winded and tried to rob me , saying my diamonds were n't worth much , because of the cut . i will stick to ebay to get more money for my jewelry . they have an ebay store too , which is how i first tried them out , later realizing i totally overpaid for a tiny diamond pendant . never again .	3804
1	loved going to the senior day not only for the discounts for the regal movies but also same day is 50+ and you get a lot of perks like getting a chance of winning the slot game they have for free , do not have to put a dime or dollar into any slot machine , just go to the area where they are playing the game for senior 50+ ! they changed some of the eateries , the cafe is still nice and the buffet is ok .	3947
1	very friendly staff , easy to talk to , made me feel comfortable . i look forward to my journey with family doctors of green valley	297
1	amazing customer service . i actually wanted to leave 4 stars , because i have rented twice and had a considerable wait time ( just because it 's been so busy ) , but i have been treated so well that it totally overshadows any wait time . there are so many locations to choose from , but knowing how well they take care of you ( and how friendly they are ) , it really makes a difference !	1863
1	amazing seekh kababs ! probably the best in calgary ( hint : do n't get the spicy seekh kabab unless you have an infinite amount of time for a session at the nearest washroom if you know what i mean )	1303
0	we used to come here every weekend for football games , but have noticed that it has been extremely cold . we are leaving in the middle of watching the raiders/chargers and dolphins/packers game because we ca n't stop shivering . i asked the people around us and they agreed . turn on your heat !	1520
0	hey get the blonde , the one with the light blonde hair ... off the drive through window . i think i went through half a tank of gas waiting , with only two cars in front of me . where is the regular a.m. guy at ? ?	2358
1	these folks were so kind ! ! when calling around all the well known hotels they would not get us in before 10 and even than they wanted to charge fees fees fees.. motel 6 let us in and gave us a bday discount ! ! ( they really left the light on for is )	3772
1	simply the best ! ! has been my go to store for many of years . amazing employees , customer service , food , coffee , clothes and deal ! !	1907
0	do n't tell anyone but i have a weakness for mcdonalds chicken mcnuggets . today i ordered myself a ten piece and a large order of french fries . after i paid , the guy at the second drive thru window said i needed to park and wait for the fries . i said no thank you and left .	504
1	why only 5 stars ? would n't let me give them 6 ! ok , just saw this place , and had to try . ordered the half dozen , where the person behind the counter picks them out . only she let us pick most of them out . the maple bacon long john , was not a choice for that deal . so , we got 7 donuts , and all we 've tried are simply amazing ! steve	2053
0	the guy working here is rude does n't greet you and just throws the receipt and straw at you . it 's like hey you hate your job quit and go next door and work there maybe then your endorphins will kick in and put you in a better mood .. jerk ! !	3302
0	what a sandwich ... .they say . no it 's not the best ! why ? # 1 the bread is old and hard to chew , # 2 the veggies they put in the sandwich a joke ! 2 slices tomatoes about 5 shreds of thin lettuce and a pinch of sprouts ! # 3 they refused to give peppers on the side `` because they are free '' all this for $ 8.00 not including chips or drink . however the racist remarks and bad attitude are free ... yes mexicans do eat sweet peppers too ... .i prefer them on the side ! ! !	1475
0	incredibly difficult to get in contact with from management . 6 calls and no answer , no offer of help . used to be great . i would n't recommend this place after my experience .	3730
1	seriously my favorite cleaners in vegas ! the two girls that 's work there are always so friendly and helpful . my clothes have always been on time and i 've never had one single problem with any of my garments . other cleaners tend to mess something up from time to time and/or misplace something . at eco cleaners , they 've even given me stuff back that they 've found in my pockets ! it may seem little , but seriously how many other cleaners can you say that will do that ? i 'm a weekly customer and need everything to be on time and on schedule and i would n't have it any other way than eco cleaners ! -joe soto	1596
1	i have been going here for over 7 years . i wont go anywhere else and i live in phoenix . love johnny ; nails are perfect every time ...	415
0	doctor did not thoroughly assess issue with foot . did independent research and my symptoms match more with another issue than the one this doctor recommended . doctor has lots of experience , however attitudes changed in his office once i questioned getting a boot for treatment . more in the business of quickly seeing patients as numbers rather than actually analyzing what the issue could be .	974
1	i stayed here for about 10 days . my stay was so long i think i knew or had at least said hi to everyone who worked there . i ca n't say enough good things about this place . very cute hotel and affordable . staff were friendly and accommodating . clean rooms . quiet . really worth staying here if you are visiting cleveland .	2188
0	security at this establishment does n't make you feel `` secure . '' just about every time i 've been in there , a homeless person has tried to panhandle money from me or cigarettes . management fires the good employees and the building is old and needs to be renovated in a major way .	2928
1	tina did a great job ! ! i brought in a picture of what i wanted and she did exactly that . i will definitely be making nails with love my new nail salon . the pedicure was amazing and ended with a hot stone massage ( amazing ) . it truly was great ! ! ! my gel manicure was also great ! i brought a picture of a very detailed design that i wanted and tina did exactly what i wanted . the salon was clean and the people were really nice . ca n't ask for more than that . i will definitely be back .	1429
1	great , local bakery , lots of brazillian sweets , which are pretty similar to french pastries . very reasonable prices ... 2 huge desserts , a tea and coffee for less than $ 8 ! i look forward to having an excuse to head back to mavis drive ... lots of shopping about .	3184
0	not as good as it used to be - the pho is really bland now , they were skimpy on our bean sprouts ( 1 wimpy plate of all the toppings for 2 bowls of pho ! ) and service is not great . also , they have a new menu that is way smaller and does n't have pictures . the old one was cheezy , but i kinda liked it . : )	673
0	i decided to come to this panaderia because i had the worst craving for a mexican pastry . personally , i thought the selection was quite limited . after i perused the pastries , i ended picking one that looked like some type of roll . when i took it out of the bag i noticed that it was so oily the paper bag looked like it contained french fries , not a dessert . one thing that bothered me the most is that there was a fly inside the bakery that you know was landing on any food it could get on . not sanitary . it was flying around in front of them , they could 've at least tried killing it .	1845
0	love bodyheat tanning , but this location lacks good personnel . visited march 18 , the girl who worked the front desk was rude , insulting , rolled her eyes , and i will never visit this location again ! love aliante location ! employees there always eager to help , and always have a smile on their face !	1314
1	i love the concept of this place ! ! ! i come here quarterly to sell the kids ' out grown clothes , toys , furniture , etc . then i purchase whatever i need . they have sales and some things have the tags on them . they get picky sometimes with what they buy from you , but that 's because they may already have too much on hand . do n't take it personal . chk their website first before selling so you know the tips to get the most back .	2018
0	i go here all the time for to-go orders and i swear half the time it takes 15 minutes and my order is ready and the other half of the time it takes about an hour . today in particular i waited for a full hour and got over cooked chicken with no honey , rice that is so hard it is inedible and mashed sweet potatoes that i would n't serve to a dog with how over cooked they are . why are we waiting an hour for terrible food ?	1549
1	always go to oceans when visiting from nyc . i only go here for the exotic fruit that isnt available in the us . store is always clean and always busy .	2069
1	gilbert center for family medicine has been my primary doctor 's office for 10 years . they are wonderful at getting me in in emergencies and getting me the medical assistance i need . i especially like the fact they have a blood lab on site ! their new location is super organized and nice . it is a pain to have to wait sometimes for my appointment time , but i understand the doctors and nps are taking their time with the patients - just like they will with me .	1562
1	i love this company they 've been around for years and are not only honest but efficient . you can count on them to do the right thing and give superior service . i will use them in the future .	3654
0	i really wanted to give them a good review based on the facts that so many yelpers love them but i just could n't get myself to do it . after the first bite of their seafood pancake , i knew my expectations were too high for this place . the pancake was bland and it tasted more like an egg fooyoung ( sp ? ) than a korean pancake . it was soooo thick ! i also ordered their beef sondoobu but they gave me the yook kae jang instead . again , very bland with lots of spice ( i liked the spice ) . i 'll stick to my regular korean spot on the southwest side and chinatown .	435
0	they stop and give me a ticket and a hot female can just get off . that 's bs phx pd . kiss my you know what .	2322
0	a few months ago i asked them to order a hogue grip for my s & w 65 . they told me it would take a week . when i did n't hear from them i called . they told me it was back ordered . i had my doubts when i was told it would be ordered and would be in a week later . i still have n't heard from them . i ordered one from midwayusa and received it less than a week later . their communication with customers is deplorable . i suppose if they have your item in stock it 's fine just do n't ask them to order anything .	2247
1	i have eaten pizza all over the country . i like all of the various types of pizza . metro is one of my top go to spots in las vegas for new york style pizza . i love the old new york with pepperoni added . i want high quality ingredients , a chewy crust , and the right balance of sauce . metro always delivers . the new $ 14 bottle of wine deal is also a great deal . i 'm giving this 5 stars because it is definitely under rated here .	192
0	why even make an appointment ? ! ? ! it seems like all the employees just ignore you . i brought my two daughters and grandmother in and we wo n't ever give this company our business again . the two stars are for the ladies that did my little girls mani pedi . they were gentle with them and for their first pedi it was good . i wish customer service was at the top of the priority list . there are too many options in the lake norman area not to give great service .	3603
0	the drinks are good & strong ! but the service and overall experience was a complete fail . the 1st bartender scoffed when i asked for recommendations , which is by no means an outrageous question to ask . we were told to `` read the menu , i have no idea what you would like '' ! nice ! how about just naming the most popular drink , seriously how hard is that ! the 2nd bartender was openly appalled by my rum choice , which i found bizarre . she brought over the 2nd bartender to exclaim over my choice once again making me repeat my order to her colleague . this was bizarre and blatantly rude . not worth lining up for !	292
1	great little motel . a bit dated , but very clean . staff was very accommodating and helpful . the breakfast was well maintained ( the eggs were a bit weird ) . but all in all , a great experience . easy access from the 10 with more than ample parking for large vehicles . we will be back if ever in phx .	1335
0	i was for a dinner since friends stayed at the four seasons . a much smaller venue than i expected and the table to narrow that my 'neighbour ' next table elbows constantly touched mine . the food : had their square pizza - typical thick pizza ( thinking pizza hut ) , cheese and basil is fresh , but , the price tag is a bit scary . also ordered duck pasta - it was nothing spectacular and tasted like shredded pork in cheesy sauce . wo n't be a second visit .	833
0	great staff . soggy hotdog . unique menu . soggy wings . i guess , great price but a little disappointed from all the reviews .	1566
1	i love love love these guys they did an awesome job ! they gave me a great deal on the install . rigo and the whole team . took care of all of ladies that where stuck in pep boys ... ladies these guys are the best and wo n't ripe you off	2263
0	the woman answering the phones is horrible . she can not speak clearly , and is rude . she hung up on me twice . also my order took well over an hour to be delivered to my house and i am right down the street . it 's a joke .	987
0	items in my luggage was stolen in a virgin america flight and now i am in my fourth call to them trying to get reimbursed . this is the virgin america experience . update : they just said they will do nothing .	1623
0	staff and vets are friendly and nice but it seems very expensive . recently brought in my dog and was given prescription meds . came back to get a refill and was stunned by the price . later saw the same medication online for about half the price . do n't understand how they can get away with charging that much .	2165
0	never ordering from this place again . they have just changed the pizza oven two weeks ago which cost their pizza to be cook more evenly . this means that every time you order pizza from them the bottom of the pizza will be black ... but they will argue with you that it is not burned but this is how a pizza is supposed to be . horrible service	459
1	i love this store ! so much selection , and sales people are very helpful , not pushy , they do n't follow you around like vultures . there is a discounted selection of furniture in the back too , returned items , or custom pieces that were returned . there are a variety of price points , so that you can be mindful of different budgets . i bought a sofa today , and the sales person was great . i did n't have to go throughout a lot of hassle , and they were able to schedule a delivery time that worked best for me . and they have free starbucks , what could be better !	2071
0	got a $ 20 haircut on tuesday . i guess it is true you get what you pay for . i have n't had a haircut this uneven since i was a kid and i tried cutting gum out of my hair !	2591
1	i love this store ! i was greeted at the door and was asked if i needed help ! i had a question about my hp printer , results in 2 minutes ! then they walked me to all the computer supplies on my list . i was out of there in 15 minutes . maybe the price is a little more than walmart , but it is worth it !	3192
1	stopped in because i 'm alway shopping at frys so i thought why not give them a try . i 'm so glad i did ! i always ask for a specific shape and ann was able to get it done ! i love them . great customer service and very accommodating . will be back and recommend them to others as well .	3390
1	all experience with national stone was just awesome ! ! ! ! from first moment when i called them to get estimate and last moment when i paid , shake zane 's hand and leaved very happy . their customer service , care for customer and taste were unbelievable . jim came to my house at my requested time ( at 7am ) . theresa , zane and mo helped me to choose the perfect quartz for my shiny white kitchen from ikea and save lots of money ( what is a big plus : ) ) ) . my kitchen was done very quick and neat . i definitely will go back to them again and will recommend to all my friend .	2090
0	team was nice and answered questions however they literally look one hour to box 3 packages . borderline embarrassing . i use to like ups stores but their franchised stores are poor at best .	1320
0	would give this place zero stars if i had that option . # 1 - terrible service # 2 - dirty for a restaurant . shoes were sticking to floor , i did not even bother using their washroom # 3 - food was okay , nothing spectacular enough for me to rmbr ... # 4- chinese take out box concept was cute # 5- better then going to random ghetto fast food restaurant around the area ... at least their fried food is made with fresh ingredients .	688
1	i got a coupon in the mail for a free oil change here so i decided to bring my mazda by . austin in the service department was so nice and thorough . he brought a few issues to my attention and i completely trusted him . he ran through the list of items that needed attention and made sure i understood everything . i think i found my new shop for service and repairs !	2816
0	the apartments are very nice but the staffing there is horrible . especially one in particular by the name of joanne . she was very rude , stuck up and unprofessional . somebody needs to tell her that she sucks at her job .	2033
1	very helpful staff . groupon made it very affordable . we had a tremendous time . even for novice ! !	3936
1	i have lived at liv northgate gilbert going on three years . this property has the most amazing amenities and events that any complex could offer . the maintenance staff is right on top of things . the new office staff is fantastic . it is a family friendly atmosphere where you can feel at home if you 're 21 or 91 .	2609
1	if you are a matcha lover like i am , you will love this place . hands down , mcm has the best matcha soft serve in vegas . delish !	2984
1	i love dr k ... .he is professional , friendly and does great work ! ! ! i just found out dr k has new office personnel who care about his patients as much as he does . great news . i 'll be back , no doubt about it now ! ! ! ! ! ! !	2953
1	what an amazing restaurant for healthy and fresh food ! i love the vegan veggie burgers with gluten free buns and the kale quinoa and lime bowl ! my daughter asks to go here so often . this is now one of our most favourite eateries in charlotte ... such good food we crave ! ! thank you b.good ! ! !	1269
0	i do n't know how the other barbers are , but the older white man , do n't go to him . rude , crappy and needs to get his eyes checked to do line ups because obviously he does n't know how a straight line looks	3600
1	thank you nothing bundt cakes for donating mini bundt cakes to the junior league ! i had my first bundt cake ( white chocolate ) last night and it was absolutely , perfectly , amazing ! ! ! ! i thought i would take a bite to try the cake out , expecting it to be good ... it was so good , i finished the whole cake ! the white chocolate bundt cake was moist , had a perfect amount of frosting drizzled on top and down the middle and raspberries in the cake . cake flavor was delicious ! i will definitely be in to pick up some more soon to share with friends .	18
1	had dinner here tonight with my fiancé . we got excellent service from derek , who made some awesome recommendations on the mac and cheese and fettuchini alfredo . atmosphere is relaxing and quiet . i loved the black martini and the super fruit cosmo . we 're looking forward to coming back soon !	1529
1	i 've gotten several haircuts here over the years and they 're always great . the employees are friendly and make you feel welcome , and the prices have always been reasonable . i recommend may 's hair salon to anyone looking to get a quality haircut for a good price while helping out a local small business .	887
1	i am more familiar with inflatable bouncies , but this was still quite fun for little ones . we did n't feel like bouncing that day , so we left it to the kiddos go at it while we sat and chatted . i do like the separate little children 's area . there 's a coffee bar , drinks and snacks are available at the cafe . nice lounge area with a flat screen for daddies that could n't do without sports . overall , a good place to relax and have the children play . i can see this again on my list come summer time !	1664
1	customer service is nice so any things is clean i was looking for some lumber just take time around and 10 minutes .	1820
1	one stop shopping . no need to select stone at one location and the try to find finishing and installation . these people know their `` stuff '' ! best price in town for the complete package . job was done to perfection . owners should be proud that they offer this kind of great product and service . we show off our countertops with pride !	2090
1	my daughter and i just wandered into this salon - how lucky for us ! ! ! great products - skin care line is exceptional . they have a beautiful clean space - soothing music - wonderful staff that all understand and communicate with you in english . manicures and pedicures are amazing ! ! also - after it all - they do a neck and upper back massage ! ! exceptional services and wonderful staff ! ! ! our new 'go to ' place for any pamper me services . have also heard they do outstanding facials ... . that is the next on my list ! ! highly recommend ! !	2148
0	not my usual 24 hour fitness locations at this morning i saw something that is just disgusting . man was standing outside the jacuzzi and scraping his feet the desk staff did not seem overly concerned about him spreading his human petri dish all around a place where people walk barefoot and right in front of the opening to the water . i will not be back	392
1	this evening i watched an air force gentleman come in order his sub and the young lady working there thanked him for his service and paid for his sub out of her own pocket . glad to see there are still good people in this world . she deserves a raise !	1475
1	i can only comment on the first floor . where else can you find dollar drafts in this area ? once my friends and i saw the sign , we settled in for hours , particularly with the awesome , live hair metal just outside . $ 1 rolling rock and hamm drafts ? yes , please . i thought the gaming staff were nice as well , and this an inexpensive , but fun place to hang out .	3630
1	great sushi . the galbi is the best in the city . i have tried to find better but none can compare ! the service is very good . the servers are attentive and knowledgeable .	740
0	i made a 6pm appointment in advanced a few weeks prior . i walk in and was told to wait . a few minutes later another lady walks in and they take her instead first . poor customer service . besides that , the interior sucks . it looks like a shitty ghetto fix up .	2686
0	i was prepared to go out and have a good time , when this establishment turned me away , told me i could n't take part in underwear night besucase i was in four inch heels . as a femme gay man , i felt rather attacked . they told me `` it 's a gentleman 's night and heels make it drag . '' so do n't try to get in to this gay bar if you 're `` too gay '' ! i will not be back .	3661
1	overall a decent dollar tree . i 've been here maybe 6 times or so . the lines are n't too bad , but usually dollar tree 's are pretty good about lines . the primary flaw to this dollar tree is they have zero shopping carts . they actually steal shopping carts from other businesses , so that 's a little ridiculous , but other than that a positive experience .	963
0	we 've been searching for a replacement since our other cleaners moved on , and it seems , after several months of trying new people , we have arrived .	2029
1	food is mediocre and service is okay , they are trying to `` up '' the service . last night my hockey team and i stopped by for some food and to watch the jays -- our normal waitress ( tatiana ? ) was pretty great ! nachos on the house and food came out quick ! my diet coke was already on the table before i even got there ... and they have barking squirrel beer ! tuesday is half priced wings and if you ask nicely for garpar ( not on the menu ) you might just get it ! bear in mind it is medium wings with grated cheese never busy but always regular !	1112
1	i wish a had more stars to give . i 've moved 4 times in the last 2 years and have used these guys every time . i 've had the pleasure of having just about the same crew for every move - steve , kam and ben - they absolutely rock ! they are so professional , very quick and beyond careful with all of my belongings . they always show up at the expected arrival time , they get straight to work and are very efficient with their time . i will , without a doubt , continue to use them and recommend them to all my friends and family . thank you guys for being so amazing ! !	1645
1	visit # 2 was as great as the first ! yum ! maple long john and a homer donut for my niece and i , and cosmic brownie for my nephew ! customer service was great , quick , and the staff is so friendly : ) way to go hurts donut !	2053
1	my sister and i bought an rv trailer 16 ft in las vegas nevada our first . we could n't have had a better sales rep was raymond juvera , we put him thru hell and winded up given him our business , he went way beyond for us new owners . if and when we are ready to upgrade we will be back to see ramen again and bluedog rv . please do if you go there to look for an rv ask for him you have the best experience .	1353
1	i really enjoyed my meal here . the decor is really nice and the staff was really helpfull in navigating the long menu . i started off with some dim sum that was very well crafted and freshly made . the shrimp dumplings and crunchy chicken were outstanding . the two highlights of the meal were the scallops and green beans . i was too full for dessert , so that means i will have to head back . you do get a fortune cookie ! ! one tip ... they charge $ 20 for 3 hours of parking ... you can do better at a lot around the corner .	1441
0	one of the few gas stations in vegas that does n't sell 40 oz beers or single tall cans . everyone else in town does , why do n't you fools sell it ?	3814
0	cash is so horrible and i will never give my money to a club that is so awful to patrons . the dj was so mean , left her booth several times to yell at people who were simply trying to dance and have fun . a place that is supposed to be open to all to have a good time turned out to be extremely judgmental and terrible . i would n't recommend you give any time or money to this horrific place .	2860
1	rissa j. needs to lay off the heroin and chill the fuck out . she wins , machine does n't print out the ticket and she losses her shit . the bartenders did all they could but it was up to the slot tech to fix the issue . rissa was yelling across the bar at other guests and yelled at the bartenders . if anything they had a lot of patience to deal with her annoying , loud obnoxious ass !	1520
1	purchased a mountain bike at this location as a christmas gift . very happy with the bike , the price , and the service . i have been to other locations and not been very happy with the service . the manager at this location was very helpful , friendly , and knowledgeable ; just great customer service .	3911
1	i 'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews for this company . they did an amazing job on my house and the landscaping was n't bad either . i do n't think people on here understand you 're supposed to tidy up your house a bit before they come . they 're also on a 2 week rotation . one visit they do basic cleaning and the next they do detailed . it would be impossible for them to complete both in one visit given their time restraints and large clientele .	2994
0	these people and their employees are a piece of work . got taken by no fault of my own and the owner took a what cha gon na do attitude not gon na persue them over a 3 month contract and he knew it . masssage sucked young cutsie pie girls lack customer support skills and owner is a piece of work	3862
0	they have a horrible answering service ! ! ! i 've been trying to call for the past hour and no answer at all ! ! ! it just keeps on ringing	3059
0	i normally do n't like to give bad reviews on yelp . however , i 've gone twice to kelly 's bar and lounge and had an unsatisfying experience . i felt completely unwanted to be there from the staff . i do n't expect over the top service but i want to feel okay being there which i did n't . we ended up leaving without getting any food because they kept on ignoring us and being unkind .	279
0	my husband and i come here a lot but we will be backing off . this location is inconsistent with their blasts and scoop sizes . my blast was under filled by an inch ( i thought it would be filled to the top ) and there was no candy sprinkled on top . we 've been disappointed lately and do n't feel it is going to continue to be worth the money .	3493
1	good music , beautiful people ! we had a cabana reserved last night , and i thought it was funny to have bottle service with an led flashing rod ( a replacement for actual sparklers , which was kinda strange ) . i do wish it was more inclusive for gay people ; there was a massive crowd but no same sex couples among all the straighties . shout out to janae ( sp ? ) our server , who was so helpful and friendly ! dj was awesome in a glamorous environment ( but have a well sized wallet )	2553
1	we enjoyed excellent service and very good food . salads were perfect as was soft shell crab and chicken livers . broad pasta was excellent as was scottish beef . very good and extensive wine list . wonderful experience and good value for the price	286
1	my most favourite place ever for chinese desserts ! not only are the prices super reasonable , but the food is delicious ! the staff and service is excellent too ! and their tea is really good . i particularly love the design of the store . it is very traditional and not too modern ; it reminds us of the chinese culture and history . it 's a perfect place to hang out with family and friends . the black sesame soup , steamed egg , fried milk , steamed noodle rolls , rice pots , are only a few of my beloved dishes here . i will no doubt be returning ! : )	1062
0	pretty pricy korean place , wo n't come back again . came here wanting to have bbq , but a plate of short ribs is $ 15 while i can get ayce for that price somewhere else . ended up ordering regular stuff . tried cow ribs soup ( so small ) , grilled fish ( i swear the fish weights less than 0.5lb ) , and rice sausage ( flavour was bland , no seasoning ) not coming here again that 's for sure	396
1	everyone was very sweet and our nails turned out fantastic ! great customer service and great pricing ! i recommend this place to everyone !	1838
1	this was my 4th cleaning ... love them ! ! ! i have used for both carpet and mattress cleaning . the staff rocks ... so nice and professional . special shoutout to jeremy & joe who just did a beautiful job on my home carpet today . see you guys in another 6 months . thank you , you 're the best .	1273
1	cute little place ! got here around 7pm , about an hour before closing . bf wanted something off of the savory crepes menu , but we were told they were n't serving any savory crepes at this time.. not sure if they ran out of ingredients or they just stop serving them at a certain time . we got the smores crepes instead & it was delicious . it was packed with a ton of nutella .	1011
1	i went for the basic oil change a few weeks ago . i had a good experience and will return . they completed my change within twenty minutes . that is good enough in my opinion . thank you terrible 's ! !	1544
1	this place is excellent ! ! 5 star customer service and they also got my son 's damaged i pad screen fixed in 60 mins ! ! he really needed it repaired quickly for school ! ! stop in and asj for morgan he is the best ! ! !	1104
0	sushi is decent and fresh . service is very slow . travelzoo voucher users are not treated the same as regular walk-in . for example , sunday family specials are not available . even with the vouchers , this place is overpriced . without the vouchers , this place is outrageously overpriced . skip this place and go to aoyama ( when i do n't go ) or cafe michi or zen which are close by and much , much better .	422
0	there really starting to fall apart . been a member for over 2 years and machines are always broken and takes forever to get fixed . towel service has been on and off . the air conditioner seems to never be on always hot and they have the fans on but all it 's doing is blowing hot nasty air around . i 'm not the only member complaining a few even left to go to other gyms . when i first was a member here i would of given this place 5 stars	2328
0	ordered tandoori grill , worst chicken , stale chicken , the grill chicken had a stale smell and was too dry and hard to bite , seemed like it was recooked and it was tasteless too , got biryani for my kids , portion size was too small , no value for money , biryani too was tasteless and being an indian i feel sad to say this is the worst indian restaurant in phoenix .	202
0	i only give a one star rating because you ca n't put a zero . do not get your hair done here ! ! ! ! they messed up my hair & did n't even dye it the way i wanted . they did it their own way without even asking or talking to me about it until after it was done . even when i mentioned i did n't like the color they did nothing about it . worst decision of my entire life ! ! !	1117
0	worst eyebrow place i 've ever been to . they always thin my eyebrows and fuck up my shape and i have to grow them out and go somewhere else to get them fixed . do n't come here	460
0	i have stopped coming because the food is not that great , the chicken has an after-taste and i have had better food . if it were not for the friendly manager and some employees , i would have not been such a glutton for punishment . the red-haired cashier will ring up your order , and then go to the men 's and women 's restrooms to empty the trash , bringing it through the kitchen ( how tasty ) and then prepare the rice and rest of the meals without washing her precious little hands . i am sure the health department will enjoy this review .	474
1	i came to smart fix with a laptop that had cracked screen : ( after calling around for quotes , i was driving one day and saw their business and decided to go in just to see if by chance they may be a little cheaper than the quotes i had received and they were ! i was very happy with the repair and the guys at the store called me as soon as it was ready . i will save their info for any other repairs i may need down the line	1104
1	spiced rum daiquiri is amazing . so was the famous deli . sooo good . lived the chipotle sauce and sweet potato fries as well . service was excellent and food tasty . very reasonable prices and big portions . love it !	534
0	worst whole foods store ! ! ! they can not keep up with their inventory ! ! they hire the most miserable unfriendly employees . most of them look depressed/unhappy . at least put an act on or something geez ! lol they are definitely in need of improvement .	3874
0	if you like sushi that has mayo , cream cheese , and is deep fried , this is your place . i did n't love it . the stir fry tofu was not bad . but overall it 's too pricey for the portions , especially the sushi .	912
1	one of my favs ! absolutely ! they make this spicy shrimp dish - it used to be available as an appetizer , but now it 's offered as an entree . yummy ... i luv it !	600
1	only used the pharmacy . was on a week long business trip and had to ask a pharmacist a question . very knowledgeable and professional and helped me with all my purchases . it is a small mini store on asu campus but next to raod so easy in and out .	3318
0	it took me about 20 min to get my drink . the waiter is rude and unprofessional . she gave me an attitude even i think she is a racist . the jazz music is good but i guess they mostly welcome white people ... .was very upset and disappointed	3295
1	great food . there wings are delectable . i always love their food and they are pretty fast for delivery . thanks again for some amazing food ! definitely recommend for first timers !	987
1	took my wife in looking for something to spice up valentine 's day . if you go and need help ask for sam . not sure what to say about the rest of the store but sam was amazing helping her find something that fit right , and because of her help the wife looked amazing and confident in what she wore out on our date that weekend . thanks sam because of you she will be back .	3234
1	love that this park is in our area ! my kids love to feed the ducks and play in the gated playground area . summer time is especially fun for them when the sprinklers are on in the playground . overall an excellent place .	367
0	came here for 2 bowls..what a shame..i kept asking for extra and he would n't give it to me and just ignored me..then got annoyed when i told him if he can add extra steak ... the bowls were so small not like a regular chipotle..waste of money and time ... do n't get annoyed at people when your suppose to do a simple job .	214
0	do n't go here if you have a job ... or a life . they make you be a member ( $ 50 a month ) and never have appointments available on weekends or evenings so that you can actually use your masssages . my boyfriend has 26 massages built up and every time he goes to cancel his membership they let him know that he 's going to lose his massages ... ..that 's $ 1300 of services he 's paid for that he ca n't redeem at any location . he tried to authorize me to use some of those massages ... . $ 10 transfer fee , you can only transfer one massage every 6 months .	1950
1	i love this dunkin donuts location ... .they are so much faster than many others . great service and they do n't burn my wraps like the one on crismon.. .	1770
1	adopted our beautiful 2 year old cat here a little over a month ago . the sunnyslope location is beautiful and well-maintained . the only problem was that our cat already had an upper respiratory infection when we adopted him . however , you receive two free vet visits ( including medicine , tests , etc . ) if the pet has an illness that they might have gotten while being at the humane society . they are also great about following up with us to see how the cat is doing and providing helpful tips to make him more comfortable in his new home .	1980
0	waste of time , staff was very unprepared and not helpful . if i could give zero stars i would .	2906
1	hubby and i love this place . we 've had chinese food all over the country , including chinatown in san francisco , and we think the food here is just great . the sauces are so delicious , the veggies are crisp , they put a ton of shrimp in their dishes , and the meats are good quality ( some buffets have really fatty , tough meat ) . if you want the buffet , you need to be here between 11:30 and 1:30 when dishes are hot and fresh . they have additional dishes at the dinner buffet , but we think lunch is the best deal . hope this place never changes .	1575
0	wanted to thank you for driving all the way out here and your closed ... says your open 10-4 and i pull up and your closed ! thanks for taking 40 minutes of my life i 'll never get back ! update your facts	550
0	i had read reviews mentioning the smell , and they were correct . the fish smell hits you in the face as soon as you walk in . if you can get past that ( my wife could n't ) , the store is ok. nice selection , but not as complete as new century which is in the same plaza .	1963
1	this is one of the most exquisite taco belles in all of the phoenix valley . all i can say is wow ! ! ! so . let me start with the décor . classic movie posters really put me in the mood for some authentic mexican food . now , let tell you that not all taco bells are created equal . this one is truly a cut above the rest . it 's finger lickin good . definitely recommend	3
0	father 's day dinner , not good ! the cook must love salt , because my chicken parm was sooooo salty . the calamari was soooo salty . the fish and chips was missing that light flakey batter . the long island drink special had way to much sour mix and ca n't help but wonder if he or she made me a virgin . picking new places to try is always a gamble .	717
1	i was skeptical based on reviews but gave it a shot one sunday afternoon . my friend and i had the best salads ! and we knew we were taking a chance ordering salads since it appears to be a sports bar . they were amazing and the fruity light summer ale the waitress suggested was awesome ! would def go back , prices seemed good too . - ordered the harvest salad -	211
0	do n't waste your money on their laser treatments ! did not only work as dr said i paid for more and still did n't work . either the laser or the `` laser tech '' failed . how much training did she have and why did they tell me this would work and it did n't work at all ! there was absolutely no change even the slightest improvement would 've been something . i feel robbed !	2430
0	this place is n't worth even one star . the owner/receptionist is shady . was quoted over the phone exactly what i wanted . how did just a blow out double in price over the phone to after i was done ? the guy who did it was great . but the owner is a money hungry liar ! ! ! ! ! ! i will never come back . u should be ashamed of yourself . and the girl who did my moms hair was even worse . bad day ! bad experience . the reason he could n't find me in the data base is cuz i do n't want you knowing who i am .	1617
0	the mongolian beef and chicken chow mein were very bland , and lacking on any major flavor .	1264
0	i can imagine how a new trainee is introduced to jambo mesa . here are the rides . some you have to push in order to operate . and you are the break , how much do you weigh again ? you will never have to vacuum the carpet or clean anything . make sure you roll your eyes and ignore people as much as possible . here is your ringworm and scabies treatment kit . you will get used to the smell of feet , but not on your first day . if something breaks , just keep using it . at all costs , act like you do n't care about how ghetto your workplace is .	3439
1	these guys are awesome ! i took a used bow in last saturday . they spent close to an hour checking it over , tuning it , and helping me set it up to my draw length . i asked `` how much do i owe you '' ? and they said $ 15 . i was expecting at less twice that for their time . then i told them i needed some arrows and some string wax . they took the time to find me some arrows at a reasonable price that would work well with my bow . i mean these guys are great . i will be going to them for all my archery supply needs .	471
1	amazing food , enough good options for vegetarians and gluten free needs . very nice staff . would totally recommend folks to eat here . the only thing i would like to see is more vegan gf options and a bigger place . if they did that i 'd likely quit cooking at home and eat here all the time .	640
1	we just ate here this evening , and we will definitely be returning . the customer service was phenomenal , and the wings were even better . cody greeted us as we walked in explained the entire menu , the favorites - spice levels , etc . our food came out just quick enough so you knew it was freshly cooked just for you . the owner came over to our table to ask how the food was and our one year old daughter was quite pleased with the french fries . it 's casual , but very clean recommend 100 % - yum .	1397
1	i had a great experience here at petland . i loved the staff . they were friendly knowledgeable and caring . no pushy tactics just good sales staff period ! i got a baby beagle here while i was just brousing missing mine who had just passed at 17 years 2 weeks prior . they offer a full puppy for life guarantee and full coverage of vet bills for the first 2 weeks should your baby contract anything . i love this place !	1894
1	very happy to see this place rise up . prices are good in general . plenty of savings can be found . service is excellent . workers are always friendly .	1904
0	hmmm i am a darn huge fan of kimpton hotels however when i booked here they failed to tell me there was street and building construction going on during my overnight stay . tisk tisk . this hotel met kimpton standards in decor and food and their famous happy hour but i never expected not to be told about construction jack hammers and all . will not stay at this particular location again for that lack of service .	3859
1	i 'm from new england and love my dunks ! i was c pleasantly surprised to find this on the same plaza as my new hair salon . i stopped by the drive through on my way home . there was no wait and they got my order right which equals a perfect trip to dd ! the lady working was n't overly friendly but the service was fine for me . i 'd def give this place a try - especially if you 're an unsweetened iced tea lover like myself !	618
1	while not quite true authentic japanese style ramen like you get at monta 's in vegas , it 's the best tasting ramen i 've found in the valley of the sun . i find the owner very personable and honest about his attempt at making ramen . he treats it as a work in progress and a constant learning process to find the right balance and above all ... consistency . practice makes perfect ... stop by and take a taste of the young masters craft !	131
1	they have really great calamari and spring rolls , their delivery is quick but they 're california rolls are okay	1231
1	slightly over rated and expensive ! ! ! but it 's still a lot of fun as long as you do n't go broke gambling the night away . good to visit at least once or maybe twice in your lifetime . and i do n't know why people want to bring their kids here ... sleaziness all over the strip ! do n't bring the babieeezzzz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	315
0	wow second update ... that 's a first for me . anyway , my new bumper popped out of place from az heat ( my best guess ) and the pearl white paint from my bumper to my fenders does not match only a month later . so much for all those additional charges the shop justified as needing to blend the paint to match ! we will be taking it to a new shop to have the mistakes fixed .	2654
1	it is strange but the food here taste a lot better than another location i have visited . had just a plain burger but it was really good . we had mussels , pizza , and a killer sausage dish for appetizers . the atmosphere with the multiple levels was very nice , and the staff was attentive . do n't kill me but i am not a beer drinker so the options of non beer drinks were limited .	670
0	wow ... i was going to leave a negative review of this place , but that would be like kicking a man when he 's down . crystal cleaners ... get real guys .	1053
1	we had 2 dogs and baby . we love aloft ! ! ( this was our second time aloft stay ) very clean room , nice bar ( bartender was nice : ) paid $ 50 for dogs but its refundable if dogs does n't destroy anything . one thing we did n't like it was waiting for pack in play about 40 min even we told them we have baby when we booked ( this is hotels.com 's fault ? ) but mostly very good experience . i do n't know why the review is not so good ? if they have a bath tub and complementary breakfast , it would be super perfect ! ! ; )	3522
1	great supply of all the good brands ... two reasons they do n't get five stars ... 1 ) i have waited over 20 mins to check out before and 2 ) $ 30 for professional make up application ... forget that - got to mac , buy $ 40 of makeup and get it done free and better ...	2479
1	i was desperately looking for a hotel . i was greeted by caitlin who did a wonderful job and finding us a room so late at night . it was nice to see that we had a hot breakfast for free . they even had happy hour from 5pm-630pm . my next trip to phoenix arizona i would definitely stay here .	1195
0	if you want 2 dead ants in your ketchup , definitely come to this place . i 'm disgusted and do n't even want to think about how many bugs are in their kitchen .	57
1	closest that i 've found to chinese food from back home ( i 'm from oahu hawaii ) . the only place that i 've found here in vegas with cake noodle . not as good but pretty close ( consistency is not as thick or firm as back home ) . too bad it 's so darn far from where i live ( centennial ) .	1103
0	i ask myself everyday how people stay in business . i have been trying to contact this company about their tours to the grand canyon for two days without a response . their phone rings twice and then rings busy . i have sent multiple emails with no response . it 's obvious they do n't need my business , if they do n't answer their phones , how do i know they will be in business at the time of my tour . moving on ,	2935
0	do n't waste your money ! you may as well take it and throw it into the garbage can . young staff who could care less about supporting your efforts . they just wanted to sell you more to up their commission or what ever they get from upgrading your treatments . injections , b12 none of it worked . i left with several more treatments . waste of time and money !	2168
1	if you love mexican style seafood , this is your place . the menu is in english , but i 've not had a waiter that spoke it . i do n't speak spanish , but i can point to what i like , so it 's always worked . as with most non-american restaurants , they are mucho kid friendly . they have booths and tables . the location is unappealing , as is the exterior , but if you live in phoenix , you 're used to it , so take a trip to mesa for this treat .	299
0	ordered a medium black milk tea boba , no whip cream on top , and blended - $ 5.06 total . the drink was not fully blended at the top portion and liquid at the bottom . it tasted bad . i have had many bubble teas before , and it did n't taste or resemble those other yummy drinks . hard to describe , but it had a taste of blended powder with a lot of artificial sugar . i was only able to take a few sips before throwing it away in the garbage . service was also very slow , there was only the one employee , and he moved slowly . very disappointing ...	2980
0	do not give these people money down to hold a car for you they will rip you off and not give you your money back if you change your mind i gave them 500 dollars plus 20 for their bs credit card fee never heard of that so 520 total now they say they installed a gps tracker in car put gas and washed it and had it all ready and when i ran into issues with their bogus finance charges and backed out of deal they said they are only refunding me 450 dollars and ive been waiting a week and still no credit on my debit card	2227
0	this place is bizarre . what 's with the huge curtain upon entry that serves no purpose and is just in the way of the line of people ordering . the service ? totally unengaging , unfriendly , and unhelpful . the system they have going on is completely unorganized and inefficient . i found the food very bland . and the atmosphere was what it is , an old car garage with new white paint . i will not be returning .	21
1	after playing here for more than a couple of times , i felt bad for my other review . i 'm now giving this place another star because 1 . there are not really any naggy kids anymore , seems like they 're gone 2 . if you get used to the arena , the bang bang rule kind of grows on you . and lastly 3 . i find the refs to be helpful and very chill . yea there are going to be those people that curse at you in the arena and overpriced snacks , but not everything is perfect .	3058
0	never ever shop here . they do not stand by their products . when faced with a complaint about a new bar stool purchase the manager said '' it 's your problem- put the stools in a yard sale '' . these were on sale for $ 350 each.refused to take back and refused to replace . total purchase over $ 4k . never again .	3872
0	honestly , this is a bit of a cheesy show for my taste . if you want to go see guys performing to choreography , tease you without revealing anything , and see mother-in-laws get dragged on stage to grope the host ... then this is the show for you . i will likely not be coming back here . like another reviewer on here stated ... i can see more at the beach for free .	2149
1	travis moore provided great customer service and was a pleasure to work with . i highly recommend reaching out to him regarding the purchase of a new vehicle .	1424
1	roberto 's taco shops have very authentic and tasty mexican food ... awesome frijoles , delicious shredded chicken tacos , rolled tacos , decent spanish rice , and so much more ! open 24 hours and they usually offer a great chicken taco deal on wednesdays ... 99 cents each !	322
1	great experience ! do n't neglect yourself and get all those suspicions moles and lesions treated at this professional and wonderful office !	3598
0	this place is very unprofessional . i made an appointment for 4 o'clock and i was not attended til 6 . regardless whether you made an appointment or not they take customers as they go . i had to run to the lady after she finished someone else 's set just so she can attend me next . this place is also very packed . i got my nails done by mickey and she did not do a very good job . she did it in 2 seconds and they were very crooked . the nail polish and acrylic nail did n't even cover my full nail nail . on top of that she was kinda rude to me and my friend .	2892
0	do not go here ! i arrived at 5:45 pm after noticing my dog excoriating her skin . the front office told me i would have to pay for an emergency visit . they close at 6 pm . the front office only seemed to care about getting out of there and going home . dr. hampe and lynne are very nice . neither of them were on today . do n't go there . now i see why their waiting room is never full . horrible way to treat someone .	1700
0	service is slooooooooooooooooooooow , waited 30 minutes just to get some snacks . overall the theater is nice , just needs to hire more people	2450
1	i 've been to this cafe rio location once . my cousin worked at the university at the time and it turned out to be the perfect place to meet up for lunch , especially since i 'm a big fan and she had never tried it before . as always , i ordered a burrito with enchilada sauce . i always mull over their menu looking for something new to try . when crunch time arrives , i seem to find myself settling for that . settling is not quite the right word , though , because it is always delicious and satisfying .	1365
1	an 80 's style comedy room . the owner is nice , the bartender is nice . great acts come through here . why would you not go ?	42
1	great show , loved the colors . very retro a true vegas must see . and the best part is all the longed legged lovelies half naked . great set design and production	3069
0	i had made several trips back to this restaurant and found the food quality was slipping each time . i finally stopped having dinners here and switched to appetizers when i dropped in . i also noticed that the wait staff had become more and more arrogant over time . apparently poor service , bad attitude and declining food quality along with high prices finally nailed them . they are closed !	13
0	stopped in on our way back from indiana . we are avid starbucks fans , frequenting starbucks all over the country . my wife 's misto was undrinkable , even after sending it back for a remake . first time ever we poured out a starbucks . this is not starbucks coffee !	3678
0	i went yesterday for mothersday and took my mom for the first time . read some reviews seemed like it would be a nice relaxing time . i was very disappointed . i thought it was just the guy i had no it was just the worst experience the massage we both had were too rough and left us both sore it was so painful . their massage techniques were terrible the worst i 've felt . we both need another massage . i 've definitely been to better spas . i will never go back and i recommend everyone to keep searching for another spa to go too this was waste of time & money .	2320
0	if i could give this place zero stars i would . after standing around waiting and watching a mechanic yell at another customer they finally asked how they could help me . i told them i simply needed to see if my tire was able to be plugged and the guy looks over his shoulder and goes `` uhh looks like we 're kinda busy . '' okay ? ... thanks for the help .	1778
0	the employee that goes by annie b , is the rudest more unhelpful person ever . she acts annoyed and agitated when you ask for help and makes you feel stupid for even asking . she definitely needs to work on her customer service skills	1782
0	beware- if u do n't specify in comments u will be forced to use level 1 . i found that out with my horrible hair cut . so i did every thing i could to get level 2 for my color and drove across town to be told 'sorry it 's a level 1 ' wow ! never again- i 'll pay a professional . bad cut and bad color is asking too much to try to help these students out .	354
0	i would not risk my 121 career coming here . very unfriendly and instead of making sure a pilot keeps flying , i got the impression she was trying to ground me . i was berated for having a cup of coffee in the morning , 2 hours before my physical . it was an overall uncomfortable experience .	3888
1	i came here to get my car smog and they were wonderful ! fast , easy , and professional . they also have a $ 5 military discount . i will come here for all of my other vehicles .	2208
1	as always this location is awesome ! they had 4 guys behind the counter and were super fast ! a fee people in front of us but they worked together and we had our food fast ! we got the italian and the club , both sandwiches were so good and fresh , the roast beef was nice and rare . you ca n't go wrong with any sandwich at this location . whoever owns this franchise is doing something right	1528
0	honnêtement , je ne comprends pas pourquoi ce restaurant est si achalandé et si bien coté ... d'abord , le poulet n ' a rien d'extraordinaire et la sauce piquante très grasse , les frites , mis à part les petites épices sur le dessus , n'ont rien de spécial non plus , sans compter le manque d'espace pour manger confortablement sur place . les cheveux du monde dans la file d'attente presque dans nos assiettes et tout , et tout le monde qui attend qui te regarde pendant que tu manges ... bien bien bien ordinaire , je ne retournerai jamais là-bas , même pas pour un take-out ! seul point positif , les sucreries et produits de boulangerie avaient l'air bien .	1109
0	stupid manager kayle did n't let me finish my coffee inside .	491
1	when you get a six month subscription that includes thursday and sunday papers , you ca n't really complain . the thursday edition includes the entertainment guide and also the department store ads for the coming weekend . the sunday edition is huge and includes the coupon section . if you use the coupons , one trip to the grocery store can pay for the entire subscription . overall a decent paper and worth the price when you get a subscription deal .	3511
0	i went to yolanda and was very disappointed.. her schedule was always incorrect . she ran late and i had to sit for up to one half hour . she never gave me full lashes . said i had to continue to come bk and she would add more . which did n't make since.. last appt i left because she booked a wedding party during my scheduled appt . she was always in a hurry.. i would not recommend this shop .	3639
1	went there for the black friday sales as i usually do every year . extremely knowledgeable staff , especially bob with the tool suspenders . staff is very friendly and the sales are good . nice store .	3567
0	i appreciate the one year guarantee on implant crowns , particularly because mine broke just shy of that year ! perhaps it was because the crown was sort of hollow , like a shell ; odd , since it was made to replace a molar . nonetheless , i was pleasantly surprised and grateful angel dentistry eventually honored their verbal guarantee , even if the front desk initially tried to tell me it was past the 1 year guarantee . ( thank god for credit & debit card transaction records ! )	3402
0	finally had reason to create a yelp account . came for a sunday night family dinner but there were 2 wedding receptions booked . competing sound systems with loud music and emcees , slow service , and generally terrible experience . one star for the ok food and sympathy for the wait staff .	0
0	i was n't very happy with the experience nor food . their eggs benni was disgusting . will not be coming back here again . def not top breakfast joint as blog to states .	253
0	the taste of their food is average , but the main problem is that none of the food items is what you would expect from what is depicted in their menu . also we got horribly bad service and rudeness from one particular male staff wearing a black suit walking around ( probably the supervisor ) , but the rest of the staff seems okay	814
0	i stayed for a week at the hard rock and went here 7-10 times . there was never once they did . it screw up an order . they literally said they did not offer ice tea and proceeded to hand me a tea bag . i would say on average of ordering a drink it had to go back three time so they got it right . either it was the wrong size , the wrong tea , or they gave me an ice coffee . i 'm talking serious incompetence .	579
1	thanks cindy and nancy for making our first mom and daughter nail experience so pleasant . we love our nails .	104
1	stopped by while in vegas this last time . chicken tiki masala was amazing , their sag paneer was delicious and the cheese and garlic naan was mouthwatering . all went great with their mango chutney ! ! oh and not to mention their great staff ! ca n't wait to eat there again !	600
0	this place is terrible . the man was completely demeaning and the woman stared at me for 5 minutes before she called someone to help me . i would n't trust these people with any of my 5 dogs . i would n't trust them with a stray , the place is dirty and full of negativity . i truly hope you read this and look into a second option , unless you want to be talked down too and made to feel like you are beneath them all .	3850
1	was n't entirely interested in ever visiting this place , but it was absolutely crucial that we saw the mayweather vs. pacquido fight that night . the place was absolutely packed with barely any room to stand . personal space was of the essence . when i got a chance to make it to the bar through the crowd i was pleased with the decent price with beer . got ta have a heineken . it was a fluke that we even made it for the fight , but i went only because my friend wanted to . not exactly dying to go back as these kind of bars are not my forte . nice place though .	1292
1	another great visit to rtr vegas ! alyssa and rocky went above and beyond despite the fact that they were under staffed . alyssa was working with myself , and a couple other clients , but still managed to assist me with funding jewelry that would compliment my dress for the latin grammy 's .	2153
1	just moved into town and must say the best place to have breakfast and lunch with family . menu had manny good selections and the service was great ! looking forward to come back for lunch : )	134
0	so we were waiting for the family bathroom at scottsdale quarter and some young girl in a cocktail dress and stilettos ushers in front of us and our 3 month old fussy baby by herself and locks the door behind her . making eye contact with all of us ... only to emerge as a juby true employee in uniform ! real classy . maybe they should add a locker room on site or something .	468
1	we had just come back from a naples vacation and were missing korean food . decided to try this place out and were pleasantly surprised to find out the food was awesome ! had the yuk gae jang and the ja bong . probably the best i 've had in toronto . will be going back frequently for sure . you need to go here , this is proper homestyle korean food . no short cuts . but , i really think they should put draft beer on the menu !	298
1	garlic doughnuts and house made jerky a must ! super friendly and not stuck up , which is hard to find on king street ! !	3039
0	this place is a mess . so much potential , and excellent marketing - but the fundamentals are severely lacking . we bought bad chicken four times . four ! it incumbent of me to check the meat quality before purchasing ? ? do n't think so . it 's chicken . people could get really sick ! ! took it up with the owners but they have no accountability . zero fucks given . also ... their main cashier , 'rosalyn ' i think , is perpetually rude and miserable . she berates her staff right in front if their customers but offers no help at all . hope they get their stuff together ...	1639
0	rude , rude , rude . if i could give them a rating lower than a 1 star i would . the lady that answered the phone claimed to be the owner/manager/supervisor and would not connect me to george so that i could complain how rude she was ... do n't see them being in the insurance business for long ! ! !	727
0	stood up two days in a row ! ! excuse first day is they did n't see my info . scheduled second day for a 12-1 appt . even texted my info ! no phone calls or text as to why they were n't showing !	2258
1	we went in the other day and we got wings and pizza ready to go . you may want to call in before heading up there in case they are out . it 's usually ready in minutes . great prices . my son loves the pretzel bread pizza- very good . with so many choices for pizza in this town their prices are best . we love the wings - very moist and we like them with no sauce . very friendly staff .	519
0	i do n't see what all the hype is about this place . i like subway way better . jimmy john 's does n't have spinach or green bell pepper toppings like subway does , for one reason .	1475
1	each and every time i reach out to penguin air my experiences have been fast and professional . i have always felt their technicians were very knowledgeable , honest and helpful in reference to their assessments and recommendations . i will continue to recommend this company to friends , associates and family .	2203
1	great company to work with . their houses are clean and well cared for . repairs are completed by professionals and in a timely fashion . i would definitely recommend leasing a house from them .	3536
1	the first time i went i tried the lemon chicken and it was way to greasy and 90 % breading . the second time i tried the chicken and broccoli , it was ok .. my last trip i had the orange chicken and it was very flavorful . the wonton soup is so tasty . the staff is super friendly and they seem to have a lot of regulars which is a good sign !	1550
0	i went to the camelback store and arrived at 6:59 p.m. to simply return a router . the employee had just locked the doors as i was walking up , and refused to help out my simple return . he said that they were closed and would n't assist me . this is terrible customer service and represents the product that cox offers . please hire employees that seek to aid customers rather than ignore them , otherwise you 'll lose another customers business .	2633
1	frank 's is clean and the service is a lot better than it used to be . if the millvale location did n't exist , this place would get five stars , but it 's just not the same . obviously , the buffalo chicken pizza and ranch are amazing , they are just better in millvale . the chicken and ranch are the same , i think it 's just something about how they do the crust in millvale . either way , you ca n't beat the buffalo chicken pizza and frankie fries .	1509
1	i walked in and this place smelled so great . the people inside were amazingly friendly .	438
1	this venue is beautiful . i attended a wedding here last month ( september ) . they had the ceremony outside at sunset in front of the gorgeous fountain then the ceremony was right inside . the price was not nearly as high as the venues at the casinos on the strip . the food was good . during the 1 hour between ceremony and reception while bridal party took pictures a plethora of free horderves were passed around . the only downfall to this venue was the dance floor was very small .	3869
1	as usual the cooked food was great and the portions still large as usual . what surprised me is that they 've really stepped it up with their sushi ! the rolls were very large and filled with fish rather than 80 % rice like before . i just hope it is n't the odd chef that makes it like that .	516
1	i was glad to find out that there 's an authentic chinese restaurant close by my house ! our waitress was very kind and attentive . i ordered the salt and pepper crab which was so delicious ! the clams with aberdeen sauce was a little spicy , but it was still pretty good . the golden roasted chicken was amazing ; it was very juicy and flavorful . also i was surprised that the food arrived to our table so quick . overall this was truly a pleasant experience and i 'll most likely be coming back to try more of their dishes .	294
0	do n't call these guys . had them look at my water heater and the plumber couldnt find out that was wrong with it ( didnt look very hard ) and said he would start throwing parts at it and that the cost would start at $ 299 . well , i called someone else and it turned out it was just a bad ignitor switch . a $ 10 part . so either their plumbers are clueless or they are just trying to take advantage of customers . also to quote me $ 6700 for a water softener is just laughble . all other quotes were no higher than $ 2800 .	2203
1	if you like your pizza 's crust to be more buttered than donald trump 's butthole , this is the place for you . buttery , flaky , and just down right american inside and out ; this pizza was pretty good .	705
1	there are other locations and i fell in love with this place for a number of reasons . looking chic as a full figured woman for less than lane bryant , avenue , fashion bug or catherine 's is a wonderful feeling when on a tight budget ! however , i am not saying those other stores are not great because they are if you want high quality , but when you need to look good on a dime rainbow has your back and all sizes are available ! definitely a clothing store that does not discriminate !	1833
0	big store , lots of seating and staff , filthy . i really hate stores , especially that serve food , that are filthy . i mean floors not swept , creamer area with what appears to be more than a days worth of spills , staff that takes out garbage and then goes back to serving customers without washing hands .	1934
0	i ordered two shots of espresso with extra ice and a small amount of ice coffee and they wanted to charge me for the ice coffee ? gtfoh i go to starbucks almost everyday ( i live in california ) the smarter thing would to do was to have had them put it in a tall cup vs a grande and use a small amt of iced coffee cmon use your brain cells	2849
1	stopped by to check out this place and loved it . even though we visited a few months ago when it was very new , the service and food were excellent . wonderful outdoor area with lots of comfortable furniture . i 'll be back with more friends .	49
0	straight up scam artist , said they could n't fix my flat so they can sale me a used tire and keep my old one ... i had to drive back to california so i bought the used one and told them i wanted to keep my flat ... $ 40 ... came home and went to my trusted tire shop and they checked out my flat and hardly touch the `` patch up '' work they did and it peeled off ... he also said they did n't balance my the wheel ... he patched up my tires and switched the tires for me ... checked out the tire they sold me and it was already patched up 4 times ...	247
0	it 's a mall . in madison . it 's exactly what you 'd expect . the interior has been spruced up and there are some new stores , but west towne still wins . if you really need to shop , get outta town and head to milwaukee or chicago .	2594
1	i love the prices here . not the cleanest nor the most organized . not in the greatest area either . hoodlums in the area will harass your bike if you lock it here .	3194
0	the questions i had were ignored repeatedly so i withdrew my participation in the process and let my husband deal with them . evidently interacting with women is not their strongpoint . there is a lack of communication . the last straw is that they only have one machine to dig and it will not be available for a week and a half . so again , we are waiting on them . i wish we had gone with another company . they are very unprofessional . if i could rate negative stars i would .	3541
0	impossible to get an appointment that works for me within 2 weeks . and i 've been trying literally for the last 3 months . i 'm sure they do excellent work , but nobody answers the phone and they text you back ... . one time , it was 3 days later . i 'm done trying to get in . my time is valuable , also	1370
0	what does it take to have this guys call me back ? i left two messages and no call back ... ..what is up with that ? they are not taking new customers or something ?	2139
0	worst store ever i was overcharged for a box . 22.00 when everyone else would have charged 10 . overcharged for shipping 77.00 . vs actual ups charge of 42.57 . this ups store lied cheated and stole has poor integrity as they charged for 25x25x25 when actual real box is 20x20x20 . all verified by investigator , you will only get cheated at this store . i am filing a bbb formal complaint . filing a formal ups complaint , lying is not ok ups .	1764
0	your standard i-hop or denny 's style menu . the food was good and they serve large portions and the price is a bit much . i had the biscuits and gravy which came with 2 eggs , hashbrowns and choice of bacon or sausage . i selected the sausage , which was horrible ! next time i will order the bacon . overall good and i would eat there again .	1319
1	my 2 yr old face planted my ipad mini the screen was cracked everywhere . i went into one stop wireless to see if there was hope in replacing the screen without breaking the bank ... ..omg from the moment i walked in it was professional all the way . they were up front , honest , and affordable ... ... when i picked up my device 3 hrs later , it was as if it never was cracked ... .i will def refer them to anyone ... ..and you can just sense their dedication to their customers .	2930
1	superior customer service a few months ago we bought new rims for my rubicon here . have n't had any problems whatsoever . we love them . today i stopped in and asked them for help and they came out and looked under my tk and knew exactly what was wrong . ( it is a dealer warranty problem , not anything installed here ) . thanks for helping me figure out how serious my problem was ( or was n't ) .	2632
1	my so and i were in the area shopping and thought we would give this place a try for lunch . this was the best decision we made all day ! order two different type of hummus and a gyro . everything was absolutely delicious ! we will be returning .	875
1	great show ! very entertaining . got the crowd on their feet basically the whole concert . i liked the mariah carey concert better but i 'm a big mariah carey fan . only bad thing i could say are the people who is constantly video taping the concert on their phones obstructing the views .	1771
0	i 'm going to be straight up and say that the employee kyle was an a**hole today . he showed no interest in helping me with my ups shipping issue . he needs training in customer service and manners . i hope the manager ( god i hope it 's not kyle ) but i hope the manager sees this and gives that boy training . kyle gave the impression that he 's does n't like his job and does n't enjoy helping customers .	1764
1	the sandwiches are good here , it 's just a little pricey . the service was very friendly and it did n't take long to get our food . i 'll probably visit again if i 'm in the mood for subs .	517
0	very mediocre place with no service and ok place . we just ate pizza and the sauce was very sweet .	902
0	if i could give zero or negative stars- i would . this company was dispatched to me through my insurance . they were to be there between 30-60 minutes . after 3.5 hours of calling and getting the run around and lies and excuses in 40 degree weather , they never showed and i was forced to pay out of pocket for a tow . worst ever . stay far away .	2010
1	i like cat she is great with blondes . plus she is very nice . with the store coupons i feel like i get a great deal .	2479
0	called the office to become a new patient and the receptionist was short and down right rude . i 'm still on hold after twenty five minutes , waiting to speak to her manager . it is like this firm has forgotten , or does n't care , that they are there to serve their patients , and that the patients are the customer . absolutely no respect , and clearly no interest in growing their practice . in serious need of new management and a reminder why they are there .	3059
1	had a very good experience w/ bankier a few years ago in champaign , il . my apt was well-maintained , all service requests were done quickly . quiet building , good amenities , and good office staff . i recommend them regularly to people moving down to champaign . if you want quiet , just do n't live anywhere in campustown .	222
1	these guys are great ! came here for some issues with my tires and dashboard lights . service was quick and friendly . thanks , mark ! my car was in a bay in seconds after i signed the estimate . they called to update me and give me choices on the repair , and they were n't at all offended when i decided to do some repairs elsewhere . this was only because my car is european and i 'm wary of doing any major repairs anywhere but a certified volvo shop . i did end up getting an alignment and the issue with my dashboard lights were fixed . their prices were great . i will definitely be coming here again !	2392
1	my first time flying virgin . i 've been hearing great things about it & so my friend recommended it . first class was nice & i heard flying international it 's an even cooler different feel . i love the leg room , so much more than other airlines !	1623
1	had an appt yesterday for spa week and was very impressed by the awesome staff and wonderful medical professional that did my photofacial.they were knowledgeable , friendly and on time.the center was clean and relaxing.definitely a superior center .	582
1	huge selection of gel colors . i 've never been so overwhelmed with choices . dawn did my nails . i was pleased with her because she did a careful job and she knew i was on a time crunch so she worked as fast as she can to get me out of there . convenient because it is down the street from our house in vegas .	655
1	i brought my daughters here for a treat during our visit to charlotte from atlanta . very clean , relaxed atmosphere . the staff is warm and welcoming . we will visit again when we are in town !	2830
0	to tristan , i do not believe it is appropriate to write a review for your own company and give yourself 5 stars . i would consider that very unethical . i also consider it to be very bad business to divulge other people 's personal information to the public . you are a terrible business man and i hope people can see that through your poorly written response , which by the way is completely inaccurate . any reasonable consumer will clearly see that your lack of professionalism and complete disregard for any ownership or accountability for your company 's actions is reason enough to never do business with you .	3761
0	we came here because it was a block from home and we were feeing lazy . did n't want to drive to the normal fro yo place . boy , did we pay for our laziness ! the frozen yogurt was like the ice milk crap that you get at a buffet restaurant . the topping selection was lame and the place was a mess . not sure why this place is so packed all of the time , it sucks .	1903
1	this is my new favorite asian market . i love the food court out in front . they have buddae jiggae ! i did n't expect it . it has all sorts of food to try out . i 'm from colorado , so i would say that this is the closest to hmart that lv has to offer . i go to this place and 168 . check it out !	715
0	i hate coming to this urgent care but because of my insurance and the proximity to my house its my default urgent care . there is no sense of urgency what 's so ever here . some of the medical assistants look like they jut rolled out of bed without showering or laundering their scrubs . the front desk can be very slow . some of the dr 's hate being there . if you have a choice go elsewhere .	121
0	worst company i have ever dealt with , my bad i should have checked them out further before hiring them but i did n't . they hire installers that just do piece work and do n't really care if they scratch furniture , or even cover furniture so its not covered in concrete dust . they say they are going to take care of things and you have to call several times anyway . was also told i would receive cleaning kit with purchase of flooring and its been couple of weeks , no sign of it . like i said i should have checked this company out before , live and learn .	694
0	purchased a small bedroom bench 8 weeks ago . it seemed a little odd to wait 8 weeks for a $ 200 bench , but ok i 'll wait . when i called the service center , i was told my item was on backorder for an additional 8 weeks . do n't know about you folks but that seems pretty unreasonable since they will have had my order ( and my money ) for 4 months .	1640
