0	they are non-existent or inaction regarding parking rules in bella monte community ! many cars or commercial truck have been parking overnight and during daytime in the streets and obviously , nobody from colonial goes around and check parking especially at nighttime anymore !	3608
1	i 've been coming to this car wash since i moved to vegas . i really like that they give you a towel for drying your car and air freshener when you order your wash . sometimes i feel like the employees can be a little pushy with getting their monthly packages/more expensive washes . sorry i 'm a poor grad student . maybe when i graduate i will come often for a nice clean car , but for now , i will live off of the $ 6 washes . service is quick and fast . no complaints ! also , shout out to daniel -- the employees are super nice , but he was especially hilarious the day i went .	2093
1	we take our daughter here ... she loves it and is learning . ms ashley is a caring and wonderful instructor . highly recommend .	2856
0	so accommodating when you signing up ! different story when you want to cancel the membership ! you can sign up from any location but u have to . cancel from where you signed up . you do n't need a manager to sign up but you do when you want to stop !	2919
1	i recently needed a prescription refilled . my insurance company denied coverage of my medication . lilly worked very hard and was able to get my medication approved . she was able to get my insurance company to change their mind ! i appreciate her hard work and dedication . thank you from the bottom of my heart . i am one very satisfied patient ! !	297
1	there are few places on mill that have the laid back social atmosphere but are yet loud and fun . love this place for fun music and good classics ! the name really fits the atmosphere .	1176
0	awful customer service . could n't get an acknowledgment from the person working there - not a `` hello '' or even a smile . from the lack of customers in the store , you 'd think they would try harder . glad there are many other bridal shops to choose from .	3370
1	we have used stellar home services three times now for plumbing repairs and i 'm embarrassed that i have not reviewed them before . always timely , courteous , and fair priced . they even tell me things that i can do on my own to save me money . definitely recommended .	910
0	the worst watch repair shop in las vegas . brought my watch here to simply change the battery , took about 5 min and $ 10.75 , but they also left 2 long scratches on the back of my watch . i 've never seen any watch repair professional leave scratches on handling such a simple task of changing a battery , very unprofessional . and the worst part was that they pretended nothing happened , and acted like it was n't their fault . i was shocked .	2307
1	wonderful salon ! exceptionally clean , professional , and knowledgeable staff . i have been coming here for 12 years and would n't go anywhere else . the best spray tan in nc and i have photos to prove it ! in fact , tania did my daughter 's wedding party and it was natural and realistic . i highly recommend this salon for tanning , nail care , and spray tans . you will not find any better ! ! ! ! !	786
0	if it were possible to give a review with zero stars-i would have ! save yourself your time and money . there is a reason this place is a ghost town . they were beyond rude , i almost turned and walked out the second i was greeting with a mean look as if i was interrupting the show tech was watching . thought i would give the benefit of doubt . sorry i did-i will never return to this salon for services . i have no idea how they are still in business .	854
1	best water company , all the staff is polite and very customer service oriented . bill pay on line very easy to use .	2519
1	this is one of the cantonese restaurants that i frequent in mississauga . i come mainly for the dim sum lunch . what i like is the food is still pushed around on carts just like in the old school days . as a result , you get to eat pretty quickly on your arrival . one thing to watch out for is because you are hungry on arrival , you might tend to over order ! like they say your brain is bigger than your stomach ! however no worries here as we pretty much always take home the left overs for our kids .	0
1	quick , responsive and knowledgable ! open seven days a week and had the part in stock ! when we were trouble shooting our problem with the washing machine and found out the drain pump needed to be replaced , apc had the part and was open-saving us time and getting us back on track . thank you apc ! we will go to them for future help .	3242
1	dollar tree is my favorite store to stock up on greeting cards because they 're 2 for $ 1 . the candy is pretty fresh . this location can get pretty busy . the sales associates are friendly .	2446
1	i really have no idea how to review yogurt places . they all seem the same to me and they 're all delicious . and they 're always wide open spaces with neon colors and sparse furniture . the yogurt here tastes like yogurt and the toppings are plentiful . i typically go for plain or fruity yogurt and pile on the fruit and cheesecake bites ( if they 're available ) . the only issue i could come up with here was the semi-melty consistency of the yogurt , but i ate it so fast , it did n't even matter .	3902
0	abusive staff who try to upsell and do n't let you read the small print , dirty car that needed servicing and ran out of coolant , trash under the seats . non existent customer service on helpline . then when we complained at the return they actually overcharged us with extra hidden fees . given that everyone else has already rated them 1 star , this review will probably not make a difference . if you rent from them be ready for your trip to be ruined .	3576
0	this is the closest old navy to my house and i would rather drive across town to go to the one on rainbow ! employees are always pretty nice but ... . they have a hard time honoring signs that are up in the store and online prices ! 1 time ok i understand but i just had my 3rd bad experience . not a fan !	2617
1	i 'm vexed and haunted by how consistently good each cup of gelato i 've gotten from here is . the flavor descriptions sound incredible on their own and messina hits it home by making their gelati with ingredients and mix-ins that make each spoonful so dreamy . i 've been a fan of their rotating special flavor selection , but panna cotta with fig jam and amaretti has a special place in my heart and continues to be my favorite $ 3.50 scoop .	3735
0	i hired june 's legal services to serve my ex-wife court docs . they took my payment and did not serve her but said they tried to serve her 1x and were unsuccessful so too bad . shawna the receptionist was rude when i asked simple questions and told me to call back another time and speak to a manager .	1932
0	felt very taken advantage of . i can save almost $ 500 by towing to another place . all they wanted was for me to get a credit card with them . felt used , not helped .	2799
1	i needed a tow so i called around . they gave me a good quote on the price & wait time . when the driver arrived he was nice & friendly . towed my car to the shop . end of story .	1530
0	didnt know grown adults cant try own samples i felt i was being punished..plus cashier never once smiled , said hello or thank you.. we all felt unwelcome..kinda weird..oh well it does n't matter we 'll never return ... think we 'll stick with menchies they never failed us..good luck ! !	288
0	do n't go here . my dry cleaning was wrinkled and dingy looking- looked the same as when i dropped it off - looked like they did n't even iron it after . also very pricey for very low quality- do n't make the mistake of taking your clothes here .	1719
0	i was ready to love this place . soda shop vibe ? i love nostalgia ! named after moses cleveland ? i ca n't get enough of all things cleveland ! what could be better ? well ... there 's two things that really bother me about this place . 1 ) the wait . it seems like you have to wait forever in line and then once you pay , you have to wait forever for your ice cream . it 's just ice cream , people , why does it take 10 minutes to put a scoop on a cone ? 2 ) prices vs quality . it 's expensive and i the ice cream 's ok , not great .	3604
1	this is the best place to rent a car at sky harbor airport and david at the counter is the only name you need to know ! great prices , fast service , professional staff and clean cars ... . what else could you want ? p.s . the car return staff is great too !	3595
1	dr sharif does not treat mris or x-rays he 's an actual human doctor treating the human . he does in fact use mris and x-rays as tools to treat ... but he cares about you the person . i felt seen , i felt heard , i felt as though all of my concerns were listened to heard and addressed it 's a sad commentary to say how rare it is to find a doctor with his exemplary skills and a surgeon that still cares and listens . i trust dr sharif with my very messed up spine and my life ... it 's just a beautiful bonus how much he truly cares . i 'd give him more stars were it possible . ! !	2176
1	pros prices are good place is huge * good produce selection & freshness nice helpful staff lots of parking indoor/outdoor lots of carts/basket good hours the whole store is open lots of bathrooms - at lest one on each floor* pharmacy cons : fish counter , deli , bakery , take out , sushi sections close hours before the store does bathrooms downstairs are always dirty * self check out machines are slow they can be out of stock of something for days they pull things from there sku frequently it 's the best grocery for the area though . hands down .	1665
0	really bad experience , management is very unethical . we bought a car there under the pretense that it was equipped with a key fob system , they even gave two key fobs . they never worked so we figured they just needed to be reprogrammed so we took them and the car to the dealer to program them . turns out the fob receiver had been removed from the vehicle before we bought it . they would n't put it back in unless we paid the regular part price and labor , $ 199 . classy .	624
0	was left on hold for 20 minutes . hung up to call back and phones were switched to the we are closed voicemail . no call back	565
1	my family and i stopped here late night one evening while in charlotte . we liked the layout and everyone was very professional & nice . we ordered a pepperoni pizza and mild wings which came up quick . our food was very good and as ordered no complaints at all and we would recommed this place .	902
1	great appliances stores . good affordable prices . overall great experience . y buy at big retail store when you could save money on the same appliances . very happy with my purchase	1236
0	do you like puke on your urinals and your bartenders doing well *sniff sniff , in the bathroom while you wait for a drink ? , i 'm not assuming i went to check , .then i implore you go to duckys pub where the clientele are power drinkers , your feet stick to the floor and the staff drink more than you .	3164
1	i visited this gym over a weekend in pittsburgh and remembered why i fell in love with golds . the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating . the whole gym including the locker room was very clean . the equipment was in good shape and also have dumbbells that go up to 150lbs . there was no wait for any machines or free weights . i 'd highly recommend this gym to anyone looking for a spot . if i move to the area i will certainly become a regular here .	2338
0	aweful . the two girls working the kitchen could n't be bothered because the gun show was going on . took 5 minutes to even be greeted . then she says my card is declined but then the other cc machine worked just fine . the cages them self are very old and out dated do n't pitch very well . go somewhere else !	3555
0	worst rental every . warning do not use them.. i will upload picture of the rental they provided that were broken or just disgusting . detailed texts and email will posted . i can not get into details because legal action is being filed againts this company as we speak . don't do business with them owner steve or the assistance lisseth . should have know with only 15 yelp reveiws..pretty sure 5 stars are fake accounts friends of steve	3620
0	i used to come to this place out of desperation for sushi , but now with so many other options this one does n't make the list ! this is my least favorite sushi spot in mississauga . i find them to be more pricey than the other ayce sushi spots and the quality is worst ! obviously there is seafood being served , but often this place smells horribly of smelly or cheap fish . the quality of food is sub par and the rolls tend to fall apart as soon as you pick them up . service is n't the greatest , expect long waits for your server . i 've retired from eating here .	1231
1	i 'm a landlord and had a messy tenant . i was worried that i would need to replace the carpets in my rental . i was shocked to see how much of a difference dustin at jcs clean was able to make ! his company uses a $ 30,000 machine to clean any type of flooring , including carpets and ceramic tile . i even paid jcs to clean my garage floor too ! their prices are very affordable , they arrived on time , and they were able to finish within a couple of hours . i recommend their services to anyone who 's flooring has a lot of wear and tear -- odds are it will save you a few hundred dollars .	2135
1	i love this place . the portions are huge and the prices are n't bad at all . the food is great , i 've never been disappointed ( i always get the chicken moo shoo ) . the menu has something for everyone , and the delivery is really fast !	945
0	worst massage ever ..they pet you not massage you . give yourself a favour and save your time and money . do n't go there zero massage skills .	1192
1	the dim sum here is great . the regular menu not so much . i have n't had a dim sum item not taste good so i ca n't make any recommendations . try anything ! prices are slightly higher than other places but it 's deserved . lines can be long .	0
0	what kind of coffee shop 75 feet from the courthouse does not have wifi ? starbucks gained over $ 5 billion last year in income and they ca n't spend $ 500 and three hours to install adequate wifi ? smh ... i could n't access the internet on my laptop at all . no wonder there are no legal professionals or office workers here so near the legal center of las vegas . yes , the building 's architecture is nice , staff is cool , but for those needing to do work involving the internet it 's as useful as squirt gun on a battlefield .	1996
0	they are afraid to cut hair . my hubby went in to get a hair cut and came out and it looked like they did n't even cut it . they did a horrible job . i will not recommend them to anyone .	430
1	excellent experience and first class care . from check-in to discharge , everyone treated my husband ( the patient ) and me ( the worried spouse ) with the utmost respect . all fears were put to rest instantly . so thankful !	1225
0	i want to give it -ve rating . just bloody buy some packaged salad , sprouts and add some dressing . you know what forget the dressing too . now pretend you are a fancy goat and eat it . bingo !	1127
0	have you ever been discriminated against ? well if you want to this may be the place for you . security will treat you like a 3rd class citizen and will verbally berate you and your party . i 'm saddened by this altercation , but if my description matches your liking for deprecation by others - then this is your spot .	2200
0	stay away ! ! so disappointing ... stopped in to get the dips ( sns ) and pedicure and first i walked into a yelling match amongst the staff one staff member started crying ( leave your drama at home ! ! ) and my services were a complete waste of time.. 2 and a half hours people and i finally just could n't take it anymore.. having to pay for my services was like a punch in the gut , i refused to pay for my nails i did pay my pedicure but now i have to figure out where to go to get my nails fixed ! ! ! stay away ! !	1388
0	pros : close to old town cons : customer service poor management kids yelling 24x7 rotted wiring ( unstable internet connection ) roaches in walls ( 4 treatments never worked ) numerous accounting discrepancies	3665
1	never disappointed with their service . great staff . friendly and experienced . i recommend them to anyone . get my nails done here very often and refuse to go to any other place . i drive an hour just to get here and do n't regret it . its well worth it !	1829
0	i came here for a couple massage and it was the worst massages ever ! do n't go there ! it does n't worth the money ! i know that it is nice price for a couple massage ... but i had back pains afterwards for days . they scratched my back while doing the massage ... and they do n't understand english so well .	2320
1	i was afraid of to dine here after all the negative reviews , especially since i had a travelzoo voucher . but i 'm sooo glad i came . our server , louis ? was amazing..very helpful and very very friendly . instead of getting dessert he offered to let us choose sides since the steaks were served alone . i highly suggest the ribeye steak..rossini style . a good piece of foie gras on top with truffle oil . so so so good ! ! i ordered the surf and turf but kept eating off the ribeye steak plate . definitely will wan na go back . it 's very pricey but it 's delicious !	971
0	it took us 2 months to get our title . same story as others . all we got was lip service . glen and chris are scammers . we took our car back to get the leather on our driver seat fixed seat was worn out in three days ... .stay far away from these crooks ! ! ! ! ! ! !	3528
0	sams club is sams club and do n't expect the speedy checkout like costco . poor selection of products , slow customer service , and not to mention about their sluggish check out lines . someone needs to motivate the workers with higher pay and better system . feels like a turkey farm here ... .if costco is nearby , sams club is out of the question ...	2469
1	walgreens are nice . i really like how well lit and clean inside and out . the employees are very nice and accommodating at this walgreens .	1733
0	really bad service and very rude employees . our family wo n't be back , we will just drive to the chandler heights location from now on .	1770
0	absolutely no stars from me , actually ! i have to give them at least one star to post this review . that was the worst massage i have ever had ! the lady that did my massage was grumpy and spoke very little english . ( not that is problem ; what is a problem is when she is angry with me for not understanding what she wants me to do ! i will not go back and i will not recommend this place to anyone !	2014
1	a simple , bright , clean and casual place to come ! relaxed atmosphere- large menu with appetizers , drinks , sandwiches , soups , salads and dinner choices- daily specials too ! nice and friendly staff , good for a story and a laugh ! never disappointed !	1380
0	let 's start with the parkkng : parking is around back with doors in the front ( not good for handicap ) . door labeled to go in was locked . the door for take out is to be used but not labeled for restraunt entrance . the table for a party of 4 received bread with no silverware , but the bread was good ! the baked ziti had no herbs/spices or flavor . we will not return .	192
1	this place has an amazing fish fry and awesome reuben egg rolls ! the food is classic irish deliciousness . on the weekends they have live irish music but get there early ... ..the seating fills up fast ! ! ! !	454
1	food and service were great . the stir fry is a must . ordered two dishes , asparagus , spinach , shitaki mushrooms , and tofu with rice . second dish was greenbeans , carrots , onions , rice noodles , and chicken in a curry sauce . both were so delicious . will definitely return .	205
0	this office staff is one of the worst office staffs i have had to deal with . they do not smile , they are slow and they do not call you back on important and not important issues . the billing staff is out of this world horrible . i have have been calling on a situation forever ( 7 plus months ) with no results . i like there doctors there but the staff is a sad group . people who come in mostly have some type of mental illness . you would think the staff would give the patient a smile and a `` how are you doing today '' . they give you nothing ! ! ! !	1541
1	the staff is so helpful . every time i go in there everyone is super friendly . all the items i need are always in stock . love this mac store	2409
0	this place was barely worth it before . now after their huge price hike , it 's not worth it at all . who charges $ 3 for texas toast , and $ 1 per ranch cup ? buffalo wild wings is even cheaper . at least they have a lot better wings .	1397
1	i have ordered delivery many times , and tried several different things . the food is consistently high quality and delicious . the menu has such variety and so many great options . you can not go wrong with express pizza . yummy !	987
1	i came in for a haircut , and my 5 yr old daughter came with me . the folks at paul mitchell gave her a haircut , did her nails , and even did her makeup . the staff treated her so well , she felt like a princess . there is no better gift a company can provide than making my daughter smile . this school is my new favorite locale in vegas .	354
1	nice facility with great instructors and helpful staff . it 's very clean . lots of equipment and class choices .	2699
0	the food here is always good but 4 of 5 times we come here at least one order is wrong . if the waiter would write our orders down that might improve . it 's frustrating to have limited time for a lunch break and get the wrong order . today , 3 out of 4 of our orders were wrong and they gave a 30 % discount . so , we basically got to eat what they decided to serve us for $ 2.00 off menu price . i also believe it is obscene to charge $ 1.00 for a tablespoon of sour cream or 1/4 cup of cheese in a mexican restaurant .	882
1	this place is amazing . we are never disappointed . they are almost always early and never late . there has n't been one thing that we 've ordered that we did n't like . awesome quantities and in general incredible food . absolutely recommend !	276
1	food was pretty good but a bit too salty . the atmosphere & decor are excellent . thanks . will come by again .	177
1	i ca n't get enough of crafty burger goodness . oh . my . godddddddddddd yes	1046
0	not a good experience . truck was pulling left , took it in and was told i needed to replace upper and lower ball joints on both sides , two tires and get four wheel alignment . was quoted over $ 2000.00 . decided to get 2cd opinion , ball joints were in perfect condition , needed two tires and 4 wheel alignment . saved $ 1700.00 . truck is now great . buyer beware !	3405
1	california burger was delicious ! ! spinach artichoke dip was a weird consistency . i was n't a fan . sweet potato fries were crisp and fresh . wings were fantastic . service was pretty good . cleanliness was ok .	68
0	i felt so lost during my 4 years at this school . it 's very big and nobody really knows who you are . it 's also expensive .	1722
1	i purchased a groupon for elements , even though this location was on the opposite side of town . let me tell you , it was well worth the drive . i had the best massage ever , i was almost sleeping during the massage . anthony was great . i went back to him a second time , and i took my mom too . highly recommend going to see him .	450
1	what a fun place ! hubby has been wanting to go here , so we went just before picking up kiddo from school on thursday.he got an angry dog and i got west coast dog . delicious ... i ca n't wait to try the santa fe , he want to try dragon next time . each dog averages $ 5 and the small fries is enough to share with someone . when i checked in , it gave me a yelp deal too . i will use it next time , i checked in after i paid . o well , more incentive to return !	1566
1	this service is wonderful here.. bart is a fantastic , he 's very knowledgeable and a pleasure to do business with . it 's good to have great mechanics and know that your car is going to be taken care of .	599
0	they managed to redo the chairs and make them so uncomfortable ! movie chairs were not broken , why were they fixed ? these mechanical recliners are loud when you try to adjust during a movie .	3063
1	love this place ! great quality ; great prices ; super friendly . i never really had a go-to place for alterations before . now every time i am about to put an item of clothing back in the closet because it 's too big or missing buttons or the lining is torn , i take it to the folks at sun - a couple of days and​ a couple of dollars later i 'm wearing my favourite stuff again !	2425
1	this place is an impeccable clinic ! i came all the way from las vegas to get adjustments from dr russell . he is very thorough and professional . he also let me understand what is my problem and what i should do about it . i felt he really personally care about my lower back issues . and more than anything , he executes adjustments well . thank you dr russell you are awesome !	3525
1	medshape made me lose 27 ponds in 3 weeks ! the workers at medshape are really nice . and the bars are really good for taste and losing weight : ) i say if you need to lose weight you should go to medshape weight loss clinic .	2588
0	stopped by for cheesecake on a sunday afternoon - website & hours on door said they were open - door was locked & nobody was inside . they should have been open for another 2 hours . so disappointed ! might be a good idea to call first !	3611
1	do n't be put off by exterior . extremely pleasant , welcoming , and attentive service . outdoor deck , foosball and pool table upstairs are fun . fascinating book collection and all around charming atmosphere . we love it here and will come back whenever in toronto .	1091
0	decent selection ... nothing special and way too pricey . absolutely no acknowledgment by the employees when customers enter . three employees of whom walked by us several times as they were rearranging items . no , `` hello ! `` no `` welcome ! '' no `` is there anything we can help you with ? '' -and you get to listen to barking dogs locked up in kennels while you shop . too bad !	1987
0	as a recent chicago transplant , i 've really been missing chicago pizza . imagine my amazement when i discovered that there was an uno 's in madison ! wrong . while the original pizzaria uno ( at ohio and wabash ) is wonderful , something is lost in translation here . i ca n't even explain it . it 's just bad . the hunt for good deep dish in madison continues ...	705
1	this my place whenever i 'm in toronto and androjeny is a beaaast ! she did 3 smaller tattoos on me and also a 10 hour rib piece and i could n't be happier . also had a small neck piece done by key who is also dope af . chill as vibe in there and everyone 's coooool will be coming back often haha	2028
0	yeah , as with the other reviews ... .go elsewhere . these are crooks ! guys arrived 1.5 hours late , supposed to be 9am . my place is not that hard to find ... it is a major cross-section ! start time 10:30am , finished at 2pm . the labor guys were nice , but the financial/logistics behind it are crooks ! charged me for the full 5 hours ... .and an extra hour for trip charge ! unbelievable ! $ 275 for 3.5 hours of labor . do what these other reviews say ... .find someone else . there are plenty of more honest people around .	1756
1	i 'm in love with the street tacos and the only place for a great pesto pizza with chicken . friendly staff and had a blast at happy hour with my friends	732
0	i went to this store yesterday first of all the parking lot is filthy dirty . i went in looking for a new windshield screen for my car . serval people were helping other people out no one even acknowledged me and said we 'll be with you in a moment ! i get it you 're busy but it 's still nice to acknowledge someone and tell them you will be free in a moment ! i finally asked someone where they were he was nice enough they had like two screens no selection at all . i went to target found exactly what i was looking for ! it was clean	2502
1	workers are super friendly , nice , and hilarious . great deals and great products . kid friendly to ! i recommend to all !	3067
1	loved my haircut i had gotten from win salon not long ago . i had heard of it from some friends and decided to try it . it was definitely worth it . the hair stylists are very nice and really take time to do the style you want . the only downside is that they only accept cash , which is inconvenient for someone who never carries cash and is coming into the place for the first time . they were able to accommodate using a card reader app and ipad but reminded me to bring cash instead next time . other than that , i do like this salon and would definitely get my hair cut here again .	3486
0	i 'm not happy at all . the food was good . but the service sucks ! ! ! i 'm vegetarian and ordered the margarita pizza , they put meat on it after i asked the waitress more than three times if there was meat . her replies were : `` idk let me check '' `` yeah , i 'm not sure '' . just not satisfied at all .	741
1	being a small cupcake place in downtown champaign instead of a bustling city , i can understand why some reviewers might have received stale cupcakes . but when my friend and i went , i remember delicious cupcakes , both frosting and cake . most memorable : 1. coconut 2. pink lemonade good cupcakes if you 're lucky to get fresh ones = ]	3749
0	my husband bought me a massage here for mother 's day . i have been here a couple of times before & always had a good experience . this time , i had 3 appointments cancelled because each time the therapist had a sudden emergency . i was offered a facial as an apology , but that is not what i purchased or wanted . this is a terrible way to run a business .	3554
0	just bought a house and needed the carpet cleaned before moving in . we paid for tile cleaning and carpets in the entire house about 1700 square feet . paid about 600 dollars for the service . they did a good job with the carpet . tile turned out ok , but in the downstairs bathroom they totally broke off the door stopper . pieces of wood from the bathroom door came off along with the door stopper . then they pulled out the faucet sprayer and broke that . i would n't call them ever again after this experience .	3796
1	i have used hugh rite for about 10 years , they have maintained , put in new doors and new openers in my two garages . they have always been prompt , courteous and efficient . lately i had some intermittent trouble which was difficult to diagnose . they persisted until the matter got fixed.i highly recommend hugh-rite .	2377
0	there are liars and thieves in this walmart car service center . anytime i go here it 's a bad experience . they will steal my metal tire caps , lie about service that 's been done etc . i hope it 's not a walmart thing but specific to this location . the photo below shows how they lied about the tire pressure - the receipt says 35 psi while the dash show 29 - it would n't be so bad except i asked them to fill the tires . they said the car was wrong . i had to fill the tires myself at a service station later . did they actually work on my car ? you 've been warned .	3825
0	i got a buttermilk donut which was good but everything else was not great . my husband got a strawberry-filled donut which he said tasted like it was filled with strawberry icing . he also got a strawberry smoothie which he specified to the cashier was a fresh-fruit smoothie and it tasted like icing as well . i got a milk tea which was the worst i 've ever tasted . it did n't taste like it had any tea in it and the sweetness was both overwhelming and artificial tasting . the tapioca balls were too hard to even go up the straw and would get stuck . i had decent hopes for this place but it just did n't meet any of them .	3137
0	do not go here if you need to change your name . you will wait in line and when you finally get inside , that 's when they tell you to go to the buffalo location .	2598

1	this is the former merchandise mart on independence . i just attended the southern christmas show here the other night . great place . it 's huge ! the christmas show has been here for years . lots of arts , crafts , food & festive stuff . a christmas shopaholic 's dream , a husband 's nightmare ! plenty of parking ( $ 6 to park ) and tickets to the show are just $ 7.50 at all harris teeters with a vic card ( i knew they were good for something ) . this place has all kinds of expos & shows throughout the year . the southern christmas show is a great way to get into the holiday spirit !	1492
1	really friendly and helpful staff . i ordered the veggie burger which was good . however the cheese fries were n't the best . i do not recommend the cheese fries . lots of seating and a very clean environment .	1337
0	follow up : this place still sucks . i do n't know where they find their front office workers but they are just not very bright . laundry rooms rarely work and take multiple washes to get your clothes clean . the only improvement is they fixed the streetlights so you can actually see where you are walking at night , bravo . do not move here , save your money and live somewhere that actually cares about its residence .	3148
0	i have been going there awhile but after this last time probably will not . the gel nail polish that is guaranteed to stay on 21 days has come off after a week both this time and last time . i had my nails and toes done before vacation a week ago and it 's all peeled off . it bubbled and then peeled off . ridiculous .	3948
1	awesome service ! ! ! i only use satellite for my glass replacement ... . does n't matter what area you use them in ... ..they always have the best customer service ... .	1988
1	there 's always consistency with the taste of my wings , and how nice the staff are . i am obsessed with the mild wings . no matter what , come see cynthia ! ! ! she 's awesome ! ! ! !	1395
0	my wife took an item to them to be sewn ; the procedure was agreed , and the cost was also agreed . on the delivery day , only one of the items were done . in my opinion , this process took about 5 minutes from beginning to end . the other alteration was not done , but now they want more money to do it . $ 8 for 5 minutes works out to $ 96 p/h . not very customer friendly , and not recommended .	1545
0	wow i am not surprised they have this kind of rating . took them only one month to get our drier fixed . worst customer service ever ! ! ! tried to call a couple of times to see what 's going on . i have been told countless times that i will get a call back . not once did i get it . i was kinda stuck with them because my home warranty company sent them . do not use this company ! ! ! !	3885
1	was hesitant to try a new place that i was n't familiar with but dream nails does not disappoint . they have a huge selection of gel colors to choose from at a decent price . what i like most about this place is the service . they are incredibly patient while waiting for my friends and me to pick our gel color . not only that but they are helpful in guiding us and suggesting different colors or ideas .	3274
1	this place is dangerous . i could definitely spend all my money in one day , maybe two . this store has so much to offer for any sportsman or woman . added benefit , it is attached to a casino for the significant other that does n't want to walk around the store .	2601
0	no air conditioner was on at all and it was over 105 outside . they put my friends size 13 shoe in a bucket that was way too small . tapped the feet instead doing any real massage or reflexology . never again .	1322
0	prices are very high for the quality of food . i took some of the food back and they did refund me but no way should they think the prices are ok. also when i went in i had to walk all over glass . the front window broke and they made no attempt to clean it up . after i left i had to pick pieces out of my dress shoes . i was hoping they were better but i guess go down the strip mall a little more and get good quality food .	1361
1	dos is our favorite spot . all the staff are awesome as is their food . they have great happy hour deals . i really like the bloody mary 's and the breakfast burrito on sundays . dos gringos rocks ! ! !	704
0	this place is a joke . truth is i have no idea if the cupcakes taste good or not . i bought a groupon and was excited to get these cupcakes for a birthday party and was told that they are only available 2 days out of the whole week . hope to et a refund from groupon .	1673
0	a ton of scratches from the brushes today . been here so many times and never scratches , but today , all over , sides , hood , roof , back . never scratched anywhere but here today . very very disappointed . hopefully they come out with waxing and buffing . otherwise the unlimited car wash wo n't be a great deal at all . need to change the brushes more frequently through day , especially if extra dirt covered car or truck goes thru .	2939
1	my boyfriend and i had traveled from southern california , last minute , unfortunate and exhausting day in glendale , az we were absolutely starving and looking for a good dinner and a cocktail . texas roadhouse not only had the best steak 's they had an amazing service staff as well . our server jonathan , a.k.a j.b . recommended a beer called `` the kilt-lifter '' from a local brewery and i had a peach tea vodka drink . both hit-the-spot . the steaks were great especially the bone-in ribeye . food was fantastic and the service was friendly and worth mention to the manager .	560
1	april and michael gives the best gel pedicures ! ! ! not only do they take their time and give great massages , the prices can not be beat . on the plus side they always have the best movies playing on the surround sound .	1661
1	i like this place . it 's a great space , with huge mirrors ! it 's in a cool location . granted , i live around the corner , but if i ever move , i 'm driving here to get my hair cut . yoki does an excellent job . she 's cut my hair four times now , and it continues to grow out perfectly . i 've never had a haircut that i 've liked better ... and it continues to improve over time . a very rare skill set !	3610
1	enjoyed checking out ashley homestore . great selection of furniture . was greeted by `` ej '' . very helpful guy and very friendly . found lots of great pieces of furniture . definitely my style and i thought the prices were reasonable compared to other furniture stores i walked into in the area . i 'll definitely be back to make a purchase . a++	3738
0	to start of this hotel is in a great location.. i give the hotel a 2.4 rating ... .. the hotel does need upgrade/fix issue . the carpet on the way to the room was filthy with bleach spot in many area . the room were okay but the chairs were to big ... . it a average cheap hotel.. we got a good price so it was good but this hotel is not a 100/night hotel .	2866
0	twice the price of a real ny bagel and half as good . am i missing something ? is there a secret ingredient ? bagels are small and average tasting . not even cut in half . 2/5 stars	325
0	they do n't follow their advertised hours . i checked their hours , biked all the way over there for lunch and the door was locked , although all the patio tables were set and there were people inside .	1271
1	great golf course . come here once a year for super bowl and the grass is like carpet . will be back next year for sure .	1087
0	i used to enjoy going here but it has gone down hill . went there for lunch today and the enchiladas i ordered came out cold . also we ordered the queso and were told it would take awhile because they were making it fresh . it came out with a pudding like skin on the top .	1558
1	props to the management of this starbucks . i have frequented different starbucks all over the gta , as i have lived in different areas of the city . now , i am at school near by to this one and ... seriously ... most consistent lattes ever . they are full to the brim and they taste good . always . every once in a while , at other starbucks , i 've gotten pretty crappy drinks . here ? they are always good . no matter who the barista is ! i 'm impressed .	3294
1	these guys were life savers ! ! i had booked a car through costco at budget for a trip to oakland , california . budget could n't honor the booking due to ineptitude . payless not only had a car available but also honored the discounted costco reservation , even though they have no affiliation . wow to top that off , the paperwork was simple , straight forward , took only minutes , and had by far the best looking counter staff . absolutely no upselling here . check in was even easier . i 'd rent from these guys again over the `` big four '' companies i 've had to deal with in recent months .	3595
1	my roomie and i decided that we deserved to treat ourselves with mani/pedis after a long hard week . great service . the nail techs are really nice and do a great job . i think they liked that i was vietnamese , thats probably the most i 've spoken in vietnamese in a very long time . very clean salon . the chairs for the pedicures were nice ... they had a weird butt massage thing going on them as well as a back and neck massage . not the cheapest but at least they take their time .	2390
1	if you are looking for a restaurant with an outstanding beer selection and great food , this is your place . long ago , their food was not good - but they 've made great strides in the kitchen and now it 's tough to find anything on the menu that 's not good . ribeye steak is very flavorful - french fries are a+ . burgers are gourmet in quality . as a beer aficionado , the only quality that would make this place better would be to see more rotating taps . i want to see more new and unusual beers , more often .	211
1	because we are in mississauga , i think this place is pretty good compare to other dim sum places around the area . me and my family used to come here a lot , but nowadays we all so busy that we come here less . the dim sums here are n't as fancy as the one in mississauga china town , but i do n't mind the look . i just mind about the taste . tips : only a few dim sum need to order . most of them are pushed out .	0
0	my wife loved the flowers , but the fact that she mentioned that it seemed like they did it in a hurry made me write this review , the flowers were not spread out and had bunched up clusters . i spent over $ 100 and that will probably be my last time there , she wasnt completely satified to me if she mentioned that .	38
1	good store , with good prices . a customer can get cash back ( like an atm machine ) . cashiers are also nice and helpful . one thing i like about all aldi stores is they do not play music . some of the music in some retail stores can be loud and annoying , but for other stores , it can be pleasant . i personally prefer no music .	1824
0	no ! the food is n't worth the money to me . it 's not seasoned , the fries are awful . it 's best to drive down craig to raising canes . ! !	998
1	catfish with poutine combo was fantastic the blackened catfish had the perfect amount of heat , the chicken pan gravy was amazing . service with a smile . not sure how i found this truck but i 'm lucky i did	1007
1	mary is a great professional and a dedicated supporter of the community . she is knowledgeable and always available to provide insight and advice . definitely someone who you should look to for advice and guidance .	2026
1	good sit down chinese restaurant with food served on real plates . casual , but clean . great service , but i would expect that since i was the only eat - in customer the hour i was there on a thursday night . quite a few walk-ins for take out , but no others eating there . all food is served mild , but they ask if you want it medium or hot spicy . portion was way more than i could eat and they did n't skimp on the meat .	1550
0	i never received an apology from hobby lobby for the bad customer service i got when i returned an item . apparently they do n't value their customers . also , why do they close at 8:00 pm and why closed on sunday ? this is the christmas season , people are shopping . i specifically drove to their store to buy some items i needed , and when i walked into the store , they were closing . there was a woman locking the doors at 8:00 while people were lined up at the registers . i ended up going to michaels . i 'm finished with hobby lobby !	204
1	been working with them for a couple years now . excellent people ; great communication . definitely recommend . keep up the great work !	2848
1	i brought my 65 lb . standard poodle in to do the self serve wash . the tubs are hydraulic and can be raised and were so much easier on my back than doing it at home ! the sprayers made it so convenient and they supplied the shampoo , conditioner , face wash , ear cleaner , towels , and force air dryer . all for $ 14 . the staff was incredibly helpful and nice ! we will definitely be back !	3290
0	capital one is a great card as long as you do n't expect good customer service . ask for a credit line increase and you carry a balance ? you get a letter/email that says you are denied because your payment is too low . the payment sent may be 2-3 times the minimum on a regular basis and it still may not be enough . when capital one is contacted , there is no financial decision maker available through any means , in which to ask how much the expected payment is to make such a request . pretty bad if you ask me .	3236
1	so this was my first time to club red and i was expecting the worst conditions after reading the reviews on the place . i get there and it 's awesome in every way good ventilation air flow sound quality was good otep rocked it of course either they did a 360 on the bar recently or people are full of sh $ @	17
0	okay , so ... i 'm all about a wood fire , crispy , while densely chewy , with a hint-of-sweetness bagel , but i think the balance was just not there . i had the lox & cream cheese on a sesame bagel , and cinnamon raisin to-go . overall , the bagels were way too tough making the sandwich very difficult to eat . i felt like the sweetness of the dough actually enhanced more of a floury taste which overpowered the flavors as a whole . i did appreciated the side salad that came with the sandwich , though .	995
0	this is a great place to go if you want to pay more for cheap , poor quality furniture . they were way overpriced compared to other stores i compared them to . i also wanted to look around and only come in for 10-15 minutes to browse . well the sales lady followed me around and continued to show me pieces that were outside of my budget and not even what i was looking for . they try to push financing options on you to make you forget that you are overpaying . i did not like the pushy sales feeling i got .	1998
1	gina is the best ! she knows how to connect with patients and does everything she can to help ! the facility is clean and the staff is super friendly .	1843
1	on a whim , i stopped in to get eyebrow wax . but eyebrow threading was recommended . since i had never experienced threading before , i asked the usual questions - how long does it take , how long does it last , why is it better than waxing . by the next morning , i could see eyebrow hair that was not removed . i also upgraded and had eyebrow tinting . was disappointed in the results . staff was friendly , though difficult to understand . store was neat and clean sadly , i feel my money was wasted , as well as my 'over ' tip , as i now have to have my brows waxed in just a couple of days .	3614
0	just a manicure first time empty place not very personable sign says $ 15.00 i was fine with that and would give 5.00 tip - when she said she was done i asked for a buff and she gave me a funny look and then told me the mani- is now 20.00 due to the 30 second buff - there went her tip and my return visit . never paid 5.00 extra for quick buff before - so it was a one time only shot .	3732
0	dr. batoon was a good enough dentist , but her bedside manner was terrible , and he office staff was lacking . i was over-charged by a lot and it took a week of me calling every day before i finally got a hold of someone who could help me and got my refund . every time i called i was assured someone would call me back by the end of the day and they never did . that alone was enough to make me see care somewhere else . pay attention to your bills if you go here ! ! ! ! -edit : 02/27/2017 i received a full refund after speaking with dr. batoon directly	3099
0	had n't been here for several years , horrible disappointment . chix with garlic sauce had no taste . egg rolls , wonton soup were not good . all in all ... ..will not go back .	1524
1	i am beyond satisfied with the service and the customer friendly environment this facility relayed . i went in for brakes and their hands on approach and efficient communication got my car back on the road promptly . i will coming here for all routine maintenance moving forward . thanks jon !	2040
0	i have been a member at this gym since it has been open . in the beginning it was a great gym to go to . since then , new management has come into place , the gym has become over crowded and the bathrooms are not kept clean . they have also started charging maintenance fees , however the machines are always broken . the lack of customer service at the front desk on saturday mornings during prime time is a dissatisfaction . if you sign up for the $ 10/month you get what you pay for , but as a long time member , the gym has gone downhill .	3446
0	tried the masala burger and poutine fries . for the first time , yelp led me wrong . i was quite disappointed . the bun was dry and the burger was just confusing . the fries ... meh . also as an fyi : it 's cash only .	940
1	today was for our veterans free lunch which was very good sierra was a waitresses she was great and very cute ! catfish very good and chicken fried steak delish ! ! !	560
0	i contracted cdc pools to resurface my pool deck . the salesman was very personable and attentive . there was poor communication from the work crew and their workmanship was substandard . they did not show up to their agreed upon time and a couple of times they were a no show . i had to have them back to do touch up and clean up work . i am still not totally happy with the work but i am tired of dealing with them so did the work myself and just over look the rest .	659
1	had a craving for some sushi downtown and this spot did n't disappoint . i was led here by the good reviews . nothing fancy and the seating is n't very comfortable but the sushi is on point . they also have a couple salads you can get as well like seaweed and octopus . we had the spicy california and spicy tuna rolls . great prices and everything tastes great . impressed by the quick service ! i was in and out of there in less than ten minutes .	24
0	we have been trying different pubs in the airdrie area over the past 6 months and this place will certainly be removed from our list . beer selection was average , food was below average and cocktail selection , despite having a large menu , was pitiful . ordered an old fashioned and was given a glass of bourbon with a cherry and a sugar cube in it . there was even a picture of the drink in the menu as it should be presented . so a glass of bourbon ( bullet ) and a sugar cube cost $ 14 - quite unbelievable . so , obviously make your own decisions but we will never be going back .	1546
0	c'est tellement pas les meilleurs déjeûners ... chaque fois je me demande pourquoi je vais la-bas . souvent c'est par manque de connaissance du quartier ou par faute de mieux . c'est plate a dire , mais c'est ça . les crèpes sont caoutchouteuses , on doit payer pour avoir du vrai sirop , le service est vraiment ordinaire , c'est toujours plein , etc . je préfère vraiment les endroits uniques ou on sert de la bouffe vraiment maison . en plus je ne peux pas supporter les décorations de coq , je trouve ça laid hahaha , cocorico !	358
0	scheduled an appointment , received a confirmation email that contained my correct address/email/phone . scheduled time came and went without any notice . will be looking for another company that will actually come at the scheduled time without having to hunt them down .	1473
1	my family has been going to mr. hong for over 20 years , when he used to work out of a small office in the chinese resteraunt that used to sit on the corner of scottsdale and camelback ! mr.hong is the real deal -he is a taylor and a skilled craftsman . over the years mr. hong has altered everything from my wedding dress to my husbands class eights and everything comes out perfect . in addition to being a fantastic taylor , he is a really nice man , with a facinating life story having originally been born in cambodia during the khmer rouge . anyway , mr.hong is amazing .	136
0	( 2.5 stars ) service when we were here was exceptionally slow . i agreed to try this place because i 've never been to a cha me cha chain and it was my friend 's farewell meet . not impressed . we were greeted dismissively by the waitress , and it took us forever to get our drinks ( literally , we ordered and it took 30 minutes for them to make us some milk tea ... ) . the milk tea is standard . tried some of the crema as well , and the saltiness of the foam on top is not for my tastebuds . i 'm sticking with cha-time and ten ren for bubble tea !	176
1	my first home for my kids and i out in phx as we just moved in town and i must say it was easy and stress free and since everyone in the office is so easy to deal with and they understand sometimes life happens and will try their best within their limits to work with you .	3388
0	custom tailor should be one word and a 4 letter word like `` love '' . it should not be abused . i took a dress here and the owner told me to take the dress somewhere else because he thought it fit fine . i am 5 ' 7 105 lbs with no hips the top of the dress fit perfectly but the bottom was loose and it was supposed to be fitted pencil style ( helmut lang ) i am sure he is great with hems and taking up sleeves and taking in the waist of pants but `` custom tailor '' - not really ... ..	136
1	the service is perfect.. water is fresh.. my delivery guy hugo is the best always on time..	2519
0	now that i 've eaten at la tavola i ca n't believe all the good reviews it got . the calamari was very chewy although the flavor was good . the sauce did not stick to the pasta and the grease used for the veal was not fresh . the only thing memorable was the rack of lamb . we all agreed it was very good . service was adequate . ambiance was terrible .	423
1	amazing ! huge portions and fresh ! ! i got the turkey burger and most turkey burgers are on the drier side ! this was so good ! and huge . i got no bun and they loaded it up with toppings . sweet potato tots are enough to share for 2 people . it 's $ 9 dollars for either bison/turkey/beef or a non-meat alternative ! ca n't beat it . best burger locally also ! plenty o ' beer on draft !	1571
1	needed an oil change and got in right away . had the opportunity to schedule an appointment for a recall repair and now waiting enjoying coffee and popcorn . the gentlemen working the floor , big al , is super nice and respectful .	1910
1	newer spot in tempe serving great mexican food . they are smoking their own meats in the back , are byob , and will start to sell meats by the pound here in the near future . the food is really good , the salsa bar let 's you kick up the spices to your liking and the staff is friendly . definitely give it a try if you are in the neighborhood .	562
1	good place ! the food and prices are good/normal . think asian legend-esque , but thai version . the oakville location has all you can eat lunch buffets that are really yummy and the environment is really nice considering it 's an asian-owned restaurant . service is not the best and this kinda puts a damper on it only because the intended clientele is more for westerners ( not ethnicity , but `` western perspective/lifestyles '' in which service is important overall ) . would come back again - with a date .	1362
0	the food is mostly heated up in a microwave before being toasted in an oven . it cost $ 9 for 12 '' sub so kind of pricey . the subs are bland but the pizza is n't bad . the workers are n't very friendly or personable .	1356
1	everyone who works there is polite and professional . i had to see several people during my visit and i did n't wait more than five minutes for any doctor or technician .	1635
0	this place is absolutely the worst experience i 've ever had . the food was extremely over priced and i literally would n't feed it to my dog . cold , greasy , old ingredients , and the chicken tenders were undercooked . please do yourself a favor and do n't bother ordering food from this place .	1295
1	they are very friendly play everything tori is a bartender she 's she nice and alanna she gave us our table and she was the nicest best person ever .	1734
0	has the potential for a sweet , intimate venue . however , when i went the crowd was very disrespectful , so much so that the artist requested that people stop talking . i could n't hear the music due to all the people noise , so i will not go here again for someone i 'm really into .	225
0	sitting here eating the 4 piece tenders . not a fan of pink chicken . 1st time the food was ok. definetely down hill since . the service is terrible . placebos almost empty and you wait for ever . gon na mark this off the list as a return .	862
1	loved the apps , reasonable pricing , and lively environment . great food , service , and absolutely amazing live performance made mine and the girlfriend 's night . the female lead singer had an incredible voice and created a lovely evening for me and my girlfriend . it was the whole package .	177
0	terrible service even with an appointment . i expected the customers to be `` ghetto '' and the lobby to have crying babies with mothers more worried about their cell phones then telling them little abominations to shut the hell up . but the employees are just as bad . no respect for the customer . you are just a number to these people . make an appointment , come early as possible to avoid the trash and bring earplugs . do n't be surprised if the lady with 15 kids gets preferential treatment over you . and protect your valuables .	1077
1	fantastic walmart . new . clean . well stocked . enjoyed shopping in here . a+	3066
0	i just want everyone to know that lobby and housekeeping staff are bunch liar . i left stuff toy when i stay there and i got home i ask them if they found it and they said they have it they will keep it for me and nobody mention about 9o days policy if dont claim it they will throw it away . i was in town tidy to claim it and they said they do n't have it i stay lot marriott facility do n't have issue i do n't recommend 'this hotel they do n't deserve any star can not be trusted and i 'm gon na report this to marriot corporate office	3253
0	tried them twice . both times they refused to contact my insurance for prescriptions . i 've never received a specific card for prescriptions from my insurance company for prescriptions . have also never had any challenges ever in having a pharmacy call to verify . they refuse to apply your insurance if you do not have your card . both times i asked them to check with someone . but hey- if the cashiers do n't care about me , why should i go back and care about this business . at $ 50 a month for my prescription this adds up . i will take my business elsewhere .	1372
0	45 minutes wait to even talk to an agent about our already reserved rental car . what a joke . we should have used uber	3129
1	we 've probably been coming to paradise juice for the last 15 years and in all that time the quality and taste has never wavered ! easily one of our favorite spots and the owners are wonderful ! i hope it will be around for at least another 15 years to come .	3026
0	i went to return a defective item well within the return period . when they refused to return because item was worn i asked if they could make a note of item since it was a safety concern . the manager george refused to provide me with safety number and his employee number ( it 's disney policy ) although i stayed calm never raising my voice ( i was with my kids ) he called security on me . this store has had several complaints about return . just know that if u need to return you will be treated with hostility . already called disney corporate to report this	1960
1	i got married this august and my friend suggested i check out urban nails for my mani-pedi and i was very satisfied . the place is much cleaner than other nail salons and my services cost only a few more dollars . the staff are also very friendly . `` kelly '' is especially good . the french manicure and pedicure she gave me lasted several weeks after the weddng . i 'd def . go back there again .	3247
1	my first time here i saw michelle she was amazing ! ! she took her time to match my nails and feet and i kept changing my mind and she was very sweet and patient with me i def recommend her ! !	686
0	the service was really good , very friendly . i honestly just thought the food sucked , which i was really surprised by , because it had a lot of hype . i 'm not really sure what else to say . it just was n't good . maybe i went on a bad day ?	270
1	wife and i have been coming to this otb for many years . never have had a problem with food and service . as usual the food and service were very good . wife had a combo of tacos and enchiladas . i had the flank steak and enchiladas . dessert was delicious as well .	1558
0	i came here for their winterlicious 2016 lunch menu . i arrived at a busy and noisier time , but it quieted at around 1pm . the soup i ordered was too sour for my taste . however , i did enjoy the spicy curry , which i found too spicy later , but no worries if you have a higher tolerance for spicy food . i do wish that they put more vegetables to counter the spiciness . the waiters were very nice and friendly ... but they sometimes left my friend and i hanging ( as they temporarily got distracted and forgot about it ; but , one time thing so all is forgiven ) .	1425
0	i 've gotten sick twice now after eating here . management does n't seem to care and plays dumb yet there are multiple reviews of people getting sick at this location .	998
1	excellents service , bartender recommended a dish that was'nt on the menu ( but should be ) called sambal . he even went above & beyond recommended an excellent wine pairing to the dish . def recommend !	961
0	i try not to post poor reviews of places , but this place irked me . i went for a walk with my kids in their stroller to get my nails filled . no biggie , i 've done it a million times . their doorway is so narrow the stroller would n't fit . first time that has ever happened , and the width is the same ( about 1/4 '' narrower actually ) than a standard wheelchair . nobody bothered to get up and even see if i needed help either , they just stared . i walked off to another salon . so : if you are in a wheelchair or have a double stroller , do n't bother here .	3682
1	came here with a friend of mine to get mani/pedis before a wedding . amazing experience ! the girls were awesome and very attentive and funny ! we 're not easy people to impress but we will definitely be back !	43
0	fyi : the d.o . summers cleaners at 14409 cedar rd , in university heights , oh 44121 damaged a dress that i submitted for same day service . the hemline was snapped and hanging when it was returned to me , the eye lash hook was pulled apart , and the dress did not smell fresh . the only explanation that i was given was , `` well same day delivery ... , '' and `` sometimes we put them in [ the machine ] twice , but i do n't know what they did . '' i do not recommend sending your clothes to them .	2784
0	first time i give one start to any groomer , i send my golden retriever to grooming on dec 27 2016 , and i found some hot spot on jan 1st 2017 , it get worse on jan 7th 2017 , the doctor says that cause of groomer , hair not dry enough or shampoo has some problems .	3177
0	reserved 8 rooms for an employee event . dinner and raptors . we spent a ton of money in the hotel and service from check in to check out was not impressive . to top it all off no hot water in the morning . they conducted a scheduled service on the heating unit with known prior warning . typically a hotel will let you know when booking or at least at check in . not only did they not have hot water but they were not concerned about it .	1859
0	horrible experience . i got a pedicure and a full set . pedicure was rushed lasted 8 mins . the full set is horrible ! the acrylic is way to thick	3333
0	i 'm really not sure how this restaurant has received such high reviews . i 've been to many indian restaurants in the us & in the world ( including in india ) and this is the most overrated place i have been to . the food was very average . seems like a place people go to for the atmosphere . i really do n't understand the high ratings here . i recommend nandini and little india in tempe .	640
0	this is not gelato . this is sorbet . it has no milk . we had four different flavors and threw them all away after a few bites . if you are allergic to dairy this would probably be a great place . we are not lactose intolerant so we prefer gelato over sorbet . i probably would n't be as upset if they did n't advertise themselves as a gelato shop . if you serve ice or sorbet , that 's fine . do n't advertise it as gelato .	499
0	i read the reviews on how rude the owner was but i still decided to give it a shot . well good people she is rude ! i do n't care how good the food is and it is tasty but they do not have to worry about me or my co-worker returning . the eye rolling and when you asked questions the huffing and puffing i am so sorry if i am about to spend my money here and i am bothering you ! yeah , no thanks ! ! !	1868
1	really fun club with great music ! ! workers are really nice as well . come around 10:30-11ish to avoid long lines , especially for coat check ! !	1282
1	ordered via uber eats ... had the carbonara , i was glad they had lunch portions . the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente . and the flavour was amazing . it got super greasy at the bottom , but how can i complain when i knew it was a mix of bacon and cheese . mmmm still thinking about it now ... we also ordered the margherita pizza which i heard was kinda underwhelming . i did n't try this though , i was too satisfied with the pasta .	252
0	oakville does n't really have a huge selection of good mexican food , and the habanero taqueria does n't really do much change that . their barbacoa burrito is the one item you 've got ta try ! it 's the saving grace for this place , that and the exceptionally nice staff .	1474
1	so . good . the food was incredible ! i got the pizza , which was my favorite entree . the cashew cheese is outta this world . the roasted cauliflower rosemary soup is the best soup i 've ever had . i also got to try the mint to be smoothie and it was great ! i got the bbq sliders bc why not and they were very tasty . absolutely perfect overall . the service was quick and fantastic ! i ate alone and my bartender made the whole meal enjoyable from start to finish .	1127
0	poor service . after waiting for nearly 45 minutes , and making it very clear that i am highly allergic to sesame seeds , i received one of the dishes in my order made with sesame seeds . needless to say.. it was taken back and remade , however staff should be more attentive , and quick .	1231
0	tacos chiwas has decent gorditas , but the tacos were unbelievably disappointing , especially given the name of the establishment and its current yelp rating . not only are they tacos small but they 're also dry with very few ingredients in each one . i tried the al pastor taco and tacos chiwas taco and found both to be pretty bad .	270
1	just had lunch here- great service and very fast at making our food ! ! there is always a like here and they always are speedy quick ! ! !	214
1	fast , clean , professional and easy parking . i had a great experience shipping an item back from a trade show at this location .	1878
1	this review is actually for the starbucks counter inside of safeway ! i stop here pretty regularly on my way to work and the wonderful ladies at the counter are always so sweet and delightful { even at 6:30 am ! } . there are about 10 starbucks along my route to work but these ladies have me coming back time after time ! there 's nothing better that kicking off your work day with warm smiles and a delicious starbucks cold brew !	1097
0	business is closed - no longer taking new customers . this business owner gave my information to another cleaning company in town ( without my permission ) that called me hoping to win my business but made a racist comment about hispanic women . are there any professional cleaning companies in las vegas ? jeez !	2944
1	great nail salon and technicians ! salon is very clean and customers service is excellent ! they also send you home with a mini nail care kit ! definitely recommend !	1834
0	stick to ups store fedex stores or other places sorry service was n't great and i do n't suggest anyone should come here . they have hiding fees/ plus its pricey and do n't tell you until they ring you up . i also question the credentials of one of the workers . how can you be licensed to preform services and you are having comprehension issues . i had to tell this person several times the correct information and how to do it . it was still done wrong and i had to go waste money and go somewhere else .	1393
1	every sunday you 'll see this farmers market without fail . it is pretty small , but it has everything you could want . fresh fruits and veggies from local farmers and delicious food that local venders have made . i had trouble finding a parking spot , but it might have just been a coincidence since i have n't had trouble finding parking before . it 's open from 9-12 . you 'll also find people selling their crafts . this is a great little jewel in ahwatukee !	1500
0	the worst service i have ever received in my life . i politely asked for help to install a license plate bulb and was told to `` you tube it '' while the manager kasey was tossing popcorn in his mouth . i walked outside to my vehicle and the covers literally popped right off with a flathead screwdriver . i walked back into the facility and expressed how concerned i was about the poor service and lack of help . on top of all that they gave me the wrong bulbs to replace ! needless to say i will never go back to this place .	3834
0	terrible service . be prepared to wait ! arrived 10 min b4 appt and waited for 30 min without any type of status update . 2 girls at receptionist desk were just chatting away completely ignoring me . i just walked out . my time is important too !	2577
0	i would n't even recommend this place to an enemy , they did a sloppy job on my nails they are uneven and chipped within the first few days ( i got gel polish ) but the thing that was the worst was the girl who was doing my nails came to me while getting my toes done sat an acetone soaked towel on my lap so i smelled just like it when i left and she was on her phone the entire time . for just a polish and a basic pedicure i payed $ 45 . for sure wo n't be back .	786
0	not really much to write about ! they were going course runs out here ! we did n't have to pay i think it was a private event . so we did n't deal with any workers ! just hanging out with people in the club .	2955
0	called 2 weeks ago . left a message with her answering service . no one gets back to me . emailed them and another week goes by and no one replies . finally got them on the phone today ( it is now august 1st ) and there is no availability until november 1st ? if you are looking to get an appointment wit this dr. be prepared to book 3 months away and wait . oh also - her office is only open monday - thursday so be prepared to take off from work to get in after you have waited 3 months .	3200
1	have been here a number of times prior . the usual wfm experience here . best of everything . we actually came for lunch at deli . thanks folks . well done .	433
0	this establishment does not provide complementary water for their guests and then expects $ 6.50 for a bottle of water . no wonder females are being carted off in wheel chairs . maybe i 'll buy a $ 9 beer elsewhere .	2494
1	absolutely amazing juices and cleanses . love the basillion . i do think each individual juice is overpriced for the fact that it is not freshly made and not all organic , but definitely great and unique juice combos .	468
1	this was a great experience . it was my first time at experiencing this particular type of massage ( reflexology ) and it was very relaxing and helped to work out a few of my kinks . not to mention they currently offer a tray $ 40 special for a 1 hour massage plus 30 min foot detox . glad to say , it was worth it ! !	1322
1	so i legit ordered three sammy 's 12 minutes ago and dude knocked on my door already with my food . those commercials do n't lie . i 'm seriously kinda freaked out . how is this possible ? ! ? ! ?	1475
1	wow ! had the philly steak dog and it was amazing . the best hot dog i have had in long time . the auoli sauce was perfect topping to this dog . wish they were in henderson . would eat here all the time ! the staff are friendly and the place is clean . delicious ! !	1566
0	when it first opened , the price was reasonable and the portion size was appropriate for the price . just went in today and they 've changed portion sizes . what is a $ 9.00 bowl is the size is something a 4 year old could eat . i 'm not a huge portion eater so i thought i 'd try it until i was told there is an upcharge to add shrimp . ripoff . place was n't crowded like it used to be . guess they have to raise prices to keep the lights on . i 'm not interested in returning .	209
1	i have using this pharmacy for a few years to receive compounded eye drops ( demecarium bromide ) for my great dane . i find them reliable and efficient and they get them to me in a timely manner .	2827
0	thought i 'd give this salon a try after finding a coupon in the mail . i will not be returning . i got acrylics and the man who did them did a poor job . the staff was friendly , but the nails were horrific . i had to point out an area on one of my nails were he completely missed filling with acrylic . did n't file underneath the nail , did n't request i scrub my nails before putting on clear coat , the acrylic is uneven and bubbling . took me about 20 minutes at home to fix everything . not worth the $ 20 coupon price . you get what you pay for with this place .	1838
1	amazing service and always so helpful and nice ! thank you so much ! i highly recommend nicole beauty they always have everything i need and when it comes to my extensions they are the only place i will go !	2826
1	excellent food , clean and friendly . their level of spice is a little higher than other indian places in the area . medium was more like a spicy of other places . very good flavor though .	1540
1	if you 're craving panang curry , king & i is where it 's at ! ! ... . every dish is exquisite ! ! i absolutely love the late hours as well ... open till 10pm ! ! probably the best thai food in végas ... my happy place !	1361
0	not good disappointing this was my first visit to fuego taco shop . in my opinion the food just is n't very good . on this visit my lunch companion and i ordered the asada and al pastor tacos , we were both very disappointed with our entrees . my lunch companion told me that her pastor tacos were flavorless . to be perfectly honest , the tacos looked flavorless . the carne asada taco consisted of chunks of flavorless beef in a warm tortilla and the tortilla did n't look very appealing . the tacos just did not have a lot of flavor , were slightly overcooked , and just had a strange unappetizing taste . the food just was n't very good .	593
0	had new wheels and tires installed and within 3 weeks it fell off while driving ! luckily no one was injured . but they will not take responsibility ! beware beware update ... . pepboys will not pay for any damages and do not feel responsible . so they are working on vehicles involving safety features and not caring about the lives of the people who pay for the work ! amazing that no one was hurt ! but sad that my teenager worked so hard for this truck and now has $ 4000 damages that he has to pay ! ! this should never happen ! ! !	2960
1	after reading that dry cleaning chemicals are one of the worst things out there , i decided to make me and my family go to a green cleaner . we tried this place out and have stuck with them ever since . they get the work done good and quick and are a friendly family operated business .	1596
1	we moved to vegas from california and need a place to stay for 5 weeks until the construction of our house is done . we checked in here a day after thanksgiving after a horrible experience at emerald suites ! brandon the receptionist that day is so helpful and even let us check the room before booking.this place is clean , has the basic necessities and very close to everything ! we can cross the street to the outlet mall ! ! ! we are here for 4 more weeks and thankful every day that we found this gem ! ! !	2695
1	dr. garcia is wonderful . we 've been taking our son there since he was born . she is very thorough and caring . i would definitely recommend her to my friends . i will say the wait times can be extremely unpredictable . work on getting people in and out ! thank you !	2461
0	the bartenders here just do n't care . shame on me for sitting around waiting to be noticed . love how the manager sees me and does n't even wince at my level of patience . no hello no thank you no nothing . warm and friendly as a bitter scorned ex gf . worse is that i manage a restaurant on the same property . the whole union mentality kills the opportunity to be better . this sense of entitlement makes my job harder and even more difficult to enjoy a damn beer .	2494
0	the burger sounded great on the menu . but when it came out it looked sad . like really sad . i would not recommend ordering the burgers .	369
1	first time ordering from wing time . had food delivered during knights game . wings and fries arrived hot ! ! ! buffalo and louis n ana sauce ; both very good . wings were good size too . yummy .	1397
0	quite concerned about stars this company has been receiving . not only did we receive poor customer service , but we were also faced with the company 's inability to comply with its contractual obligations , unsatisfactory and partial performance by its employee ( kevin ) , and the company 's inability to provide relief to damages caused to the property by the employee . this company does not deserve the praise that they have been receiving and this should serve as a warning to those considering using its services . legal action will be taken in order to recover damages .	2130
0	first room , which the clerk had promoted on the phone as a comfy suite for 2 couples , was inadequate . the sofa bed was awful and we demanded a change . the 2nd room was adequate with the caveat that the inner shower curtain was off the hooks , which made for a memorable bathing experience .	952
0	so over priced for absolutely terrible food , so many better places in the valley for indian food .	1497
0	prices are great . but the lady behind the counter was rude . told me she was insulted . when i said i do my own nails cause its cheaper . i have been a licensed cosmetologist for 18 years . had to bite my tongue cause i had my daughter with me . i 'll be going across the street for now on .	2182
0	great gym , great classes but will never get a membership there again , they do n't give a crap what happens in your life when it comes to their monthly fees .	2699
0	we arrived today at 11am and were told that the wait was 10mins . 30 mins later and we were finally seated . it 's been 40 mins now and we still do n't have any of our food . the table next to us arrived 15 mins after we sat and they are now eating . unbelievably bad service and only a weak apology are n't going to cut it . this will be the last time i ever eat here .	975
0	bartender nice and friendly the girls are pushy and kinda ugly ... one beer was 11 plus tip what a fn ripoff place	1779
1	this is my go-to place when i am having car troubles ! pulled in at 7am wednesday morning with a huge screw in my tire and i was out the door in 15 minutes ! super friendly and helpful staff ! thank you ! !	3379
0	the bald guy with the glasses clearly does not enjoy his job as he was rude and impolite . he worked super slow and had a grimace on his face the whole time , you could clearly see he was `` overjoyed '' to be working behind the counter .	3154
1	very nice . let us in just before closing and they were still very cool about it . long time customer . employees were very helpful , friendly and sincere . helped with finding coupons . good sales . great people .	1743
0	do n't waste your time or money ! ! i went there wanting some good burgers and good beer and while the menu looked appetizing , the food was very bland . maybe they should change the name as tap house is misleading . the beer selection was underwhelming and less than most bars in madison . i know there is n't much on the far west side but there has to be better than this ! ? !	957
1	i come to this starbucks everyday before going to work and every single worker there is extraordinary , in specific the girl with the pastel rainbow hair ( not sure what her name is ; / ) but i just wanted to say to keep it up : )	3396
0	had the seafood butcher cut up a fish head for me at 7:50pm . got home , realized he sold me fish that was already going bad ... returned it and the customer service lady said it was the hot summer weather that caused a bunch of the fish to go bad and smell . if she knew that and if the guy in the back could smell the fish , i have no idea why they were still selling it ... i did n't want to get into an argument but i was going to tell her `` the temperature on the outside of the refrigerator has no relation to the temperature inside of the fridge . ''	3269
0	very bad . i ordered to go for my 8 , 10 years old boys . i asked several times to make a sure burger needs to be medium well for kids . patty not even cook well . rare~~ . boys could n't eat at all . throw away $ 20 burger . $ 5 in n out is much more better . never go there again	964
0	just got off the phone with the receptionist , she was incredible rude and short with me . will find someone else .	676
1	i had my lexus serviced here and could n't have been more pleased and thankful for how helpful and professional ryan and the other mechanics were . i 'll definitely be back .	988
0	update : i called the store and was on hold long enough to get dressed , get in my car , drive to the store , and still be on hold . absolutely ridiculous . if you ask when shipments come in you get every day of the week as an answer , yet yet they never seem to have the product when you do come in on the confirmed shipment date .	3192
0	bon ... nous avons été oubliés pendant plus de 30 minutes , avant qu'une serveuse s'occupe de nous . le service laissait grandement à désirer , surtout quand on doit demander plus de trois fois la même chose avant de l'obtenir . le sourire ne semble pas être la marque de commerce de ce restaurant . la nourriture était bonne ( pas à se jeter par terre ) et la présentation agréable . les quantités convenables quand on partage . bref , un endroit qui gagnerait à améliorer son service .	1537
0	well good luck trying to find a seat . i hate the assigned seating . usually if you show up 50 minutes before a movie you will get decent seats . not here , you have to buy tickets online 6-7 hours before your showing and get stuck paying a transaction fee . i was excited to get a location closer to buckeye , looks like i 'll continue to go to other theatres .	564
0	i think the froyo wasnt really that good the flavour wasnt really special and the taste of the froyo wasnt really rich ( pretty plain ) they have more toppings than menchies but menchies has better froyo . i personally dont like the toppings much cuz everytime i go there the toppings are mostly chocolate or cookies..price is standard for frozen yogurt . this yogurty 's has more toppings but some other yogurtys has really less . the place was clean and comfortable if you sit there and eat .	3729
0	the worst mothers day brunch ever ! the food was over cook , either burnt or dry ... . the sausage was a heat and serve style and the inside was cold ! the set up in the back was to cramped for all of the people in the restaurant ! horrific ... ..	714
1	absolutely delicious . chicken tenders and fries are great . menu is similar to canes but in my opinion is better than canes because pdq 's offers buffalo sauce . i hate mayo which is a main ingredient in cane 's sauce so it 's nice to have options .	998
0	really wanted to have a better experience at this location as it 's super close to where i live , but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations . to start off the seating for pedicures gets uncomfortable really fast throughout the service that felt rushed . it was actually painful during the cuticle work , something that never bothered me at other salons . giving them 2 stars because the end result looked good ( like others ) and lasted as it should .	876
1	i do n't have vision insurance and a local optometrist quoted $ 250 for one pair of glasses with a basic prescription ( +0.75 ) for my 9 year old son . we came here and found a nice selection of designer and sport frames , and got two complete pair of frames and lenses for less than the first optometrist had quoted for one . when we were ready to finalize our order the manager reviewed it and had us remove an add-on i had requested that is good for adults , but not good for a kid wearing glasses for the first time .	403
0	the car wash was not so good today . i paid for an additional service and it was not performed .	2198
0	it 's laughable how little fish they put in their poke . i built my own large bowl with salmon , tuna ( + $ 0.25 ) and albacore tuna ( +0.25 ) . there was only around 100 grams of fish in the entire bowl . for approximately the same price , the large bowls at north poke always have more than 200 grams of fish . the taste was also unimpressive . hoki poke has got to be the worst out of all the poke places around .	2719
0	$ 10 admission for kids tournaments and the acs do n't even work ! it felt cooler in the 111 degrees outside than it did inside this facility today . outrageous admission , you would expect a cool and comfortable environment for the price you pay to get inside . on top of that , selling warm water in an already sauna of a gym . totally unsafe .	3837
1	thank you kathy klapach ! we love rita 's italian ice and appreciate your community support .	2162
1	order through postmates and this was by far one of the best desert ideas . who does n't want fresh hot cookies with a pint of ice cream and some mille at 1am . . we had the og chocolate cookie and the fruity pebble cookie with double strawberry ice cream for the win ! it was amazing . twice baked	1522
1	aaron is best cashier this side of town fast and friendly	3107
0	had cupcakes from this place twice- on each occasion i tried at least 2 flavors . in my honest opinion you should save your money and go pick up some grocery store cupcakes . i hate to give a bad review but it is so hard not to considering the product they specialize in is n't that great . my husband prefers my box cupcakes over these . they are expensive to me at almost 3 bucks per cupcake ... i could live with that if they were good . the flavor is okay , nothing out of this world . the cake part is really dry . was so hoping to like this place but i do n't .	2013
1	took my friend for a french manicure . very friendly staff , fair price , and excellent service . ty is very professional .	1716
0	do n't list a closing time of 2 if you 're going to cancel orders placed at 1 . with awful management like this i 'm kind of glad the pizza did n't come . do n't waste your time ordering from here .	543
1	i 've ordered so many roses for the love of my life over the last few years and many of my orders from 1-800-flowers i know go through az florist which i believe is this place based on the card information . great flowers , wonderful pricing . the challenges i have had not from this place but the confusing service and time lag of the 1-800-flowers system of communication . my love one is always happy with her roses !	38
1	love costco ! ! hard to get outta that place without spending 10x why you planned on spending .	1102
1	full catering menu available with delivery ! ? groceries delivered to your door ! ? cooking classes , and an event room with kitchen you can rent ! great addition to campus .	1914
1	great house margs , and a very good price . came in for tacos on a tuesday ( no taco tuesday specials but that 's totally fine ) . i enjoyed my food ! ground beef taco , cheese enchilada and pinto beans . it was not memorable to me , but certainly was a very tasty meal at the moment . great service !	1346
0	super understaffed . literally could not find anyone for the life of me , one cashier ... tons of people in line . super slow ! ! ! also so many more coupons at michaels ! ! ! ! michaels usually has 40 % -60 % off coupons on their website , jo anns does not have any . michaels 100 % has a better selection , more workers and cheaper prices with coupons . jo anns : please hire more people its like a ghost town in here .	3943
0	i usually love this doctor 's office but i have never been shamed for wanting an anitbiotic for a sinus infection like i was at my last visit . i felt so talked down to for needing an antibiotic . then when i called with question left a non urgent medical message i never got a call back . i sadly will be looking for a new doctor 's office .	1562
1	hands down the best acrylic overlay manicure and pedicure i have ever ever gotten . ty ( pronounced t ) is incredibly quick yet meticulous . her work is flawless and above all others , and i have been getting my nails done for nearly 10 years or more . the pedicure was out of this world . they have gained a customer for life .	3603
0	this is the worse whole foods i have ever been to . the cleanliness is disgusting and is discouraging to my appetite . i 'm from portland , or and i guess it must be a culture thing . the service makes me uncomfortable , and the hot foods prepared all look like they have been frozen . the deli section is awful and the do n't clean the display fridges . it was very disappointing to visit las vegas and go to a whole foods with such a lack of high standards .	433
0	all members notice this , you are a none membership contract and pay first and last month when sign up . when i canceled my membership because complain of sanitation issues in steam room and sauna room , they not take care of it and one of the club manager kick me out , and they never refund my money for my last month they keep because they just pay 2 days for that month after cancel , so they still keeping my last month pay when i join in , hope all members notice this , and that how they run their business . watch a video in fb or utube mountainside fitness manager kick out club member because complain of sanitation issues	2699
0	we 've been taking our son to mesa peds for 11 months . overall , the doctors have given us good treatment for routine checkups for our son . however , the first time we needed to use their services for a cold/ear infection , the service from the front desk staff was terrible and in many ways unacceptable . the staff had an attitude when asked basic questions regarding call backs from the nurse . it appears that the office was busy that day and the doctor never sent the prescription to the pharmacy . their after hours service to try to get our prescription was the worse i had yet . we are definitely considering to change offices .	3893
0	always slow . costs way more than any other starbucks . my ham and cheese croissant this morning was frozen in the middle i was very upset as i got all the way to the room and then had to come back to get a new one the sad part is this is the only starbucks close by on fremont street the next morning you can walk to with your pajamas on they really should get it together	683
1	my appointment here today went very smoothly . i tried this place due to a groupon deal and they were very professional and organized upon check-in . i waited about 10 min before being taken in for my treatment and the doctor i saw was quick and made the procedure almost painless . the waiting room was kind of sparse in decor , no beverages or new magazines so i do n't think it reaches 5 -star level but i would definitely return . also their b-12 shots are only $ 10 - the best deal i 've seen anywhere !	3215
1	been going to bailey 's for the last six months . it 's an older crowd during the day , but at night and on the weekends the crowd id much younger ! bartenders are all friendly and the drinks are cheap , though they could be stronger . i highly recommend it !	2894
1	we eat here at least twice a week , my friends and i may have a problem ... you only need to know two words : louisiana . rub . that is all .	1395
1	delicious food , good prices . this is actually a great place to get quick lunch or dinner . chicken shawarma plate is the best i had in a while . i like that chicken is all white meat , no fat pieces as in other places . their hummus and falafel is very good , as well . and they have so many salad choices . located close to subway on yonge .	1206
1	pancakes were excellent , sammy and his daughter were delightful . my boyfriend and i both ordered breakfast specials and our total was only 17.77 ! great food for a fantastic price . they now accept visa and mastercard as payment ! ! side note- they stop serving specials at 10:30 , so be sure to get there before then to enjoy pancakes or french toast !	990
1	great service with exceptional meals ! the calamari was cooked to perfection . the veal chop with tiger shrimp and veggies was amazing . the service was amazing . i do n't think i ever poured my own wine once . would highly recommend .	163
1	come here lots before i fly out . food comes out fast and beers come out faster . perfect place to come crush a pint of two before you fly out !	604
0	they overbooked and told me on arrival at 1am that they had no room . i had a reservation with guaranteed late arrival . in addition , i called on the drive to the hotel and told them i 'd be late and they promised me it would not be an issue . despicable . they simply resold my room because it is the start of tiff and they probably got a few hundred more . they do n't care about their guests . do n't stay here . i 'm sure there are good hotel chains that understand what the word `` reservation '' means .	73
0	not real friendly female optometrist . staff just okay . they added $ 25 to my quoted contact lens exam price since it was a `` refitting ' . i was a new patient there so ca n't see how that could be . sketchy . they also used a different brand so that when i ordered them online , since it was over $ 100 less , i could n't use the mail in rebate since i did n't buy them from a doctor 's office . i never had that problem with acuvue lenses , no matter where i bought them .	1865
0	labyrinthine and dingy . the room was dim with a tiny bathroom . cell service and wi-fi barely worked including my free diamond hhonors password . tv 's in the fitness center equipment did not work properly . parking is a disaster . better places to stay like the hampton inn across the street .	1741
0	this has been the most frustrating experience with trying to receive my order from this company . we ordered a bed off of amazon from this company and have yet to see it . its been more then a month and the original arrival date was two weeks ago . i have contacted them several times and have gotten nowhere except for a threat to cancel my order . i use amazon often but i will be sure to avoid this company in the future .	3854
0	management : you claimed that you needed the proper paperwork and that i did not return it to you . correction i asked for the paper work in may , got charged in june . requested paperwork again then did n't retrieve the email . then finally the 3rd time requested email . so yes you did not receive my `` proper paperwork '' due to this matter . also keep in mind they still managed to screw up my name in the system as well as having no notes of our conversation that i had with 2 managers .	528
1	met the owner ( brandy ? ) when i was out riding usery . she was setting up a bunch of bikes as part of a charitable event that they put on for under-privileged kids . ( 1st reason i think they are awesome ) . a friend of mine rode up and started chatting with us . brandy noticed he did n't have a helmet and offered to lend him one she had in the trailer . she told him just to drop it off at any of their stores whenever it was convenient . how awesome is that ! good old fashion concern and trust for someone she does n't know while she is giving back to the community .	3775
0	i stood in the line of one while the cashier and older lady talked and talked and talked to her customer till i wanted to scream . i get being nice to customers but it gets to a point where it becomes ridiculous . after standing in line for what felt like an eternity as i waited for the bs to cease oh and then a manager approval for a price reduction i gave up and left . big box stores can not afford to have customers walk out	1638
1	this is my favorite place to go to for vietnamese food . i love their spring rolls with peanut sauce . also , my go to dish is bún tht nng ( vermicelli noodle salad with pork/crispy roll . food served quickly , great flavor , and friendly staff .	784
0	strange experience , employees do n't seem to like their boss and i was terrified i would n't get the dress in time despite paying $ 60 for expedited shipping . they did n't return my call when i called to check on it . got the dress in time and looks right , but i would n't come back .	1298
1	who does n't love a old school casino with go-go dancers right by the roulette wheel ! we had never played roulette before and the dealer was very patient and helped us through the process . we definitely did n't get rich but we had a great time and they were really good about keeping the crown & cokes coming while we were betting . we will be back next trip .	3630
1	i 've been to several bed bath & beyond stores in the valley and this by far has the most helpful people . i wanted to make a special reference to the girl at the checkout , rose , who was very sweet , kind , and helpful . she is a great asset . needless to say i will be back	1884
0	went for lunch today and ordered kung pao chicken . possibly the worst i have ever had . no taste , too much celery , and in a brownish sauce . fried rice and hot n sour soup were ok. wo n't do this again .	1103
0	have been here before for their teppanyaki and it was delicious . the portion sizes are great and the service at the teppanyaki was friendly . however , they have started with an ayce and decided to give that a try . after being seated we waited 20 . no one came to say hello , offered us a drink or take our order . other tables were being served that arrived after us and received drinks and their orders taken . we were the forgotten table . we were hungry , fed up and left . never again !	516
0	i just bought a iced coffee and a suasage egg and cheese on a crossaint . both were super gross . first the coffee was mixed well so i could feel the sugar in my mouth . the crossaint was burnt and tasted like plastic . this location is terrible , if i could give it 0 stars , i would .	1770
0	no high chairs . how can a restaurant be open for several months and advertise as kid friendly but not have one high chair in the whole place ? ! unreal .	308
1	had a great experience at today nails . foot massage was amazing as well as a gel manicure . i would recommend this place to visitors and locals . ask for lou , ivy , ben , or kevin . there was no wait for services and everyone was so kind !	2686
1	i really like this place . it 's small but cute and the two tofu dishes they have ( hibachi and teriyaki , if i recall correctly ) are very good and huge portions .	1014
1	i do n't understand how anyone could write a bad review ! ! ! this place was amazing ! ! we even let them know that we thought it was better than senor frog ( which is very good ) .kudos ! !	623
0	they are really easy to work with but a bit over priced ! ! i just found out other companies would have had my loan paid off by now but borrowing payments just keep going on and on with hardly no end in site ... my friend used other companies in phoenix who are paid off paying less than i have each month ... just fyi ... . they are really nice though : )	3404
1	it 's located in the chevron gas station lot . quick and easy . done in less than 2 minutes . $ 25 for smog . the guy was pleasant enough . the end .	2208
1	this place is fantastic . it 's a true family-run restaurant and they really care . try the platter for two - it 's a mountain of food . it comes with 3 types of schnitzel , sausage , red cabbage and rice . prices are very reasonable . on some evenings they have a band playing traditional gypsy music . you can almost imagine you 're in rural europe , even if you 're suck in richmond hill .	625
1	maybe i 've just been lucky , but this location always has a really nice guy taking our order and it 's never been messed up . we always order everything vegetarian with beans instead of meat and this is the only location that 's never `` accidentally '' given us meat in our food . 3 other taco bell locations near here and one in henderson all put meat in our food and ruined our appetite for that day . kudos to this one for always being speedy and getting our order right !	859
0	i waited 30 minutes for a coffee . this was ridiculous . the lady making my coffee severed a call in order before mine . i 'm pretty sure i ordered one of the most simple coffees on the menu but it still took them forever . i would n't recommend going to this restaurant also because the customer service was mediocre at best . did n't like it .	2516
1	my new fave bbt place . had the sesame red bean slush , light sugar level . you can taste the flavours of roasted sesame ... had cheesecake to go with it as well ! afternoon special : 3-5:30pm , half priced drink with any cheesecake purchase . ordered popcorn chicken and it was tasty as expected . service was great , no complaints ! loved how cozy and comfortable it felt in there , ca n't wait for my nexr visit to try the snow ice and shaved ice : )	176
1	amazing job . ramsey took care of my bmw in an hour . the result is even better than expected . he was fast to answer my calls/texts . showed up at my house the next day . chips and scratches are gone . he would tell you if he can do something or not . honest and nice , i recommend his services to anybody who 'd like to give his car a second life . thank you	2888
1	i booked my appointment at natural solutions and had jewel as my junior hair stylist . i was very happy with how she cut my hair and the time she took to give me a really nice blow out . she is very friendly , a good conversationalist , & gave me advice on how i can start blowdrying my hair because i had told her i did n't know how to do it .	1430
1	we had and amazing experience thanks to marshal , carli and hanna were amazing and very knowledgeable and extremely helpful . every puppy deserves a home no matter where they come from or how they are acquired as long as they are in a good loving home . thanks guys our pups are healthy and in a wonderful home .	1894
1	still a fan ! just updating a review to add a quick tip : avoid going in on saturdays or sundays . it is so busy , they just go through clients like it 's a gas station . in , out , get your fill , get the heck out . once i had a stylist that was n't my regular one and she let me walk out with damp hair . not cool when you only came in for a wash and blow dry . so do n't come as the last appointment of the night ( cuz they want to go home ) , and do n't come on a week-end !	2509
0	i have been going here for approximately 20 years , and considered it one of the top 5 mexican food restaurants in the valley . no more . when i went tonight the first thing i noticed that 20-25 % of the menu was blacked out , particularly the part about the flavorings in the dishes served . and it was true , the food is now bland . and the service is now atrocious . my friend , who also goes there with me frequently , also agreed the restaurant has taken a turn for the worse . when i questioned our server she replied , `` we are going through changes. `` definitely will never return or recommend this to my friends .	1346
0	this place has been in decline since it opened . relatives from out of town stayed here last year and said it was terrible , no maintenance , not clean and the service was very bad . i will recommend another place to family and friends .	2866
0	the drive through line is always wrapped around the building . the line inside moves at a glacial pace . i have to confirm 3 times and they still do n't get it right . seriously , wth are you guys doing in there .	606
1	i have been coming to family doctors of green valley for about 4 months for their medical weight loss program . i am very satisfied with my care and jaimie takes very good care of me for my weekly visits . she always has a smile on her face and always willing to answer all of my questions and concerns .	297
1	i really love the sandwiches and the service at philly 's famous , you get the feeling that ( most of ) the staff actually wants you to enjoy your meal . i will say there is room for improvement on the fries , but they 're not bad by any means . any place with a flat top can make a cheesesteak , but the quality of the steak itself and the bread separate the winners from the losers ... and philly 's famous is a winner in my book !	777
1	went in an bought a thruxton 900 , mark and all his staff are super friendly and extremely helpful in answering all my questions overall it was a great experience . i am looking forward to seeing which motorcycle is next , definitely coming back .	94
1	these guys are the best ! they are so nice and so helpful whenever i frequent their store . i took my bike of 18 years in for repair and it works like brand new now ! thank u thank u thank u !	1946
0	unless you want your veins blown in both arms , do n't let the arogant , narcissistic white guy in the back poke you . this place wasted my time , twice .	1753
1	we went to two different restaurants trying to house a party of 12 . no go ca n't help you . these guys are bending over backwards . they rock . samples , friendly service , managers coming over several times to see how we were . and the funnel cakes were to die for . we will be back ! ! ! !	144
0	i would give a 0 if i could . been waiting for this special order for weeks and it 's gone take longer than 5 weeks which stated it would take for them to make the request . bs .	2071
0	answered the phone hello like i was bothering her . had to ask if i had the business . called this place to see about an oil change . the lady on the phone was so rude . still do n't know if they do oil changes , nor do i care now .	3453
1	i 've only been there twice during the afternoon but both times was quite pleasant . it 's definitely a dive . but i enjoyed myself . only reason it got 4 instead of 5 is there was a pup there that liked me a little too much and would n't leave me alone but once the owner of the dog saw they took care of the situation promptly .	850
0	nice atmosphere and service was good . my low rating is due to food quality and options . everything was adequate , but not worth it for the price . it seemed as though everything was overly salted instead of properly seasoned . also , more vegetarian/vegan options would be appreciated .	632
0	the owners sister gave me a pedicure . she was wonderful and did a great job . the website said $ 20 for a pedicure and so did the price board in the salon . the gal who did my pedicure charged me $ 20 but ... as my toes were drying the owner came over and said i owed her $ 23 . i told her i already paid and the price says $ 20 . she said it 's more on fridays and her sister did n't know . ruined the whole experience	2121
0	we must have caught the owner ( that everyone raves about on here ) on an off night . after about 15 minutes of waiting for someone to take our drink order , we asked the hostess if we could get a server to our table . after another ten minutes of waiting we asked again and someone finally came . not ideal with two hungry kids at dinner time . on the plus side , the sushi was very good and hibachi chef was entertaining .	890
1	this place has a really nice modern aesthetic . i got the pesto toscano pizza and it was pretty good . the pizza crust is thick yet airy , with just the right amount of crunch on the exterior . the pizza would have been 5 stars if it were n't for the olives they used . i usually like olives but these olives were wayyyy too strong for the pizza . they overpowered all other flavors and that was disappointing because it was a great pizza otherwise . i would probably spring for the margherita next time .	252
1	used the salon services here for my daughter 's prom . victoria in the salon listened to everything my daughter wanted for her prom `` updo '' , and victoria nailed it ! ! she was fantastic ! i have never been compelled to write a review before , but felt the service we received warranted this review . we also were able to get makeup done at sephora here , which was amazing as well . overall great experience .	3633
0	last night we had a reservation at 6:15 . by 6:35 we had not even had so much as a hello from a wait staff . we did , however , get water from a bus girl . we left - feeling disappointed . went next door for mexican instead . it was packed - and we did not see a single table get waited on in 20 minutes . gave up !	600
0	i absolutely love the food here . it 's one of my favorite sub restaurants . however , the delivery service is terrible . i always order when i 'm at work , which is in the pv mall . it regularly takes a half an hour for food to be delivered , with my max wait time having broken an hour once or twice . there 's nothing freaky fast about the delivery service at all .	1340
0	by far the filthiest gym environment i 've ever been in the equipment has n't been wiped off in years and the high dusting is so thick and full of contaminants it 's ridiculous for a place where people go to to try to get healthy to be put in a position to breathe such filthy air is just plain irresponsible i 've brought it to the attention of management on more than one occasion and it falls on deaf ears owners in upper management should be ashamed of themselves there is no excuse for how bad it is i get that it 's a low-cost alternative but there 's no excuse for filthy	2919
0	absolutely shocked by the rude customer service . very condescending and not at all helpful over the phone . truly a shame , since they appear to have a decent product . the person i spoke to claimed to be the owner . honestly a shockingly bad phone experience . i would not even consider ordering from this florist .	2585
1	two febuary 's in a row , win a little relax in great comfort , have a great experience and a whole lot different then the hotel style , traveled around the area and had some good luck , met good people , saw some wonderful real estate , good enough to make me leave cali , maui got some competion , love the mountain views from everywhere , will be back again and again	1057
0	this place is terrible . i left there with on significantly thicker eyebrow and one super thin one . i went there once and had a good experience , so i thought this was my new spot . the three times after that were a disaster . as i mentioned asymmetrical eyebrows which was a mess , but on top of that i always noticed a bunch of missed stray hairs all over when i would get in the car . so ridiculous and expensive . do n't go here . i drive all the way to phx now for my eyebrows and it is so worth it . this is your face your paying for !	2986
0	total wine is for the total white . racist staff and unsatisfactory customer service . better off just going to wal-mart for better service .	3199
0	went today , shoutout to the girl who was wrapping my burrito and decided to announce how sick she was and thought it was funny . disgusting . thoroughly upset with quality of food and service ... poor job moes	828
0	the air conditioner in our room sounded like a bunch of harley davidson bikes driving by . the bed was n't very comfortable . the coffee was weak . the staff , however , is very kind . we 've stayed in many hampton inns and this is one of the worst experiences we 've had .	3802
1	the cost is not for the feint of heart - but the food is fit for a maharaja , have a great evening and treat yourself to the chefs tasting menu . not typical presentations or traditional preparations set origin india apart from usual indian fare . some may be disappointed in this . the bartender makes a wild selection of great martinis .	600
1	we went there on a friday night for dim sum . really delicious and fresh green beans , pan fried chicken dumplings , and beef samosas . we could n't get enough of the green beans . service is good enough , and ambiance is urr , `` fusion '' , but that does n't matter . we will be back for the food .	113
0	after visiting the website , my daughter and i booked a birthday party with sweets unlimited for the $ 30 per person price exactly as described on the website . just received a call that the party is now $ 50 per person . very disappointed and would never do business with them . false advertising .	782
1	crisp , yeast crusts minimalist decor byob ! fab pizza wi thoughtful ingredients- simple is better such a cool owner chef try ! ! of the earth	754
0	unfortunately , i found nothing good from this place . the musubi fell apart and i could taste it 's from dry leftover rice . the magic boba is n't boba at all . the french donut is probably the only good thing but it took them more than 20 minutes to get my order of 3 items and i 'm the only customer in the store .	215
1	love the mimo salad ... great servers , awesome patio , right on college st .	240
0	this place really sucks ... i bought a groupon for a massage.. i called , texted , emailed to try and make an appointment never got a straight answer to when it was available . . she said they do n't open evenings , and on here says the open from 8 to 8 , she texed me they open at 11 and close at 2 30pm.. what kind of business is this.. why do you sale groupons if you are not going to be professionals when it comes to `` availability ''	3079
1	best deal of the day : killer shake ( see picture ) . big enough to satisfy your sugar cravings in its 35 oz mug !	534
1	downtown toronto near entertainment district . lots of construction nearby and the king street pilot project affecting traffic . several close parking lots . the inside is `` dated '' according to hubby but i found it cool . coat check , kitchen , bars , several little areas that can be sectioned off ... ..attended a fundraiser here and various food stalls were in the different areas . great sound from the dj . i did not see the washrooms or the terrace .	2873
0	would not recommend ! ! first time trying since the remodel . the place was maybe half full on a wednesday evening , service was awful , food was so-so . truthfully , could 've gotten a better burger & better service at 5 guys ! it took 45 minutes to get our food ! ! i could see if they were slammed but they were n't ... . too bad because i prefer to support local businesses ... : (	1253
0	beware of this cleaner ! their management and ethics are simply terrible . i took my brand new calvin klein dress , only worn once , my new favorite , to have drycleaned and they broke the teeth on the zipper . the guy behind the counter ( manager ? ) refused to give any restitution . i did receive a response to this post weeks later saying that they would send my dress out to receive a new zipper . so much time had passed that i did not keep the dress . i posted back that i would like the money for the dress but never did get a response . therefore , my one star remains . read more	1719
1	i was very happy with my experience at the costco car wash. for $ 7.99 i got a decent drive-through car wash . the guy who was at the start of the car wash even offered to let me go back through the wash if it did n't get all the bugs off my windshield the first time . i 've found my new car wash spot !	1102
0	way way way overpriced . they did n't even know what tattoos both of us wanted and hey we 're charging $ 300 for the both of us when we wanted the smallest tattoos possible . no recommended at all . the worst . just trying to make money in a tourist area . horrible .	665
0	i thought this place was really nice and clean until i witnessed employees allow a woman and her dog in the establishment , they litterally walked through the shop , one of the workers even pet the dog while handling tools and servicing a customer.talk about disgusting and unsanitary ! ! ! ! i will not be back ! ! ! !	1256
1	jan arrived took jake right in and turned my 3 year old aussie into a prince ! i am amazed how beautiful he looked and relaxed after his grooming session . last time he was at the groomers he came home , cowering and clingy . after his visit with jan he was frisky and ready to play . he was clean , fluffy and well trimmed . his nails and feet were trimmed to perfection . i will definitely recommend her to all my doggy parent friends and use her services again . jan is very busy but called me back within 24 hours and worked with my schedule . very positive experience and best of all my dog was happy .	807
1	really nice staff . they are very helpful , and reviewed my bill . i was able to add additional channels and my bill went down by a couple bucks ! thanks for the awesome treatment guys !	664
1	our 2 older grandsons have b-days 10 days apart . for their present-my husband and i `` kidnap '' them in the morning and take them out for breakfast and then a museum . the first year we did the great kids museum , but the last 2 years we 've gone here . they love it ! it 's good for all ages , we even learn and try new things ! i do n't know about anyone else-but we were there almost 3 hours . the boys b-days are coming up the end of the month and they 've already requested to go to the science ctr again-they 'll be 8 & 9 .	3891
0	got carry out after a long day and ordered a crave big box i ordered all items in the meal with chicken instead of the normal beef paste . when i got one and finally sat down to rest and eat ... only one item had chicken in it , the rest were still beef . i 'm all for raising minimum wage , but the quality of work needs to be worth the cost . now i have to drive back in to get the rest of my meal . this is the second taco bell that has messed this up this month .	1341
0	i will never go back . the food was old and cold . the bathroom was so nasty , i refused to use it . i was sick after eating there , i threw up all night . if i could give this this restaurant a 0 , i would ! ! ! ! horrible place .	1212
0	this is n't a renaissance festival , its a flea market where people dress up . real renaissance festivals at least try to be historically acurate . they do n't mix centuries of dress , continents , etc . they do n't have guilds of people in body paint acting like amature bdsm wannabes . its expensive , ( to eat and drink all day . admission is n't much ) and the entertainment is laughable . if you want to go to a real ren faire , save up a little extra money and go to the southern california ren faire .	2665
1	we ate here last night for dinner . i have eaten at a lot of chinese restaurants in town out of town and out of the country . this was the best chinese food i have had yet . my husband had the chow fun without sauce and it was amazing . i ate the lobsters with green onion and ginger . it was cooked perfectly , sauce was excellent and just the right amount . the service was fantastic . i am defiantly going back . best chinese restaurant in town hands down . if this is the food you want this is the place to go ! ! !	561
0	on a scale of 1-10 i give this event a 4 . it was $ 15 a person to get in which was cash only . the people working the event and attending the event are super rude . i was n't dressed in the renaissance attire , just every day clothes and i was treated so poorly by everyone who was dressed in their renaissance attire . so over all it 's over priced for entrance , food , and drinks . also , the people there are mean . so boo .	2665
1	such a great experience , it gets super busy here on saturdays because of their $ 20 piercing deal , but it 's well worth the wait . taylor is so friendly and very professional with her work . she made me feel very comfortable . i would highly recommend this place ! : )	2764
0	horrible training of staff in the office . i knew i could only sign my kid up for one month and asked what do i need - the staff said that 's fine just fill out the regular paperwork . no problem . well i was charged for a second month i can not use . the manager of billing told me sorry you need to give a 30 day notice- which i did when i signed up .	1427
1	we get the pork belly table bbq every time ! the value is really good and good portion for 2 . the side dishes are good and they refill them if you ask . the soup that came with the combo is really nice and i recommend to choose the tofu soup .	1290
0	i was going to the chandler office ( 2015 to 2016 ) for andropause after seeing dr. derosa on tv . i received testosterone injections . my provider quit without notice . i did not like who replaced her so i went to another provider . armed with all my derosa lab-work my new provider could n't believe how high derosa let my estrogen get . they did n't address elevated estrogen , common on testosterone therapy and easy to prevent . the new place put me on an estrogen blocker and intermittent hcg to prevent testicular shutdown and atrophy .	303
0	1 star for not having french fries as a side . all of their sides are awful but not having fries in a sandwich shop is just an example of a lazy business owner who did n't want to shell out the money for a deep fryer . off to miracle mile for a real sandwich .	432
0	they send me coupons..yet everytime i try to buy something with them they say it 's excluded ... . never will they get a dime of my money again ! ! !	2479
0	eh ... no frills event building in a strip mall . most people working that i interacted with were just fine . the one thing i notice they need to be clear about is when the doors open and when bands take the stage . in both cases they advertise inconsistently between tickets and online ads and the venue 's online schedule . sound was eh ... could hear sound bleeding into the venue i was in from the one next door . not sure i would want to make the trip again to see an event in this place .	17
0	just got take out . not good . almond fried chicken was n't correct . fried rice tasted old . egg rolls were stringing with some type of leafy , lettuce vegetables and over fried . sweet and sour chicken was okay . first timer . not going back !	1264
1	overwhelming selection , but that 's a good thing ! it was nice to be able to cruise the showroom and not feel like i was being stalked by some ninja salesperson .	2071
1	same regency cleaners staff and locations , just new business name , ownership with more focus placed on a more environment friendly product and more current style . no price changes . hoping to see an improvement from previous ownership . i know the staff makes great efforts to provide customer care and service . in the past i watched some good employees walk away and i am certain it was because of upper management aka previous owners .	2374
1	the chow fun noodles with shrimp are outstanding . this little asian restaurant reminds me of my favorite place in china town , san francisco . liking forward to going back .	779
1	if you 're looking for just a place to sleep for a great deal off the strip , i recommend this hotel . this was formerly a holiday inn , but i guess it was bought over . the hotel is clean . the room is spacious and comfortable . staff is friendly and accommodating . there 's also underground parking . but be aware that there is a resort fee that pays for the gym , parking , and wifi . there is a complimentary breakfast included .	2017
1	dr. monroe is amazing ! she has helped me with my issues for the past few years . i understand she is very busy and this may be the reason i have to wait sometimes but , i do not mind because she is a very good and up to date . she takes her time with me and takes care of my health better than any doctor i ever had before .	3323
1	alex was on time , worked efficiently , explained what needed to be done and took his time answering my questions . i will call the right guys in the future and will recommend them to my friends .	1644
1	we stopped here for the first time and the froyo was amazing ! the atmosphere is fun and family friendly with cool games and decor . we got a mix of froyo and toppings . i like that there are different cup sizes and a variety of toppings to choose from . we found out they are recently under new ownership run by a really nice family . we will be back for sure ! !	1903
1	was here earlier today they let you stay as long as you want . i just get a good lunch service is still the same grill cheese was ok. wilke snack wrap better . this is my new spot for when i have to edit photos . price is nice . they let you fill up your own waterbottle ! let 's just say i filled it with ice tea then they did let me switch to another drink . that does n't happen too often . comfortable seating to . and chargers . if you go in the weird hours you can focus more on your work .	2741
0	this place is a mess . i 've been to plenty robertos , but this one takes the cake . none of the sodas had any carbonation , hell scratch that , none of the the drink dispense fully worked . this place over all is fucking nasty , do n't know if it was the crew that day or just the management . i 'm glad the robertos closer to where i live have better quality than this shit hole .	322
0	my home warranty company sent doctor cool out to fix a a/c leak . the technician wrote up a expensive repair order that the warranty company denied . they sent out another company and after applying .15 cents worth of glue and 20 minutes my problem was completely resolved . do n't trust this companies diagnosis .	2776
1	love the curry chicken rice and great milk tea ; decent portion ! the atmosphere is nice in here , very relaxing ! p.s curry chicken rice get sold out fast so best to coming before the rush hour !	2971
0	service sucked . beautiful afternoon , marvelous company , at swirl for 1.25 hours was served one beverage each and waitress never returned to our table . very disappointing .	296
1	was pleasantly surprised with the service today in a terminal ! i 've previously had a few bad experiences here but definitely not this time . it seems as if there are some fresh faces behind the bar so that is positive . great job management .	3124
1	tried this place for the 1st time food was good but prices we a tad high . it has the typical *burtos menu . the restaurant is small . but food is great and i will try again !	1036
0	did n't even sit down before hearing the performer michael spadoni make a racial slur . when expressing our discomfort to the performer , he stated that he refused to apologize , and that he makes racial jokes about all cultures , therefore it is `` okay . '' a different staff member verified that he does indeed make racist statements that like regularly . for this to be deemed as regular is a direct reflection of the establishment . i refuse to visit any establishment that allows the closed minded , racist statements of michael spandoni continue .	3326
1	ryan and scott took care of me totally with a remake on a delish sicilian that ended up with mayo which i do n't eat . no questions , handed over a new one on time just perfect with a smile . always a great product and a `` hello '' when you come in ! nice !	1494
1	i purchased a new laptop here a few days ago and the staff was great . i dont know much about computers so the guy that helped me actually took the time to explain everything to make sure it was going to fit my needs . i am very happy with my purchase and the customer service !	494
0	i have been a customer of this dr for over ten years . i have spent hours waiting for appointments up to two hours at times , one hour being the norm . i got into the habit of calling before my appointment to make sure they were running on time , which was also a waste of time as they still made me wait . today my daughter was 20 minutes late ( not excusable , she was late ) however they told her she needed to reschedule ! ridiculous i am finding a new dr one with more compassion and better time keeping skills .	661
1	my back has been feeling much better allowing me to be up on my feet for longer periods of time . the staff there are all very friendly and the scheduling is very accommodating to my busy schedule . i have liked it so much i even brought my 16 year old in to start her treatment too !	1785
0	1 . if you sell cupcakes , have more than three kinds of cupcakes for sale , and more than nine total in the display case . it 's a cupcake store . it 's not an art gallery . fill the display case with , oh , i do n't know , cupcakes . 2 . if you sell cupcakes , make sure they taste like cupcakes . hint : cupcakes should taste like cakes , not like cardboard cups . those are cakecups , and are totally different .	3749
0	wow - quite the rude encounter at enterprise rental at madison airport . usually really like enterprise because they care about having happy customers and take responsibility for when they are not fair in a situation . not this time ! where are the madison manners ? ! ?	2345
0	if i could give zero stars i would made an appointment been sitting here over an hour to be seen and i even arrived early	2334
1	steve saved my life . i needed a new lens for my nikon because my hubby dropped it . our vowel renewal in cabo was 4 days away . thank goodness steve said they had a spare and i could trade in my damaged lens for the already refurbished one . the price was also too good to be true . great place to come for repairs and good service .	633
1	stumbled upon this place while trying a find another store in the area . oh my -- huge smile on my face when i walked in ! this store is an upgraded ben franklin . picked up more scrapbook stuff to add to my collection . love the fabric section ! so much more prints to choose from vs the stores at home . i will definitely go back to this store when i 'm in vegas again . thank you to the lady behind the fabric counter who gave me coupons .	1937
1	five star service . convenient and so helpful . priced compared and they matched cheaper price with an additional $ 5 off . bought the extra super glass protector and an otter box cover . highly recommend this store . salesman was perfect too . cost was $ 99/price match at $ 89 las $ 5 , iphone 5s replacement glass . they made sure phone worked perfectly too . gail	3817
1	i love forever 21 and always have ! this location is the closest to me but not my favorite . it 's always a mess , the visuals as well as the mannequins are always a mess . the visual merchandising is very poor and need big changes and maintaining . the great about the location is the sizing . they carry a lot in stock and always have enough sizes . it 's a huge store with plenty to choose from . i always stop in and but a few things when doing my shopping in this center .	3373
1	i enjoyed my service at the avalon school or cosmetology . the highlights were the professional , beautiful and kind teacher overseeing her students who worked on me . things i did n't enjoy : were the busy front desk , the atmosphere in the front was not so relaxing ! the private rooms used for facials were lovely , clean and simple . my daughter had a negative experience with her brow waxing , so i 'm not sure i recommend the waxing services . nails were just okay .	2899
1	big fan of their gnocchi . always pleasant service and food comes out relatively quickly . they have a small restaurant , tables are pretty close together but it gives that small italian cafe feel . love that they have a covered patio with heaters so you can enjoy sitting outside rain or shine .	563
1	best service department ever ! very efficient and treat you like family . if you are ever in the need of repairs contact bob krotonsky at arrowhead honda !	2210
1	i love 121 fitness . the facilities have everything you could want and the staff is friendly and professional ! they do an exceptional job keeping things clean and tidy . the staff members i have gotten to know like melissa go out of there way to make you feel welcome and get the most out of your experience . their yoga instructors are top notch and are always striving to keep their classes fresh and challenging . i particularly like the classes taught by julie , nick , brian and hillary .	1984
0	i decided to try them again . one guy kept pulling his pants up ; only problem with that is '' he still had his gloves on and trying to prepare my food '' . and this was the same week that all chipotle stores closed on a monday for food safety . feb. 8th 2016 ... my visit feb. 11th another guy was by the grill and checking his messages . burrito tasted okay .	869
0	update . went back here and ordered a crispy chicken sandwich . got home and after biting into it realized it was raw . they also messed up my other order . i called and spoke to robert and his resolution was to remake the food . unacceptable resolution . i paid for this food . simply doing what you should have done to begin with is not good enough . going above and beyond is .	998
0	the employees will run this place out of business , came there at 10:40 when they open at 10:00 and sign is not on , tell them the signs not on and they say `` ok ? '' one employee stayed on her phone the whole time . these employees make a bad atmosphere and make you want to get out of there on purpose so they do n't have to work .	1528
1	this place was pleasantly surprising ! they were fast , and i am super picky , but i enjoyed the time there , and had not one complaint . love my nails , and my toes !	43
1	always super fast delivery and everything you can expect from a big chain pizza joint !	1406
0	worst salon ever . i came once and a woman helped me and she did a great job . the man i saw today was a younger guy and tall . he kept staring off while doing my nails and accidentally clipped my skin and it bled . half of my nails are crooked and lumpy . he was so quick to get me out the door . at least do your job correctly . rude guy .	3497
0	below average taste with premium pricing . what a rip off . i ordered a wonton soup , with two wontons in there , price is $ 14 . will never go back again , recommend others to explore other wonderful chinese restaurants in the area as well .	1441
0	this place was so rude to me , they made me uncomfortable and the smell in there is horrible . you can smell in the scent from the different stores around . like seriously ! ? so gross ! ! definitely do not recommend this place .	2683
0	have really enjoyed pure pizza in the past . tonight there were a few issues with the pizza . my wife and i had the pure country pizza . to sum up the pizza - the tomato sauce was like water , no taste and sauce soaked through to the crust . sauce made crust so moist , it was almost impossible to pick up . the topping included country ham , but it was almost non-existent on the pizza . pure country pizza ? more like a pure mess .	809
1	ask for van ! today i had a perfect manicure-pedicure - for just $ 35.00 . the pedicure chairs are amazing . i will be visiting this place again !	786
0	out of business and i bought tons of coupons for future deluxe washes ! bummer ! their phone is disconnected also .	1408
1	we used their services for the carpets in our new house and loved the job dustin did ! he even gave us advice on some stains we had on our furniture . prices were very reasonable ! will use again !	2135
0	could n't really get a feel for the place as i was n't let in b/c was wearing a tanktop . however , i do suggest you wear an affliction shirt . seems to be the uniform .	1966
0	unbelievable how rude servers were to us . we had a party of four on friday night , ready for the weekend to start ! we were blown off by couple servers . waited there for 20 minutes , nobody even acknowledged us . a server helped tables next to us couple of times and completely ignored us ! we picked up and left . got great service at tap house-the complete opposite of sierra gold . we are never coming back ! ! !	1520
1	it was awesome ! ! ! all desserts and drinks were good ! ! try everyone ! interior is also modern and fashionable .	1821
0	i get that it 's peter piper . so the expectations are kind of on the lower end . but this time they let a bum sit inside the restaurant . i get it , it 's hot out side . and if i was home less i would want an air conditioned place to relax and well . but eating a salami out of a chik fila bag and then sleeping in a booth . sorry not when my children are running around . never again . sorry	1283
0	this is the worst tuxedo place in pittsburgh . i suggest if you want a smooth wedding experience , stay away from top hat tuxedo . all of the workers are very rude , including the owner . we used this place for my brothers wedding , and it was a headache each time we had to go there . my brothers suit ripped before he walked down the aisle and the owner offered him 20 $ to get it fixed somewhere else so they did n't have to deal with it . ridiculous . stay away from top hat tuxedo ! !	3942
0	rough experience from beginning to end . intended to eat-in with a colleague with 30-minutes to work with . ordering was painful , as person at register struggled to correctly input our order . accidentally overcharged us by $ 21 somehow , and had to bring cash out to table to fix problem . after 15 minutes of waiting we changed order to `` to-go , '' and were then presented with wrong food . the wrap was decent , although not nearly as many options for toppings as other mediterranean restaurant options . i wish them well , but wo n't be back .	875
0	good pedicure , but requested to have a buff manicure instead of polish , which has a shine , but when finished and the buffing was n't complete i asked making the nails shiny w/the buffer , i was given a nasty look and quite the attitude.. disappointing , since i specifically asked for the buff w/shine .	3031
0	went the first time and they gave me the wrong order.. no chocolate ever.. moved down here almost a year ago and after the south durango store closed i went to this store.. and they still get orders wrong and again ... no chocolate still.. travel the extra time to a better dq cause you wo n't get soft served chocolate..	25
1	i love aawl and everything they do for all the dogs in need . i am starting to volunteer here and if anyone has any extra free time , they should too ! it is a great environment , everyone is very friendly , and it is very very rewarding ! if you are thinking about getting a dog or a few there are so many amazing dogs looking for a furever home !	1787
0	rude employees ( bob ) , balls are old , overpriced , gets too crowded . go somewhere else .	2690
1	i can not say enough about kelly 's . from the delicious mac-n-cheese ( the best i 've ever had ) to the great beer selection to the daily `` vintage '' cocktail specials to the fantastic , multi-genre jukebox , i love everything about this bar . the crowd varies from hipsters to students to older professionals to locals . you can sit in one of the booths inside for hours , play cards and talk , or you can sit outside on their patio during nice weather . beer prices are reasonable , and well worth the cost .	279
0	if i could rank lower then 1 star i would . terrible service , terrible food . do n't eat here unless you want to be tied to your toilet for 2 days afterward . shrimp tacos - no . greasy ( how ? ! ) , doused in mayo beef stroganoff- basically dog food warmed up on noodles will not be back .	97
1	as a newcomer i had n't heard about this place , until a good friend of mine saw me trying to fight a hardcore chocolate craving and decided to drag me to this place . i ordered the hot chocolate with salty caramel and i felt like the happiest person on earth when i saw my treat - sweet , salty , creamy , crunchy toppings , warm , delicious ! also , the inside of the place was very minimal and pretty , i liked the soft pastel colours and deco .	2548
0	little caesars : `` wait , it 's not ready ! '' i do n't why this particular location never has pizzas ready . that 's the whole point of going to little caesars , right ? you go in , give them $ 5 and walk right back out with a pizza . it 's really not worth waiting for , in my opinion .	519
0	the tall red headed woman with dimple piercings has a very condescending and smug attitude . they have a no return policy the second you walk out the store , which she did not explain to me either when i purchased the jewelry . the jewelry i bought turned out to be defective . it was my first and last time visiting this store .	2790
0	love the stars ! but you can get them online cheaper . the other lighting that they carry is way overpriced and quite antiquated .	3426
0	these guys are ripoff artists . the guy in the garage actually doing my oil change did a good job . i watched all the work he did from just outside the garage door . it was the desk guy in the office and then the store manager who came up with every excuse in the book to more than double the cost on the oil change coupon . if they do this for an oil change i 'd be afraid to use them for a brake job .	2552
0	this place is kept like a jail . bouncers are poorly educated about customer service , and do not know how to treat people . my girlfriend and i were kept in the line for more than an hour for being mistaken for somebody else . upon the end of the night , she got physically assaulted by one of bouncers while she tried to argue the situation . the bartender tried to rip us off , and when asked for a bill ... came back with a different and a much lesser amount . luxy is a jail and not a club ... it makes downtown clubs look like heaven . i do not recommend luxy for anybody .	3724
0	tried to play mini-golf last evening and had to quit because of bugs . when saying something to the help about it , no offer was made to refund money . they acknowledged the bug problem .	3001
1	i went to mor looking for a living room set . the sales rep was extremely friendly and helped with all the questions i had . i 'm planning to go back soon to buy a new bed and some wall decor . best furniture store by far ! !	1640
1	great lunch today ! i had the tamago burger . it was so yummy and the patty was actually a bit crispy ! i am coming back for sure !	964
0	i might return another time , i went on a thursday late august for lunch . it was n't bad , took over an hour to get served for lunch and we had to wolf down the food and leave to get back to the office for a meeting . i would avoid this place if in a hurry but i may try again if i have a longer lunch time , or maybe for dinner . this place has all the elements of a good restaurant/gourmet burger place , but clearly have n't figured out how to manage being busy which i guess is a good problem for them to have .	1417
1	called penny for emergency service , and was immediately given a window for service , same day . within 25 minutes , chad was at our door and working a solution to get us powered back up . not only did he diagnose our immediate issue , but he provided us with a plan to make sure this does n't happen again . chad was a consummate professional , not even stopping for a torrential downpour . it 's been hard to find good electrical contractors in las vegas , not anymore . thank you chad and penny electric !	1867
0	they 've increased prices but do n't keep the same price for returning customers . i 've been a customer for 1.5 years and am now paying $ 10 dollars more than what i usually get . sadly will not be returning because they do not honour their existing clientele .	3420
1	jamie did an amazing job at fixing my nails ! ! ! i recently went to pink nails , and they messed my nails up extremely bad so i went here and they did an amazing job ! ! their work is amazing ! !	3010
1	this business went over and above the call of duty to get our a/c up and running . our home warranty contacted affirmative air after another business showed little knowledge and was unsuccessful at repairing our a/c , along with providing surly customer service . the guys from affirmative air came in and worked tirelessly at repairing a complex problem . they worked within our schedule and coordinated with an electrician in order to get the problem repaired correctly . they worked with positive attitudes and were very professional . if i could give more than five stars i would ! a very happy customer in cave creek , az .	2078
0	went this afternoon with two friends . ordered food , and one hour later server comes by to say `` the kitchen is busy , it 'll be coming soon '' . fifteen minutes later she comes by to say the same thing . we ask her to check how long it will be and she goes , comes back , and says `` at least another half hour '' . we got up and left . awful , never again .	630
0	this one was very hard for it took me 5 days because i love this place ! ! ! what kind of person and friend i could of been to y'all if i do n't deliver the truth ! ! in the beginning i would of giving this place 10 stars but in every place you know what might be there but your always in denial until you witnessed it yourself for example.. dirty forks , bad service , cold food ; but i will let my video do the talking . just realized i ca n't leave a video so screenshot it is. ! ! ! i will give .05 star	3397
0	great service until we purchased the dress . it was all down hill after that . very little consideration or accommodation that my daughter had to fly in from out of town for fittings . they told us we did n't need an appointment to pick up the dress and then had us wait for 50 minutes . will never recommend them .	2938
1	cactus jacks is a super chill place to grab drinks with friends . the bartenders are super friendly , and the prices are great ! love cactus jacks : )	1295
0	jack refuses to warranty his work . i paid for work on my backwash assembly and only used it once . i called jack and asked him to come take a look at it . i made an appointment with him , got off work early to make it , and he called 10 minutes before the appointment and told me his warranty is only 30 days -- thing is i checked my invoice and it does not say this ... dissappointing service !	2925
1	my first time flying with alaska air ... i was really surprised by the awesome customer service . i have flown with other airlines before and have always waited at least 45 minutes to an hour before being able to speak to a customer service representative . i had to revise my itinerary this past weekend ( seattle to phoenix ) and had to call in 4 times . not once did i wait more than 2 minutes to speak to a real life representative . the reps were also very polite and funny ! go alaska air !	2400
0	not a family / kid friendly place . food was bland and service was horrible . would not recommend this place .	423
0	jeff and edwin mcguire made the process very frustrating . they were unprofessional and did not know how the process works . they pulled credit multiple times and could not explain the reason why .	2134
0	my daughter had her eyelashes done here . she had a groupon . it was her first time . at first , the lashes looked good , but after 3 days , most of the lashes had fallen out . she called and told them and when she went back to have them fixed , they charged her again . also , she discovered that they had cut her real lashes short before applying the extensions . not sure why they had to do that . definitely would not recommend this place .	1056
1	one of my favorite restaurants , and the best butter chicken in the montreal area . intimate decor , good service , amazing food . the 10 $ thali is a great deal , and the konkanee shrimp are delicious . i love this place .	140
0	tony doesnt know de wae , i speet on cold stone speet speet speet speet speet speet speet speet speet	1523
0	zoo . unmanaged chaos . unresponsive service reps. no one knows what is going on . i only come here when responding to manufacturer recall . i honestly so dislike coming here for service , that i plan to not buy another honda because i do n't want to be locked into this service department again .	2210
0	do not choose this place to live until heath the head of leasing is gone . i signed a lease from california ... no one told me the pool is under construction and my luxury apartment is vibrating . heath does n't know how to do the right thing .	1798
0	dirty , dirty , dirty . small scoops . i can tell this place just changed management . too bad .	220
0	overrated food . the shaved ice has no taste , just a plain ice ... super dissapointed ! ! !	176
0	omg ! was too disappointing about the taste . and it 's too watery . how can you taste the flavor if its too watery and smoothies suppose to have a bit of ice atleast . but customer service was ok. ca n't really speak english well but atleast they try !	1898
0	just moved to the silverado ranch area and needed a gym close to home . fitness 19 is small but has all the necessary equipment you need to get a true work out in . the gym does lack in open space for stretching and non-equipment exercises . i 'm always press for time and here i can get in and get my workout done without waiting for a machine . on the negative side it 's not open 24/7 . even if it was open a little later . i mean this is las vegas .	2919
0	choppy . sort of a mess . quite odd . big jlo fan . loved the jenny on the block segment but the rest was just not happening . we saw three parties around us leave early including 5 young girls that were clearly thrilled to be there initially . i am glad i saw her , but for the price tag i ca n't recommend it .	1771
0	the trampolines are fine overall the thing that sucked were the nachos , they were stale as *** the cheese was n't even fully melted . & the icee machine was n't even working . i paid almost 4 dollars for a couple stale chips and cold cheese , does n't seem like a lot but i mean how can you possibly mess up nachos ? if they 're going to be serving food this crappy might as well let us bring in our own food .	1664
1	looks like this car wash took over the old one i had a membership for so i was a little skeptical . all i can say is wow ! ! ! the kids are dressed very professional and the light show was actually pretty cool . looks like they have a few new things added that i did n't get before with my membership and my car came out amazingly clean . needless to say i will be getting a membership through them welcome to the neighborhood	78
1	food was very good but not great . service very friendly and spot on . nice clean restaurant . plenty of parking . good value for prices . upscale neighborhood italian restaurant , that if i lived in the area would go back . long trip from los angeles .	1539
1	john from dr cool just came to service our ac units . he was quick and to the point . very knowledgeable about what the problem was and was able to fix it fast . carla ( who works in the office ) also offers great and friendly customer service over the phone . our home warranty company sent them out but i would definitely call them on my own and recommend them to anyone .	2776
0	always thought i loved this store , but honestly after today do n't think they deserve 1 star . all because of one guy who is apparently the owner . threw out my girlfriend who unfortunately has to have a service dog . unacceptable !	794
1	edward g is a great guy . came in at midnight and needed a car battery and he was very helpful . what a great place to be open so late . thank	424
1	i stopped by to see the shop . it was clean and there people up front to greet me . they were very helpful and got me in right away . they answered all of my questions before i started . they were thorough and honest ! definitely coming back to this salon ! ! ! cindy was awesome ! ! !	1834
0	military families do not go here ! this place said my three year needed to get surgery to get her molars fixed and had two cavities . the surgery would cost $ 300+ and to get it done asap . my husband took my daughter to a different dental office that accepted tricare and nothing was wrong . no cavities and molar issues . i filed a fraud complaint against this place on the tricare website . this place just wants to get paid and not looking out for the well being of young children .	2626
0	i placed an order for pick up online . when i got there , i had to wait behind a customer that was ordering . i told the lady i had a pick up and she seemed confused . she asked how i placed it and i told her online . had to wait about 15 minutes and the lady that placed her order there received her food before i did . this is the second time i 've ordered for pick up and it was n't ready . i should have at least gotten my food before the lady that just placed her order .	308
0	don in electronics is the rudest costco employee i have ever run in to . i was going to buy laptop but went to sams club .	1102
1	i loved this place . friendly staff and great food ! very affordable . i 'll definitely go back . : )	1450
0	i 'm not sure what happened . he seemed very nice and willing on the phone , and actually did a treatment several months ago . for some unknown reason he stopped returning my calls and my tenants calls . after a full week and no response i had to hire another company . very odd ?	2998
1	nice guys but poor service . inaccurate info on when my car would be completed . when it finally was done , the interior was a mess and grease all over the seats and carpets . how do i even know if they changed all the fluids if they do n't care about my car ? update . cliff the gm called me . as i said , nice guys and we discussed this and he was very kind . i feel that after his call , i am satisfied with his explanation and as whole , his company cares about the customer . i will go back here for all my brake issues in the future .	2552
0	do not bring your pet to this veterinarian . i was a long time customer of this vet and recently learned that their business practices are along the lines of a `` mechanic '' who looks under the hood and charges you for things you do not need . they should be investigated for their way of doing business its horrible . of the thousands of dollars i have spent there over the years , i am not wondering how much of it was really necessary ? ! only giving one star because i have to .	1700
0	lame imax theater ! ! when i have been to imax theaters they have been massive and awe-inspiring , but not this one- it looks like a regular movie theater , with an average sized screen ! ! the only cool part was the beginning credits advertising imax , but thats about it . it kind of sucked , the only cool part is that is at the palms .	491
1	in and out with the quickness . not social but who cares ! give me two eyebrows instead of one and we are all good . i constantly get compliments on my eyebrows so i am greatly pleased .	460
1	this was the first mcdonald 's in las vegas to have the new interior design & wifi many years ago , when they still charged for it . this location is close to the corner of sunset and eastern , which is near the airport runway . the staff is friendly and the manager here knows how to get the customer their order quickly , even when there is a large group of people . this is a good spot to grab a drink or some food before heading over to sunset park across the street .	1023
1	i recently got my windshield replaced with safe auto glass and could n't be more pleased . it was smooth from the beginning till the end and my glass looks amazing . i received the promotions i was offered from the sales rep and would highly recommend this company for any auto glass needs !	200
1	i 'm a huge fan of japanese and ramen and growing up in hawaii it 's hard to find what i like . this place is like someone 's grandma made food for you it 's the best . it 's not super fancy greatness of the food is mostly in how it 's done and what 's in it . it is well prepared yummy and delicious . its not going to break my bank because it 's fancy . it 's simple i have hit every ramen place in town and this is the place i go to 90 % of the time .	1
1	we have been to all of the recent iterations of this bar - world of beer , wasted grain and now the funky monk . we stopped in this afternoon for a drink and to watch the nba playoff game . the bartender welcomed us in and checked on us periodically , the bar was quieter than all of the other area bars , but maybe because it is such a new concept ( or maybe more of a club at night ) , and they have a pretty extensive drink list . i settled on a cherry lime mule and loved it - well mixed , refreshing and so tasty !	3336
0	dim sum was ok . i think they put a lot of msg in their food , felt so dizzy the whole day after and my stomach did not feel great . they had push carts which i 'm not a fan of , all that talking into my food . there may have been some food that had been sitting on the cart for a while , they offered to rehear which was nice but how long has it been sitting there ? ? too bad , i was looking forward to this place after looking for a dim sum place in mississauga ! !	338
1	i had a diy bowl over mixed greens , and really enjoyed it . this is a really healthy place to stop for lunch or for a snack , and it 's pretty accomodating to meat-eaters and vegetarians alike . i do wish the bowls were a tad bigger , but for a light lunch the small bowl works just fine , and it 's much better for you than a lot of other options in the area .	309
0	this car wash changed ownership literally overnight and is now quick quack . i used to love coming to this location for a $ 3 car wash- cheap rinse to get the dust off . now , the cheapest car wash is $ 5 for the same thing . annoying to pay that much more for the same thing that i 'm sure a lot of customers come for . disappointed in this change	78
0	worst hotel ever ! ! ! ! do not book this hotel ! cockroaches , drug deals by the vending machines , thin walls , smoke through the vents and then they charge you extra for `` smelling smoke '' . no breakfast as advertised and staff and management not helpful ! ! ! !	1888
1	this has become my movie theate of choice . the location is great , parking is close & easy . the star class theatres have ample leg room and extremely comfortable wide seats . they serve you food & drinks in star class . look for $ 6.00 coupons in the newspaper weekly .	2486
0	update 4/16/17 well came on easter sunday i called before hand to ask if they were open and they said yes but we 're only washing cars outside till about 10am then full inside and out after . so we got there and nope only washing outside once again ... this place blows now it 's being run by a bunch of kids no manager or anything	2359
1	great pizza for $ 5 . let 's be very clear , there are a bunch of 2 star reviews , that wanted gourmet pizza for $ 5 and were shocked to find out that extra cheese and pepperoni were extra . when evaluating a place you have to take the service in consideration to the price . if you want a better pizza , you can ask for extra cheese , pepperoni , garlic crust , etc . and still walk out with a large pizza for roughly $ 7.50 , which is well under the $ 10- $ 15 you would spend at a major chain . i also regularly get their cheese sticks and cheese steak hoagie .	662
1	my partner and i have lived here for a year now and we love it . unlike where we lived previously the appliances here are of much better quality resulting in far less maintenance requests ( i 've actually had none as of yet ) . the building and common areas are all very well kept . we are both very happy residents !	1798
0	got kicked out because it was 3 of us and they only allow 2 at a time..very distasteful !	1659
1	try the pineapple curry duck and fried spring rolls , they are delicious ! beautiful restaurant with a great atmosphere . this is the best thai food around .	895
0	would never use this company again . from charging way more than initially quoted to placing my pod a block away from my home to horrible customer service . never again !	3342
0	went there for a cut and a dye . left after the cut because of how poorly the cut was done . definitely did n't trust them to do the dye . the lady who cut my hair did n't seem like she knew what she was doing .	3182
1	great selection of food to choose from . staff was very friendly and helpful . price was good , quality and quantity of food was excellent . will go back there again . thank you yelp for helping me find this place .	580
0	went to bring out two dogs to be groomed . they want you to sign a waiver if they kill my dog or it gets bit by another dog on the premises that they are not responsible . so who would be ? oh its no big deal said the lady behind the counter we have 5 more people waiting to be called for grooming . well good for you . beware overpriced , snob 's , do n't care about you or your dogs . well thanks for nothing . my prediction is your not going to be working there much longer with that attitude .	3433
1	i have shopped here for years and have always gone to tj for help . the dude knows his stuff and never pressures you to buy anything . he cares that you will be satisfied with your purchase and the delivery team is also very good . they called me to let me know they were on their way and brought everything into the house quickly . if you are looking for an inexpensive place to buy furniture , there are other places . if you want quality with expert people to help you find the right furniture , then go see tj at rc wiley .	439
1	the food here is great ! it is difficult to find restaurants that cater to my food allergies and this one definitely does . i love that they have gluten free , vegetarian , vegan , and free range options . the food is well done . service can be slow and i do n't like that they charge $ 3 for extra pita ... other than that this place is great if you 're looking for a pita jungle type restaurant that is a lot healthier	1402
0	the landscape is so beautiful , but the pathways are really dirty with poop , poop everywhere . my family loves park , and this park is close to my house , but we prefer to go the park on craig , more activities and cleaner .	367
0	should be called the hogtown stench . i came in over the weekend for breakfast with a friend . i got the belt which was decent , but very stingy on the bacon . they cure their own meats and have an open kitchen with no closure to where the patrons sit . the smell is overwhelming . my friend and i had to change our clothes immediately after we left as we smelled like a pig roast . do not go here if you have plans after ! !	267
1	i was driving along and suddenly my engine started surging and it became difficult to stop my car . i called aaa and they sent mike snipes from kendall towing to tow my car . when he got there i described the problem , and he knew exactly what the issue was ! he opened the hood and re-attached the throttle body to the hose , which my mechanic had failed to secure a few days earlier when he replaced my radiator . i was on my way again in just a few moments , mike was just fantastic ; he was a nice guy , and obviously very knowledgeable . i was very happy and impressed .	1159
0	good first experience . second was unfortunately my last	2024
1	this review is for the `` cafe '' portion . pretty cool spot for super cheap $ 2.00/cup french press coffee . i love the deck they built , which overlooks the bay . i stopped by for a leisurely morning coffee with my bf on sunday morning and had a lovely time . they are just starting to offer classes on paddle board yoga , kayak etc - i ca n't wait to sign up for the moonlight paddle series !	1291
0	pathetic service ! pizza bar is disgraceful . 2 people ignored my family and i today . we order pizzas at a minimum of once per week . three years running ! lately , the people in this department have had poor attitudes . lazy and ignoring customers . but now it 's ridiculous . also , veganaise and refrigerated sections are seriously out of stock . poorly run store . only the basics we ca n't get anywhere else from now on for us . sad	433
1	great massage , hit all the tight muscles . very good customer service . i 'd highly recommend this business .	2550
1	a beautiful hotel in the middle of downtown phoenix . my husband and i stayed there for our second night as a married couple and the staff was lovely ! we were congratulated , upgraded and given a bottle of champagne to enjoy before we headed off to our honeymoon . the shower was also so cool , as it was `` walk-in '' style that almost took up half of the bathroom . we thought it was well worth the price - and the downstairs hotel restaurant was divine . definitely check out the happy hour .	3859
1	after a loooooooooooooooonnnnnnngggg walk in search of caffeine , i found this starbucks . my mocha frappuccino was fine and service was friendly . that 's all i can ask from an airport starbucks .	3124
0	cancel cancel and cancel ... these front desk bitches will practically wait the last minute to call and let you know that your appointment has been canceled . they always start their stupid ass messages the same way `` unfortunately they dr had an emergency '' two weeks straight on the same fucking day . then the dr. should stay home and you receptionist should n't schedule anything . they have me so upset . i swear these reviews are fake as hell	3598
1	their family meal is perfect ! it comes with a 1 topping pizza , chicken tenders , chicken wings and a 2 liter drink ... all delicious . we always have it delivered and it is still hot when we receive it . there is enough food in the meal that we have leftovers for days ! so yummy and the staff is super nice . : )	987
1	amazing food and atmosphere ! the butcher 's steak was one of the best dishes i have had . just be sure to make a reservation beforehand ! : )	1331
1	chicken tostada is currently the special on wednesdays . i love their chicken tostadas so much that i now call wednesday ... '' chicken tostada wednesdays '' ! ! ! i have yet to have a bad meal here . i 'm pretty sure if i could i 'd eat here every day ! tortillas taste homemade . salsas and meats taste so fresh . this has to be my favorite `` fast food '' mexican place in town . love it ! if you 're not a fan of the tostada , try the chicken quesadilla ! to die for ! tacos are really good too ! and get a punch card ... after the 10th punch you get a free meal ! yay !	1365
1	loved the food here ! by far , one of the juiciest burgers i 've ever had . the fries with the gravy is amazing , and the entire setting is very relaxed and nice to look at	964
1	omg ! ! ... . they have the best chicken tenders ever ! ! they are so moist amd huge.. my son loves them for his lunches . they are made fresh everyday and ready around 10am ! ! they have replaces a few chicken places and now we only go to fry 's . so yummy ! ! oh and i love i can get in and out within minutes if needed . or if i 'm doing a full shopping trip they always have everything i need .	2241
0	first time at this location and just needed brows done . wow , what the heck do the teach these people ? ? ? i literally left with one brown way shorter , much thinner , and not even close to looking like the other one . my 11 year old niece could have done a better job . and the girl who did it kept telling me she was `` addicted '' to waxing . maybe she needs to get addicted to learning about how to properly wax . have gone to the location in gilbert and always had good luck . 2 thumbs down on this experience ! ! ! !	2300
0	here 's the deal . they did n't wear gloves . and then . the ice cream i bought ( a small for 4.00 ) in the flavor java jolt tasted like soap with a hint of freezer burn . my friend got the cookie dough flavor ( again a small for $ 4 ) that tasted like crappy vanilla ice cream with cookie dough chunks thrown in , again with the aftertaste of soap and freezer burn . i will not be returning .	2569
0	thumbs down ! i tried to order over the phone and have a bouquet sent to my daughter 's school and the store rep made such a big deal that not all schools accept floral deliveries for their students , when i told her i know for a `` fact '' my daughter 's school does . courteous customer service is not a plus here . going somewhere else !	2266
0	i 've been coming here for over a year to get my nails done both acrylic and gel . i came this past friday and found that my gel nail fell off only three days later . i went back in to get it redone and they did not apologize or paint my nail the same color when i got it redone .	3711
0	horrible ! rude the minute he saw my coupon ! massage did n't even last 2 minutes ! ! not friendly what so ever - go elsewhere !	2407
0	worst customer service ever . rude . they can not answer questions , not welcoming . had to walk in twice just to get greeted .	1493
0	this is the worst place to live . the office is nice as can be before you sign papers , after that they can care less and treat you like a peeon . went to them for advice after my roommate left unannounced and they flat out said not their problem . then the roommate who left called and said i had unapproved people living there . so they gave me a 10 eviction notice without even knocking to verify if anyone was living there . now i have a 5300 collection from this corrupt place . oh yeah and if you do n't attend the community activities they will treat you even worse . do n't rent from them ! ! !	2609
1	great first impression with interior design and cleanliness . bright welcoming environment with very comfortable chairs . took advantage of the buy one get one free drink promo . had the mango green tea with coconut jelly adjusted to low sugar and low ice . it was excellent , refreshing and hit the spot . would definitely recommend .	3033
1	stayed at the hard rock for my birthday , got complimentary club tickets so we decided to take advantage of it . my sister and two best friends , we had such a wonderful time time at the club . it was a bit crowed but the music was great , dancing and overall ambience was welcoming and fun .	3596
1	new drive in - classic style ! hosted my son 's 8th birthday here and the staff and food is amazing . they brew their own pop , root beer and beer as well . lots of special events and great burgers and dogs .	953
0	been here twice and purchased the 15 $ wash do n't waste your money . i 'm sure the basic wash does the exact same thing . down the road i can get a wash for 15 and have guys make sure everything is spotless and dried for you . both times my car came out cleaner but still all kinds of spots and marks that would of came off somewhere else . the cycle is too fast for it to give a car a good clean . it 's worth 2 stars and i 'll never return .	2093
0	too expensive for `` expect more , pay less '' and i walked past a number of employees who i felt were very in-inviting to target . i smiled and said hello and i was dodged by the employees .	3244
1	they repaired my rug doctor vac under warranty . the machine was 3 years old , but new in the box . rug doctor still covered the warranty . the owner of mr. vac and sew then refunded my fees . very cool of him to do that . they have a customer for life . thanks ! !	932
1	the pizza is really good . really cheesy ! i always get the lunch menu because it 's a really good portion of food and the price is better !	239
1	the people here are so kind ! bummer there is no drive through , but sometimes its nice to go inside . busy , yes , but what coffee place is n't ? they really strive to be quick and have never gotten a drink wrong for me . love that they write your name on the cup , how personalized ! parking is great , tough to get to from eastbound elliot but not a huge deal .	3154
1	we ordered a pod to be delivered to our home to be used as temporary storage . it arrived on time as promised and provided much needed space to put our furniture in while we refinnished our floors ! of course a pod would be great to use if you were moving , but for other temporary storage needs it is a terrific alternative to keep in mind .	2233
1	mike is the man ! ! exceeds my nails every time . i basically tell him the color and he surprises me with the amazing technique & design .	2297
1	i have friends nearby . fry 's has chips and beer . match made in heaven . the staff here rocks , they even help me empty my cart . this store was redone a year or two ago , now has sushi bar in there , if you call it that . you can eat at the cafe in the corner , if that 's your thing . you wo n't find me there .	914
0	one star is to much for this store on the delivery i had to take 3 days off work to finally get my recliner . very bad customer service .	1794
1	i am an avid `` high-end grocery shop '' person and was incredibly impressed with this freshco . there were no lines ( we went after 8pm on a thursday night ) and the selection and prices are amazing . i bought some organic products protein pastas that you can only get at whole foods , but at a fraction of the price . really nice produce and extremely clean and big store . this is definitely our new go-to !	3613
1	art and margaret went above and beyond all expectations while helping me set up an account with one nevada . they were very kind and made sure i understood every option that was offered for the account and were able to answer all questions i had . true professionals ! i love this credit union already !	1141
0	thought i would update my experience . placed an order of a dozen for an upcoming party . called to see if order was ready . was told they made a mistake and delivered to the wrong location . my only option , pick the order up myself from the wrong location ( 15 miles away ) . huh ? lost not only one customer but many more i would have referred . sad	2024
1	i just love this place ! if you 're into clean eating and fresh local products it 's a gem . they have products you ca n't find anywhere nearby . good selection and very friendly good vibes staff . i always end up finding new exciting products too .	2488
1	good ol ' safeway ! i really do love this store and this location . i have tried other places like fne or the safeway on mcdowell and i always come back to the osborn locations . it at times can truly be one stop shopping ... from the us bank , to the pharmacy , to getting basics . the only thing i hate is that sometimes they dont have coverage on their lines late at night at it can take a long time to check out . but their produce can not be beat , they have certain products that i love always in stock !	2316
0	sold me a lemon . battery replaced and the same problem occurs , and no help from management . all that is done is sending you to different departments to sell more dreams of fixing your car and they are helping . i should have known when chuck pushed this certain ford fusion on me that it was a lemon . this is how i make a living and they did not care but i bet if i did not pay this note ford will report me to the credit bureau .	1650
0	nice sound and venue . our bartenders had no clue on how to make very basic mix drinks . they were awful . stick with the beer !	316
0	just ok . i think the pizza is fair but the lack of space inside and the customer service is horrible .	417
0	minus the tvs which are great for watching sports , the food almost killed me ! it 's disgusting i never complain but when i ordered the chicken avacado sandwich other night it tasted and smelt rank like rotten meat , it was dry like it was freezer burnt that was left out open and then spoiled then cooked ... ugg..then i ordered wine it was so rotten i spit it back in glass ... yep i 'm not ever going back there again..	428
1	service is good , only came in for a quick drink and snack . we had the pretzel sticks . the beer cheese these came with was excellent and i am not usually a fan of beer cheese . it appears to be more of a night time bar than a day drinking place .	3336
1	never had an issue at this location , always very friendly staff and quick drive through . they always make my sandwiches perfect , never burnt !	2902
0	went here a while ago , nobody on the staff said hello to me or anything at all to me . walked around the floor for a good 7 minutes too ... not sure if they 're prejudiced against darker skinned people but whatever their issue is it needs to be resolved fast . truly disgusting and pathetic . yikes , stay far away . downtown location much friendlier and welcoming . idiots .	1163
0	the providers are fine , the staff is horrible . simply they do not care . i called 3 times basically begging to have my little girl seen and they would not help . we have been patients for about 6 years , and they have never been helpful , but i liked maggie the nurse practitioner . stupid me , i should have moved years ago .	2526
0	happily sell you a defective phone and refuse to fix it . this location has always been horrible and continues to be .	2749
1	cheap tools ! i love this place since they carry things that most places do n't . i came here for some ramps to drive my quad onto my truck . they had 4-5 sets to choose from . the only complaint i would say is they get busy and they cant always get to everyone right away but it 's probably because they pass the savings onto the customer by not having tons of employees . the tools are n't craftsman so do n't expect a lifetime warranty but i do n't always need that kind of tool . i hardly use tools !	2267
0	so this is our first time here in a very , very long time . we are very apprehensive after waiting this long and having some of the staff repeat that our party will need to sit down within five minutes even though we were all standing waiting to be seated for the last 75 minutes ... definitely not good for large parties ... .	560
0	expensive place , food and drink are so so and customer service is just average ! but they charge above average than all bubble tea place , $ 25 per person is standard for lunch and drink on weekend when they do n't offer the lunch special ! wo n't come back again !	176
0	this is by far the worst walgreens i have ever been too . the workers are extremely unprofessional and have no idea what they are talking about . i would highly suggest never going here or going to cvs . this place was an absolute waste of time ! ! always a long wait and uninformed employees ... scary for a pharmacy .	3937
1	dr. jawadi has been my obgyn for a few years , and i even followed her when she started her new practice because of how great of a doctor she has been for me . she has always been responsive when i have health questions and concerns . i recently had my first child , and dr. jawadi and her office staff were wonderful throughout the whole process ! i had a safe delivery and felt that she was a knowledgeable and sensitive care partner in the whole experience . her office has been quick to submit paperwork i needed for work leave as well , despite me waiting until the last minute as a new mom , which i really appreciated !	3200
0	they broke my appointment at 5pm . said they did n't have time to take care of me before they closed . great at taking appointments ; bad at keeping them . seems a bit mismanaged to me .	3379
1	much dankness as always . tiara is the bomb 10/10 would recommend . also derek is one of the best servers i 've had i would recommend him to the crown prince .	383
1	bought a groupon and did this on a sunday night after two of my friends got married in vegas . this was an excellent activity choice ! while most of the spots on our tour did n't have drink specials ( same ones as outlines in traci 's post ) , my favorite was them taking us to the club body english , where we danced our asses off . while true that we were n't on the bus often or long , we had unlimited drinks on the bus and there were several fun options like margaritas . our guide/bartender was awesome . this is a great activity for young people in vegas who want to have a good time with other partiers .	2122
1	many shelf items are expired , so be sure to check expiration dates . the live fish tanks sometimes have dead fish floating in there , so would not recommend getting a live fish from that tank . the pre-cooked lobster is pretty good , but it 's kept in the same freezer area as uncooked seafood , so you 'll probably want to steam it to a temperature good enough to kill any bacteria . they do n't like pictures taken in the store and mini restaurant . this may be due to county health inspections or something like that . if you shop at the market often , buy $ 100 in gift certificates and you get 10 % extra in gift certificates .	3269
1	had a messed up last few days . week actually . just life bs all at once . thats led me to workout longer than usual . the great employees at this location have been the only bright spot . does that mean im that pissy or they that good ? whatever . i needed it . clean facilities . smiling . attentive . caring . great post workout fuel . special shot out to carlos for the shirt hookup when i spaced and forgot mine at hotel .	2370
0	was really look forward to coming here after being on the website . i did read some bad reviews , but figured it would be okay i mean people have different tastes . the appetizers i had where amazing , the scallops are the best . however , the butter chicken not so good ! we actually sent it back . we did tell the waitress we did not enjoy it ... she did comp our meals but did say `` oh ya i have heard that alot tonight '' i guess other people did not enjoy it either . it 's a shame , it 's a beautiful little place , but the food was so so .	1468
1	awesome place . ping pong and pool and drinks all at reasonable prices . good people , good times . i would give it 5 stars but for the internet jukebox ...	3840
0	hi ashley , thank you for your response . during the day our experience has been fine . i think your night crew is not as polished . as i said , gim me sugar has excellent macaroons ! we may be back . we will go during the day though when your service is better : - ) . thank you , austin gold	981
1	come several times a month . never fails us . we like sitting at the bar ( booths ) . always same two waitresses they are professionals . fast . friendly . always checking . oh the food ... ... roadhouse is great on all . the 6oz is enough for me . always perfectly done . ribs have lots of meat . get the loaded baked potato . worth it . salads always the freshest . lots of tvs in bar but not too loud . just great place .	1491
0	still waiting for my shower head to come in ... ordered it 15 days ago , was told it would take 5 ... .not happy .	2825
1	i just started going to valley medical , and i am doing the lipo-b injections . the staff is really nice and helpful . they tell you exactly what you need and how often to get it . i will for sure be going back .	2168
1	nora poblador was great when we came in . she was very meticulous about making sure everything was done right and there would be no issues down the road .	1141
0	rude , unfriendly management . clearly not trained to be customer-facing . do n't waste your time .	3330
1	thanks for the great haircut paul ! ! ! london barbers is the best barbers in town ! ! !	552
0	we have been regulars here for take out for years . the ownership has changed at least once , and i am guessing that it has changed recently again . the quality has dropped drastically . after having been disappointed twice , we were hoping it was a fluke and tried again . i always order a spicy chicken or beef dish and my husband always gets the house special fried rice . same poor quality . it makes me sad that we do n't have a decent chinese restaurant nearby anymore .	829
1	my wife and i had a great experience . the service was great and very knowledgeable . our waiter had phenomenal suggestions . the food was great , but not sure about the price . do n't skip dessert . the carrot cake was pretty good . we would visit cork & cleaver again .	1463
1	our backyard looks amazing . dane and his crew did a fantastic job . would highly recommend	2387
0	this place is a dump . i went there to buy several pairs of dress pants and shirts . it looked like nobody had worked there for days . there was clothing , hangars and trash everywhere . the dressing rooms were filled with piles of tried on shirts and pants . the inventory selection was dismal . also , there was not an employee in sight for help . i wound up not even making a purchase , instead i went home and bought everything from jcpenny.com and had a nice online shopping experience .	3633
1	this is my go-to nail salon . they 're usually really good about getting you in and out at a decent time . i 've gotten acrylic and shellac here and have never been disappointed . i love that you can just walk in and you do n't need an appointment . all of the nail techs that i 've had have been very friendly and always ask me if they are doing what i asked of them . i would definitely recommend this place to friends .	3452
0	horrible place ! i checked yelp review before i go and this place was one of the place that has best review . do n't trust review at all ! ! ! i did my nail done from heidi and she did a horrible job . she did n't really trim my cuticle and as a result my nail looked horrible even the next day . i am regulary doing my nail and this place is the worst so far in my life .	686
0	went here today with my 3 kids . this place is so horrible i do not recommend going their it will be the first and the last for my kids . they charged me $ 10.00 for my 1 year old which my 1 year old did not play with anything . also , parents do ni t watch their kids my 7 year old daughter got pushed and the parent and the kids did not say anything ... . i would not give this place even a star and the person that registered us was rude beyond rude can not see anyone as rude as her..	1631
0	very poor service by the waiters and attendants.. gave us empty glasses and did n't even serve water ! came midway through our dinner and took away the remaining empty chairs on our table.. you dont disturb anyone having dinner at a table unless called ! ! ! food was less than average.. overall disastrous experience	600
1	i wanted to get my tahoe ready for winter . the pros here did a great job and did n't try to sell me services not needed . i am very happy to so business with them . ron the service desk manager was fantastic .	76
0	nice ballpark but the team looks like a bunch of quitters that lay down in the late innings . i do n't go to their games anymore . they have n't had a winning season since they deleted their $ 1 seats . they have quite a few ball players with ability but as a team they `` choke '' way too often . what does it tell you about a team that leads the majors in runs scored in the first three innings but has a losing record ( by 5 games at this date ) . this team needs to play baseball every day . if they wo n't play during the game , have team practices after the game ! !	2005
0	they 're closing for lunch and dinner to support a protest in madison ... last time i 'm coming here .	951
0	within a week , my nails began to break and chip . the paint job was n't great . i asked the gentleman not to use the grinder on my nails and he did n't seem to understand me . then the lady came through to paint them and she did not out enough paint or layers on . the best part was the design ... i only came here because all nails in sun prairie was closed and i was in need of a manicure . lesson learned ! i will wait until all nails is open before going anywhere else !	1027
1	trying a new therapist today but all have been great so far ! front desk in the evening is awesome ! helpful and friendly . they really seem to enjoy there jobs ! clean and quiet in lobby . great location to visit	2120
0	brought chicken65 , its pathetic and it is covered with white butter gravy ( not sure what it is )	1540
0	the staff was pleasant , the rooms were as expected for the price . my concern was with the pool area . the sides of the pool where nearly black with grease and gunk . the sides needed to be scrubbed intensely , and the pool itself needed to be cleaned . the amount of chlorine in the pool was overpowering , as i believe it was attempting to compensate for an actual cleaning .	2872
0	service last night was lackluster . sat for 8 minutes before anyone greeted us after being sat . food was very good but had to ask 3 people for more water . we were very disappointed to say the least .	640
1	this is an awesome autozone ! the fact that it is open 24/7 is a huge plus . they have a rewards program so you can earn money back towards future autozone purposes . you can use this reward system at any location ! they have always been great about honoring warranties with no question .	424
1	cool um ein wenig abzukühlen und mal was anders zu machen , anstelle zu spielen oder party ...	2061
1	i 'm here at least once a week , getting gas and grocery shop . its clean , never crazy packed . the only downfall is the food area is really slow sometimes . the pizza is really tasty better than costco .	2172
1	randomly found this place looking for pedicures for 3 people and they had availability right away after going to like 4 other places ! everyone is very nice and for the price of the pedi , it was really great ! ! 20 $ and it was relaxing . my mom and i had holly . sweetest person ever ! : )	2736
0	this owner told my friend that he did n't like her because of the color of her skin . i would not recommend this business to anyone in the area . his behavior was bigoted and unacceptable .	1053
0	service advisor rude . he only wanted to tell me he was right . when i wanted to tell my side of the problem he walked away from me . will not return to berge for anything .	2816
0	went to regis salon to get my hair done last thursday ... .. went in for bayalage and got 1980 orange highlights that bleed and created spots ... .. there reaction was that nothing they did would fix it ! please share # balayagefail # badhighlights # beautyschooldropout # regissalon # regissalonfail	605
0	this place is a joke . my fault for going here again having already experienced their abysmal service . after having my brakes repaired 3 weeks ago , my brakes were squealing even worse than when dropped off . i was told i could not have an appointment for 2 weeks to fix the problem . after convincing them this was worth dealing with more immediately , they turned a 1 hour appointment into a 5.5hrs one . next time buy local and get rinsed by your neighbourhood mechanic instead .	2520
0	prices are rip-off ... battery price installed was $ 50 more than shop immediately next door . owner sammy is rude and offensive to customers .	972
0	worse than ever ! they did not have formula for our daughter . they did not have formula . horrible . also , they sold us a bag of butterfingers which was missing several of the bars . ( just empty individual packs . )	3656
0	they kinda have beer , reminiscent of cooper 's malt extract kit beer , they all kinda tastd the same . service was acceptable just stick to mixed drinks .	670
1	first time i came here , i ordered three things but only got two , the guy fixed it right away , i had my credit card out to pay but he said i was ok : ) i would 've left a tip but i had no cash on me : ( food was too hot but yummy and my smoothie was perfect ! thanks guys	2095
1	i really do keep meaning to go for free line dance lessons . good prices , no cover , excellent happy hour , lots of crowd variety . fun place to meet up with my friends !	2860
1	came in for brunch today and had a very nice experience . i really like their décor , classic diner style . i got the meatloaf and oh my goodness it was so amazing ! the homemade gravy was to die for ! my friend got the egg mornay i did n't try it but it looked delicious . our server eric was also amazing ! i will definitely be returning soon , for a first time experience i give five stars ! as a side note as we were walking out every single employee that we passes said , `` thank you , have a great day . ''	975
1	i brought my son in with a horrible outbreak of hives from an allergic reaction . it was the weekend and his allergist office was closed . we were signed in and and seen in minutes from walking in the front door ! the staff was professional and super friendly . i have to say we had an amazing experience under the unfortunate circumstances . i would highly recommend this small er to anyone !	350
0	not impressed- they lost my appt and chart . had to wait 45 min .was rushed through with md - area that i wanted taken care of and had concern about was ignored and told to come back again so that they could look at it- then did a quick co2 blow of my fore head for a sun spot and charge a surgery fee of 92.00 - rip off .	2099
0	i signed up from training which i truly regret customer service is the worst i 've seen .	641
0	bleh ... i just had the worst , most watered-down taro bubble tea drink in my life here . she does n't even use a shaker , she scooped a few tablespoons of random powder , spoon-mixed it with some tea and added a heap of ice . i only finished it because i was just so thirsty from walking around in the heat . save your $ 2.50 and use it at any of the other million bubble tea places in this area x_x	3110
0	i 'm sad to report this is simply the worst thai food i 've ever had . i ordered the green curry with tofu and i 'm shocked by how bland it is . i definitely will not be going back .	1450
1	if you want something amazing for the best price , you go to ragstock . simple as that .	1045
1	this is my favorite place to get coffee in the madison area . the atmosphere is warm and welcoming , and the staff is great ! they have the best salted caramel latte and honestly i 'd prefer that any day over a latte at starbucks . their food options are wonderful too !	2516
1	my entire family has been using tony 's services for over 10 years . they are the best . they run a super efficient shop and we get top quality service ! one quick story . our ford expedition was having engine knocks . and i took it in to tony 's and expected to be hit with a big repair bill . tony called back and said the problem was the gas cap . i had lost the original and got a replacement on the internet . turns out it did not have a proper seal and resultant caused the engine knocking . only charge was for a new gas cap . once again ... tony is the best ! !	3924
0	last night we went to roman candle for a family dinner . we had horrible service . after a long long wait we were served burnt pizza with the promise that new pizza would come and we could keep both . the pizza was not worth the money . we wo n't be returning .	218
1	just brought my acura in for the gold car wash and not only was treated exceptionally by everyone but received the best interior/exterior car wash ever ! thank you for a great car wash and exceptional treatment !	2359
1	probably the best dim sum i have ever had . the quality of the ingredients was superb . great variety of flavors and textures . not your typical venue . obviously reflects the celebrity chef owner . prices reflects the location and surroundings . expensive .	1441
1	great food . we started with the beef yorkie . fantastic . i had the butter chicken and it was better than most idian restaurants . i was also with a business associate and he had the ruban sandwich . he said it was great and recommended it to his friend who arrived after we finished eating . as the place got busier , the service started to decline . this location only has bar top tables inside . there is two patios . one on the ground floor and one on the roof . i hear the upstairs patio has a limited menu . overall , we agreed that we would return again .	97
0	this amtrak station is in need of a face lift ! it is very dingy and outdated looking , which is surprising because it is underneath one of the most prestigious address in downtown pittsburgh ! the employees were friendly and helpful , which was nice , and our train came on time which is really the most important thing !	3601
0	they do not have authentic indian style dosa 's . they cater more to the sri lankan customers . the idllis are also not fresh , most of the times they are very hard and stale . the sambhar for the dosa is very thick which is not how it is supposed to be .	505
1	paradise bakery is a place to go for consistently tasty sandwiches and salads . this particular one makes their food extra well .	701
0	just moved close by also and wanted to try mr. gs , food . straight up terrible service . wings were good but took forever to come out and on the bar side the bartender was to busy smoking and socializing to even ask for anything . they had a server who was doubling as the delivery driver so she was not even really there and not to mention everything was watered down like the ranch and hot sauce . junk junk junk . a visit from bar rescue would n't even help ...	86
1	i came here to get my hair done and was really happy with my experience . sarah did a great job cutting and styling my hair . all of the employees were really friendly and this was a great environment to get my hair cut in . i will definitely go back to see her again . they provide customers with a great experience from the ambiance and atmosphere , to the bubbly and fun attitudes of the employees . you can tell everyone enjoys working here and it 's a great salon to get your hair or makeup done . they also sell lots of jewelry made by local designers . this salon is worth checking out .	533
1	i have been amember of this church since 1972 . it is a wonderful , love inspired , welcoming church , do not believe the negative posts , some people just do n't get it i guess . it has 900 seats and is full every sunday . i love this church and it is my home ... .ruth	1899
0	my experience was mediocre . the color came out good . however when i tell someone how to cut my hair i want it that way . i think this person did not have the experience , skill set , or listening skills to accomplish the cut . i did n't appreciate that she finish doing laundry instead of efficiently taking care of me so i am not there longer than necessary .	2908
1	i love this church the energy within the church is unreal and the holy spirit is deafly in this place . if you 're looking for a church with real people this is the place stop in and visit	3167
0	said they welcomed walk ins then when they did n't have anyone there to do 2 sets made remarks about waiting til the last minute to get them done	2008
0	this place does n't deserve a star , but had to click for comment to post ! what a rip-off ! ! ! what i ordered was n't the same as pictured in the filipino newspapers . ordered the fishballs which did n't taste like the ones sold along the `` streets in the philippines '' as barkada claims . and this was the ultimate rip-off , i was charged $ 4.00 for 4 pcs . of banana cue on a stick ( 1 pc of banana cue = $ 1.00 ) and those tasted bad , so customers beware !	817
0	laser away is a scam in my opinion . i will never step foot in this establishment again and suggest you do the same ! the sales lady is extremely pushy and convinced me to purchase a 3 part series of a laser facial and cost me a whopping $ 1500 . i received botox as a promotion but never used it all and when i called to schedule my remaining cc 's `` they did n't know what i was talking about . '' gina told me nothing was in my charts for `` remaining cc 's '' what a load ! beware of this malpractice ! !	366
0	the people here are kind of rude . i asked multiple times how long the wait would be for a nail fill . the workers talked amongst themselves and never gave me an answer or they act like they dont hear you and walk away . then because a local/loyal customer came in they served her first ... . ive been here for an hour . i will def not be tipping .	2686
0	just left this place lived there for 2 years just as i expected they will keep your deposit when u move plus add hidden fees .. a/c units are old and ghetto rigged always leak bad maintenance is a joke wo n't give u a time they just wan na go into your home when your not there ... .do n't believe me just see how friendly tina in the office is !	3665
0	went in for `` reflexology '' and received a foot massage . i do not believe that anyone at this place even knows the meaning of reflexology . i read other people 's reviews and i have to assume that they are reviewing a foot massage and not reflexology . that being said , it is a quiet and relaxing place and the massage is inexpensive and feels nice . the only reason i 'm giving 2 stars is because we specifically requested reflexology and not a foot massage .	2970
0	tried this place for the first time today and had the sweet potato bowl . the food was pretty good , but i was really disappointed by the tea selection . they did n't even have a basic black breakfast tea and most tea was green or caffeine free . as a non coffee drinker this is a big deal . i do n't think that i will be back .	2516
0	lots of workers . wait time was quick . new place , looks great . but ... .fries were limp . lemonade is so fresh squeezed its like sucking on a whole lemon , i could n't drink it . chicken fingers were like anywhere else in town . not sure if i 'll go back .	998
0	paid $ 80 for 2 applications & never heard back . it 's safe to assume we did n't get the house but a response would be nice . enjoy our money !	3512
0	i went with a party of 6 on a lazy and hot sunday afternoon ... no ac on a hot day . : ( out of 3 of their 5 beers . : ( no jalapeno beer . : ( ( seriously if they would have had full taps i would have been fine with the no ac ) food trucks not there on sunday ( and they do n't serve food ) : ( will have to try again and give a second chance ( on a different day of the week ! ) -but i will call ahead and make sure they have their beers on tap this time !	993
0	had higher expectations of this place . i got the grass jelly with coconut milk and mango but the mango was sour and grass jelly tasted like store bought even though the menu stated it was homemade . overall , below average and would not come back .	1062
0	not much flavor . awful service . the food did not taste that great , i 'll be on the look out for another vietnamese restaurant .	673
1	i just want to thank matt , he was very friendly and helpful , i been having issues with my billing and he was able to help me and walk me through everything , it was very clean inside the store and everyone was polite . thank you matt if you ever have questions or need help with your phone you should definitely go to this store .	1237
1	this place is everything ! ! the histess stephanie was sweet as pie . tracy did my mani & pedi and i feel like a princess . this is my nail spa now . never thought paraffin in the summer ( feet ) would feel so good ! and my nail designs are off the chain	1316
1	called needing a birthday cake same day . this bakery surprised me , they are really good ! i said i wanted something with reeses peanut butter cups because that 's the bday boy 's favorite . they did n't have anything but said she could make something up . picked up the same day and it looked awesome ! i added a photo . it says `` happy birthday jeff ''	1097
0	definitely watch your back . i had the same problem with this dentist office and the insurance `` issues '' . the billing manager , clara was very rude and will argue with you and refuses to help you . nina should take over her job . my husband and i got bills that our insurance already took care of . they denied receiving payment and tried to give us the runaround for a month and a half . i call fraudulent activity and will no longer go here after this is settled . the work they do is good but they will take you for your money and the office staff does n't pay attention . save yourself the headache .	1855
0	$ 15 to get in , and $ 2 each for tacos smaller than the palm of my hand ? i do n't think so . i went to the festival on saturday and was appalled at the lines for everything - especially for the `` tokens '' which you have to get in order to buy anything ! ( 1 token = $ 2 ) . the tacos i had were nothing special . i left hungry after spending $ 25 total . this event is the biggest ripoff ever .	1392
1	good food , service is slow but they are very nice , prices are right . great addition to mint hill food !	189
1	very pleased with all the dishes we ordered . food fash tastefull and fresh as well as the orange juice . service was great and fast .	243
0	this place is just ok for my purposes . its close to my parents house when i am in town . the weight room is small , but the equipment is in decent condition . cardio area has up to date machines . if the weather is good , i usually make the trip to fitworks in parma .	1620
0	walked in , told the greeter i do n't have a membership and i wanted just to look around at products they carried to see if i wanted to join . she said i needed a day membership . i said okay she showed me to the customer service line . 10 people waiting in line . i stood there for about two minutes listening to the customers problems . i just could n't take anymore and i walked out . the greater asked what happened where you going . i answered i 'm not waiting in that line , my time 's worth more . she responded with that 's too bad . i 'm glad i did n't choose to become a customer here .	2172
0	medicore , greasy pizza . i do n't think they even have a bottle of olive oil in their kitchen as none could be tasted on my pizza . there were 3 young , under-worked employees behind the counter chatting and playing with their phones , and one over-worked cook in the kitchen . there were a couple eating , one couple waiting for take-out and me . it took 20 minutes for me to receive the `` slice ' i ordered . does the jimmy & joe 's dress code encourage the wearing of sweatpants for their counter help ? why ca n't i order a slice with no drink at a lower price than the slice with beverage that they offer ?	417
0	signed for a pool with dolphin the 1st week of january 2013 . it was n't finished until end of may after many promises to be done months earlier . horrible customer service and follow up ! still waiting weeks now for punch list items to be completed . i spent over $ 35k with dolphin pools and have never felt like they appreciated my business or wanted me as a customer . i would avoid dolphin pools at all costs regardless of the price or package they quote . they simply do not care ...	3541
1	recently moved here from ca and was dreading the search of finding a new primary care physician , however i came across dr. hall and he is excellent . he is extremely patient , understanding , and knowledgeable . he answered all my questions and concerns with confident answers , in words that a former marine could understand . it is hard to find trust in a dr you just met , however i feel confident in dr. hall and glad he is my primary doctor . i would highly recommend dr. hall .	356
1	i love the fritz been staying there for my last 5 trips to vegas and believe its the best hotel downtown for the money . the hotel is older but nice clean and the staff are the best . last time there asked for a corner room i was put on the 27th floor had a great view . i do miss the coffee pot in the room . the elevators are fast the view bar has home time feeling . had some luck in the casino not a lot but enough to have a good time .	2500
1	probably one of the most unique spa experiences i 've had . i had the one hour reflexology ( whole body ) plus shampoo . the head massage is fantastic ! ask for jenny -- she does a great job !	2399
1	i love this place and the positive atmosphere . the trainers are knowledgeable and were able to really help me ( a person who is lost otherwise in a gym ) .	641
0	upon reading all the great reviews , i decided to give it a try . honestly , not sure how they even had so many good reviews . there was only two staff members working . i will say the nail tech i did have was very nice ! unfortunately , i could tell the polish was very old , she needed to add to the bottle . also , the selection of polish , is lacking in every way . the establishment could use a overall good cleaning and good makeover ! not good environment to relax in . sorry , just speaking option !	1637
1	hands down one of the best croissants i 've ever had exists here . it 's on my way to work so sometimes i stop in and grab a coffee and pastry to go . i 've also stopped in midday . oddly every time i 've gone in it looks a bit empty and understocked . the food is good but the environment leaves a bit to be desired .	1160
0	one star is far too many . while they do offer a hookah buffet for 10 $ , it 's like a prison offering a bologna sandwich buffet . the bowls are poorly-packed lasting about 20 mins max . the staff has no idea what they 're doing and it takes them an hour to change a bowl that 's literally unsmokable . the music is like a middle school dance , and not to mention when i told the employee there was no toilet paper or paper towels in the bathroom he just shrugged his shoulders at me . avoid this place at all costs .	3013
0	the service was atrocious . had tomatoes in my coke , the food was shit at best and that 's an insult to shit . it really ruffles my feathers that people could be so dumb . in the wise words of gordon ramsey , where 's the lamb sauce ?	383
1	went here with a large group of ladies for a girl 's night out . the staff was attentive and fun . our food came out quite quickly considering it was a saturday night and the restaurant was packed . the food itself was so good . i will definitely return !	240
0	this pizza is hit or miss and at this location , its been mostly a miss . i absolutely hate pizza that is spicy . why are they putting chile flakes on a slice of cheese pizza ? its not mexican food . if you want to put chile flakes on a pizza , they should have some chile flakes at the table . this spot is so tiny that it really is not all that pleasant to eat inside . the jimmy and joe 's located on dobson in mesa is better .	417
1	wow , what a experience ! you have come see it youself , it is a must see store in charlotte . if you are into asian stuff , you will probably find what you are looking for here .	1963
1	i do n't care how bad the service is or how weird some of the customers in there but when i can find things with huge reductions and still great quality i give it 5 stars . i mean nice dress shirts : check ties : check ipod charger : check chuck taylor 's : check pots and pans : check all cheap : chachacheck five stars hand down	1678
1	employees : 5 stars - fantastic . seriously , what do they feed them before their shifts because they are a happy , cheerful bunch . cleanliness : 5 stars - they do keep the place clean and that is a huge plus in a store that sells food . food court : 3 starts - really , you got rid of chocolate frozen yogurt ? what are you a communist ? ? ? everyone loves chocolate .	3884
1	since i am writing reviews for cab companies now ... i will write about the best cab company in the city . unfortunately , they will not pick you up from outside montreal , but if possible i would use these guys first . the drivers are always courteous , they do not fuss , complain , or fight me when i use my credit card , ( unlike most other cab drivers in montreal i 've used ) . they take me the quickest way , even though i probably seem like a tourist when i am downtown . i use this company a few times a month and would highly recommend them .	3011
1	this is a great place ! a little getaway . i have been here for a family get together they have rooms that have casitas ... so nice ! if i want some alone time ( or not ) lol : ) ! i 'm here fo sho !	3916
0	it is simply a big knockoff store ! ! ! will never shop here ! ! !	1594
1	awesome customer service and very low pricing . also open when most other locksmiths were closed for the day .	1559
0	this is place is way over priced and filled with rich college students who spend their parents money at will . we picked up some chocolate covered raisins only to bite into them and find out they were peanut butter . woah . peanut allergies are a serious thing ( and my brother in law has one ) and we let them know about the accident .	1914
1	we 've eaten here twice now and enjoyed it both times . my 9-year old daughter loves the rice . the black beans are perfectly cooked and delicious on their own or with the rice . i got the same thing both times because it was so good - both vegetarion options as tostadas . the guacamole and salsas are very yummy and the chips are some root vegetable that i ca n't recall but they were perfectly crisp and delicious with the salsa and guac . it 's byob . we 'll definitely be going back .	1358
0	so my wife and i really like the cheese steaks , but the people behind the counter are horrible . it is definitely a family business since one or two of the people behind the counter are teenagers . to top it off , there always seems to be a loud family `` discussion '' ( fight ) everyone we are waiting . waiting and waiting and waiting ... . really slow service .	777
1	dr. limkemann and staff are bringing back the family practice . thankful to have found them . truly compassionate , caring dr and pa 's and ma 's here . they take the time needed to really understand concerns as well as educate the patient . i appreciate that the staff knows us , remembers our history and understands and regards each of us as a whole person without judgment . it is so refreshing . keep up the great work !	2991
1	my husband and i bought new dining room furniture . jett took such good care of us ! he helped us find just the right pieces . we love how everything looks in our home and ca n't thank jett enough for his help ! also , the furniture was delivered as planned with no problems . we will definitely be back to see jett when we are ready to redo another room .	1442
0	just called spoke to antoinette she attempted to transfer me to a company in tempe i live on bell rd in north phoenix and to top it off the call was n't even transferred she connected me and the line said it could not be completed as dialed.. searching elsewhere now..	3663
1	although you pay a pretty penny the work is worth it . it 's art ! we got armando he was legit , professional as well as very knowledgeable the staff was very friendly . my husband and i are very happy with the work . definitely going back for any future tattoos .	2912
1	we have recently become a land rover family , with both an lr4 and rrs , so this location has helped us with everything from questions to accessories , and services . thank goodness for the amazing service department , and robert in particular , for the expert knowledge and excellent attention . fitting us in and taking care of us like we were family . ca n't tell you how easy and stress-free it is when you know you are receiving the best service in town . these folks earn our business everytime .	2659
1	did n't think we would ever deal with a car dealer in arizona again after our last experience but we did and we left happy . thank you nick cicala !	2210
1	tucked inside the lobby of the holiday inn express next to the pnc building , sammy 's is a little diner that serves up breakfast and lunch staples for prices that do n't break the bank . one of the few downtown breakfast places open on saturday , i was glad sammy 's was as good as it is convenient . bacon here is crisp , potatoes are better than huran st diner and my heart is still true to the people at pjs but this is definitely where you 'll find me the next saturday morning i get a taste for eating breakfast out in the east 4th neighborhood .	990
0	it 's crazy to think how you guys keep customers , raising prices as much as you do . i am so happy i will not be using this place anymore . renting a small storage and raising the price as much as you do is so ridiculous especially to the people who have been with you for so long . it 's been 5 years that i have had this storage and i always pay my monthly bill . finally glad to be moving my things out of this place ! ! !	928
1	people who run this place are really nice . always helpful . they saw me loading my laundry and suggested a way to save me money . the machines are less expensive than other laundromat a in the area .	3258
0	i always come here & get the best customer service , but today was horrible i waited almost 3hours for them to finish my nails nd toes definitely not going back to this nail salon	1829
0	ordered a burger , took 30 minutes and it came out with a burnt bun . sent it back , they replaced half the bun not seeing the other half was also burned . by this time my date was done eating . requested a box and left without eating . pretty disappointed . wo n't go back .	951
1	i was young . it was my first beer out in the real world . i had a yuengling in a bottle . i felt cool . i was cool . we smoked indoors . ( do they still allow that ! ? ) and listened to juke box music in the 50 's style diner-esque booths with quiet conversation amongst friends . beyond the cool interior , kelly 's has good food , cheap happy hours and has n't changed a bit . i miss my good ol ' local spot . kelly 's will always hold a special place in my heart .	279
1	we went the first week it was opened . while most places have excuses during a grand opening , none needed for this place . the service was excellent and so was the food . i went in to eat but i did notice the drive up was moving fast as the servers went back and forth . the staff worked like a team to provide customers a no wait visit . keep up the good work .	862
0	i went in and within 3 minutes selected two pairs of shoes ; i asked for them in two sizes . the sales clerk disappeared - came back without shoes and walked past me . joe completely ignored me . the store was not crowded . he simply did n't feel like helping . this is not the first time i have experienced below par service here - but this was the absolute worst . i went to nike and ended up buy	2557
0	use uber ! use uber ! ! ! this company does not follow-through with reservations . we had a pick up set for early in the morning to catch the first flight out of town ... .. no showed on us . even though we got email confirmations for the pick up . thank god for uber ! ! ! even at 5am last minute , they were available and dependable	52
1	un genre de `` self serve '' de pâtisseries hongkongaises . les prix sont abordables et en plus , c'est vraiment bon ! on voit fréquemment les employés remplir les présentoirs de pâtisseries fraichement cuites , ça prouve au moins qu'il y a un bon roulement de produits et qu'ils trainent pas sur les tablettes plusieurs jours . je n'ai goûté qu'aux pâtisseries sucrées , mais ils en ont aussi pas mal à base de viande pour les repas , c'est à essayer si vous êtes curieux !	2211

0	i have n't had many massages so i '' m not to hard to please but i was pretty disappointed with my experience here . the massage was ok but had many distractions and seemed undedicated , but i get the impression my therapist was new . the room was super bright until after i was already on the table and the therapist came back in , and i could here people talking in the hall and the waiting room throughout most of my massage . i also found the front waiting room very awkward and small and not the appropriate place to be reviewing a person 's personal details before taking them back for their massage . wo n't go again .	3733
1	amazing service . took a couple of their cabs while here on vacation with friends . great drivers , great driving , just great experiences .	3142
1	diana and miguel just made my day ! ! nicest people and fabulous team ! ! i will be back : )	1214
1	dawn is amazing . i 've been getting laser hair removal at another place for years , and never had the type of results i have since i 've been coming to her . she listens to your concerns and is thorough with her work . i ca n't say enough great things about dawn and simplicity laser : )	343
0	well ... that have corn beef hash . that 's about the extent of this place . if you are n't picky about your food or service , stop on in ! gravy is horribly watery . do yourself a favor and go to ihop . at least you know what you 're getting	672
1	rainforest plumbing is the best service experience i have ever had ! the plumber that came to fix my shower drain problem was awesome ! they even have a total up front contract before they start the work . i knew exactly how long it would take and how much it would cost before they even started working on my drain . everyone company should do this !	2775
0	it took about 20 minutes to make my wrap and when i get back to my office i see the lettuce is completely old and wilted . i understand this is a warm wrap but it should not wilt by the time i get back to my office ( 5 minute drive ) and open it . i am very disappointed that they supposedly pride themselves on being a wellness cafe . not cool . i posted a pic as well .	1422
0	if you intend to come as a group , you might want to think again . the owner can be extremely unfriendly to groups and seems to have a particular dislike for groups of bicyclists .	353
1	everyone here is fabulous . especially joe the super in charge of our job . he took the trouble to do some digging ( literally ) to investigate whether we could get our in-ground pool cleaner working . thom andreozzi is a great salesperson and gave us great follow-up which helped seal the deal . so far everything is going great on our pool remodel .	3541
0	worst starbucks ever . i went through the drive thru , ordered a sandwich , they asked me to pull up front the sandwich was n't ready yet and they would bring it out to me . no one ever came outside , finally went inside after 10 min and the sandwich was n't even made yet . never got my sandwich or a refund .	2849
1	looks like an old taco bell from the outside , but so glad we came here ! food is delicious , with a local beer and 2 on tap , besides other choices . the young man taking orders patiently explains the differences of the burgers and sauces . we had the kinoko burger and jazz fries . they were excellent ! we met the owner cleaning the tables . he explained that he tries to source as much as he can from local purveyors . ladies ' room was also nice and clean . we will definitely be back !	964
1	dinner for two tonight . we shared the crispy eggplant and inhouse made potato chips . loved the eggplant but was n't as crazy for the chips . our server was pleasant and non-intrusive . i had the rainbow trout and my friend had the duck breast . the duck tasted amazing and my fish was yummy and very well presented . as always , i 've never disappointed here ! ! !	1079
0	one of my favorite stores is guilty of one of my biggest beefs : workers that are sweeping the floors should either wash their hands or take off their gloves before bagging groceries . it 's gross and unhygienic not to .	2819
1	great chinese restaurant . i have been there several times , the food is good . if you want to try the original chinese taste you should go there ! highly recommend the noddle and cold dishes .	1329
1	love love love this place ! everyone here does such a great job and are so friendly as well ! best nail spa by far in vegas : ) christina is awesome and even does permanent make up ! she does my brows and they are amazing ! i ca n't talk up this place enough ! ! !	544
0	after over hearing the way dr. hechko was lecturing his employee in an obnoxius way , i wo n't ever return to this clinic . i highly recommend everyone taking their animals to a clinic where the doctor treats the employees like adults and not like animals . i can only imagine the turnover this clinic has ... it 's got to be off the charts dealing with a doctor disrespecting employees .	2770
1	the best carne asada ... i have tried many places in the phoenix-metro and this place rocks ! its flavorful and tender ! we always get for nascar and grill up with tortillas and potatoes , the next morning i scramble it in with eggs and potatoes and add salsa and it gets even better ! we make special trips to tempe just to get !	3764
0	this is an update on my experience staying there a month ago ... . our stuff got stolen out of the room and managment knows for certain there was extra keys made after we already checked in ... we were told they will be reimbursing for a certain amount after arguing with them for over a month . but have yet to see a pennie and at thus point i do n't care i just need to do the right thing and worn people that they have a thief on the inside . so if u wan na risk getting your stuff taken stay here but i do n't recommend it to my worst enemy	3091
1	my last visit here was such a change from the usual greeting/service i usually receive . my threader was an older woman and showed me that my eyebrows were n't even arch-wise ... she told me it 's strange nobody pointed it out previously . luckily she did ! she is now my official threader , helping me even out my arches and recommending castor oil to thicken my brows and lashes .	460
1	fantastic ! ! we loved the entire show - the acts between set changes were phenomenal , too . that theater is amazing and with all the stuff coming out of ceiling , from the floor and along the sides , its amazing that the execution looks so flawless . all the movement stayed just this side of sensory overload and then the numbers would slow down or it would be time for a set change . the 2 men acrobatics was unbelievable , as well as the guy spinning the metal , and the aerialist - not sure if i left anyone out . will likely return when we have guests visiting us .	3069
0	as stated in other reviews , the service was good but at least double what it should be . i was charged for an entire truck ( $ 558- $ 30 coupon ) load of yard debris despite the fact that there were already some items in the truck . this was a very small truck ! i would need at least another half truck to complete the removal . they really do n't seem to be equipped to efficiently handle this kind of junk and maximize the space . i will never use them again . consumer beware ! !	3663
1	i love this location ! staff is always friendly and they try to remember me and my requests . drive thru is the fastest i 've seen . my order is always correct , served with a smile and a warm friendly greeting . thank you , i appreciate all of you !	2849
1	toronto housecalls is awesome . i 'm a huge fan of doctor home visit service , if i ca n't see my regular family doctor because it 's after hours or weekends , i would much rather wait with my kids at home instead of a crowded walk-in with other sick people sharing germs . i 've used another service for years , but , unhappy with their service , decided to try toronto housecalls out . i am so happy i did , and i 've used the service three times now . their doctors are friendly and knowledgeable . i am really happy to have discovered them and highly recommend toronto housecalls .	723
1	love this place ! always have the best service when i come here , it feels like a family run restaurant . intimate ambiance with a modern look . the food is excellent , i always get the pad se ew and it never disappoints !	1366
0	if you like sweet burgers this place is for you . i had the tamago burger which was really sweet , did n't taste no wabasi . the bun and burger patti itself was amazing . my husband had the karai burger which was there spicy burger , once again super sweet and no spice at all . garlic fries and there crazy sauce was pretty good . we like trying new burger places but this was n't a favorite for us . service was great and the place and decor was nice .	964
0	the food is good but it 's to expensive ! ! it 's they lowered their prices i would for sure be a regular . but i am not going to spend 18 dollars for one person for dinner ! i can go to o outback and get a steak for cheaper than that . the food is good but not worth it	875
0	ordered take out lemon chicken blah doughy ! , sweet sour shrimp thick flour coating , and 1/2 duck ! ! $ 36 barely eatable . called to discuss with owner she comes on says we been here 26 years and wont let me discuss issue , no wonder not 1 table on saturday night at 6pm ! ! was good in past but this time no so ! ! ! ! hope they teach cooks to cook properly . not again	1103
1	really fresh ingredients , really tasty mix of deliciousness wrapped up in a pita . i 've had their chicken shawarma three times and i love it so much . i 've had their philly cheesecake and it is so good . i like everything about this place except for the price . i find their pita sandwiches to be on the pricey side at just under $ 6 for a regular and just under $ 9 for a large . i find that price is hard to justify for a sandwhich but then again , they are soooo good and healthy too !	1019
1	good clean hotel . no smoking or casinos inside the place so great if you want to get away from the action . strange location though surrounded by huge parking lots and abandoned hotels . great happy hour at the bar and free breakfast .	3253
1	great place and close to my house . i use to drive across town to get alterations done and i 'm glad i checked this place out . they have a quick turn around time and get you in and out during your fittings .	2982
0	the only complaint i have is that the manager who came to help cut fabric was super rude ! ! we were buying at least $ 200 worth of fabric as a group , and the manager was pissed off that she apparently had to help cut fabric . she also did n't cut to the lengths that were needed and did n't offer remnants at the end of the bolt . that is not proper customer service and it made our experience not enjoyable . we will not be coming back to this joann 's .	3876
0	i came in yesterday to withdraw from my loan and the chick looked new and asked if i had my car with me . take it i live 20 mins away and have my kids with me and i have never been asked that after years having to take out loans here and there . what an inconvenience . she did n't ever pull up any account information . i will not be doing business here because of the bad experience . i will stick with the one in north phnx .	1726
0	has the tranquility of a doctors office , my facial experience was n't good at all ... first off the person suppose to do it on me was n't the correct person , second his phone was going off without any apologies and how are you suppose to relax ? and third i did n't see his license on the wall ? i saw a license from the person i was suppose to get it done and that did n't make me feel reassured . honestly he did n't have any knowledge of the product of the facial nor get to my pores and blackheads . i do n't recommend it at all .	306
1	since opening i 've tried countless combinations and their staff was extremely cooperative with my wacky but delicious creations . at ted 's they have a wide variety of fishes and fried foods to choose from ranging from fresh fish to salmon skin and fried tofu . all really fresh and the fried foods are actually crunchy compared to other sushi burrito places . i 've been coming at least 3-4 times a week and it never gets boring . definitely recommend the burdock roots !	1354
1	i had the pleasure of working with manager gary ! excellent customer service..superb service . stated just the facts..did not try to upsell services that were not needed . keep up the great work !	2212
1	tryst has become a `` home away from home '' for me and my friends in the nightclub scene . somehow we always end up at tryst but it has n't ever disappointed . it is a decent size , good music ( both floors are open on saturdays ) and is always busy . the washrooms could use some work but the washroom attendant , teresa , is so sweet ! the interior looks like any other nightclub , nothing exceptional . if you want an affordable night out ( ladies usually free before midnight ) with good music , tryst is your go-to . if you want more of an elegant club , muzik is your spot .	1449
0	was expecting more than paper plates and plastic silverware . waffles were dry and my kids immediately said we should have stayed home and made waffles there . the coffee was weak as well . not a great start for our morning !	580
0	this place is closed . please remove from the list . i saw the store on yelp and i went in . it switched to a different business .	3514
0	what is wrong with you people that you thought you could trick me into stepping foot into this place to be fed overpriced sick sick drinks ? ! ? !	637
0	i need some material , so i went to jo-ann . first time to the dobson one . i got a fabric that was mark with a green tag 9.99 . but no the lady looks at the chicken scratches on the other side bunched in some numbers and was like oh this is 14.99 . but down load a coupon online and get it 50 % off . i was like ok. then i get to the front and it is an exclusion to the coupon . fu old ladies .	3943
0	i prefer petsmart better because they have a better selection and prices . i like petco for their cookie bar so i can pick up some cookies that are friendly for pets for my pets . that 's basically it , i only shop here on occasion because of the location . go to pets inc in tempe instead for a real shopping experience .	2822
1	i have to say i have been into this location only a handful of times . however i have ordered catering for my company many times . not only did they agree to deliver to my location outside of richmond hill but i am continually happy at the level of service , quality of the food , presentation , and quick delivery . they always call to confirm my order and confirm delivery time . this helps a lot when i am running around getting things ready for my client meetings . i know i do not have to worry about the food . my clients are always giving me compliments on the food : )	251
1	really nice and spacious , and the customer service is great ! i just do n't like how the vip area is limited to only 18+ , but i love the restaurants around the theatre ! really convenient for eating dinner right after you watch a movie .	884
0	watch out for their drivers on the highway cutting into the carpool lane with no turn signal at 80 miles an hour especially when it 's 3 pm and no carpoolers are allowed to use it . kind of ridiculous to put your company name all over the vehicle that you drive like an inconsiderate psychopath	3479
0	i 'm the middle of a shady area . food was over priced . too far to go for really a average burger	452
0	unfortunately they have n't received any merchandise this year selection is not that good anymore yeah they got a couple nice jeans size 44 sorry i offended people that wear size 44 they do n't care too much about what they wear sorry i hope i did n't offend any big boys please ross stock your stores	3778
1	been trying to come here for months and i finally got the chance to go ! i love the vibes with the music and the decor , it 's just super modern and very spacious ! i got the infamous meatball cone , of course , and it was soooo good . the cone was very chewy and went well with the meatballs and pasta . i also got a chicken pesto panini and the caprese pesto panini , both of which were pretty good . i would like to say that everything was on the pricier side though . the menu is pretty small with only a select few options . i would still totally come back though !	712
1	this is one of the best restaurants in toronto . they have a great all you can eat menu but very high quality food . we go there all the time with family and friends . prices are reasonable considering the quality and variety of the menu .	1362
1	stopped for lunch in our way to dc . great sandwiches and lived the chicken tortilla soup . was brought out at the perfect temperature . friendly staff and good service . the place was full ; seems to be a local favorite !	1367
0	all i can say about this store is the store manager is a complete asshole . he accused me of hacking straming devices because i wanted to buy more than 2 . i went to this best buy because it was the only store that had what i wanted and i i was not able to buy because the store manager would not let me . do not shop here if you are going to but more than 1 of somthing . again ... the store manager is an asshole and likes to accuse people of wrong doing .	3192
0	the pizza was absolutely terrible , the sauce bland , the crust was like thick cardboard and the employees were truly terrible to deal with . spend your money elsewhere , you 'll be glad you did .	789
0	disgusting . the appliances are cheap and get dirty easily . i feel like i 'm living in a motel . currently we 've got a bug infestation . they 're in the fridge even in the bathroom . so disgusting priced as if they were penthouses look and feel like cheap motels . loud neighbors , rude , office has done nothing about the noise . do n't waste your money . do n't waste your money on this piece of junk . loud and filthy .	3475
0	after seeing this on anthony bourdain , we had high hopes . boy , were we disappointed . i do n't care that the food was n't authentic . but the awkward combination of flavors in our mushy , poorly prepared dishes betrayed a complete lack of mastery that made us rethink our planned restaurant itinerary . i was sorry to waste a meal in this wonderful city at this establishment . with so many great restaurants in montreal , do n't waste your time at a place so mediocre .	1582
0	new bus for uw hospital shuttle but pm shuttles have not been on time yet . waiting half hour currently	3132
1	if u happen to come here on a saturday for passport ( s ) make sure they have someone here that is helping out that day otherwise u will be standing in line for nothing . also the back line is the passport line . everyone in this post to office is very nice and the people here r very informative .	1913
1	just visited freddie 's for the first time today and i can honestly say this was the best nutrition store i have visited in a long time . the staff were amazing and honest regarding their products and they carry a large variety of products that are all high quality . i am vegan and buy organic and non gmo when ever possible- there were tons of options for proteins , snacks and even skin care that catered to my lifestyle . did i mention the staff where extremely nice and knowledge : ) two thumbs up and i will definitely be back !	3691
0	had them come out for there annual service , tech told me that my furnace was not working properly and needed to be replaced for 14k i told him that i just wanted service that everything was working ok he tried to keep hard selling me a new unit and keep telling me how mine was not working . this service call cost me $ 49 dollars and i still did not get the service just a con and hard sell for a new unit i do not need .	1718
1	i love new york bagels and bialys in scottsdale ! i love the food and the wait staff ! it does n't get much better than eating at new york bagels and bialys !	325
0	worst company ever to deal with ! ! ! please avoid this for sure , they try to refer you to their connected doctors to inflate the treatments . stop over treating ! ! ! !	1466
0	corey was really nice . he was very personable with his customers . unfortunately , i was unimpressed with the quality of my beverage . neither my nor my friend 's tea was shaken . if you 've ever had an unshaken tea compared to a shaken one , you 'd notice a huge difference . my largest concern is if they 're making a simple tea incorrectly , there must be larger issues .	2242
1	loved how nice the staff was , my dog grady seemed to have really liked it a lot there . definitely will use them in my future trips here .	1830
1	i highly recommend this panda location . food is excellent ! price is very reasonable . very good sized helpings . fresh & delicious ! very clean restaurant . friendly staff . healthy `` fast food '' . its not fast food , its really nutritional & deliscious ! im a big fan of panda here in ohio , ca & other states . been eating panda for over twenty years . you 'll be addicted from the first time !	1075
1	i am so happy i went to check out swina finally ! i was way overdue for a facial and my skin is still trying to get adjusted to this dry weather out here ! i had such a good experience with corina , my esthetician . what a sweetheart ! . she was knowledgeable and personable with a gentle touch . i loved that i was offered a hand and foot massage during my facial . the product recommendations were on point and there were no pushy sales tactics . my skin felt hydrated , moisturized and clean when i left . looking forward to my next facial : )	1701
0	i hate how they fight with you with shots . i 'm there for shots , then give my son shot . do n't tell me to wait when they are due . should be given soon as possible . i 've took both my kids to see both drs ... and the drs sucks ! i loved everything else but the drs .	2221
0	las vegas is like spring break . except all of the people are adults and more pathetic . i was hungover , walking on the strip in 2005 when a hooker asked what i was getting into . i told her i was feeling sick and stay away . she did n't listen . i puked and it almost landed on her shoes . that is the perfect metaphor for las vegas . a prostitute ducking vomit .	315
1	being a repeat customer , i can honestly say that the service and the communication between parties has not changed ! excellent as usual and is never a hassle . people will definitely have a smooth transaction over here . shout out to mark who helped me out ( again ) . always a pleasure to be served with ease . he explained everything accurately . this is my definite spot when it comes to car service !	2392
1	best soon tofu ive ever had . side dishes are great too . kinda in a sketchy area but this place is amazing	22
1	this place is n't as bad as everyone says it is . i had absolutely no problems with checking in , nor did i have any problems with my room . the room was clean , and i did n't see any stains on the carpet in my room . i however did see stains in the hallway , but i 'm not sleeping out there . excellent customer service through and through .	2976
1	very nice staff ! made me feel welcome the minute i walked in the door . i was wary about my dog going because she had n't seemed very comfortable around dogs since i had adopted her , and they made me feel so much better about being apprehensive rather than feeling crazy . they introduced my dog slowly to the other dogs and were so patient and kind and i was so happy when they told me my dog did great and passed her interview ! i am so glad she 's a camper .	3745
1	i just moved down to huntersville nc and could n't find a good italian deli until i found this place . so many people told me to go , so i finally did . what a fantastic place . the butcher had all kinds of cuts ! the deli meats and cheeses were outstanding ! if you go , do n't forget to buy `` little gina 's '' pizzelles ! i just might be going back tomorrow for other items . my husband was pleasantly surprised what i brought home .	283
0	the server was the worst ever . only saw him twice throughout our dinner . had to flag him down on the 2nd time . he gave us our order of oysters after we finished our entrees . oh , and i got food poisoning so i could n't enjoy the rest of my vegas `` vacation . ''	1538
0	incompetent front desk staff ! ! ! she was to lazy to look up my insurance info and sent me on my way with my son who had a bleeding gash in his head . i had my insurance card but not one with my sons name . info is all the same and he should have been in the system from a prior visit .	535
0	service seemed hurried and uninterested , and in the end i had to do additional follow-up with the cra due to a typo on their part . seems like copying the numbers from a t4 should be a no-brainer , but no . too much trouble for a simple return , would not recommend .	3146
1	we always stop in here to see bob , our regular vegas bartender , but he was off the night we stopped in . no royal flushes this time , but the beer is cold .	2688
1	i love this place ! ! i just moved to las vegas and went really for a cup of coffee but when i walked in it had the coolest vibe to it so i decided to sit at the bar and look through a menu . i ended up getting the chicken omelet and ordered my sister the tuna kale eggs benedict . it was all delicious as well as the coffee . they also put a side of plantain chips on your plate that are crisp and very good too	1332
1	the staff has been amazing . there are 7 of us traveling together and even with how busy it is thanksgiving day everyone has been super nice and very helpful . travel is very upbeat today .	3127
1	we 've been very pleased with stuart wakeman in the service department . he 's always been straightforward with us about repairs and has let us know whenever a part or service was covered by warranty , even when we were n't aware of it .	3774
1	open until 2am ! ! ! big deal for me ! i like the location , it 's convenient . their prices are competitive , but the best part ( especially in the summer ) is their well stocked cooler . it almost gets a little crowded , but i do n't mind , people shuffle through carefully and at least they have what i 'm looking for !	3265
0	we had good food and great service at the fusion sushi in kensington so we came here expecting the same . big mistake ! the food was okay . the service was not good at all . they seemed extremely confused by my allergies ( simply asked for nothing to have sesame on it ) . the worst part of all was that the restaurant smelled so bad ! ! ! we were seated in the back portion of the restaurant towards the bar and i 'm really not sure if that was the washroom or the kitchen but either way it made the meal absolutely unpleasant . we 'll probably be back at fusion- but not this location .	515
1	i have been to bonfyre for over 4 years . it 's consistent , which is a good thing . the vibe is always fun with a touch of class but not over the top for those who like to hang out in jeans and fleece . great lunch and dinner specials such as paella , pot roast , salads and chicken pot pies . the seafood dishes have always been my favorite . great wine and cocktail options and do have wine lockers for rent . the beacon lounge is the newest addition to go and hang out , either while waiting for your table or a smaller intimate space to go with your sweetie . well done for keeping it up !	951
1	clean facility with courteous staff . most members have good gym etiquette . if this location was closer to home and work , i would attend here more often . one issue is there 's some gym equipment that 's not available at this location like it is at my regular gym , and vice versa ; they have some equipment that my regular gym facility does n't have . i would definitely recommend this location to someone looking for a good workout .	392
0	did not really like my massage . my lady was rushed , and said it 's a $ 10 tip -__- got the groupon $ 39 for a full body massage for green tea foot soak and sea salt scrub . it was 30 mins in the public room and 30 mins in a private room . she rushed the latter part of my massage and i felt unhappy giving an undeserved $ 10 tip . would n't come back or recommend .	2399
0	i was there on mother 's day , and i came out the same way i went in for a pedicure . they only soak your feet brush and color your toe nail for 40 dollars . is not worth it . i should read the reviews before . here are some pictures that i took just outside of this place .	2686
0	booked appt for 4:45pm , finally got called at 6:45pm . never going back ; not recommended ...	223
1	delicious dim sum and very attentive service . tried a variety of the steamed dumplings which were a decent size , black sesame balls were delicious and piping hot , and pork buns . that said , the prices are very high compared to chinatown . however , if you want a lovely dining atmosphere to go with really good food , then this the place . only care about the food , then heading a few blocks to chinatown will cut your cheque by about one third .	113
0	i bought a desk here and the salesman sold me on the idea that it was easy to put together . once i got it home it was anything but easy . there were 50 pieces and numerous hardware items . when i called they refuse to answer my questions . they said it was my responsibility to put it together . i asked to speak to a supervisor and of course there was n't one available . i was told one would call me back . of course no on called . terrible customer service .	439
0	i really like their men 's department . i like the clothing and the prices . however , the hassle of checking out really makes me dislike shopping there . the men 's department did not have a cashier available so we walked over to appliances . there were 2 customers ah ad of us and 2 cashiers- and it still took 20 minutes for our turn . ( i am not exaggerating ) one lady had one item ! when we asked the cashier to order 2 shirts in a different color than the shirt we brought as an example he said they were out of stock . i 'm kinda confused because i went online and ordered them myself with no issues at all 3/19/18	223
1	this was pretty cool ! i really like the sting wrays and the over head aquarium . some of the fish i had never seen before great for a quick trip to do something fun . would recommend .	706
0	they need a more welcoming approach other than yelling if you have an appointment and to pick your color . yes i know i need to pick a color . just way too abrupt in their first approach . end of the week and weekends never go , it 's all a big rush and not relaxing at all . i do n't think i will go back .	2962
1	love this gym . i come late at night to avoid the crowds . never a wait for a machine . basketball gym is great ! unlike the other 24 hours , there is actually room on the sides of the court to sit and wait for a game , stretch , or rest !	392
1	we had never ate here before . it was amazing . the rosemary sea salt fries were so good . probably one of the best burgers i have had . right up there with 5 guys . service was good too . the young lady waiting on us was friendly and a big smile . a real change for airport food . we will come again .	669
1	my car broke down during rush hour on the south end of the strip . i called my insurance company and they said it would be 90 minutes at the earliest . i asked them to try a few more companies because i did n't want to wait 90 minutes or more . they called a few more places , and phenomenal said they would be there in 60 minutes or less . well , within 50 minutes the tow truck arrived . the driver was polite and professional , and we chatted the whole way to my mechanic . good experience for me .	2010
0	stay away from this place brought our truck for small leak it took them a week after we came to pick it up they said they found more problems and it would take another week also it would cost 5000 $ . scammers ! ! !	3914
1	very nice and friendly staff and quick drive through service . i did n't have any issues with ordering and the wait was not bad at all , i ordered a toasted bagel and two lattes and was in and out within minutes .	3571
1	actually very good for what it is . old style vegas showgirl show and the costumes are outstanding . got the tickets for free through total rewards and just wanted something different to do for `` date night '' and was n't expecting anything spectacular but it turned out to be surprisingly awesome . i just can not say enough how much i loved the costume designs . beautiful . i could do without the singing but all the visuals made up for it . for a free show it gets an a+	3069
0	retarded security asked for idenentification really softly and when we walked passed because we did n't hear him he told us that we was rude and kicked us out instead of just asking us again .	3840
1	hands down best pho ever ! ! ! little pricey but it 's so work it ! i have the beef pho and i added chillie oil and suracha and hoisen sauce . and some lemons ! so so tasty ! best pho i 've had in az and trust me i 've been on a search !	779
1	love this place ! came here for the 1st time & & the staff is super friendly like everybody and they really clean your car by hand : ) youu get to choose from like 15 different air freshner scents ! my car has never looked better ! ! thank youu alamo !	2359
0	be aware of the cheating going on in the service center . i stopped using them when they told me i needed a tire rotation on tires with less that 400 miles on them . my dad got a 2 year free oil change deal when he bought the truck and they told him it expired 4 months before the 2 years was up . do n't trust the service center here .	307
0	the attendant is so rude . i have parked in airport parking all over the us and she ( patricia ) is by far the worst . i will never park here again . there are so many other choices - i will definitely go to others .	2531
1	recently purchased my first home , it 's got a sweet pool ! needed a pool brush , pool net and some shock treatment also . so went to leslie 's and found what i needed but to be cost consciencous i decided to shop around a bit and stumbled across this place . found the same exact items and for way less . the counter help was friendly and helpful . they even offered to come to my home and check the pool for me . even gave me a bottle for the water testing . not a 5 star review as i only visited the location one time . no complaints and no problems here , will definitely be shopping here again .	3699
0	terrible class schedule . there is classes at noon and then a huge break until 4 pm . for how expensive this membership is , it does n't really include much . the schedule is garbage and i 'm always having to drive to the dowd . now the dowd is having renovations and also closed their schedule for 4 hours . what a joke ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	349
0	this is my first and last time visiting this urgent care . the girl at the front desk was rude . there was also a power outage for a few minutes .	2940
0	sitting here again and it 's already been 1 hr and that 's with an appointment . love dr.irons but we need monthly meds and they make us come monthly when other dr 's give 3 months at a time . ..this place is the worst . ... huge waste of time , although it 's conveniently located i 'll be looking for a new dr .	609
1	great medical practice . i have thyroid issues and need to see this doctor on a regular basis . here is some great items i like : 1 . calls to confirm apointments a week in advance . 2 . they answer the phone . 3 . they can look up my info and email me . 4 . professional group of individuals that work here . i do n't know about you , but my past experience is that it is hard to get prescriptions at my regular doctor filled , or someone on the phone . glad these guys stepped it up and seem to be on the ball . keep up the great work !	303
0	terrible service , waited on the phone for 45 minutes , then they ca n't find my rx . never using them again	2827
0	i came here after receiving a recommendation from a carpet cleaning company . when i entered the showroom i was not greeted well . i felt as though i was charged too much for the piece of carpet i purchased . the guy had initially quoted me one price but when he rung me up he charged me another . i will not be back !	3407
0	purchase a at of sample and was charged 4.99 today they charged me 12.99 per qt really riled me off	23
0	my nails look so ugly thick and they already look like i need a fill because they start it my nail so far away from my cuticles . shape i asked for was square-oval and that was n't accomplished . wont be returning	2929
1	we visited for our first time for their show called 'top drag ' . we were told it was really quiet compared to usual crowds but the vibe was great . staff was really professional and friendly . met the bar manager , who was very cool . he was operating the spot light for thee night 's show . stage and dace floor separate from the bar makes floating around fun . we will be going back soon !	2249
1	this is it ! we finally found it ! we were hungry and they fed us well . the stuff were very attentive and friendly . the service and food are phenomenal ! ! perfecto ! ! ! we will definitely coming back to vegas and cebu inasal is on our top list to visit and eat . ( ; we had so much fun , we did karaoke too ! ! this is it !	658
1	i just got eyelash extensions from mimi and i absolutely love them ! ! ! ! ! this place is so nice and clean and the staff was super friendly . i will be back !	2481
1	clean , lots of room , free drinks , and does n't smell like nasty smoke ( well at least not as much as there casinos ) . i barely bet on sports when i 'm in vegas , but when you 're there with someone who knows what 's up it 's fun .	2271
1	they do good nails prices are okay . should probably make a appointment they are usually packed ! love my coffin nails	1637
0	the store itself is very cute , nicely decorated ... .thats about the only thing that impressed me about this place . in my opinion cupcakes are not being perserved properly or something , very dry cupcakes ! do not try the mexican chocolate cupcake ! tasted like dirt..they need to rethink their prices too..deliver perfection at $ 3.00 a pop	1806
1	had a good time seeing the show with two of my close friends during our girls trip to vegas . the show speaks for itself , but i can tell you : think magic mike amplified . my friends and i could n't stop laughing during the show because it is just so out there . i 'd recommend the show especially to bachelorette parties who seemed to have the most performer interaction . can also take a picture with the guys for $ 20 extra after the show . this seems a bit over the top , but i guess it 's a nice memory to have of the night .	2149
1	i have been here three times and look forward to returning soon . the food is always great . but be warned : it 's hard to make a decision because the entire menu looks sooooo good ! my goal : try every burger .	496
0	i was excited to try a new chicken place in town , but was really disappointed . the quality of all the food here is just not there , it 's nothing special . just about any other place is better than this .	862
0	consumer - customers alert ! ! ! http : //crosslandstudios.com . and @ extendedstay america hotels are dens of theives and discriminate and are racists . beware ! ! ! try # travelocity	2185
0	car wash is a joke ! the smog includes a cheap express car wash. you have to go inside the store and get a code for a horrible basic express car wash	2796
1	first time here with a little hesitant due to some of the reviews . however , i had to give this a 4 star for the awesome food that i ordered ( power salads + salmon ) . yummy and delicious . thank you pgatour grill .	369
0	i do n't post reviews very often . but stay away from this company . run away . they really do not know what they are doing and their sales people are not very knowledgeable . the customer service is horrible . they do not follow through . there are plenty of low cost companies that are much better.. anything is better	3551
1	went saturday 7-4-15 around 5:45 pm . they were running a 4th of july special of 1/2 off pizza for military ! our server jenn was so nice and attentive and i ate the best caesar salad i 've ever had there . my go-to pizza is the gotham . this time i tried the fried mozarella ... .it was pretty tasty .	192
1	i signed up for the 2-week unlimited trial and have been going to different classes just trying to figure out what teacher and class best fits my needs . so far i love them all and every single one of the teachers is amazing ! the studio of cozy and the staff is very friendly and definitly not salesy like some other studios in the valley .	908
0	had to obtain some closing records from them , because was out of state and did n't have my own with me.. called , left messages and emailed several times and not a word back from them . will remember not to use this title company in future for anything !	3783
1	have n't been here in so long , tierney was very helpful explaining things ! very clean and i 'm excited to have another membership !	2604
0	i transferred my prescriptions to a local pharmacy . i 'm not giving any more money to walgreens after a patient was denied medication for miscarriage in peoria .	3411
0	had a quick lunch here on my way to catch a flight . i ordered the grilled chicken pesto flatbread , which turned out to be a cheesy mix served on what could best be called a deep dish crust . in other words , not terrible but definitely not worth the $ $ .	369
0	rude customer service from quinton . feels like he do n't want my business and over charged me for the service . i will never come back to this place again and give my business somewhere else where i will be appreciated . a special gift from someone special ( gift card ) was put to waste because of bad service .	2113
0	officemax is n't all bad , but their impress print center is another story . they are extraordinarily slow .	1997
0	they did n't check any of my fluid levels like they say they do under their list of services that are included with an oil change . i even mention to the technician that my car had recently been overheating when it was sitting still , and they still did n't check to see that i had virtually zero radiator fluid . now my car has major damage , it would 've been nice if they could 've given me a heads up before all of this went wrong ! ! ! ! ! ! is it because they take advantage of women or all of their customers in general ?	3519
0	just not feelings this place . boutique - yes , but cumbersome expensive parking and rehashed rooms do n't add up to high price per night . not a bad place if you need to head downtown for game or concert . as for me , i 'll stay elsewhere and drive a little further when flying out . do n't see myself staying at this pretentious place again .	3859
0	reception was unfriendly . dr. feng spent three minutes with me and advised i should take anti inflammatories , wear a brace and let time heal it . he did not listen to me , take my pain seriously or try to diagnose what the problem is . i would not recommend him nor will i be returning to toca .	2755
0	i tried this place for the last time . ive been here several times and everytime its never the same price and the people dont know the price they always have to call someone ( the owner i assume ) and clarify what price was agreed upon . when the guy asked do u want oil and hot stone he never said it would be $ 10 extra . umm for you to rub a hot stone and oil on my back for an extra 3 1/2 minutes , im good thanks skip . such a rip off . dont go just because its convenient .	2399
1	staff is awesome ! love my trainer ! and my daughter loves seeing the girls working in the daycare !	2699
0	this is response to a rental i had recently at this location . overall i was disappointed with the customer service and will not rent there again .	3024
0	first off the bartenders were and extremely disrespectful . when i ask for a water , since my dd was not drinking . i was told they only have bottle water , which in turn was charging me for water . in the state of arizona it is against the law to deny any patron water . free of charge of they dont have tap , they must provide other means of water . fuck this this place	17
1	the good -i give them 5 stars for their gel nails and pedicures . they have always done a great job when getting either of these services . their pedicure chairs are comfortable . the nail techs have always given at least 5 minute leg massages with pedicures . the bad- do n't go here for sns . they do a gel topcoat at the end and this is the only time my sns has ever chipped/cracked . they say it is for the shine but doing the standard sns topcoat gives a better shine than the gel topcoat and if you 're getting sns you want to avoid the uv light so it does n't really make sense to do the gel topcoat .	2197
1	my son wanted pizza so we ended up here . service was good and the pizza was very tasty . some interesting drink selections available . unfortunately we wanted to eat in , which is not available , however there are tables outside . it was a bit chilly but the delicious pizza kept us warm . pizza was a little undercooked but delicious nonetheless . would come back again .	1063
1	well we came in with a true car quote too and they made good on it . they even found us good financing that another kia dealer could not . michael our sales rep was good and steve the sales manager delivered for us . we bought a sorrento there last night . i would recommend them .	624
0	took 2 months of rescheduling on a couch that was on back order for me to finally decide to just get a full refund . they wasted so much of my time , even when i called they never answered my calls was just placed on hold till the call hung up on its own .	1794
0	wow , what a disaster . not only do they not have ac it also smells bad and i would say at least 50 % of the shops are shut down . we even asked one of the store owners about the ac and they said the owners do n't do anything about it . what a mess ! the stores that are in there are nick nak shops so it 's a bunch of junk . thank you amazon !	2815
1	the new facility is stunning . so clean and fresh . i am so glad they have the well and sick waiting areas separate from each other and they also have a moms nursing room which is so cozy and private . the doctors are all very thorough . dr. caplan is great . she listens to the concerns and also respects the parents input and preferences . high quality care here for sure .	3134
1	absolutely as good as i could have possibly hoped for ! we celebrate our late dad 's bday with a traditional/annual spaghetti dinner in his honor ( his favorite meal ) and without a shadow of a doubt this was my favorite & most delicious year so far & in a rather unassuming location ! thx to yelp we found this place which we most likely would not even have considered ( or even found , as it is inside of a 'putters ' lounge ) i wish i could give them a 6th star ! ! staff was attentive & friendly & the value and tastes far surpassed our expectations !	459
1	this is my favorite spa in lv ! red rock does n't even compare to gvr ! anyone u get performs amazingly !	2651
1	i like the convenience ! the doctors and staff are friendly and professional . i recommend the joint to all my friends and family . i have been going to this location for over 2 years and have always been satisfied with the quality of service . you sure ca n't beat the price and for regular adjustments , this is great ! i have arthritis , so coming in regularly is so important for my overall health and feeling of well-being ! i ca n't recommend this place enough !	3756
1	this review is long over due , i order jesse 's pizza twice a week and it 's literally the best pizza ever !	1399
1	the wait was a little long but the care of my cut finger was great . 3 stitches tetanus shot . have not seen the bill yet but i was happy .	2517
1	great club great drinks and love he music will come again next weekend for sure.highly recommend to friends and family	1966
1	operations in my area ( sf bay area ) have gotten much better . i 'm receiving package notices that match their records and i have n't been put on hold endlessly . a friendly customer rep answers after the first ring . i 'm so much happier with their service .	556
0	it does not worth the money . thirty-five dollars for twenty minutes hair cut and it turns out to be ten dollars quality . i got unequaled hair shape on the top of head and unequaled hair length on the sides ! if you do n't use detailed trimmer , then do your work carefully . do n't excuse that you cut the hair in the manner of equal length and the issue is that my head is not even ! i felt weak sense of responsibility of you and i felt sorry that you try to pass the buck . definitely not recommend .	3486
1	this is my second time here .both times i have been happy with the service .the facility is clean and the physican assistant is knowledgable . i would return again !	535
0	sandwiches are bland , the bread is like wonder loaf . the service was just awful five guys yelling at each other . just do n't understand the hype .	1340
1	whenever my friend and i are in the mood for dim sum , we come here for their discounted dim sum times ( 9am-11am , 2pm-4pm ) . the food is always hot , fresh , and delicious . we got pork spare ribs , har gow , shu mai , crab claws , beef balls , tripe , and rice noodle rolls with shrimp . everything was so good and only came to about $ 15/person which is great . i 'm definitely coming back here .	0
1	first of all , this review gets 4 stars for noon and afternoon dining and 5 stars in the am ! i love getting the apple turnovers , but you should definitely get them in the morning when they are freshly baked and still warm and gooey . later on in the day , they are kind of stale and not as good . but other than pastries , i love their salads for lunch and nothing beats a nice morning quiche . but i definitely suggest this place for a nice breakfast or early brunch spot .	1276
0	this is one of those i should 've read the reviews before i came in i only came here because my daughter had a play date at az air time and tried to kill two birds with one stone . not my brightest idea to date . while the service was good and my nail tech was nice , she did a terrible job on my nails . uneven polish , jaded edges , just an overall bad job . i actually regret not looking first before i came in , i 'm disappointed . i will definitely not be back and do n't recommend this to anyone .	854
0	went to laseraway for tattoo removal and would not recommend it . they performed 4 treatments and only found out on the last treatment that the other treatments were done wrong . highly suggest finding another place if you value your time and money .	582
0	silver state never returned my calls regarding cleaning services . would not recommend .	2875
1	just sports is a store in scottsdale fashion square , and easy to spot due to the graphic entrance -- baseball bats , balls , etc . the guys who work here were really nice and helpful . they have lots of sports gear , from t-shirts to jerseys , caps to visors , collectibles , mugs , cups , etc . the place is covered from floor to ceiling with stuff . obviously , you 'll find a lot of cardinals , d-backs , suns , and arizona state gear here , but you 'll see other teams and schools here . some of the prices are a bit steep , so just be prepared for that .	1737
0	horrible service . slow . rude and not worth the wait . i 'm so disappointed in this place .	282
0	please note the 42 rather candid reviews in the `` not recommended '' section at the end of the list of reviews . it is clear that along with their other dubious business practices this company manipulates their yelp profile page by falsely flagging reviews that are critical so that they appear to have a more positive image . but with 42 `` not recommended '' reviews and only a half dozen positive ones you do not need to be a rocket scientist to understand that this company has built a rather large and consistently negative opinion with their customers . beware ! ! !	2523
0	this grocery store is expensive , i might as well go to whole foods . there is a small organic selection . there is no self check out machines . i am sticking with my old spot .	1904
0	walked in at 720 pm 3 people there no one said anything no one acknowledge us seems they didnt want to sell anything wont recommend this place to anyone your lost there 's plenty other places that would take our money	1991
0	i ca n't believe where you have to sit if you are in a wheelchair ! what discrimination ! it 's directly i front of the screen ! i do n't even know why they have seats there . not one person wants to sit that close to a giant screen . i 'm surprised no one has complained to anyone hire up !	2450
1	this is a good time ! it 's pricey after 5pm , at $ 45 an hour , but it 's definitely fun . it 's cheaper earlier in the day at $ 25/hr . an hour is usually plenty for 2 people . 2 hours is usually sufficient for 4 people . i have never been disappointed with their food . excellent quality . drinks are not bad either . their service is pretty decent . staff is friendly . cocktails are between $ 8- $ 10 , beer $ 4- $ 6 , wine $ 7- $ 12/glass , appetizers $ 6- $ 12 , dinners $ 10- $ 13 . plan on spending $ 100 - $ 150 on a date night ; )	1483
0	horrible , horrible human being . kicked me out of his office because i looked 'upset ' and did n't find his stupid joke funny . the only reason i was n't completely shocked is because this is las vegas , the boil on the ass of the country . i would avoid this greaseball at all costs .	3928
1	tried this place this morning ! they have your tradition donut & then creative ones like cinnamon toast crunch with blueberry icing & fruit pebbles with vanilla ice cream which are the two my mom & i got . they were moist & delicious , not dry at all . customer service was very nice & our total was around $ 4- $ 5 bucks . very small shop & plain but i will be back when in the mood for a donut ! overall good experience which is why i 'm giving 5 stars .	3322
1	by far mine and my husbands favorite hang out spot while we have been here in vegas . dennis the bartender was amazing ! ! he was super friendly and gave us good vegas insight . all of the bartenders are really nice to be honest . the music in the casino and the lights at the bar add to the aura . nice relaxed feel . the drinks are decently priced . i 'm sure the reason for no drink menu is because they offer many many different drinks and beers . great location too .	2634
1	50 shades freed was the last movie i saw here and i ca n't wait to see black panther . this theater has recently been in upgraded to reclining seats which are a lot more comfortable for heavier people like myself . every experience i 've had here has been great . the snack bar is over priced but what theater is n't lol	491
1	mrs. anh is a gem . all smiles and laughs and so welcoming with her questions and showing interest in me . i came back a few days later because my mani had been smeared the moment i walked out and she helped me redo without hesitation . super super friendly . i want to be her friend .	2390
1	fabulously friendly ! i stop in here for free gas using the $ 100 freddy 's card i won . good prices on gas & friendly employees . you can stock up on beverages , get a car wash and be on your way to summerlin parkway in a flash ! they have discounted prices on gas if you purchase a car wash. and gaming , with a $ 10 free play offer for new signups .	2198
0	took a long time . then they tell me i need $ 1200 worth of other things fixed on my car , which do n't . and the craziest thing is when i left my car started acting a little off . pretty sure i wo n't be going back	2146
0	pho broth was bland . it was just eh . i have had better . service was good though and people were nice .	172
1	been to this place twice now and have had great experiences both times ! ! ! the associates were very nice and attentive to us great friendly place would definitely recommend to other people ! ! !	1345
0	it looks like the men 's section is a fraction of the size it used to be . too bad . fit is overall unflattering on the mens side with the exception of a few select items that fit a size smaller than i normally am . i 'll wait for uniqlo this summer .	3307
1	my husband and i love it here ! always just sit at the bar and get a couple pitchers of beer and a large gotham pizza . it 's always busy too but service is very quick .	192
1	grooming service are always wonderful , my dog has been coming here for more than 3 years . sharon and andrea are very loving toward my dog and my dog loves them too . my dog always smells great after her grooming . i 'll continue to come here and i also recommend sharon and andrea for dog grooming services .	2108
0	went there for an late lunch with the girlfriends . the food was good but the service was not . both servers seem to have lack of customer service skills . as someone who ran a restaurant , i felt these ladies did n't deserve any tip but i tip for the kitchen ... well hopefully the kitchen gets some tips . unfortunately this was the second visit in a row that service was undesirable . i do n't think i would return , even if the food was good . : - (	1079
0	just bought a puppy from them and she has kennel cough and parasites ! they must not take care of their puppies . buyer beware ! ! ! ! !	1894
1	excellent customer service by erwin he was pleasant upbeat and helped me quick he is a keeper	1761
0	they 're creative with their mto options but i was n't very impressed with the outcome . the `` servers '' are very polite and it 's a very fast process even though the line is out the door . still , the end product is lack luster and i 'd rather go to bruster 's or handels	3813
0	thank you ken for saying you do repairs on flats for big o tire customers over the phone and then when i show up you say you ca n't patch it so i need a new tire . this kind of customer service is why not all big o tires are the same . i drove back with a punctured tire all the way to the other big o tire store that was more than happy to help me out .	3379
0	just really lazy no one smiles and they just do n't speak english it 's not a very fun place to go to	2886
0	expensive like all of vegas but kind of a dive for the price the entertainment such as piano bar is ok ... and features an open mic it seems to attract an alternative lifestyle too	3326
1	this wash is amazing . the staff is well groomed i love the ties though this is arizona give your guys some t-shirts . but over all amazing service i would have never thought people would be so happy to see me come to get a wash . it was so clean and smelled amazing good job quick quack on cactus .	78
1	always great , always fab and relaxing for 7 years and going strong ! different owners now than my girl anh since the passing of her husband , thom but the new owner , holly is awesome and so is her team . i get my brows snatched ( waxed ) , a deluxe pedi w/designs and a gorgeous mani w/designs too , for under $ 100 .	3390
1	devin was great and efficient . i love that they fill prescriptions here as well .	535
1	great restaurant great service you can pick one of the burgers and change the patty to your own likening and you can also make your own combination . on top of that it is organic.we shared the rings and fries plate . my only complain is that the smell of frying was overwhelming and it lingered for days on our clothes .	1417
1	ok i was really hesitant to buy my flooring from these guys because of the yelp reviews but they had the flooring that we wanted for our bedrooms . i was very pleasantly surprised with every transaction . three separate purchases and a return of 6 xtra boxes . the guys i worked with were professional and very friendly . on my last load they guy convinced me to buy a whole pallet even though i knew it was about 6 or 7 more boxes than i would need . it was easier to just fork lift the pallet on my trailer and then return any extra boxes before the 30 day deadline . worked out perfectly ! thanks guys will buy from you again .	2763
0	coffee is good but service is bad ... the old filipino lady barista has an attitude ... she kept on ignoring us while we waited for our orders for a long time . every one left already except us . i would love to go back in this cafe but because of the service ... forget it !	2397
1	my wife 's laptop screen broke and we called several computer stores to find someone to fix it . the right pc guys were the only ones who took time to talk with me & were very knowledgeable . they fixed my wife 's laptop and i actually found a refurbished laptop for myself at a really great price with a warranty ! i had a great experience so i just wanted to say thanks !	2523
1	i 've stayed at this embassy suites for extended periods while working in phx and have always had a great experience here . the food is what you 'd expect it to be for a hotel . i recommend the salmon , wings , and the buffalo chicken wrap . the bar staff is very attentive and how can you beat a free happy hour every evening for hotel guests ? if you 're looking for a nice meal onsite during your stay , this is a great option .	179
0	nice atmosphere but real problems at the bar . started with the bartender refusing to get a water for me until he finished all his drink orders ( i asked for the water first -- it was for a sick friend ) . through the night , the bar could n't make three different drinks i asked for , including their advertised signature drink ( bc 42 or something like that ) . despite the dj , the same blondie songs kept repeating through the night . wo n't be back to camp four !	1837
1	after reviewing a couple of companies i decided to go with precision granite it was the best estimate i received . they were professional , friendly and efficient . their work was beautifully done and completed as quickly as promised . i will keep using them for my next projects .	1861
1	raj was great ... he went above and beyond helping out my inlaws get to the airport and secure a porter for them	2952
1	one posh venue ! when i arrived , i was at the wrong entrance . there was a completely different fancy event going on . i did n't know there was more than one entrance . was here for a fundraising event . high ceilings boasting high arches , beautiful flooring and cordial staff . lots of windows , a stage , coat check and restrooms in the basement . the kind of place where you always feel under-dressed . : p	3466
0	worst mexican food in the world , no taste , all old meat , hard & stale , but good counter service . extremely flimsy cheapest plastic forks and sporks they could find.. very clean and bright though . super-americanized for northern caucasian taste-buds . absolutely no spices used ... .please shut down asap.. garbage bull-s -- t ...	857
1	emiliano and his enterprise team are excellent ! he is very friendly and super considerate in offering water bottles to everyone who were waiting ! 5 stars for emiliano and his team ! ! we appreciate you ! ! !	3024
0	sandbagged burgers . not necessary being the burgers are small for fast cooking . asked for well done crispy fries.. comes out same regular . white guy who took our order could n't even put a fresh patty down , do n't know the difference from crispy and regular fries . only came here cause my daughters choice . definitely talking her out of this place next time ...	25
1	nayely was so much help and so nice ! ! everything has been great so far ! ! this place is great !	3091
0	well , so sad , but i must write an update ... . the last two times i 've been in , it was lame . i hope they are n't getting lackadaisical since they are busy the majority of the time . the girl that i had , kept burping and was leaning against the wall and then was falling asleep . oye ! ! are you freaking kidding me ? ? ? ? i might reconsider going back : /	2970
0	do n't go here they will find a way out of fixing issues that are under warranty.i will gladly drive an extra half hour and go to a different dealership i suggest you do the same .	624
1	never felt compelled to write a review for ross before , but this time i thought i should because erica ( fitting rooms ) was outstanding . usually fitting room is a very limited interaction and not particularly friendly but erica was friendly , welcoming and helpful . also the lady at the register was very friendly but i did n't wrote down her name	482
1	even with this vegas heat , these guys were able to take care of me with ease . they were friendly and accommodating . their lounge is conveniently located in a store where you can wait and eat or try your luck on the slot machines . i received a free car wash with the oil change i got for $ 50 . will most likely come back again .	2544
1	walked right in , sat right down and left with smooth feet and pretty toes . good prices great pedi . i 'll definitely go back .	822
0	ordered a burger combo with lettuce ketchup and mayo . what did i get a burger with onions and tomatoes on it . two things i hate . smh . i will say the food wood was good and would have rated higher if my order was correct	800
0	it pains me to give a place bad reviews , and i rarely do . i usually can find something to focus on that was positive . i do n't have any of that here . service was slow and unenthused . food was just ok. my fish wasnt terrible , but it wasnt good either . my wife got the bruschetta and hated it and she isnt picky . all of those things could be overlooked if it wasnt for the fact that its a microbrewery and the beer was terrible . we ordered a flight and my wife turned her nose up to every one . i didnt like any enough to order another . disappointing .	670
1	went to squid ink last night for my birthday dinner and i can honestly say i 'm always impressed with not only the quality of the food , but the service as well . the hostess and waitresses were so kind ! i would recommend the potstickers and , if you like spicy , the `` dirty rockstar '' sushi roll . the mussels were so good , but then again i 've never had anything i did n't like at squid ink . go for happy hour and all of the best rolls are half off ... how can pass that up ? ! delicious .	602
1	this location is always busy . has the usual items all dollar trees seem to have . easy if you are just looking for a quick item that 's just as good as the brand names . browse a bit , you know you 'll find something you need . sad note : this is not a location that has a freezer/cooler section filled with food . they do have a cooler , but it only has drinks in it . happy note : sunday papers here are truly just $ 1 compared to the other places .	2446
0	ordered a jack on the rocks . it came out clear . hmm i wonder if they water down their liquor . yea , we wo n't be back .	211
1	the people of carx take very good care of their customers and provide excellent service . the people that work there are extremely nice . as a college student who does n't know alot about cars or appropriate prices for car services , i never once felt taken advantage or got a service that i did n't need . i strongly recommend carx on bradley	1044
1	got my tkr surgery there . i just love that hospital ! staff is great ! the nurses , assistants , housekeeping , everyone ! stayed for two nights and i felt so comfortable there , besides the obvious pain from my surgery , i was treated very well . thank you	2081
1	one of the best nail salon 's i 've ever been . clean , professional , and accommodating in a very reasonable price . i suggest lyn if you want to do your manis and pedis she goes with your request and will guarantee your money 's worth of pampering and r & r .	2686
1	probably the largest asian grocery store in the area : they have a huge supply of ramen ( no , not maruchan *shakes fist* ) and ingredients . though not as produce-centric as far east , they have much more in terms of sauces , frozen food , and even cooking untensils . do n't miss out on grabbing some cuttle fish chips , crushed pear juice , and some frozen man doo , among the many things you can find here , but nowhere else .	2383
1	very nice selection ! i went to buy my mom a purse and found several to choose from . out of all the coach outlets i 've visited this has the nicest selection . i found several accessories and a purse to purchase ! very impressed !	3133
0	this store has the potential to be great with the right idea of selling cheap glasses . unfortunately management is n't performing . my wife previously worked at this location and loved it , but was fired for trying to inform management that the assistant manager to this location was taking breaks to get high . very unprofessional and very concerning . owner needs to look into their management to help future employees so this does n't happen again . she was honest , hardworking , followed the rules , and cared about the company 's image and reputation .	2541
0	if anyone says this is the best pizza they have had they are lying . the pizza is a touch below average , and the prices are outrageous . if you are charging almost five dollars for a slice of cheese pizza it should be very large and delicious , and it is neither . i can not imagine a full grown man or woman being full on one piece , and paying over ten bucks for two slices , not including a drink , is just crazy . please go somewhere else and avoid the mistake i made by eating here .	1371
1	loved it here ! food and service were amazing . the garlic knots are yummy , as was the white pizza with mushrooms that we ordered . the pasta with the duck ragu was delicious . the next time i 'm in toronto , i wo n't be back there just for a business lunch -- i 'll bring my family too .	833
0	i really wanted to like this place . from the `` vegan appeal '' to the appetizing ig photos , i thought this would be my new go-to dessert place . i sampled several of their flavours and they really just tasted like frozen banana . i ended up purchasing the pina colada feature flavour and found the banana to be quite overpowering . i would assume the dole dessert machine could make similar frozen treats . however , if you enjoy the banana taste and the vegan appeal , then by all means !	1134
0	there was a bug in my wife 's dinner . disgusting . they took the charge off the bill for her dinner , which is appropriate . but still . bugs should not be in `` freshly '' prepared food .	873
0	dr. zedek writes his own reviews ! that 's the only reason there are good reviews of him ! dr. zedek prescribes only what pharmaceutical companies pay him to prescribe . he wo n't give you the medication you really need unless he 's paid by the company which makes it ! he switches people from ssris to anti-psychotic medication regularly because the company gives him huge kickbacks to do so . do not see this dr or his counterpart dr j under any circumstances . they are money grubbing quacks ! in fact , if you go in on the weekend , he does n't report the visit to the irs according to a patient who kept records of her visits .	3928
1	this walgreen is convenient , right next to the montebello light rail stop and on 19th . look for the walgreen bucks before buying and save that money ! you can use the walgreens bucks that same day for your next purchase ! they also have a private lot woohoo !	929
1	this new spot was a lot of fun . the band with the asian dude singing did some off key covers that were kinda lame , but when he sang his own music he was on point and sounded great . other than the cheesy covers , for which i would suggest replacing with a modern ambiance of post rock and chill alternative rock , the atmosphere is dope , hip , service is great , cocktails are tasty , there is no cover , seating is available , and the darker lighting is good for relaxing and enjoying something different . my buddy and my girlfriend and i all liked it and will be back again on the next trip .	1992
0	this place was cute and we had high expectations based on other yelp reviews ... but they upcharged us for everything . massage with your pedicure ? $ 5 . callous removal ? $ 5 ? what seemed like a good price for service ended up being way more than we expected and they were n't clear about that until the bill came . one of my friends was cut during her manicure , too , and was bleeding for about an hour .	2686
0	terrible service . slow , un-educated , rip off artists .	535
0	i am not a fan . banana/mango cupcake- the texture was more like a banana muffin with a light mango frosting . i was disappointed because i was expecting a cupcake and not a muffin . strawberry smoothie- very bland taste because it probably needed more sugar . i normally like to finish my food/drinks , but this was just not good at all . i might give this place another chance , but if i 'm in the area i 'll probably end up at caked for my cupcake fix .	1889
0	the worst cigar shop in the valley . it 's a smoke shop that carries dusty overpriced and dry cigars . the person working was clueless to brands and the final nail is when he just stood there in the humidor smoking a cigarette stalking me . yes , smoking a cigarette . class act ! !	1893
0	ginger milk has no ginger flavour in it . the milk is n't silky and soft like it 's supposed to taste . the black jelly is from a can . the watermelon is also from the can . nothing is fresh . do n't come . bye .	1513
1	this is the first year my son has attended gaa and it has been exceptional . he has grown so much and has made so many friends and truly loves all of his teachers . ms. arnold runs a great school and really cares about the kids . every teacher we encounter has been professional and caring and each knows my son by name . our next child will start pre-k here next year and we look forward to watching both kids grow within this school .	2640
0	they call this luxury ? ? this theater design is 20+ years old . small screens . small very uncomfortable seats , very dark projection light on the screen , yet premium admission prices and you will give up a limb if you order popcorn and a coke . avoid this rip off at all costs . i truly feared getting bed bug bites in the old stained seats . watch it at home .	2524
0	i have never had a great experience at this bar due to the bouncers . one of my friends has a tiny puzzle piece tattoo behind her ear , seriously so small i did n't even know she had it ! and she was n't allowed in because `` the manager does n't like neck tattoos . '' the irony of the story is that the two bouncers telling her this both had large , visible tattoos on the side of their necks ! ha . due to this experience and the way that the bouncers handled the situation i will never go back and would never recommend the bar to a friend .	1176
1	large portions of pasta . delicious pizza- as always . there is a large outdoor deck with a lovely view of the sunset . we had plenty of food leftover for a second night . fast service . fun environment . it was lovely !	705
0	i already went to a different shop and they immediately knew right away what 's wrong with my car . i just wasted my money on you guys . your manager already gave me a call and wanted me back but will never refund me .	3379
1	i 've been to hong kong , beijing , etc . the food here is superb and the portions extremely large . we love it . the best . words ca n't describe this food , it 's wonderful . every meal there is like a trip back to the orient . you wo n't regret taking the time to dine here .	1264
0	if you found this place in southern california , it would probably sit idly like every lollicup , quickly , or tapex . i miss the sea salt coffee from 85 degrees . i miss the amazing fruit-in-your-drink selection from tastea . i miss the self-pour tea from ten ren 's tea station . i miss the honey boba from half & half . if you 're craving innovative drinks , you wo n't find it here . but at least this place suffices for the most basic boba milk tea until i get to go home again	490
1	this company has restored my faith in the home improvement process ! ! from start to finish they were timely , friendly , clean , and kept me in the loop ! ! i really ca n't say enough good things about my experience , but i constantly brag about them to all my friends and family and would refer them to anyone looking to do some work to their home .	3881
0	i ordered a chicken shwarma pita and one of the ladies charged me for a laffa which cost me extra . when the lady asked me what i wanted on my shwarma i told her i wanted `` tahini '' but she instead put tatziki . the laffa was not rolled properly and fell apart instantly . overall not satisfied and will not be coming back anytime soon .	89
1	this is my chimi fix restaurant ! i cant believe i have been eating here regularly for a few years now and am just getting around to reviewing . i always order the same thing ... a plain cheese crisp and a red chile chimichanga . it 's a lot of food but soooo good .	1346
0	well , never heard about practice that when you call you ca n't see a doctor when you are sick . this practice is all about false hopes , they treat establish patients horribly , and disrespectfuly . when you have people telling you that they are specialist and they ca n't see you , you better go and find another doctor or voice your opinions in this fourm . disgusting and manipulating practice that on purpose try to avoid seeing you when you are sick that you will come later again . i said it many times , medicine in las vegas is about making money , and doctors here are about putting more money in thier pockets than helping .	1149
0	never go to this place . not professional , not kind , poor knowledge . even my husband didnt have any problems , they sent him to the emergency room because their data reading was wrong and they said `` it looks strange '' ! we tried to contact them for the bill , but nobody answered .	2058
0	you would think a `` deep cleaning '' would include mopping the bathrooms , scrubbing the shower/tub and wiping down the doors but maybe they forgot . for the price they charge i would not recommend this service to anyone . if you do give them a try i highly suggest you request a written copy of the quote so you know what all you 're paying for . specify if you need certain appliances to be cleaned . do n't assume they will do it just because they have two people cleaning your house for 4hrs . the one good thing i can say is that they showed up on time .	2029
0	no customer service unless you do n't know someone in working there . do n't recommend this place	3469
1	one beer-garita ( tip : order it with their white beer instead of blonde beer ) + one order of spicy popcorn shrimp with sweet chili dipping sauce = one amazing snack math is fun . ps i 'm also very curious about their selection of flammekeuches ( sp ? ) which are basically flatbread pizzas .	670
1	it was a breath of fresh air on this airline after dealing with frontier , i 'll never fly on any other airline ! there was a raffle for upgraded seats and my hubby won them for me . i got to enjoy tv on demand , free food and drinks and a comfy recliner seat . i loved the neon lights and i even took a little nap . i would recommend this airline to anyone .	1623
0	for a $ 12 pho det biet it was seriously lacking in flavor and had only pitiful amounts of beef *pieces* in the soup . the broth lacked depth and had no umami flavor at all . the only positive thing about it was the temperature but that 's it . extremely slow service did nothing to help either . to me they rank amongst the worst made pho in clt , along with the likes of vietthai noodle house and the new pho ngon . waste of money if you are serious at all about how a pho should taste .	947
1	donna is amazing ! she did my pedicure and i 've never had such a stellar experience . i showed up for my appointment early and she was ready for me , no wait . donna does a wonderful job cleaning your nails and makes sure they 're shaped just how you want them . this salon is a gem , extremely comfortable and very affordable . i have really difficult nails and she made them exactly how they needed to be .	1783
0	i just left allure nails with a whole in my nail from a drill and my nails looking much worse than when i came in . the man who used the drill never apologized and was angry that i would not let him continue to use the drill and then stormed off . go to best nails up the street for a much better experience .	3347
0	not one of my favorite locations . the only reason i have come here is because it 's open late and if you are uptown and hungry ... it 's convenient . the service is not always the best . the food is ok , hit or miss . the shop is not always the cleanest . in the future , i will remember this and try to just avoid and go home .	902
1	they always have everything i need ( mainly ammo and fishing supplies ) . i also really like going at christmas as it 's great for stocking fillers ! definitely a regular here . the staff are helpful and friendly at this location .	2601
1	one my favorite bars on mill ave with awesome and cheap drinks and super fun atmosphere	1176
1	what a great coffee place . this by far has better coffee than starbucks and is often a little cheaper . the staff here is friendly and personable and always upbeat . i wish there was a dutch bros closer to where i live !	361
1	my daughter had her wedding here . the whole place was truly outstanding . the venue is so beautiful . kathy is very business like but friendly . laura is a hoot ! love her ! they were so good to us . everything was handled extremely professionally . the food was excellent ; the beef was good , but the chicken is even better ! ! ! it was a magical day . it was all first class ! ! ! i highly recommend kathy and the venue ... just take a tour and you 'll understand .	3869
0	wow , yelp not just for food , i see . the manager at this particular location once refused to honor a published price on an advertised product ( refused to match bb.com price for local stock ) . this is contra bb policy ( or at least was contra its then-existing policy ) . pointed this out to him , but no . other reason i 'll never shop there involved bb prior refusal to stand behind a non-honored rebate due to bb advertising and selling a slightly differing hard drive model number than that stated in the rebate terms . this hard drive incident was at a different store . very happy to take my dollars elsewhere .	494
1	an awesome dealership . the people are helpful , knowledgeable , and kind ! the faculty is very clean and stylish ! !	2432
1	just want to drop a note , not sure when they started , but new dinner menu for sakana , as great as always : )	198
0	i used to love them , then they sent me a pair of dull shears . then they sent me a new pair , but it only took 2months to send me a new pair to the wrong address mind you . so decided to buy from someplace else . just got the new shears and am sending them back but i have tonpay thenshipping on their crap ... ... i 'm through with ryans and there 's obnoxious shit ... .	3904
1	awesome company ! very friendly and easy ! john helped me and was extremely professional . a great experience , very thorough with the process and all policies . very happy with my choice here !	3383
0	i went to return a item that is defective i brought it in august .. the manager there was soo rude i mean really rude .. not only i will never go back because i did n't buy the extender warranty , now i found out that they only can stand behind any item for 15days .. come on its best buy ..	3192
1	went there for the first time tonight for dinner . had one of there salads and their regular fries . amazing dinner , i will return	1269
1	earl sandwich ! for the price and the quality i always got ta grab me a sandwich if i see one near by . my favorite sandwich here is the earls club , which is really good with ketchup cuz i love ketchup !	432
1	i have been a member for 5 years now , i signed up at a different location actually - but this one is closest to me so i come here most of the time . never had any issues with scheduling appointment , i guess they get booked up fast on weekends , which makes sense - so if you are trying to get a massage sat/sun , give them a call a few days ahead . i usually go on weekdays - never any issues with same day scheduling .	1950
0	this place is over price and massage is not quality , , i have been to a lot of chinese foot massage this is one of my least favorite , , , not coming here a lot of better options	2399
1	my beagle was so dirty after staying with my in laws for a week . i called furry friends and asked if they had any same day openings . they fit my dog in and i was blown away with how nice and clean the atmosphere was and how extremely friendly the people were that worked there . my beagle was cleaned beautifully and she smelled so great ! i ca n't believe i was paying other grooming facilities and picking up a dog that smelled like wet dog . this place is wonderful and so worth the $ 30 to groom my dog . five stars all the way , i will be returning monthly . you will not be disappointed .	3615
0	okay this review is about the pizza first of all $ 25 is to much for a nasty ass pizza cover in sun dried tomatoes omg the worst pizza ever	192
1	our family loves this place . we go here for most of our family events and order the pupu platter . the kids love to put everything over the flame !	237
1	this is a good theater . they usually have a nice selection and often show independent films . i like their vip seating area . the reason that i gave a 4/5 is because their menu for vip seating leaves much to be desired . the menu is basically just a bunch of panini 's that are n't that different from each other . mine was okay -- -super cheesy -- -felt like i was eating a $ 12 grilled cheese . ipics has a better food selection . this theater is the closed theater with vip seating and dinner service during the movie to my condo so i am there frequently and do consistently enjoy myself : ) i just wish their food was better !	2486
0	do n't buy cupcakes from here ! i live in the area and walk my dog past here very often . full disclosure , i did not buy anything from here and my review is solely based on what i observed . i walked into the shop to look at the cupcakes but the employee was on the phone . she was on the phone for a while - long past my patience to wait for a cupcake so i left . on my way out i noticed a lot of ants crawling around on the front display cupcakes . not sure if those are for sale but i sure hope not ! i was sooooo glad i did n't buy anything at the end .	3539
0	do n't judge a place by its looks ... and let me tell you , i did n't ! i took my fellow yelper 's advice and tried wo fat . and the verdict is ... it 's no bueno . maybe i 'm spoiled from growing up in taiwan and lived in southern california for 5 years ... but this place just was n't very special . we ordered several dishes to go ... 5 to be exact . and i have to say none of them were too good . the waitress was n't too friendly either ... nothing special here .	1103
0	while the food was acceptable the attitude from the manager ( brown hair girl with a bun ) was not ! no smiles from any employees and actually heard a sigh and saw her roll her eyes when we asked to add to our order . the owner may want to rethink who they employ and the way they represent their company .	1528
1	this has become my new place to play pool . they have 9 9ft table , which is the only way to play . the best thing was how inexpensive it was . the music was one of the highlights of the night . it went from kenny g to mick jager to barry manilow to gangster rap to rebellion rock and on and on . there was no jukebox so i have no idea how it was that eclectic . there is a 75 cent charge with a credit card , so be sure to open a tab .	3674
1	5th year of going to this gym . the prices have gone up slightly but the classes have gotten better . great service and great personal trainers .	392
1	came in for breakfast and very surprised at what came out . if ever in the s. o. m. center area comes to this steak n shake it was very good .	221
1	great and fast service . i go here every other day and never had a problem with my order or any employee . line in the morning can go crazy but always fast .	2849
0	we gave it a try after passing it for years . i ordered a ham and cheese omelet . it was the saltiest omelet ever in the entire world ! everything else in our breakfast was nothing short of mediocre .	531
1	walks in and ordered a dozen bagels sliced with a couple of things of cream cheese . i love that quick and speedy service . my family and i will enjoy these bagels on our way to cedar point .	960
1	cheryl was great , clinic is very clean and organized . down 22 lbs ! they do a great job keeping you on track with your diet ! !	2168
1	drive thru is a plus but be prepared to wait.. also if you like soy sauce or chili paste , make sure you ask for a certain amount . if you say `` a lot '' because you know that you alone will eat 20 packets , they will only give 3 .	1342
0	came into this place for an oil change as its near my house . the sign says 9.99 oil change grand opening special . they tried charging me more and gave me some bs excuse as using my own oil would cost them more money . then the guy tried to change his story and say i needed a coupon when their sign clearly has no fine print . avoid this place unless you like dishonest places that will try and upsell you .	3488
0	service here was absolutely horrible . after 15 minutes , we got up and retrieved menus ourselves , and after 20 , we had to flag a server down to bring us water . the restaurant was probably about 60 % full with plenty of staff and servers . they were out of chips and several other menu items , so we could n't order their famous salsa . food was fine , but they brought my soup out with my meal instead of beforehand ( i asked for it as a starter ) . jamaican jerk sauce was good , but the consistency of the tofu was n't good . i will not return for a long time , except maybe for take out .	1358
0	i purchased some premixed juices at 12 mg nicotine and i knew something was very wrong- i had to continually hit my kit and never felt the nicotine ever . long story short they were not 12 mg nicotine not even close ! ! ! when i put some 6mg in my tank leftover from another store and took a couple of hits i finally got the satisfied nic hit that was missing for the red star garbage ! buy at your own risk ! ! !	1747
1	everything you want in a lively lunch spot and after work bar . the staff clearly understand the typical lunchtime crowd and brought our food and drinks out in record time . i had the warm bean and salmon salad , my colleagues had the moroccan chicken salad , and the grilled mac and cheese . my salmon was slightly fishy but otherwise the dish was good . all servers were young , professional and experienced . bathrooms were clean . $ 11 beer stein was the equivalent of 2 pints . good value . i 'd go back again .	670
1	i was guessing whether or not a watch was worth what the person was asking . so stopped in this store since specialize in citizen high end watches and wanted to make sure that it worked like it should and such . the owner of the store was very polite and looked the watch over for me and cleaned it it appeared . he took his time with my asking all kinds of questions and such . in the end he did not charge me and was browsing while he was doing watch stuff and there prices are really reasonable and very friendly and helpful .	2307
1	when the orleans used to send me food comps that would all get used here . they have a great chicken and braukly for $ 10 that really is filling and tastes great .	1196
0	please advise if this company /location is still up and running . called the number nothing , no website , no facebook . they go and take my money with having me buy one of their certificates while i was there not long ago and then nothing . please advise . trying to find the pop art your pet again .	3048
0	not at all impressed with the gilbert office on mercy . not kid friendly or cozy environment- especially waiting room . md mckenna not touchy feeling ( maybe a bad day ? ) and made us wait 25 min in the room until she came in . come on , it 's a pediatric office- you know kids cant wait that long . then spent under 10 min with us . chandler office is a better environment . np was very helpful and nice . a lot better service and attention .	1723
0	ok , so flan ? no thanks - i 'll stick to pizza . the beer 's ok , but you can get ok beer anywhere .	670
1	very friendly staff and manager . efficient and not pushy to replace filters , etc . that do n't need replaced .	3519
1	i would highly recommend ace appliance repair . the staff is very friendly and helpful . joe ( the repairman ) could n't be any nicer and took a lot of time explaining what needed to be done . i 've dealt with other repairmen in the past , and joe is the best .	395
0	be careful with this place - they are super expensive to begin with and will try to up sell you . check your receipt : i agreed to a wash and clean for $ 39.95 and they charged my card $ 79.95 . when i caught it and confronted them about it they lied and told me i was the o e who was wrong . $ 80 to run it through an automated wash and have someone do a quick vacuum , wipe down and window cleaning ? i do n't think so . they lost me as a customer - buyer beware !	3899
0	pretty sad . showed up 20 min before closing and planned on getting the food to go . good thing because they gave us 0 say in the matter . nachos had movie theatre style cheese on them and a spoon full of retried beans . terrible . all the carne was burnt ( 3 vampiros , 4 street tacos ) , the burrito was cold and stuffed with sour cream and refried beans . when we could find a piece of carne it was burnt . pretty bad experience and kind of upset i blew $ 22 here especially after seeing the 4.5 star total .	593
1	am a huge fan of this eatery ! ! ! the owners hit the jackpot when they brought chef holly in from ticoz . my very favorite thing on the menu is the blackened tilapia ceaser ... .. amazing ! all the street tacos are deeelish ... ... especially the pernil pork and chicken ! the chips are not too greasy or salty and the salsa is roasted and exploding with flavor . i am always blown away by the service and love the atmosphere ! it 's already a good value for dining but you can get promotions if you are on living social or groupon .	1317
1	i come here for dr. schroeder he performed surgery in 2014 and did an amazing job and now i check in for maintenance . there 's a surgery center attached which is convenient sometimes there 's a bit of a wait but there are several physicians here . schroeder takes him with his patients and he is worth the wait .	737
0	absolutely the worst customer service center i have ever dealt with . the associate sandra was condescending and very rude . as for the other associates . the one supervisor they had trying to look up the transaction did n't even communicate with me that they could not locate the transaction via the date and card number and just walked off . a gentleman by the name of dave was the only positive experience . listening to the conversations employees were having with themselves as well as the way they were treating other customers has definitely put me off from ever shopping here again . this place keeps getting worse .	2443
0	even though i 'm only rating this bank 2 stars the employees in the bank are really nice and friendly , i have no problem with the customer service . but i come in this bank about 3 to 5 times a week and there is always a line where i have to wait 10 to 20 minutes at a time because it 's only an average of 2 cashiers working at anytime . you need more cashiers is all anybody can ask , i have seen several customers frustrated at this location because of this .	20
1	absolutely first rate health care treatment and the staff is likewise top notch . dr. elizabeth rostan is extremely knowledgeable about procedures and products , and offers very wise and helpful advice . i would not go anywhere else .	2430
1	this place is amazing . if you 're wanting and needing healthy eats , this is your place . they 're always busy and everything is great ! this is our go to for take-out . thank you noodles ranch for consistently being amazing . eat here today !	205
0	decided to go here today for lunch after they switched their menu to all you can eat and i was highly disappointed . to start off , we did get greeted to our table right away however they did not ask if we wanted tea , water or anything to drink we had to ask them . another thing was the staff here seem mad when you ask them for something . overall food is sub par , service is terrible . would not recommend going .	516
0	i was so excited to try emerson fry bread at our pre-booked staff event . we went outside at noon at their scheduled time to wait for the truck and they did n't show up . we called them to check in they just said , `` all we can do is say sorry , '' without any option of re-booking or offering to re-schedule . they said they were double booked and chose to go to the other place because there would be more people there - they did n't even tell us ! horrible customer service - i would not rely on this company to book any event , as they might just not show up and not warn you . : (	2937
1	i went in with a large group and we were seated promptly and received really good service . we all received our food at about the same time as well . clean restaurant .	672
1	very clean , easy navigation from the airport . friendly and courteous staff . had dinner at the hotel restaurant , johnathan gave great service . food was delicious ! great atmosphere . staying here again	3503
1	dr zedek is an awesome dr i 've been going to him for almost two years the staff is very friendly robin is my favorite . when i call she know me by my voice lol . love coming here i feel comfortable and at home .	3928
0	would not recommend . customer service awful . overpriced and they changed price even though i had a reservation with a quoted price ! maybe i arrived on 2 bad days but i will not use this lot again .	2531
0	this was my first time at massage envy . i came here for an arm injury since i was n't able to see my amazing chiropractor in california . i went with specific instructions from my chiro on the type of massage and specific areas the masseuse to work on . i choose massage envy because its a chain so i figured it would be professional establishment . translation , not a sketchy massage parlor . the introductory price was another bonus . you could tell the masseuse was fairly inexperienced . the massage was pretty generic . i probably would n't return . be prepared for the member spew when trying to pay for the one visit .	2252
0	this is the worse office . i spoke to several people on the phone in regard to canceling my insurance . i was told i would need to come to the office and sign forms . the telephone call was not good enough . i went to another office and explained my situation and they knew nothing about the other offices policy to have someone sign a form to cancel a policy . the way i was treated on the phone was rude and unprofessional . i would stay away from this office	2675
1	this place is great ! lots of choices and refills are discounted ! started our `` mall rat '' experience with a blue lemonade ( bf had plain margarita and loved it ) . well with the souvenir cup price . if you 're at planet hollywood go to miracle mile jist for alcohol .	2528
0	it seems like the products are made poorly . i do n't care what the suggested retail price is compared to what you are selling . the staff is usually to busy talking to help you and the customer service desk is not very knowledgeable of their products . i do n't think i will be going back .	3896
0	yogurt is watery and expensive . fro-yo should be much thicker than this . it should n't be a liquid 5 minutes after you start eating it . the only upside is that they offer the usual samples along with a loyalty program .	288
1	i bought 2018 vw tiguan from this dealership , it was great luck for me to meet peter who sell the car . he did understand my budget and i could see his effort to give me a great offer by persuading his boss .	2997
0	this waiting room is by far the worst i 've ever been to . staff is rude and has attitude , personal questions are asked loudly ( social security , personal information ) . i even heard staff ask a young woman loudly if she 's ever had any abortions or miscarriages . waiting times are extremely long . charged 150 for a consultation to show the doctor results i already knew the recommendation for ... . horrible experience . never ever ever go to becky gonzales . how she completed medical school i do n't know-she gave me incorrect information and was rude . no bedside manner . switched to dr knapp-so far other than the aforementioned she has been ok .	3059
0	i was very upset with my visit to red star vapor yesterday night . i wanted to buy one new coil and the shop clerk informed me that i must buy five , that they do not sell singles anymore . if there 's a sale to be made you make it	1747
1	i love this target . i just do . they 're nice and it 's comvienant and always easy to shop . we come here too often . would never review a target but wanted too bc they 're so nice .	1626
0	an average drink with an average meal . i may as well stay in airdrie and eat at the toad .	547
1	for the price point this one 's a keeper , especially for business travel . the location is great because you can walk over to a variety of restaurants and to the ayrsley grand cinemas to catch a movie . there is a free business center where you can use their computers and print your boarding pass , a modest gym and plenty of free parking . my room was clean , with a comfy bed and bedding , a keurig in-room coffee maker ( bring along your favorite k-cups ) and a mini fridge .	3289
0	very bad service we buy 4 vip tickets 75 $ each ticket include drinks and after they ask us to pay more for the drinks after we inside if u want do it over there think about that again	2245
0	i agree with the other poster , dr. rostan has a non-existent bedside manner . she is very abrupt , barely listening to you or explaining what she 's doing . i expect much more from a dermatologist when i 'm spenging $ 500+ on treatment .	2430
0	i 'm baffled by some of these great reviews . it makes me wonder whether those that gave such high reviews for this place have ever visited aquariums in different cities . i 'm a chicago native who has been in cleveland for a few years now and this museum is beyond disappointing . it 's dull and gloomy , not much to see , and just so old . needs a good renovation along with much more aquatic animals . way over priced for what you get .	706
1	great place for takeout just drive up . love their fish and wings . everything is so fresh . service was wonderful	1487
0	terrible terrible service . the asian gentlemen in the front is very rude no customer service skills i was looking and planning to spend a couple hundred dollars on hair wefts and because of his attitude i did not spend a dollar in there and will never go back . definitely going to another hair store in las vegas .	2826
0	服务态度差，其他人都挺好，就是前台的中国女人，叫sara，其服务态度尤其恶劣，自己不想说就说找主任和我聊，而她的主任就是她同等级前台同事而已，而且她同事不懂中文，以为我不会英文而欺负我老婆英文不好，真是可恶至极。	1788
1	habib has done dozens of pieces for me , and i am very happy with each one . he never hesitates to ask if anything needs to be changes after he has altered a piece . in fact , several times i have asked for small changes after his first alteration ( more for my own comfort , it still looked great ) and he has n't even charged me . all i can say is , habib wants his customers to be 100 % satisfied with the work that he does . it all comes down to communicating what you want . pieces completed for me : 1 full suit 1 blazer 7 dress shirts 3 pairs of pants 3 pairs of shorts	3391
1	seriously amazing ! this place is my biggest guilty pleasure . the cookies are so so soft and if you are gluten free/vegan they have cookies for you too that are surprisingly so moist and gooey . the customer service is excellent as well ! the only downfall is that they are closed during the day and monday-wednesday . i do n't like sweets usually but i am kind of addicted to these guys ! !	1522
0	after half an hour waiting for someone to take our order of an oven and a dishwasher , an employee tells me that it is my choice to bring my business elsewhere when i complain about the lack of help .	124
0	usuaully a 4 star+ , but the swordfish came out way to watery and the creamed corn was a mess , oil all over the plate too .	487
0	how this place is even still open amazes me . last 3 times we 've came here , restaurant is almost completely empty , with only 1 or 2 other tables being used . tonight we went there same thing , sat through the entire dinner with empty drinks , as the one waiter was fast walking by us over and over , used to love this place , but we wo n't be back	1116
1	i have been going here for years and franks never let me down . honest with fair prices what more can you ask for ? give frank a shot he is a few steps above the rest ! !	2318
1	while i 'm not a big sports fanatic , my bf is . they have everything from clothing , to keychains to stuffed animals etc . we come to this store for his favorite teams ' shirts and have always been lucky to find the sizes we need . the associates have been helpful and are not pushy at all . my bf always ends up having a full blown conversation with an employee about some sport related thing that i have no idea about . they offer 10 % off your purchase if you check in on yelp . i 'd definitely recommend this place if you are looking for sports gear at a competitive price !	871
1	just purchased some tires at the costco on hayden . rene the service manager is an excellent employee . great patience and knowledge . costco can not do any better than him .	1102
0	i honestly do n't even need to write a review . just look at the ones already written . completely speaks for itself . this establishment , if you will , is ran on disrespect , anger and lack of common sense . to sum up their attitudes.. they treat you as if they just found out their entire staff got untreatable chlamydia and they ca n't quit their job . ‍ if you wan na cry and ca n't get it out , just come down to the cranky chlamydia carnival and get checked out !	1925
1	no hassle membership sign up , gym is decent size , lots of machines but needs more workout benches . dry/wet sauna was the selling point for me .	1704
1	love love tahoe springs . been with them for five years . love my delivery driver . and i found out customers can custom order water bottle labels ! i 'm in love ! totally recommend this company .	2519
0	lamonica can straighten hair well . however , she is not the best at blowing and neither are her employees . after having my hair blow dried my ends were broken off . my ends were not previously split bc i 'd recently had them trimmed . i tried to talk to the owner about the issue but she defended the stylist poor techniques . i 've known others to go this salon and not be pleased by the outcome . i will not return .	3660
1	i 'll keep it short : awesome atmosphere , inexpensive drinks , cheap tickets to see great live music . all around a cool venue and a great time . i ca n't wait to go back !	225
1	it 's a must to see for every fitness freak ! at the time i counted 84 treadmills - taking into consideration they are just a fragment of the equipment they have everybody can imagine how big it is . free weights and machines from the american top brands will make not only your myocard muscle happy . climbing wall , basketball court , stretching zone with the stretching machines , inside+outside pool and relax zone are then the big cherry on the huge cake .	2762
