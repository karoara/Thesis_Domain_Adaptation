0	i 've been sitting in line for 20 minutes and guess what ? it 's like this every single time ! the pharmacists are rude and had me posted on a dea watch list because i was `` shopping '' for pain medication . no one bothered to call either my doctor or dentist they just saw that i had 2 prescriptions for pain medication and reported me to the dea . my medication refills every month and it always has to be brought in from another pharmacy requiring me to wait 2-4 days sometimes without any medication whatsoever . they never pick up the phone and when they do sometimes they just hang it up to shake the call .	3937
1	came with a group of 6 people . sam accommodated us very well ! the staff was great and very focused on pleasing us . we had one butthole in the group . we would like to apologize for his behavior . the staff did n't kick us out like we expected due to his behavior . the rooms are clean and the space is reasonable . they definitely have strong hands and great customer service . thanks again ! oh they have groupons but sam works a deal for you if you call in advance .	2320
0	this company highly inflates prices and overcharges for their services . the tech that came out , brian , was friendly and completed my garage door spring replacement in about 40 minutes and did a great job . the issue is the price . $ 635 was insane for at most $ 150 in parts and 40 minutes of labor . after looking into this company it appears to be a common practice and there are reports of them operating under different business names . would highly not recommend .	1699
1	great service , they take care of me every time i come in here . the check out girls are sweet as well ! my new car wash spot ! ! !	3250
1	marigold maison is a wonderful spot for indian food ! the vibe of the restaurant is so fresh , yet their food is traditional and delicious . for appetizers we had the seated eggplant and seared tofu which were both great and came with tamarind sauce ! for our main entree my family shared lentil soup , chicken biryani , chicken tikka masala , roti , and garlic naan ! unfortunately , all of the desserts had nuts in them so i could n't eat anything , but the chef made an exception and made us a crepe with chocolate and berries ! that was so great of him and the staff ! i will definitely return and i ca n't wait to eat there again !	640
0	horrible horrible experience and service . stay away from brian and sarah . long story as well but wow , that sucked ... .	3551
0	horrible , horrible experience ! i made an advance appointment for my husband to get a pedicure . the pedicure lasted only 15 minutes . the girl was setting up other pedicure tubs while giving him his 15 minute unskilled pedicure . shame , shame on golden nail lounge for treating an elderly man in such a disrespectful way . we live close and it would have been nice to be able to come here on a regular basis .	1654
0	the pharmacy could use some updates . the counter are crumbling . the store is kind of dirty . pharmacy person look tired and stressed out . could probably use some more staffing .	3816
1	$ 1 craps ? okay . you got me . do n't expect top of the line luxury , you can head over to the strip for that . come here for fun , and win or lose , a good time . ample parking , but i do wish the parking lot was lit a bit more - every now & then we do a quick dash to the car , dive in and peel out , but you can also ask for a security escort to your vehicle like normal people , haha . $ 0.15 minimum bet on slots if you want some free booze , so you really ca n't complain .	3580
1	minute clinic inside cvs was great ! i went in for tetanus shot . by the time i finished sighing in my name was called . ( this was around 1:00 on a wednesday ) my np jessica anderson , was friendly , professional , seemed extremely competent , and gave me a basically painless shot ! i would recommend ! !	70
1	very friendly and knowledgeable staff . lucky to have this place a few blocks away . novice or expert , you ca n't go wrong . also very close to clark county shooting range . thanks guys !	2247
0	the pizza is as bad as little caesar 's and much more expensive . this was the first time i ordered from here and waited 1hr 20min to luke warm pizza.. would not recommend to anyone who is hungry , does n't have time , enjoys good pizza , or needs food to feed their pet .	954
1	this place is amazing ! ! great service , very friendly staff and knows what 's good here .. plus they are very eco friendly big plus for me	580
0	the george morse agency is a unprofessional mess of a insurance agency . not only do they not know what they are do they also do n't know how to provide customer service standards at all . we had a policy started with them and never once received any documents from them . all 3 times i called to update my address and to find out where my insurance documents were and never got it fixed or documents . i cancelled policies with them and went to met life and could n't be any happier . think twice before walking into this office and if you do walk into the office you 'll see how ghetto and poorly ran it looks inside and out .	727
0	this used to be my go to nail salon until both of my big toes were infected . i had to go on antibiotics and they were so inflamed walking for a week was very challenging . i actually had to pay for this pedicure too , will not be returning to this place ever again .	2148
1	rented from mcquarter 's realty for 1 year , and will continue to rent an additional year until i graduate . no realty company is perfect , however all of my experiences with mcquarter 's realty have been positive thus far . definitely much improved from my landlords from the past . very friendly staff and the maintenance guy for my apartment , rob , is fast and dependable when issues arise .	3852
0	ripped off ... ..i had two air leak near at side wall tire they ca n't fix it . i asked them for a used tire and he quote me a used tire for $ 20 so after their done installing my tire . i was paying $ 20 to that guy who fix it he was asking $ 40 not $ 20 . i almost change my mind to tell them to put back the old tire .	88
1	best russian food store in vegas . too tempting for someone who grew up with that food )	541
0	walked in at 5:30pm on a thursday night . not busy at all ; asked bartender if we could sit wherever , said yes . we sat there in a booth for fifteen minutes ! no one came by ever and we were right in view of the bar ! we ended up walking out ! we always go to the madison location and thought we 'd try this one since we enjoy their food and service . sun prairie location= never again .	1519
1	magic mike , eat your heart out . these boys can dance ! ! ! take your bachelorettes here , ladies . they 'll hate you for a minute , but love you for the rest of their lives .	5
0	went 03/01 around 8 o'clock at their craig rd location in las vegas . order zucchini fries and was very disappointed to find a top layer of about 10 zucchini 's and the rest little fried pieces of chicken . usually when eating there everything is fresh and done correctly but this is just unacceptable .	998
1	i really love this store ! this pet store really cares about customer service to the fullest . i was interested in a certain flavor of nature 's variety in the medium size bag and they only had lamb and oatmeal in the smaller bag . because they pride themselves on customer service they discounted the smaller bag for me because of the inconvenience and ordered me the medium bag that they are also giving me a discount on . i think that is awesome ! they also donate any returned bags of food the the animal shelter and i think that is pretty amazing : )	1775
0	wifi is such shit here . i ca n't imagine what they charge conventions but it does n't work worth a damn with congestion .	587
1	for the prices they charge , the food , drinks and the service is great . chairs and tables could use some replacement as they are kinda broken and starting to look kinda soiled with all the years of use , but hey , you get what you pay for .	2718
0	this guy could n't have been more rude ! i barely got a sentence out about an issue at a rental property and he said he does n't do commercial and hung up on me ! wow ! fyi mark 's reddi rooter saved the day and super cheap . they also act like they want your business ! 608-241-2382	1825
0	this is the worst peter piper pizza to go to . the general manager aaron lilienthal is the worst employee there . i have gone to this peter piper for years and then he kicks me out for winning other people jackpots which is bs . the employees are not friendly and the pizza they make they always cover the crust . they get the orders wrong and that have absolutely no respect . aaron lilienthal is the worst manager you will ever see at any restaurant ! !	1283
0	as rude and as helpless as it gets . employees ca n't wait to say no ca n't help and plain ol rude towards you . biggest problem of these stores around town are their low level employees , they get a flat-pay rate and they 've been there so long that they want to do a minimal amount of assistance to get you off their counter . asked 4 questions and all 4 were `` no '' . browsed around the store and found answers myself . when they saw they were wrong they got all defensive and cocky	2502
1	i came out of town for a military ball . i sat with a wonderful women named vu . she is so gentle , when she filed down the nails she held my nail in place to help m minimize any pressure to the nail bed . i wish she lived in my state ! she 's so funny too , i had i great time sitting with her . thank you vu ! i hope to see you again ! the place was so clean and pretty ! staff was nice . vu is my favorite ! ! ! thank you again vu ! !	2686
0	someone fucked my kids hair looks like a damn bowl cut . do your barbers not know what a taper is ? or a damn line up ? ridiculous . if you guys ca n't do kids hair then just be straight forward about it . it 's simple . we went to a real barber to get t fixed , he even laughed . thanks for the experience	3574
0	terrible ! my sister came here to get her eyelashes removed and taylor picked her hair off of her head and she told my sister she was heavily infested with head lice . we were terrified ! we hurried and went to hair fairies down the road on providence and the hair fairies lady did a head lice screening and come to find out , she does n't have lice ! ! ! lash and beauty co said she knew what head lice were since she was an `` esthetician '' and she knew what head lice had looked like .	3716
1	good food for a good price . their menu is huge . lots to choose from . sadly they did n't have any congee . but they have hong kong style noodles , rice , soup and snacks . you can go there for a light meal or to stuff yourself at a decent price .	464
1	not sure why there are so many bad reviews on this place . we tried it a couple weeks ago and thought the food was delicious , the portions very generous , and the staff very nice ! my only complaint was i got the wrap in pita bread instead of the laffa bread - the laffa bread is delicious .	89
0	i have had their smoothies before and loved them . however , we went today for lunch and i was very disappointed . i got the turkey bacon avocado wrap . the spinach wrap itself was very good but the turkey was rubbery . it came with american cheese which was the same consistency as kraft singles and the bacon was more like a slice of ham ( rubbery as well ) . the soup was pretty good , but we were told it was a mexican tortilla but it was a veggie minestrone .	1401
0	this is point blank the worst starbucks i 've ever been to . worst customer service acting like i 'm stupid for not knowing that they could n't warm up my muffin for me , and my white chocolate mocha does n't even taste like they put the syrup in it , and when i asked for them to redo it they said i 'd have to buy another . do not come here , at least till starbucks fires these guys and hires some competent and kind employees .	3690
1	best virtual reality place i 've been to . only been here twice but i 've tried a few other virtual reality places and this in my opinion was the best . it has a whole room to move around in and when you get too close to the person you 're playing with it actually pauses the game and alerts you . you also have someone talking you through it . i loved it and would definitely go back over and over . a bit pricey but totally worth it !	2494
0	had lunch there today with my daughter , there was us and another table of people in the place . my daughter ordered the rotisserie chicken which was dry and not that good . i had the chicken and dumplings which were ok , but not great . we ordered the roasted vegetables and which were a mismash of strange vegetables which i 'm pretty sure were steamed not roasted . i would not recommend this place to any one .	254
0	i went in with a rash on my hand . they informed me they 've never seen anything like it , and gave me a cream for another rash that was not similar . i went to two other dermatologists after this , and both immediately recognized it and were able to prescribe me the appropriate medication . not helpful and could have continued to be a problem if i did n't get it checked by another place .	2526
1	i almost never write reviews but this place was so great i had to ! sharon is so sweet and very knowledgeable . she recommended the deep pore cleansing facial after examining my skin , and i loved it ! my skin has been congested/dehydrated from long hours at work and stress , but after the facial , it felt completely clean , and the smoothest i can remember my face ever feeling ! not to mention it was super relaxing with a little massage thrown in and a really cute space that was clean and cozy : ) i will definitely be back ! !	2647
0	ns nails and spa is a joke and they misled me on their prices . i would never go back . they treat you horrible and act like you are putting them out . worst customer service ever ! ! ! ! ! i do n't like to write bad reviews but i just want to spare someone . save your money ; get a manicure/pedicure somewhere else .	854
0	i 'm only giving 2 stars because a few people work there are awesome ! management sucks ! i did an exchange yesterday , 1 pair of panties the wrong size , and went to the pink section the look at leggings and left my exchange in the area somewhere and the stores claims they did n't found it ... so basically paid for underwear i 'll never get ! i 'm a angel card holder also , i 'll be paying that off and closing the account , sucks cuz i love their bras and underwear but customer service is everything to me .	3101
0	lisa is the most disrespectful and unprofessional bartender that i 've ever met i was born and raised in las vegas nevada and have never been treated so poorly after gambling $ 300 . i asked for the owners information she refused to give it to me . i 'm absolutely embarrassed for her and for the company that she works for someone like that should never be employed in a place where new customers come and will never go again .	1434
0	do not order from this place ! ! we made the mistake of ordering delivery from tony 's . it took them an hour and a half to deliver . when i called , their reasoning was that they had 15 orders , they were busy and that i could take my business elsewhere . i most definitely will ! not to mention , the pizza that came was cold on delivery . never again !	459
1	reasonably priced , great customer service , convenient hours of access , and kept my stuff safe and secure during the three years i rented from them . next time i need to store my things , i will definitely use them .	3141
0	good luck getting a follow up from this place . i went and got a second opinion on a back issue from another doctor and all of a sudden dr. kody smith and team cancelled my blood pressure meds , stating i was no longer a patient . now i permanently moved doctors and could n't be happier . the new dr. is actually completing tests to find out the problem . there are plenty of options and it seems this place has enough business that they do n't need to treat people right .	590
0	within days the fountain had calcium stains from water leaching right through the concrete basin . without seeing it , they said it was due to `` las vegas water '' . they promised someone would call the next day but , no one did . worse yet , they said because they gave a discount , no returns . so if you spend $ 1,700 on a defective fountain , be prepared for little baja to use this loophole . is this how an ethical business treats its customers ?	1987
0	edit : i just got my hair cut and the lady who cut it i guess does n't know how to cut hair . you can tell it 's one of those i 'm here but do n't want to be here type of job for her . it sucks cause now my hair is shorter and chunky on one side . it 's so uneven and sections of my right side have different chunky lengths . idk if she was on drugs . if you go here , make sure to ask for cici cause she 's damn good . do n't make the same mistake i did . i uploaded pictures of my cut , look at it before u go	33
1	great special . can be very busy on a nice day on the weekend . all the food has been good so far . beer specials are good too b	630
0	this is a scam ! nexus applications are $ 50usd and these guys charged me $ 320usd for an `` expedited '' application which does n't exist in the eyes of the cbsa or cbp . it 's a total cash grab on unsuspecting citizens !	2698
1	i 've been a fan of green grotto since going to the one in markham . the interior is very cozy and is a good spot to sit with friends . at night it can get very busy and hard to find a seat ( especially weekend nights ) . i always order their hokkaido milk tea . its delicious ! they also give a small complimentary bucket of popcorn when you sit in . they have free wifi which is good if you want to sit in with your laptop . my friends and i have been coming quite a bit and will continue you to come back !	344
0	wow , so disappointed . i 'm from nc and these are not good hot dogs for the money . my hot dog was burnt and the chili had no flavor . the only thing saving it from getting a 1 star is the lemonade and cole slaw . the onion rings are so spicy that i ca n't taste the sweetness of the onion . very sad . could have been an off night but not sure i will try again .	58
0	estaba buscando un club latino para bailar y disfrutar y pensé que acá sería el lugar pero la verdad el dj de este lugar no sabe lo que es ser dj es muy malo ! deberían conseguir un buen dj	849
0	i 've been here multiple times to pick up pizza and it 's a very frustrating process . the workers who take the pizza off the oven do n't call out numbers or names therefor nobody knows when their pizza is ready . this causes customers to get very angry and crowd the window which then frustrates the workers causing them to give the customers attitude . it 's a simple communication fix .	3884
1	was quoted a wait time of 2+ hours for care . i only waited about an hour though . once i was able to be seen , i was out in a jiffy . friendly and efficient professional staff .	2058
0	they never showed up for the appointment . dont ever use them ! ! ! when i called at 430 ( the latest they were supposed to contact me ) seemed like they forgot . then 15 min later i get a call saying they will be 10 min late . 20 min late still not here . they offered a free job but i would probably be waiting for that too . moving on to a different company .	1273
1	good coffee spot inside gvr . the service is fast and friendly and the coffee is always made just right .	2118
1	awesome ! really good quality food and tea , which i love , but what makes this place stand out so much is how lovely all the people who work here are , when i am on queen and need a tea , i will always go here over any other coffee shop in the area because the people are always so sweet . they go above and beyond in friendliness and making you feel wanted here , love it so much , thanks guys : )	3684
0	bought a groupon for $ 50 3 visits including x-rays -- - they took x-rays the first visit .. no adjustment or pain relief what do ever ! ! ! on second visit dr luzod sat me down to tell me i would need surgery or would need to pay upfront $ 3800 for office visits 5 x a week ! ! ! bunch of crazy quacks ! ! ! avoid this place .. i was never adjusted ever .. just sales pitches until i just stood up and left ! fully taken advantage of -- scam ! ! ! ! !	693
0	was up to order and the rude asian bartender told me `` you want that ? i mean ... i could make it for you , but you 're at a cocktail bar `` i told him not to trouble himself and i 'd go somewhere else and just let my friend order . she got a weak drink that was $ 18 , could n't taste the jameson at all . we were n't happy . reminded me of why i do n't go to places like this . bartenders are rude and drinks are overpriced for watered down drinks .	2513
0	one job guys . u make waffles and bfest crap . its super simple ! ! ! ! why isnt your entire menu on grub hub ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? called to place the order instead , but i cant trust that because you forgot part of my order last time . even tho you repeated it over the phone . its not rocket science !	580
0	we did not stay here ... thank goodness ! it is crowded and hot and loud and a drunk group of travelers . we came to visit the vue bar . the outside patio is small with very few tables . however , if you can snag a table over looking the freemont street it is a great place for a $ 3.25 cocktail . we did stay and play some penny slots . came out even and had fun for a few minutes . would not go out of my way in the least to visit this hotel or casino .	2500
1	every encounter i have had here , whether dine-in/take-out , has always been pleasant . the food is excellent . dining-in is a great experience as this place is very tranquil and has beautiful decor . i love the food . it 's always delicious and they are n't stingy with it !	895
1	if the next time i come and eric is not the manager , i will be extremely disappointed ! not only does eric provide the greatest customer service i 've seen in vegas , it also the greatest customer service i have had ever ! the food , the pizza is amazing and their calzone is to die for ! if the owner of voodoo pizza is reading this , thank you for having a great restaurant , and thank you for having a great employee like eric !	543
1	this store is amazing . it has everything you would ever need for your backyard and the customer service is excellent ! ! i would recommend this store to everyone .	1024
0	very low quality breakfast . not sure how this place averages so many stars . i would rather make this breakfast in like 10 minutes at home .	1499
1	my nail tech was super friendly and easy to talk to . very conversational . i think her name was hylie ... just got a simple gel polish change but they look good ! i will definitely be back	1256
1	if you are looking for a company that know how to do the job , please call this one , they came out the same day at a time that was convenient for me and wrote an estimate . yes they did finished on time and nice and clean .	3913
0	slow and unorganized service . drinks were still good . overall , markham ones are so much better .	344
0	went for dinner and ordered pho combo . the soup was good , but the noodle was very soggy . oversoaked or leftovers . the basil looks very old , probably expired . same with the bean sprouts . i had many pho , but i have to say i was very disappointed , despite the positive reviews . never going back again . on the positive side , the server was very polite . cashier was nice and friendly .	673
1	great food - amazing selection for vegetarians , gluten intolerant , carnivores , etcetc . something for everyone . the portions are huge ! ! ! and decently priced . the only issue i had was my jacket reeked of fried food when i left ( i didnt have any fried food - just a salad ) . next time i will order takeout .	1417
0	do not lease a property managed by this company . yet another negative review about this company . their management fee which is several hundred dollars per month is in addition to the advertised rent amount . their failure to communicate and response to issues is unacceptable . i have not not reached the end of my lease yet but based on a prior review should not even expect my money returned . this is a scam	3512
0	i see a lot of good words here for paul , who probably is the owner of the company . unfortunately i had the misfortune of getting service done by matthew who works for paul . boy matthew is a person with an attitude , he thinks that the he can boss around the homeowner just like he was bossing around with his poor assistant . no manners and i will never allow him to be within 100 feet radius of my neighborhood . he will not clean after himself and just wants the homeowner to clean up his mess . paul , get rid of him before he ruins your reputation .	910
0	deuce , tell your waitresses if they wo n't acknowledge your female patrons then your female patrons wo n't return . we arrived to a semi-empty lounge at 1am and seated ourselves in the middle of the lounge . we waited and waited ... 20 minutes passed with zero services from the waitresses who were all over the other predominantly male tables . we decided to leave rather than beg for service . no thanks . never again .	456
0	very unprofessional ! ! ! ! charged be $ 650.00 for a quote/temporary a/c fix , then said i would not have to pay if i signed an expensive contract with them on the spot without getting other quotes . did not put the top back on my air conditioner after he was done with the assessment . asked the employee to look at my water tank and he said i was `` stupid '' if i got a water tank the size i currently have . fyi i have a whirlpool tub that requires a large water tank . do not use , awful experience ! ! !	1601
1	friendly staff , i think my waiter was named curtis , he was great . good food and the cooks were obviously well trained . the staff was n't afraid to make jokes and that was comforting . we felt very welcome and the taste was unparalleled .	209
1	mayra is the best nail tech i 've ever been to , period . i 've had acrylic nails off and on for the last 20 years and they 've never been this good . they do n't lift around the edges , they do n't chip or break and her attention to detail is unlike any i 've seen . she 's also personable and fun to be around ; i have found my permanent place !	1713
0	the food was okay but my experience was ruined by the employees . my waitress took forever to take our order and i would often catch her just sitting on her phone doing absolutely nothing and not even care to check up on my table .	408
0	i have been alot of places and so far this one does not carry any ak platforms or will stock them and the sad part is they do not have any knowledge of any ak platforms out there . they only carry ar platforms and accessories at most maybe this why they have no clue of any ak or maybe seen one ... p.s . i will be giving my money some where else and over price as well .	2247
0	not impressed . while turn around time is fast , and girls are friendly , the shirts are never consistent on whether they come back with lines or wrinkles still . in addition , they are n't the cheapest . i will be going elsewhere	2412
0	over price ! bought a capacitor $ 8.00 cost online and they charge me $ 51.00 . even i will ship this part overnight it will not cost me that much . shop somewhere else .	3242
1	horrible ... do n't go . good , now stay out ! sorry i just want to keep enjoying my new favorite theater in peace . serious luxury for 2 bucks more than a regular ticket . woooo ! fancy , quiet . smells like new . me likes !	3063
0	when i went to test drive a car they were inserting a new battery when i walked in because the car wouldnt start up . when i test drove it the car felt like it was going to break down	3518
0	i have tried several entrees and a wide array of the appetizers here and i would rate all of them a 2 or 3 out of 5 . my main complaint is that the chicken in all of my dishes , ( orange chicken , sweet and sour chicken , general tso 's chicken , etc ) has been rubbery , and often overcooked to the point of being hard and gross . if you want cheap chinese delivery that is edible , then i guess this place will do , but if you want your food to actually be better than `` meh '' i would n't reccommend it .	1575
1	hard to describe , other than it feels like your favorite sweater you wear around on a lazy sunday . it is a neighborhood institution , greatly managed with superb customer attention , and quirkiness . the library on the second floor boasts lounge seating , two or three tv 's , a pool table and a great selection of beers on tap and in cans/bottles ( cider too ) , free popcorn and decent food . definitely a fan !	1091
1	it 's my first time here and i 'm impressed . they serve some of the best chips and salsa i have ever tried and the food was great . most of all i enjoyed the service and atmosphere .	1094
1	liked the lunch specials , only wish i had time and appetite for the late happy hour ! friendly service . plenty of food at fair price . sit at the sushi bar to watch him make the rolls !	1196
0	their website says they play all types of music but they only play country music all night ! super confused how everyone knows how to dance to country music . maybe it 's because it 's all the club plays . drinks are cheap tho . good environment not good music , besides country .	2860
0	my dogs were groomed to pawfection by ashley but then has been inconsistent since she left to start her own shop . sometimes my pups ears would get done , sometimes anal glands , sometimes tails ... ..and sometimes not . my biggest peeve is when they ask you to drop your dog off at 730am and they are n't ready until late afternoon . that 's totally doggy torture when they 're in a kennel most of the day stressed . i prefer the places that give you an actual appointment time vs all dogs be dropped off first thing in the morning . see my other reviews to see where i am thrilled to be going now !	3389
0	this business , has no license and no insurance . they will be late , double your bill and hold your belongings hostage , and leave half your stuff at your old place , and break anything they do touch . and you will be wishing you never called . and when i called to complain , the owner , who is always changing his name , claimed to be a organ transporter in california , who just so happened to have the same az cell phone number as john , the owner , or joe black or any of his other aliases .	3159
0	went into office for cleaning . i have good insurance and they still wanted to charge $ 600 . they overbilled my insurance company and sent me a bill a year later for $ 129 even though i owed . nothing ! ! when i went into the office to complain i did n't receive an apology i received excuses which made no sense ! i 've been an accountant for 28 years they need to hire a knowledgeable . person who can be polite and know simple math . my five year old could do the job better ! definitely wo n't be back ! !	3163
0	they say they do a 29 dollar tune up but all they do is tell you wats wrong with your system . all they do is clean your coils with water . get someone else . they where there 30 mins for two units . they did a horrible job .	2203
1	we stopped in here just after getting into town . we were hungry , and it was convenient . we were impressed by the quality and quantity of food for the money . the flatbread and kebabs were excellent , and the staff was prompt and solicitous , despite a small language barrier . i suspect that we were the only native english speakers in the place , other customers included , which i consider a very good sign .	1303
1	you ca n't beat sunday all day happy hour and live music ! they also have music thursday and friday ( i think ) . i recommend going early enough to see the sunset !	751
1	knowledgable , excellent pricing , efficient for all your landscaping needs ! call these guys-you wo n't regret it ! ! !	2387
1	i absolutely love this restaurant ! it 's locally owned and i 've always had great experiences here . the portions are large and so are the coffee cups ! the servers on average are really attentive and keep the hot coffee in your cup ! i absolutely love this restaurant !	1319
0	made a reservation to the airport online , got the confirmation email which stated i 'd receive a call within 20 minutes of my pickup time . so the time comes early next morning . no call . so i called them . no answer . tried again a few minutes later . nothing . called a couple more times without an answer and i realized they were n't coming . had to call another company , discount cab , last minute and they got me to sky harbor in the nick of time . wrote an email to scottsdale cab asking what happened , and they never bothered to respond one way or another . bad business .	52
1	why does it always smell like frickin b.o . in that place ? lol ! !	426
0	this place sucks . absolutely abysmal . if you 're looking for a pasta place that does not know how to make pasta , you 're in luck ! the pasta was overcooked to the point of mushy , the sauce was watery . best part of the meal was the ice water ...	728
0	we have been bringing our dog to this location for grooming for the past couple of years and until recently had no issues . i had an appointment for today at 11:30 , brought her in on time and then was told they were very busy and it was `` going to be awhile ... .at least 5 or 6 hours '' . the last time we took her , we were angry because they had our dog for more than 7 hours ! they overbook and then your dog suffers . i expect it to be a few hours , but this is ridiculous . we will never go back to this location ... ... plenty of other groomers around .	2174
1	if you need service , talk to amber the asst . service manager ... stopped by in the am to see if i could get some remotes programmed . she had me come back in the late afternoon and got me in , even though they were busy . got to love the quick attention , even when it 's not required ! i 'll be back ! !	1910
1	amazing hotel . it 's more like a luxurious apartment than a hotel room . almost a thousand square feet , it 's very spacious . full kitchen , living room and bed room with a balcony . we were on the 15th floor and the view was amazing . the hotel is very quiet . all of the workers are professional . i liked that they have both an indoor and outdoor pool . there is only valet but it 's not $ 15 like other hotels . it 's what you wan na tip the driver . it 's only a half mile away from the strip so it 's definitely worth checking out . go to trivago.com for the best rates .	2973
1	love this place . they have such a healthy assortment of juices , smoothies , baked goods , and coffee . i highly recommend this place for a pitstop while you are shopping at scottsdale quarter !	468
0	probably the worst dining experience in all my years visiting montreal . they 're out of veal entree then ran out of cassoulet as a second choice . frisée salads arrived without blue cheese as described on menu . it took e hour and forty minutes to be served steak arrived cold . kitchen out of control . severs confused . owner clueless . just a big waste of a night . too many other good choices so do yourselves a favor and avoided this disaster .	709
1	i love this shop ! ! very knowledgeable and friendly staff . when i walked in i was immediately greeted by andrew who showed me exemplary customer service throughout my visit . they have a wide selection of juices and vape accessories and the prices are the lowest i 've found ! this is my new vape shop hands down !	1591
1	happy they built this gym ! friendly staff , clean place and awesome pool ! love how there is a wet and dry sauna . cool juice bar inside . towel service and child day care ! never seen anything like this ! lots of work out equipment	3268
0	the store is clean . i 'm just sad that when i corrected a price my item was n't free . i thought it was kroger policy . it 's directly from their twitter . i brought it up to my cashier and he said well we 're not kroger 's .	1223
1	very clean !	2563
0	worst baguettes , i could have made better croissants myself , without a recipe . back in marseilles this quality of bakery would go out of business in a paris-minute .	397
0	took our dog here for a nail clipping , wanting to support a local business , but unfortunately it felt very unprofessional . they were so quick with the job , literally less than 3 minutes . some of her nails looked more trimmed than others . when a job is done so quickly , it tends to be half arse ...	3228
1	we used alaskan to purchase 2 a/c units for 2 separate homes . they were reasonably priced and very responsive . the quotes were detailed and they stuck to their word . the installs went well starting with on-time arrivals . i would recommend them with confidence and expect they they would provide equal service and value to others .	2730
0	buyer beware ! unnecessary dealer ad ons and jacked up interest rates with their financing . these guys are crooks in a legit business . save yourself sometime and money and go to avondale nissan . i was in and out in 30 min .	394
1	atmosphere and ambiance get five stars here , but the menu needs some updating as it does not offer enough to choose from , especially if you are not a meat eater . but if you like beer there are plenty of choices .	670
1	the gas prices are n't the cheapest here -- go to pride down the street for that -- but the service is great and the establishment is very clean . all of the employees here are friendly , particularly the weekday morning crew . the station itself is easy to get in and out of ( no hard medians at this intersection ) and right across the street from a cvs which is pretty convenient . also has a bus stop right outside .	986
0	this is the worst golds gym i have ever been too . the air is dense and hot like there is no ventilation . seems very humid inside and most machines are old and starting to break causing them to not work right . i would recommend a different gym .	465
0	terrible gym , the ceiling in the mens shower room is falling apart , sauna has not worked properly for 6 months , change rooms are freezing cold in the winter and the management could care less . stay away from this good life .	2370
1	great lunch special ! 3 tacos , chips and beans , and a drink for $ 8.00 . so yummy ! ! very friendly staff !	857
0	it 's a shame this place is always empty every time i go , it has some real potential . the good : -no lines ( clearly ) -different activities to do -free parking the bad : -terrible service -always looks like its closed -over priced `` snacks '' but did n't offer half of the things on the menu the aiiiiight : -rock climbing wall is cheap -1 token at the batting cages gets you 14 pitches -bathrooms were n't the cleanest , but not the worst	3555
1	this target has a great selection and you are greeted with the seasonal things right when you walk in . everyone here is friendly and willing to help look for what you are shopping for . the aisles are very clean and all the shows are stocked up nicely . and it is very easy to find all of the toys . they have a pretty impressive tv display selection . and they also have a wine and spirits section all to themselves . the home and decor section is very well organized .	583
1	sweets , dinner , wine , snacks , beer , coffee and bakery all in one ! came here for the dessert after date night . i have been wanting to come for so long that maybe i should have waited some time in between dinner and dessert . ordered some beignets for the mister and i.. beignets were so amazing ! they were just perfect . the right amount of size , warmth , sweetness , crunchiness and softness it was just delicious . will be back soon and definitely with enough room to maybe eat more than just one lol thank you french grocery ! you and your staff were just awesome ! customer service top was great : ) loved it	1160
0	i 've been going here for years and always tipped well . i stopped in for a haircut and girl with hipster glasses tells me they 're closed because the register is down . i ask her why the sign on the door says cash sales and then she proceeds to say , `` cmon dude we 're closing in 10 minutes '' . girl with hipster glasses is young enough to be my daughter . poor service and no respect for customers , i will be taking my business elsewhere .	3281
1	i 've been going to dr. hollifield for about 5 years now . i have a chronic disease that needs consistent monitoring . dr. hollifield is amazing . always reassures me on all my problems . thanks for making this situation a little better .	3527
0	the men 's area had lockers numbered to 28 . but the facility would be pressed if 5 guys were there for the day . this place is tiny and a bit of a let down . there are not nearly enough amenities to justify the markup typically associated with hotel spas . your better bets are mgm , luxor , or mandalay bay in this part of the strip . i would give this place 1 star except andrew saved them from the `` eek ! me thinks not '' category by offering a quite competent massage .	2317
0	i give one star because i ca n't give a zero . they say they 'll make appointment to evaluate problem , then they show up without contact & charge $ 100 for lack of access . the lack of access ? a bubble wrap pool cover that they never asked about , never mentioned in setting up the account .	3479
0	the info for store hours is not correct . m-sa : close at 9 pm su : closed at 8 pm	494
1	aaron and kaitlynn at allegro coffee were sooo nice ! great customer service ! so friendly ! we really enjoyed our blueberry bagel with cream cheese . thank you so much !	433
0	this place was the worst steakhouse i 've ever been too . we are currently sitting down writing this review while every waiter/waitress walks by both of us asking not one asked us if we had even wanted water . i 've already asked to move once to the bar and they had said it was not open seating . yet still no service , place blows i would rather eat at pizza hut .	1491
0	located in the new pinecrest walking shopping center next to silverspot cinema . it 's hard to find . we ordered black cherry chocolate chip and raspberry chocolate chip . with our eyes closed , we would not be able to identify flavors . lucky we had a coupon for buy one , get one . compare it to mitchells or haagen dazs and this is a no brainer . this is a must miss .	2797
0	i got my nails done today and they are awful . they are already lifting up and bubbling . i also have paint all under my nails and all over my skin . it looks like a child did my nails . 4 hours after getting them done and i already have to get them redone . not the first time this has happened to me at this salon either . never going there again .	2962
1	went to the cafe at brianna , my favorite place with my bff . thanks to danielle for the great service and smiles . the crab salad was scrumptious as was the bottled ginger tea . now off to enjoy this sunny day at fashion square .	485
0	avoid this place ! they butter you up with being nice but they just take your money and do n't do the services that you went in for . we complained to our service person who said he needed to discuss with a manager and we never got a call back . we went on their website to complain and again did n't receive a response . we are senior citizens and ca n't afford to get taken for services . do n't go here ! i 'd give no stars if i could .	624
0	so so coffee . nothing special . ordered the hot caramel nut latte . had much better elsewhere . i could n't believe i paid $ 4.20 for this . i make much better coffee and lattes at home using relatively low mid-line equipment , about $ 100 . i go to different shops to experience different styles to see if they offer me anything different .	3520
0	i went through yelp for a quote on a detail and mentioned that i had had my car painted and there was some chalk left on my car and i was quoted minimum $ 150 on a 2014 honda accord ex couple leather ... my car is in mint condition but has a couple extra areas of chalk there 's no reason why something should cost so much because i mention a few areas of chalk ... i 've had my car detailed before you do n't have to raise the price cause i 'm some blonde that needs my car detailed ... i was born during the day but not yesterday ...	2579
0	it costed me $ 8.50 for 2 eggs , toast , coffee and salad ( no potatoes ) . no decafe and wtf no wi-fi either ? ? ? they are living in the olden days and do not move into the future .	585
1	we have been going to pecan grove veterinary hospital for over 20 years . dr. holmes was always very knowledgeable with our pets . as sorry as i was to see him go , i am absolutely thrilled with the care dr. edwards and her staff have shown our four legged family members she is very caring and it is apparent that she truly loves what she does . the staff has always been wonderful . i know my pups will always be treated with the best of care at pecan grove .	2453
1	express flooring is truly the expert in home flooring . the amount of options they have to meet the needs of customer 's style and budget is amazing . i 'm always impressed by how family and pet-friendly they are . express flooring truly just wants to help homeowners make the best flooring choice for their home .	694
0	horrible service ! ! ! the manager/owner ( not sure who he is , but the guy that was in charge ) was the rudest , most arrogant a $ $ i 've ever encountered ! we booked for a large party of 12-15ppl and reserved weeks in advance ( paid deposit and all ) . he ensured us two tables beside each other and we arrived ( 25 min early ) he gave them away and had our party split up at different parts of the room . refused to apologize and even talk to us . however the comedians ( that showed up ) were pretty good . all other staff were great ! such a shame that guy ruins that place .	2144
1	while on our family vacay , my dad insisted our first meal be at wo fat ! we loved it and it was extremely inexpensive ! pro : good food great customer service lots of parking inexpensive meals con : none	1103
1	one of my favorite breakfast spots in town . on weekday mornings , it 's a nice spot to get some work done over a pot of tea and a hearty breakfast . on the weekends , it 's perfect for brunch with the family . love the mega skillet ! oh , and the crêpes are yummy too !	364
1	ordered delivery from these guys and it was a lovely day . they have some of the best burger patties that have ever graced my tastebuds . and the unique combinations they have are perfect for me ! will definitely come again as much as my wallet allows !	940
1	i had dunkin donuts this morning and i decided to try their new chicken biscuit . unfortunately they were out of biscuits but they were very accommodating in their offer to substitute the biscuit for either a croissant or and english muffin . chicken patty was a good size and very filling . all in all was a good breakfast .	1532
1	super chill and friend workers . food is hot and fresh . has a usb port charger if you have only the cable and need to charge up ! really nice place and very clean ( do n't quote me on that ) . it 's only my first time here and i like it so for . - if you treat them with respect they will treat you back with double the respect -	1770
0	the staff was very nice . the facility was clean . the gym equipment was nice . those are the things i liked . as a whole , i did not enjoy the experience . whoever thought having the mascot be a clown named jimbo was not scared of clowns like the other 95 % of people . i was very bothered by jimbo . he was creepy . and not having music to the songs and everyone was fading in and out and there was no excitement . i would go back if they had a free open gym .	3460
0	went in to try to return a pair of work boots tryed to give a hard time about it and then tryed to cheat me on my money i will never be going back again ! !	1627
0	talk about bait and switch ! ! when you check in they give you all the choices of service to choose from . once they have your vehicle in , hood open and ready for new oil , they hit you with all the extra cost ! stay clear of this place . always trying to up sell here !	1544
0	red head was very rude and declined me services ! i would never go back here . they had one customer and two workers and did n't have time for a polish change ! do n't waste your time ! i found another salon right down the street for way better service , better atmosphere , and pricing	3831
0	i hardly ever review but this location was severely under staffed . line was so long and moved incredibly slow . person at the register was either new or had no business being the only person on the register taking orders . people were walking away from the line it was taking so long .	683
1	we were looking for a pizza place downtown open late and stumbled upon fuel . even at 1:30 a.m. , the place was packed , albeit with inebriated post-clubbers speaking at the same volume they did on the dance floor . the pizza was good and the prices were reasonable - we loved the little garlic bread balls . i did n't find the place dirty - the only thing that pained the eyes were the horrible ensembles worn by the patrons . cocktail dresses should not be worn with flip-flops , ladies , and disco ball-inspired clothing is as ridiculous as it sounds .	902
0	terrible service , disgusting food . over priced . waited for food for an hour , got my shrimp tostada and was disgusting , my buddy did not receive his food at all after waiting an hour . and in the process they brought food out for them selves and started eating . found . if black hair in salsa . looked pubescent ... . do not waste your time with this place , i wo n't be able to look at food again for awhile now i 'm completely disgusted	299
0	short staffed . managed to get a table for brunch at 1130am on a sunday and that was great news as everything else was reserved . the poor guy was the only server there , gave us 2/4 coffees - the other two did n't come . no water - asked 3 separate times . food was good but when you do n't even get water or cutlery because there 's only one person serving the entire brunch service it 's hard to credit the food . glad we shared because $ 30 for brunch with little to no service is wild . ( prix fix brunch menu ) wo n't be coming back here .	720
1	this pool is awesome ! ! my favorite place to stay in vegas ! ! all rooms are suites . best buffet in town . there are 4 pools here , kiddie pool with sand and waterfall . two other pools are for relaxing . the fourth pool is the party pool with a loud dj and waterfalls . the waitress are top notch , you have to see the twins and i do n't mean boobs .	2193
1	great prices great selection excellent service . mac did an excellent job helping me get fitted for a putter . he took his time made suggestions and made sure everything was perfect before i left . highly recommend 2nd swing if you want to trade in old clubs or if you are just looking for a new club or two . definitely with stopping by and taking a look . thanks again , mac keep up the good work !	1013
0	terrible experience . i would expend great time and energy to describe what a shady company that this is , but my experience was exactly like everyone else 's ( over $ 700 in additional charges ) . after contacting a more reputable company ( water heater progessional ) i found that the majority of the upcharges were unnecessary . everything bad that you read about them is true . i hope that my future experiences with companies referred by american home shield will be better , or i will be seeking another form of home warranty .	2416
0	horrible service and communication . owner was very rude and lacked professionalism even after acknowledging a mistake on his website that lead me to believe i could get a hand wash at 4:45 pm when hours of operation 8:00am -7:00pm . i drove 30 minutes and he did n't seem to care and instead walked away leaving an argumentative employee behind . too many options in charlotte to give this place my business .	3061
0	i stopped in because it was on my way home i was n't going to make it in time to go to my usual place . i was a walk in . my hair looks like a 5 year old cut it i do the comb over my longer hair was cut short they cut above my hard part and cut my crown to nothing . i have thin hair so now i have a bold spot and it 's going to take me months to grow my hair back out again . i will not be back ! i do not recommend unless you prob know someone . if you do n't stay away you do n't know who you will get .	1694
1	nice place on a summer evening either on the patio or at the bar . nice selection of tapas & wine by the glass . one block east from wellesley ttc sation and one short block north .	753
0	caution ! ! ! i had to have surgery to remove part of my toenail ! ! ! i had a pedicure there a few weeks ago and the lady cut my nails way to short , once they stated growing back 5 of them became ingrown ... my big toe got infected and i went to the doctor . she said `` wow they butchered you , really cut the shit out of your toenails '' she then proceeded to numb my toe and remove about half the nail , it was disgusting . i now have 8-10 months of deformity to look forward to . thanks for the worst pedicure of my life .	2929
0	i can not in good conscience recommend unity . i attended for several years and sang their praises . now it resembles capitol hill and many of the people that i knew have moved on .	1899
1	i had 4 the truck put new suspension under my landcruiser . not an easy job or one for the inexperienced . they did a flawless job . quick and simple . no hassles . no surprises . they produced exactly what they promised . i would highly recommend this shop for anyone looking for truck accessories , spray in bedliners , custom bumpers and more . these guys do great work .	203
1	melany was super patient , genuine , and was n't pushing sales solutions . my time with her was smooth and she covered all details , notably my favorite banker interaction .	3827
1	i went to desert valley to get an upper gi screen . i got lost on the way ( dang google maps ) , i called and the receptionist gave me great directions . the test itself is pretty gross , you have to drink barium and roll around like a guinea pig while they xray your stomach . the nurse and the xray tech were both really nice and friendly and explained everything along the way . if you find yourself in a situation where you have to get a gi screen , i would recommend desert valley . the staff was polite and professional and made me an uncomfortable experience almost pleasant .	554
1	chris austad was a true banking professional today ! he was able to help me through a situation where my accounts were compromised by fraudulent activity . he gave me peace of mind and set me up with new accounts . he was a pleasure to converse with ! i will make this my new home bank of america !	20
1	my family and i really enjoy their coffee and italian soda . we have never had a problem with their service or our orders . the wrong drink was prepared for my daughter in law during a visit . but it was corrected plus we were able to keep both drinks . if we have the time , we will bypass starbucks and dutch bros. just to get to coffee rush .	3520
0	my wife went in to get new iphone screen protectors and received no help . we asked for a recommendation and was told `` it 's whatever you prefer . '' we did n't end up buying anything because the individual did n't help us . definitely not great customer service at all - i 'd go elsewhere if able to .	1104
0	worst customer service ever ! my chicken wings were under cooked i told the manager he said that to him they looked cooked and i pulled it apart and showed him the pink meat and he grabbed them and tossed them in the trash . i said i had to wait 25 minutes because they had a lot of orders and walked away no apology or anything . if i could i would n't even give them one star . this will be the last time i come eat here .	1395
1	i 've tried a lot of salons in henderson and this one is by far the best ! ! the prices are great , they have plenty of staff and the nails last so long ! !	1388
1	this place has such good options . the most that stuck out about this place was remembering how friendly everyone was . the service was wonderful , even better was the ice cream . i think we got a good portion of the food . the pictures outside of the building is what caught my eye . i loved what i had ordered , which was the ice-cream sandwich . it 's definitely a good place to stop while you 're walking on the strip on a nice warm day !	3722
1	i have used the maids for a few years now and we have been happy with their services . they are always able to accommodate our schedule and kate is always available if we have questions .	173
0	we got the black bean noodle and jam pong . flavor was a little too watered down . maybe we 're too spoiled from the authentic la food . but food was just edible at best and the worst part was the lady who a dick to us from beginning to end . as korean people to korean people , super disappointed .	435
0	i never got my food . i was seated promptly and ordered right away . more than 30 mins passes by and 2 tables after us got their food . we asked a server if our order is coming ? her quick response `` it is coming '' she leaves . five more mins passes and no one comes back to tell us what the update is . that 's okay , my party and i have left . there was only 3 of us , we only ordered 3 dishes ...	1264
1	i love this place . it 's easy for a trendy place to rely solely on ambience and falter on the important stuff ( food and service ) , but the covenant does an amazing job in all aspects . we 've always sat at the bar , and every bartender we 've had here as been extremely knowledgeable and friendly . get the charred octopus appetizer . and oh my god , anything with their short rib . i literally day dream about their short rib dip- it 's the best sandwich i 've ordered from anywhere in recent memory . their wine selection is amazing , and their house cocktails are very good as well .	1331
0	update : they opened a location at victoria park and mcnicol . staff is a billion times nicer and the cakes are just as good . i will not be returning to this location ever again . rude , unprofessional people working here .	1217
1	i would totally recommend this place ! they are efficient like a well oiled machine . i was scheduled for 11:15 and was told to arrive 30 minutes early . i did and went from one station to another and was in with the doctor at 11:15 ! ! i got an x-ray , saw the doctor , got a diagnosis , needed a cortisone shot , got my physical therapy paperwork and i was done ! all in 20 minutes . i did n't feel rushed at all . being that i work on a schedule i can really appreciate working and getting people in a timely fashion .	2176
1	was looking for reasonably priced couples message and was not disappointed . relatively close the strip and extremely friendly service . we did the 70-minute full body message . first they soaked our feet in hot petal water which allowed them to work our feet during the message . each masseuse asked us what areas we wanted to avoid and which areas we wanted them to concentrate on . they took their time and applied the right amount of pressure according to our feedback . great experience and would definitely come back next time we 're in vegas !	2320
1	very good chips and salsa and great green chili ! and believe it or not , one of the best cheeseburgers i 've ever ate ! and oh those margaritas ... what a bang for only 3 bucks ! it 's very old and eclectic looking , and the service can be a bit spotty on very busy nights , but we love this place .	1346
1	bought a new kia soul+ last weekend from brett , the internet sales manager . had a great experience . we got the price we wanted on our trade-in and paid the price we wanted on our purchase . he gave us a deal on some accessories and we left happy campers . go see brett and his boss , george who is the internet sales director .	624
0	whatever these assholes quote you ... double it . congrats , you got my money . but you'll never see another penny . update : the home button was assembled wrong . so they lied about the price and the quality of the work is garbage . great job .	3817
0	ice cream was okay . loud rap music blasting with lyrics about drugs and violence . next song about hoes and banging them . so loud you could n't hold a conversation . a bunch of teen boys around a table making gestures , some obscene , to the lyrics , who did n't even buy anything . two teen girls working who seemed oblivious , either they were afraid or enjoyed the music . not a family friendly atmosphere . they will loose all their business if this continues ! very disappointed of this atmosphere .	1201
1	great pricing , product knowledge and customer service ! highly recommended ! keepup the good work guys .	978
0	after waiting 20 minutes in the drive thru . getting a bowl of white rice thats was well under cooked . i will not be back .	1342
1	this is a good place to gamble and drink . the bartenders are friendly and attentive . the actual establishment and bathrooms are all very clean . : ) their burger place is also pretty yummy . : )	3581
0	price gouge ! watch out ! needed a $ 7.00 coil spring on rear brake replaced . it took less than 15 minutes of labor to replace and the charge came to $ 140.15 . the clerk knocked it down to $ 116.18 after i asked him what all i was being charged for and being told that i would be writing a negative review on yelp . i had been a satisfied customer up until this point , but sewickley midas has lost my business . *advice stick with a local mechanic . avoid price gouging midas !	3415
0	very disappointed . showed fran a picture of what i wanted ... .shoulder length with face framing layers . ended up with a jaw length bob ... which i absolutely hate . wanted 8 inches cut off to donate & she cut 12 inches off . i even gave her a tape measure so she would cut it to the right length . will definitely not be going back .	1915
1	my wife and i have been long time members of mary contreras insurance . and i feel that she does care for her clients like us . excellent service to mary and her staff .	2026
1	i went to evoke located at eglinton for the second time this past friday . i was using a voucher and daniel was the the person i was introduced to . he was very kind and caring ; asked me for my permission before making any changes and every once in a while ensured that i was comfortable . after he was done , he blow-dried my hair very nicely ... i was going to a wedding and my hair looked perfect for it ! overall , it 's one of the best salons i 've been too ; it is busy but the employees are very nice .	1472
1	the best barbershop & shave in town . cool place to hang for a guy that likes pbr and shooting the s ... martin the owner takes appointments and cuts a mean pomp or old school haircut . i do n't plan on going anywhere else in vegas .	3574
1	did my second room tonight with friends ( roswell 1947 ) and we got out this time . clues were fun and challenging . will definitely be back . alain was a great control master .	805
1	just wanted to thank jason dyer for the excellent customer service ! ! !	127
0	beyond disappointed in this place . my husband and i stopped here tonight for an extra special treat for dessert and were both underwhelmed . $ 3.50+ for a dry cupcake with literally tasteless frosting . at 5 p.m . i do n't expect the cupcakes to be fresh from the oven but i do n't expect them to be dry either . sorry to say we wo n't be trying any more of their products nor will we recommend them to friends .	3749
0	awful . even for a chain . went here on another christmas gift card ... seriously , i may just give these away . sat down , ordered wine . it was delivered in a glass the size of a shot glass , and all at $ 7/glass . the food was , blah . i had a veal parm that was killed with garlic , an accompanying pasta that was so greasy and slimy it was disgusting . even their bread was bad . service was good . two thumbs down on pepsi products .	873
0	terrible ! i contracted with lucas for total yard care . went well for first visit , subsequently all his unsupervised hispanic workers did was rake , leafblow and left . i disputed his billing for not performing any plant and tree care . lucas contracted a collection agency and reported to credit agency . lucas is more focused on getting customers money than satisfying customer with proper work . stay away from lucas . he 's a nightmare .	2091
1	i was greeted as soon as i walked through the doors even though it was busy in the shop.the sales person was very helpful and knowledgeable . pricing was good . i was almost late to pick up my racquets and they were very kind and said not to worry , they 'll be there 10-15 minutes after closing . my grip and strings are great on my racquets . could n't ask for more ! thank you all about tennis ! : )	794
1	quick service , delicious pho , good coffee . my new favourite east of spadina .	577
0	terrible coloring job and experience - stylist started coloring at the roots , which created a lighter shade only on the top of my head ( halo ) . hair color was completely uneven and appeared unnatural . hair went from black to brassy orange . spent more on correcting the color then the groupon . do not go here for coloring .	2490
0	for the most part the office employees were friendly . i was at this office for two hours , i will not be going back . i am really tired of dr 's overbooking , assuming your time is not valuable . i should have read the reviews before booking with this dr 's office .	3217
0	my experience with hansen was quite tramatic in that they had the wrong address on the memorial cards , but in their favor they got it correct for the obituary . i also ordered key fobs from my brother 's fingerprint , when i received them they were not what i ordered , ( they put a cross on the fingerprint ) so i can not even see the fingerprint .	996
0	i am very disappointed in my nail job , i got acrylics and not even 3 days later two just start breaking . it 's been a week since my nail job and literally all nails but four have broken and i have n't gotten it fixed for the sake of this review . the last nail broke because i was taking makeup out of its package ... like if i ca n't even do that then it 's a bad set , i just do n't understand . this is this first time this has ever happened to me	655
1	my first time at donato with salena for a trim and blow dry . i must admit , i was nervous at first but she made me feel great and my hair looked amazing . i am going back this long weekend for another go at it . i really hope i get the same results . i believe that donato could get 5 stars if they hire more mature ladies for the front desk .	2509
1	i actually had a great experience with them . the doctor was fabulous . i had problems with my contacts irritating my eyes and come to find out they were so thick it always felt as it i had something in my eyes other than just my contacts . she switched brands and that did the trick . the rest of the staff was very helpful . i just wish they had more choices in eye wear . i did save over $ 110 purchasing contacts through them versus my previous eye dr. and $ 85 savings over costco .	403
1	the hotel is very clean and it has free breakfast ! it 's very closeby to the airport and beware..because of this , i can hear airplane sounds in the morning . overall , it 's a great place to stay .	404
0	today i had a flight out of ashville that was canceled because of mechanical issues . seems like they have issues with keeping up with their planes . they used to be a cheap airlines , but now they cost the same , and you do n't even get to leave the day you paid for ... .. i do n't recommend using this airlines	3127
1	i ordered fettuccine alfredo and breadsticks . my pasta was good and chicken was n't dry also you get a good amount of breadsticks . it included a little side salad . the . price was . 17 . 62 and i still have left overs .	987
0	a little disappointed today ... .half of the sprinklers are not working at the splash pad today ...	2350
0	every single time we 've came here the guy who takes the order is very rude to us . he takes your order like he 's being forced to . he talked to my husband disrespectfully and treated my brother as if he were stupid . i never write reviews but was shocked at this guy 's horrible attitude . so we just stopped coming here altogether which sucks because the food is actually really good .	797
0	purchased twice from ashleys and spent some good money . called to get a table fixed under the protection plan they offer . called corporate and spent 40 mins on the phone to be transferred to someone else that couldnt help me . i have no idea whats going on with furniture companies these days but they sell you things to protect but then to claim it its nearly impossible . if anyone reads these please have your gm call me to discuss . im am no longer wasting my time . 4 hours in total to talk to no one . awful .	3738
0	this is my 3rd visit here and i will never be back ! if i could give it 0 stars i would . i brought my niece here to celebrate her being on honor roll . i will never return and i will not recommended this place to any one . you can get a better pedicure at a better price elsewhere . the customer service is horrible . if you come here , only stay if the man and old woman are here alone .	150
1	cheap food and real slot machines that take and give give real coins . i like it .	2928
1	seen two shows here : a wilhelmina scream and teenge bottlerocket . will be back for more ! cool venue , skate park and bar . everything however , is a crumbling dive .	1083
0	should have known this was n't the place to order from . called before ordering from grub hub to ask how many fried oysters came to an order ... 10 for those who are curious . made the order to be delivered . they called 10 minutes later saying they are out of oysters . after i threw a fit over the fact that i had just called , and they said nothing about being out of them , then they came back saying they had one more order of them . when the meal came , it was mediocre at best . i 've had better tasting chinese food in my small home town . this is vegas ... step it up or get out !	561
0	i really wanted to like this place . i 've been here at least four times but quality of service is never consistent . the nail techs are always in such a rush - the last time the guy slopped through my manicure and a pedicure in under 40 minutes . i looked at my watch and the massage that i was really looking forward to was less than 1 min 30 sec . and after i sat at the dryer , he raced over to sit down and look at his iphone ! ! done coming here . i complained to the owner and he acted like all the sudden he could n't understand english .	3711
0	just do n't bother . sub par food , slow service , and over priced . go to einstein 's of you want a decent bagel that is n't dry and bland .	148
0	the menu items are extremely expensive and the staff are not very welcoming . was in the store for around 40 mins and staff seem to be very unhappy whenever we asked for something . ordered the taiwanese chicken and was very disappointed . not fresh chicken for a high price . very salty and more soggy than crispy . the shaved ice was decent but not as good compared to other dessert places .	176
0	like to hear your neighbors having sex like you 're in the same room with them ? like the smell of dog poop mixed with stinky trash and pot smoke in your hallway ( and elevator ) ? like the sound of people skateboarding down the halls and dogs barking at 1am and 2am during the week ? then this place is for you ! please , come take over my lease so that i can be free of this mistake !	818
0	blah blah it sucks . there 's 20 places i 'd rather get tacos . the personality of the staff matches the bland cold tacos .	270
1	shucks just left and forgot to check in blah ! anyways it was an experience and was awesome on the cool custom made cars and glad we could take pics . we were in luck cause horny mike was outside and the boiz took a photo with him ! nice nice ! !	2978
1	our family loves north scottsdale pediatrics ! we primarily see dr. gerlach and could n't be happier with her . she 's very knowledgeable , patient with my 100 new mom questions and she 's full of great advice ! what i love most about this practice is they can always get me in for a quick appointment if needed with whichever doctor is available and they always have a doctor on call to answer any questions i might have during non business hours ( i 've used this service too many times to count ) . i feel really lucky to have found them !	3134
1	one of the loveliest montréal museums , situated in the downtown core , just opposite of mcgill university 's roddick gates . various exhibitions are rotating throughout the year , from sociology to photography to history , all topics relevant to canadian history are welcomed at the mccord museum . one of my favorite exhibition has to be the permanent montreal - points of view one , sharing the space with the first peoples collection ( also permanent ) . offering exclusive , vintage pictures ( and even skyview ones ! ) of montréal , complete with a chronological walk-through of the defining event since its inception , this exhibition is a good first stop for any traveler curious about the city .	3847
0	the lady here is a waste ... .i do n't know why she is sitting over there ! ! whenever i go she is always seeing her mobile and says me to come some other day ! it 's irritating ... please do n't go here and waste your time ! ! ! !	1383
1	for the first time in a long time i had beer ( with few other people ) at the end of a work day . the beer was surprisingly pretty good , and the ambiance was solid too . i had a delicious platter for dinner and it was the perfect pairing to the beer that i shared with three other people . it is a great spot for people who want to relax after a work day , but i think it 's suited to the small group that we had ( especially if you want to eat and drink outside ) . overall , an awesome eating experience .	670
0	my husband has been here twice and he 's not pleased , last time they messed it up where they had to fix an cut more hair then he asked .	3025
0	if i could leave 0 stars i would . see pics , what we asked for vs what we got and my son is due for senior pictures ! unfortunately i did not get the guys name who cut his hair as i was waiting in the car with my impatient toddler for well over an hour for quite possibly the worst cut i 've ever seen . i would have been better off taking him to a super cuts with the butcher job we received . so let 's see , horrendous wait time ... $ 30 cut and a not even remotely close to what we asked for ? ! save your time and your hair folks and go somewhere else !	2366
1	my daughter and i met with byron , one of the owners , for a consultation about seven weeks before we actually got our tattoos . from the start byron was helpful with guiding us on our initial designs . the day of he and his staff were courteous with the entire process . byron and his design input was something that i did not experience in my first two experiences at other shops . he made sure our designs incorporated everything we wanted , but with not being overdone or to convoluted . we were both completely happy with both of our designs and the end product . i will definitely be using byron and his shop for my next tattoo .	2621
1	had an awesome time here , my boys and i loved the food , coming from california and the way they run things is so much different , so much better here in scottsdale 100 % the staff was really nice and we got our own waitresses , the music was great . will definitely come back when i 'm in town ...	3296
1	this is a hidden gem around highway 7 . the restaurant is super small but the desserts there are good and something different from what you 'll usually find in toronto . i got the avocado shaved ice and it was perfect , was n't too sweet . i would go back here .	1062
0	we stopped in for a coffee and a chai tea and the staff was friendly and prompt . the coffee was just okay and the chai was not like any chai i 've ever had - i 'm not sure but i think there was a licorice taste in there that just did not belong in my chai . in short , it was okay for a coffee place in a casino , but not really worth the price we paid .	2118
1	this place was recommended by a friend of a friend . we called and they were able to get us in within 30 minutes . it was a bit strange at first because we did n't know what to expect but ultimately my friend and i both got full body massage which turned out to be great ! both of our therapist without even asking our trouble spots were able to figure it out and get out all of our kinks ! and for a great price ! we will definitely go back again !	735
0	i had sears air duct cleaning , nothing like the video on their site , they did n't remove all the vents , wiped them with a rag . i have had duct cleaning done before and it was a lot better job then i had this time .	3777
0	the worst dental experience of my adult life . i paid upfront for a cleaning and whitening . they took the money and seated me in the chair . they then refused to continue without a `` medical clearance '' . i produced one . they still refused . they kept my money , did n't deliver the care and screwed me on a personal point . i will never go there again and never recommend them .	3752
0	by far the worst customer service i have ever encountered at any department store . unless i was ready to make a large purchase at that particular cashier , i was apparently unwanted . thankfully the gents at holt were eager to help and were handsomely rewarded with a generous sale . this store needs to clean house and re-staff with members who want to help all customers if they actually want to bring their over all sale figures out of the red .	2979
1	i just had my son 's 2nd birthday at pump it up and it went amazing . it was so organized and the party planners were amazing . they also were so nice and understanding . we ' had ordered 3 pizzas for adults and one was very late . however they took it off the bill and still brought the pizza . not only that but not everyone in our party had showed up and they downgraded us to a cheaper package which was so nice of them . these are the things that make customers want to come back . i would recommend to anyone . thank you pump it up of tempe ! !	3267
0	do n't even try the drive thru , there is no one staffing it and if you 're like me , you will drive away after waiting for 10 mn for someone to take your order . this location is a sad joke .	251
1	i 'm giving this place a 5 star rating because they have cheap breakfast . if you do n't want to pay $ 15+ for breakfast at a fancy restaurant , you can come here and get their oatmeal with raisins and nuts for about $ 5 . it is a great deal and once we discovered it we ate here every day . come here if you want to save on breakfast .	3558
0	decided to try hangover soup . hmmmm ... . do the have different definition of `` hangover soup '' ? to : rosy thank you for your comment . i did not expect to have a traditional korean style hangover soup . if i did , i would 've gone to korean restaurant . these are my comments on your soup : 1 ) soup was too sweet . 2 ) soup did not have any taste or kick .	1566
0	bought tickets at 3:40 for a movie that starts at 4:10 and i was told i have to stand outside in 100+ degrees till 3:50 because they ca n't let me in ... umm you guys have a lobby , an arcade a concession stand and want me to wait outside when my child could be spending money in the arcade or i myself could be spending money at the concession stand . that 's horrible .	611
0	horrible . absolutely horrible . i was here for over 20 mins waiting for a simple ice cream cone . it takes literally 30seconds to do ? not to mention they were n't even busy . wont be back here again . sad because i love mcdonalds . just did n't feel welcomed once i got my cone .	1489
1	i 've been going to stephen since march now and he has completely transformed my hair . i absolutely love the cut and color , and it feels so soft and amazing ! they treat you like royalty . it is a first class salon all the way ! i highly recommend . it is definitely worth the 140 miles i drive to see him !	3489
1	this place is awesome . i have been taking my 2 1/2 year old son here for some time now . lauren is the best . she has been so patient with.him . he used to cry when we got his hair cut and would never let anyone use the clippers . everytime we go he gets a little better . he doesnt cry anymore and this last time he even let her use the clippers . his hair always looks amazing . if you go here definetly ask for lauren she is patient and always has a smile and my little guys loves her..	3087
0	store off fort apache - curly long hair employee very rude and disrespectful to customers . if you do n't like your job , get another and stop taking your anger out on the customers .	2043
1	this store is one of my love to hate kind of stores to shop at , it is great when everything is on sale and you get amazing deals , and terrible for when it is at regular price , the clothes can be hit or miss interns of there durability . always buy one size bigger , everything shrinks in the wash it seems . great place to pick up unique pieces .	1163
0	this was my first time going to this particular nail salon . the lady doing my nails was very rude . when i asked her if she could do a design , she refused to do it . she unevenly filed the dip nail polish after it was complete . my nails looked patchy and horrible . less than 1 week and half of them have chipped . i will never go back to this nail salon .	3117
0	my reason for 2 stars is very simple . you talk crap about customers in your vietnamese language to your coworkers because the customer did n't want your overpriced pedicure , you get 2 stars and zero tip . the only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1 is because the polish looks good . it 's a shame they have to be so rude , they have an amazing polish selection , but we wo n't be back .	2297
1	i was very impressed with my last visit . the staff is professional , thorough , and made sure that my car had the attention i felt it deserved to be made clean . i had some earlier complaints due to staff that appeared to not care as much at doing a good job , but under the new management , it looks like they are making sure the staff are on top of things ! thanks , mr. scott !	3250
0	i had a terrible experience i waited a month to get a couch when it finally was suppose to get delivered they change my delivery time 3 times so i was n't home . they arrived with no warning and said i had 15 mins to arrive or they will leave . i speed home to get there to find out they were gone . i just want my money back and i will go else where worst experience in all my life i will never go here again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! wish i could give them no star	1794
0	i highly recommend not buying anything from this place online if you have two addresses for shipping and billing . they sent my things to the billing address even though the shipping address was correctly reflected on the receipt . my theory is that their online customer service department works for one hour once a week because they never pick up the phone and reply to email at a snail 's pace . i wish i could tell you the quality of the furniture , but will have to update once i figure out how to bring it to my new city ...	3854
1	i love this place ! ! great service , great food , really cool ambience . when i 'm at fashion square i always stop here for lunch . nice small bar . cool view . there pizza is awesome and the meatballs are to die for . i always ask the server what to have they are very knowledgeable and are happy to give there honest opinions about the menu and the specials . i ca n't say enough . it 's a must try .	941
0	last reviewed 3 years ago and still disappointing . for those who like their pasta agilo e olio smothered in salt , so much so that that 's all you can taste , you will be happy .	163
0	food is pretty good . but as for the service , the young girl who took my order kept asking me to repeat myself . and then called for miss kim , who i assume is the manager . `` miss kim '' was very rude towards my husband and i. talking to us as if we were an inconvenience to them . not a very good first impression .	580
1	always a good time . took my niece and her friend and thought i had the most fun there . brought me back to when i was a kid . you ca n't go wrong taking your little ones to this place .	2868
1	love this location . pharmacy has improved so much in their customer service . drive thru lines can get a little long waiting to pick up or dop off prescriptions but other than that awesome store .	3411
0	love lenscrafters . this place is horrible . crazy long waits . everyone is incredibly rude .	3637
1	i love usaa . best bank ever ! my husband has been with them since 1996 , i 've been with them since 2006 !	1727
1	i had a great experience at the black eagle while i was visiting toronto . i went on a tuesday night and made some friends right away , striking up a conversation with some locals sitting at the bar and with the bartender as well . there 's a small area up front with the bar ( full bar and draft beer ) , a small landing up the stairs , and then a `` play area '' in the back . by the time 11:00 rolled around , the back area was filled up with horny bears and leather dudes .	1827
1	this a review based on multiple visits - i am always served in a friendly and efficient manner . the ground floor has a nice open layout that lets you browse all the electronics with ease . the upstairs has the genius bar and all the various accessories . this section is always packed . it 's important to book ahead if you can because otherwise your wait could be quite long . i 've had to have several repairs done on a variety of apple products . each time i 've had great service and many times the products were replaced without charge . it 's a great store to visit and i recommend it highly if you like apple products .	3579
1	went in here to ship important documents and the service was impeccable . the guy was so detailed and on top of things i felt like he should 've worked at a bank ! it was empty but for one dude making zero copies at 8am . easy parking and easy to get back on main road . best experience so far : )	1878
0	ever since they expanded their customer service has gone way down . i called ahead and still waited 30 mins upon arrival for a seat , then when i sat down the tech told me she had an appointment and that the front made a mistake seating me , at that point i decided i would be leaving a not returning again .	2297
0	what happened to this whole foods ? ! this use to be my favorite place to shop , now the staff is rude , lines are long , messy areas everywhere , and the days of being well-stocked is well over . i have moved on and now go to sprouts and trader joe 's . too bad ... i miss the old wf of henderson .	433
0	today was my first time i had a bad experience at this place . i wo n't come back here anymore . i 'm a veteran who liked to come here to use the range , but it just talks one person to be very rude and be very disrespectful to veterans . not everyone here is like that , but the person running the range today was probably having a bad day . i get that but do n't pass your bad mood on to me .	1128
1	i 'm one of those guys it typically do not buy right away . after looking at a few other places and feeling like i was just being pushed to buy something i was actually sold on not just the bike but the service i got from the manager jacob . he was real and down-to-earth with me it made the whole experience pleasurable . plus i love my new bike . thanks jacob and i will definitely send people your way .	94
0	was not happy with the service.. they were asked to clean my base housing home for final inspection.. there were a lot of places were they failed to clean including the top of the fridge.. i spent money on the device and the tip and i still had to clean after them ... update..thanks rhino services but i was very clear on the service i requested and i needed to pass base housing inspection.. the window seals were n't cleaned nor was the top of the fridge..i had to spend additional more time what they missed..i could 've done a better job myself..i never post bad reviews but i 'm sorry i will not refer your company again..	3647
0	i always use this store out of convenience , but always questioned their pricing . i recently had a package being shipped to a deployed airman . ( apo ) the quote i was given was for usps not ups at $ 107 . i took that package to the post office and paid $ 47 . that package actually was going to an air force base in new jersey , to be shipped over seas by military transport . i can see making a profit . this quote was absolutely ridiculous . be aware of these guys ! ! !	3871
1	smaller than i had originally thought it would be but , packed with delicious snacks , frozen meals , spices , seasonings snacks and produce . i could not find daikon radish or bitter guard till i came here . be sure to grab a few samosas on the way out . i recommend them with a touch of the hot lime pickle relish . you 'll find that in the aisle across from the frozen paratha . if you like spicy food you must try that bhungra spicy snacks ! i 'll be coming regularly for them ! ! ! ! highly recommend ! !	2615
0	the men 's department at nordstrom 's has fallen off a cliff . the salesmen ca n't be bothered to help if you go there to pick up tailored items already purchased ( no commission at that point ? ) , and the tailoring is a joke . they hem pants with fishline that unravels during the first wearing half the time . the merchandise the carry is still quality , but the service is nonexistent . sad . used to be a great place to shop .	1907
1	this is the best car wash i 've had some time . in fact i stopped going to full-service carwashes more than two years ago . i was so unhappy with the half assed crappy job everyone did . i had some extra time so i stopped at full circle on my way to work today . a little slow start and then the finish guy worked very hard to get my interior just right . i have not said a thing by the way ... for the first time in a long time i felt my $ 20 car wash was worth it ! thank you i 'll be back	3899
0	customer service is terrible at this location ... over the phone and in person . they are rude and basically say `` what do you want '' when you call them out for it . they really should train their staff .	595
0	after failing at mr tokyo , i chose another japanese place . i wanted to treat my parents to a nice dinner . musashi seated us promptly but soon thereafter was told any sushi or sashimi would take a min of 40min ! ! ! my parents of course said it was ok and ordered a bento box . i ended up eating nothing and felt like so bummed out that i could n't order half the menu . never eating japanese in charlotte ever again ! !	1
1	visited here for breakfast ! ordered the egg , cheese and bacon sandwich served on an everything roll . if you like smoked bacon , you will love this sandwich ! the only thing i would ask for different the next time is to toast the roll . heavy smoked aroma and flavor . atmosphere is small and inviting . order at the counter and they bring it to you . worth a visit ! i will come back for lunch and dinner !	308
0	i 've been to this theater many times . the price is great on monday 's ( $ 5 all day ) . the concessions are your average fare . the seating in the theaters , however , is extremely uncomfortable to me . they lean back too far and i feel my neck is strained during the entire movie .	491
0	if i could give 0 start i would ! this restaurant is giving us a false advertising , i went there for lunch with a friend and we went in the waitress told us if we wanted to eat dumplings cost $ 16.99 , otherwise for $ 12.99 all you get is the food they serve in the keep warm area , and was just warn not even hot !	1005
0	i 've been annoyed enough times by teens who ca n't hear me , ca n't see me , leave my pizza getting cold on the counter , and mess up my ticket and even mislabeling the movie times and which screen is playing what movie ... that i try to go to other locations . the bag policy would change each time i did have to see a film here because it was convenient . just check it ? just look inside it ? have to take it and hold it ? ca n't come in at all with it ? it gets exhausting .	3619
1	had a wonderful experience starting with melissa at check in . ate dinner at the bar and had wonderful mushroom and brie soup and a great house salad . room was very clean and inviting . love this place and we booked it off hotwire at a great price ! highly recommend it .	2540
0	pay attention to your reciept ! ! ! ! ! ! they charged me an extra $ 10 . i got charged for a gel fill in & it was an acrylic fill in . the guy was rushing me to sign the receipt , when i got home and reviewed my reciept i notified the additional charge . not only that i tipped him . i will never comeback here . bring cash here , or else they 'll tip themselves ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1256
0	only reason i am giving it 2 stars is because the delivery driver was on time and very nice . the food was not good at all.. waffle was super soggy , sausage was like rubber and potatoes was just regular fried potatoes nothing special to them at all .	580
0	came in looking for something specific and ending up leaving and going to sephora when at least 7 associates passed by without offering assistance . they 're too busy talking to each other .	2479
0	they need better service for the high prices . but this is vegas . will not come back . the food was good , just not worth the price . maybe the buffet is a better deal .	600
0	most of their stuff is from nordstrom last chance in phoenix marked up 5x . it 's against nordstoms policy that you can resell items from their last chance store . smh	2282
0	my mother in law got very sick and had to cancel her appointment for her initial check up . we were told that because the appointment was canceled less than 24 hours prior to her appointment , she was fined $ 25.00 ! what would they want us do , drag my sick mother in law across town just to make her appointment ? this clinic 's priority is making money and not the welfare of its patients . the individuals answering the phone are callous and unsympathetic . avoid this clinic , go somewhere else ... .	3593
1	detoured through charlotte to visit alchemy , and it was totally worth it ! it was my first time ever at a salon , and they made me feel very comfortable . i came in not knowing what i wanted , and my stylist , jess , went above my expectations ! everyone here is friendly and the environment is unique . overall , fantastic first visit .	3631
1	came to my very first football game ( ever ! ) here yesterday for the last game of the 2016 season . i could n't believe how accessible the stadium was ! i was so happy that i did n't have to walk miles or a hundred flights of stairs ! the seats were comfortable and the staff was some of the best i 've ever dealt with ! also , the people in general were awesome ! i had a great steelers fan experience here and i hope to someday be able to come again ! !	2199
0	employees are not only rude to the staff , but to their coworkers ! i do n't know a lot of spanish , but even i could tell they were badmouthing a trainee . unacceptable . needs a complete employee wipe !	859
1	the best hot dogs , ever ! ! i go here just for the hot dogs ! they may be cheap but do n't let that fool you . i do n't know what they put in them but they are like crack . i ca n't get enough ! !	3884
1	no regrets was amazing for my double helix piercing ! i forget the name of my piercer but i know it 's not the other piercer amber . she was super knowledgable about not only piercings but tattoos . and she was hilarious and distracted me from the pain of the piercing . i highly recommend getting a procedure there !	845
0	this has been the worst experience ever , we were being towed and the dam old tow truck broke down , we had to wait for another old ass tow truck to tow this old ass tow truck for two hours , the person towing the truck kept on lying to us about what was going on and on top of that the aaa in las vegas is the worst service ever , this has been my worst nightmare ! ! ! thank god a1 towing came to the rescue and got us home safe.don not trust this company they also damaged my car and arent safe.please do not trust this company with your car nor your family .	2931
0	food was good and the place was very clean . but why they are getting three stars is because of a smart comment ma . i came to eat at 8:15 and they close at 9:00 . 45 minutes until close i did n't think was a big deal because it does n't take me long to eat . well this young boy said as i was eating `` i hate when people want to come in here right before we close and order and eat in here '' . which was so rude and made me eat faster . wo n't return because of the rudeness .	517
0	worst place ever ! -- i can honestly say that out of all the apartment buildings i 've lived in around the world turnberry has hands down the worst management ever . they have no regard for their tenants well being -- they 're completely disrespectful . their pool has been inoperable for over 6 months and they have failed to fix it . they are completely unwilling to attend to the requests of their tenants ... and in multiple cases they have been extremely rude to my guests . i encourage people to seek other living accommodations ... i do n't trust this organization and you should n't either .	3354
1	this location is awesome . they 're honest , quick , reasonable and explain everything to you . i feel completely comfortable taking my car here for anything . i recently was having trouble with my a/c and instead of lying and saying i needed a whole new system they simply told me i just needed more freon . 5 stars all the way .	3405
1	i always come here for one of my favorites ... . seafood tofu soup ... there 's a few korean food stalls in here that are really good ... prices are reasonable and you can go in and walk around the market once you 're done ...	715
0	the cashier i had today was rude . she yelled at the customers . when i asked to see the manager , this young girl came . she had no customer service experience . rather than calm the customer down , she aggravated the customer even more . hire experienced staff and make your customers want to go back to your supermarket . you have great products but poor customer service ! !	2069
1	one of my best experiences with customer service i have enjoyed in a long time at sport chek . i had gone looking around to purchase bicycles around town and found not only a good price on the bikes and equipment but good service . from the moment walking in the night before window shopping to the next day buying then they were all helpful courteous and polite and patience no one was texting on their phones they were all busy doing there jobs . the staff took there time and patience to answer my questions and being nice and helpful . made me really want to come back . thank you to the staff at sport chek sunridge mall .	1676
1	the salon is a bit dated but very sanitary . i had a manicure/pedicure two weeks ago and my nails were perfect . the ladies were diligent and attentive . the price for everything was reasonable . i will defiantly be going back : )	2962
1	as car buying experiences go , it was good . jason was great and spend hours with me test driving and answering questions . he really went out of his way to do what he could to make it a good experience and i would highly recommend him . he was not a pushy salesman but was really helpful , friendly and seamed genuinely excited about my car along with me . the push came from the dude in the back room when your actually signing the purchase paperwork so be prepared to fend off the push for add-ons . he was n't rude , just trying to get more $ .	525
1	people at front office were very helpful and polite . i communicated with ventura to choose an apartment and he was great in helping me get one according to my needs and budget . the location of the community is really good , close to asu , close safeway and cvs . will be moving in soon in a 2b2b apartment . really looking forward to it .	3148
0	i am very unhappy with the service we received at the hound huddle , we have a puppy and we were told that she has too much energy and we should n't bring her anymore . i think that is very unprofessional and rude . you run a doggy daycare , you should be able to take puppies who have a lot of energy . i will not go back	1535
1	my only complaint is that they wo n't refill a prescription over the phone . you have to make an appointment to see someone and pay a co-pay . other than that , this place rocks . i see maria jaten , a nurse practitioner . she 's the most amazing provider have ever had and i would rearrange my schedule to see her instead of getting right in with someone else .	3349
0	stay away ! ! ! ! ! this place is the worst ! waited 20 min to get my food , to find out the made me the wrong plate . then all the meat was so dry , i could n't even eat it ! i told the manger and she just looked at me like it was my fault lol.. this place is the worst ! please stay away , save your money . i got sick to my stomach 30 minutes later . nasty food , nasty place	857
1	each kind exchange reflects the neighborhood . this one has a lot of variety and what i was looking for . make sure to try stuff on as all sales are final . i accidentally bought one thing that was torn . but as always there is lots to look through and the staff is nice .	1762
0	we have not been here in years . disappointed dinner calamari was great caprise was fair . tomatoes had no taste and cut to thick clams in white broth were bland and had no seasoning . clams in linguini was fair . linguini was bland and pasta not cooked enough chicken parmigiana was to much marinara waitresses were delightful food disappointing no more italian food here for me	274
1	we decided to get a car for new years eve last minute to avoid crazy uber fees and tony williams made is super easy . did an inquiry on their website , received an email a hour or so later with some pricing details and then called and reserved the car . the car was clean , the driver was very friendly and the entire process was simple . will definitely use again and would highly recommend .	2356
0	horrible ! ! very rude counter person . will never go back to this location . employees being yelled at by a manager . told me they would price match then when i found a deal said they could n't	806
1	cheryl is amazing ! every time she does my eyebrows become our perfect . i have patchy eyebrows but after she 's finished you can hardly tell . i always go to diana for my hair . it always come out perfect colour ! every time i have an event i always get her to style my hair . ( photos attaches of hair she 's done for me )	1430
1	a/c and heat unit on top of a two story condo and a very small crawl space to service , but did the tech complain ? not even a little . and from that point on he got to the heart of the problem , he even took the time to explain the repair and complement the upkeep of the unit . special thanks to donnie for excellent customer service !	2031
1	great service and i was in and out quick . the doctor was very friendly and the facility was very clean . would definitely go back . -- -- went back , and this time the service was a bit slower , but again i did n't wait longer than 30 minutes . the one thing that concerned me a little was the doctor googled my condition . should n't they know that ?	592
0	a friend gave me a gift card on my birthday for this place about 2 years ago ... i finally got around to trying to use it . guess what ? they have no number corresponding with this gift card ( i have it in front of me right now . value : zippo ! ) . i was given no solution , no apology , nothing . out of luck , too bad , i guess ! so , avoid buying gift cards here ; the chances of them honoring it are unknown . zero help solving the issue from any of the staff . lastly : it reeks like bo in there , someone should get the carpets cleaned .	3314
0	this is an update review of topgolf . i was a frequent visitor here . however the last visit i was there i got food poisoning from a sunrise burger . i ran into a server that knew me by name and asked why i was n't going anymore which i explained why and her response was yeah i would n't trust the kitchen . i think i will stick to normal driving ranges for now on .	1483
0	there was a toilet seat on my counter on the executive floor . the lights of the sign were burnt which is a but sketchy . they did n't believe my colleague when she said i was coming into town after her . i am surprised at the lack of professionalism .	73
0	this airline sucks ! i booked travel in september and paid main cabin select . they changed planes so my seats where changed . this is not the first time it happen years ago on virgin atlantic . i called them on it today as i went to log in and it nothing but lip service . total crap and now to move up they want even more money . after this trip no more . i have better service from southwest then these guys .	1623
1	great pricing & great service joe garza and his team delivered a great customer experience for my refinance . they provided the lowest option of all the lenders i quoted , and made the process a smooth transaction . i especially appreciate joe 's industry knowledge and the accuracy of his commitments .	3551
0	i decided to try this place because i was in the area and they charge way too much ! i originally went in for a fill but after the guy kept complaining about how bad they were done previously he ended up doing a full set . $ 23 full set , $ 5 to remove my old nails , $ 15 for damn gel polish , $ 10 eyebrow wax and $ 5 for lip ! almost $ 60 and did n't even get a pedi . rileys nails is where i will remain ( baseline & hardy ) half the charge , same work and nicer people that make you feel comfortable ! i left feeling ripped off !	415
1	new to arizona , love finding all the deli spots in the area ! ! this one goes into the top two . great spot , amazing food , solid corporate citizenship , and super friendly people . had the grilled cheese , it was perfect !	277
0	do not get a brazilian wax here . most painful wax i 've ever had , why ? because 1 , they use soft wax for the majority of the brazilian opposed to hard wax which is less painful and better for coarser hair , and they use the same cloth strip multiple times so it does n't get all the hair after the 3rd or 4th rip , which i also think is kind of unsanitary . so , looks like i still have not found my go-to wax place .	1875
0	i have been going here for awhile and it 's usually ok ... but this time i told her just a clean up not to make them to thin and now my eyebrows are two different sizes and shapes . i will never return ...	3907
1	mr. steers . not the regular burger . not the greasy , sloppy burger , not a burger made of chuck either , but made of steak . makes for a different tasty burger served as a ball instead of a patty with crispy bacon and susy-q fries to die for and they have black cherry cola . sold . this place has been around for decades and i 've been going for over 20 years . definitely worth the stop . not cheap but for a different take on the usual burger , go for it .	1280
0	got my car washed inside and out . the inside looked like it had n't been cleaned . the only difference was that the dashboard was shiny . even where they wiped it down there was still stains like they did n't even try ! the seats were n't vacuumed like the crumbs were still there ! ! frustrating and ridiculous never coming back again !	2198
0	disappointing nothing wrong with the food , it 's nicely presented . i sincerely do n't get the hate , i 've seen worse and more expensive at other places with less criticism . and the fries are great ( pro tip montreal : mushy fries are a no-no everywhere else ) but the service was not great . yeah , we did n't get the condiments , ok , someone else brought them later . then we got a wrong check for our table ( it was even for less than we had ) , having that fixed , their card machine did n't work properly . yay . sorry , hard to recommend it .	992
1	found these guys on angies list..have only used them for 2 weeks . i originally called them to clean my filters and then hired them for a month of weekly cleanings . so far , so good ! ! paul is very friendly , knowledgeable and always answers or returns calls promptly . we have used many pool companies in the lv area . i just wish i would have found royal blue years ago ! !	1376
0	i had my oil changed here about six weeks ago . since then my oil leaked out and my car is in the shop . the service was so so slow . an hour to change oil ? and you could tell they did n't care about customers . if you value your car and your time , do n't go here .	1093
1	i was so excited to find pop drinks ! ! their `` palms '' soda is just what i need for a long day , coupled with a chilled sugar cookie and it 's a heavenly treat ! i love that i can get my kids a popcorn instead of a cookie when they have earned a treat but i do n't want to give them sugar . we love it here ! !	837
0	update ... closed	489
1	great service ! kent was friendly and changed my blinker bulb for me ! ! ! took extra time and taught me how so i can do it myself next time ! `` give a man a fish , he 'll eat for a day , teach a man to fish and he 'll eat for life ''	506
0	sometimes i wonder why i sold my soul to the devil aka best buy . i 'm involved in their reward zone program ( premier silver status ) and have a credit card with them . this location has awful customer service yet i keep going back because it 's convenient . in 2010 , i purchased from them : a 50 '' samsung plasma hdtv , a tv stand , tv accessories , kinect , kinect games , xbox games , a nikon d3100 , and nikon accessories . they remodeled their store , which is a plus . they just need to do the same thing with their employees .	2477
0	totally unimpressed . very not good tasting , low quality ice cream . i tasted 7 flavors and i could n't bring myself to buy a scoop . ugh .	3722
0	service is so slow ! ! like a snail . if you just want something simple , like say a coffee and there 's someone in front of you ordering 5 complicated drinks , they wo n't serve you out of turn to get the line flowing , you 'll just have to wait ages instead ! expensive as well , but this is to be expected .	1793
0	i ca n't review the food because i called to make reservations and they kept me on hold for over 7 minutes and hung up on me . if you are going to ask your customer to make phone reservations , perhaps you should implement better phone service .	57
0	i will never go into this bank again ! i went in to make my credit card payment and the teller started telling me about other cards i should get . i told her i was not interested , she ignored me trying to tell me about different cards and about my card . after telling her 3 times i was n't interested and getting an attitude from her i then got annoyed and firmly told her i did n't want to hear it . being that they were not busy the other tellers and manager gave me a dirty look and i got a disgusted grunt from one of them . i could hear them mumbling as i walked out .	1111
1	love this place guilt free shopping ! i go in about every few months and always leave with something fabulous i would have never bought new because of the price .	1446
0	rudest costumer service in town . ignorant people getting paid for giving the worst service you can expect .	2724
0	horrible service and staff , even after showing them my confirmation number for my reservation they did n't honor it , staff acted indifferent and cold because their hotel was booked full and they had no record of my reservation . hotel searchers beware ! ! ! do n't book this hotel , no reassurance you will even have a room when you arrive . ruined my anniversary trip with my wife , had to stay in north scottsdale and had to cancel dinner reservations we had for that night in cave creek . not only did this hotel lose my business but they lost the business of my friends and family .	3803
1	tony is a rock star ! ! ! he was patient , extremely helpful , and wanted to make sure that we got exactly what we were looking for . he was also fantastic with our 3 year old son . thank you for your help ! ! !	2565
1	went for a family party and sat in the party room . we had to wait to be seated longer than expected but the service was good and the sangria margarita made it all go away .	560
0	my husband took our son to get a haircut at the scottsdale location , and i thought it would be an awesome quality of haircut due to the environment and reviews . i was so disappointed and upset , his haircut was horrible ! patchy , not even , and just an awful cut ! i do n't think it 's even worth going back ! so disappointing !	260
0	this is the worst airline i 've ever flown with . was flying out of vegas to bellingham . waited in line for an hour just to be told my flight was cancelled till the next night at 9:30pm . thank goodness i was early enough to get on a flight later that night . crazy lines , way over priced baggage prices ... pay for carry ons ? ! i then received a voucher for the inconvenience ... which i did n't end up using because no one in the whole airport could tell me how , where or when i could use this voucher .	3127
1	everyone at the store was very friendly , and i had a good experience shopping there . bought two pairs of running shoes , a pair of olukais , and two packages of socks on recommendation . the one downside was the wait time for the foot analysis , but that 's understandable . vyda was the one who checked us out , and she went above and beyond for us . very helpful !	2557
0	i really was n't that impressed . plastic table cloth and the place smelled kind funky too . i got the bone in ribeye - and it definetely was n't the best steak in the area . wine selection is rather lacking . i 'd hit the many alternatives before this ; flemings , capital , ruth ...	1147
1	such a neat idea ! i love this place ! came here for my anniversary with my bf and we had a great time . the food was delicious . i think when you are not distracted by everything around you , the food tastes a lot better ! i definitely gained a new appreciation for the blind after this experience . most of us take our eyesight for granted when we should n't . i 'm so glad to see restaurants like this that provide jobs for the disabled ! will definitely come back again : )	449
0	horrible horrible horrible everything ! ! gaming sucks ! bartenders suck ! ! food sucks ! ! the only reason for possibly a 1 star was because of a sweet server that walked by and said hello	1520
1	i had a perfect drive thru experience that a review was worthy . the lady was nice and cheerful . she took my order with no problem . the chicken was warm , crispy , and just right . the people there had such a great attitude that they made my day . will definitely be coming here again soon .	1517
0	this place scammed me and my girlfriend and refused to make it right ! told me that they would refund my money but gave me the run around with calling this supervisor , call this agent , transfer me , and ultimately screw me out of my money ! ! ! ! you are taking a gamble with your money going to the state fair ! you were warned .	2076
1	i like this gym because it 's usually not crazy packed like lvac . even when it is peak hours it does n't have that crowded feel . it 's a pretty basic gym . i wish they had more updated equipment like the one on stephanie st . i usually just go to this location since it is closed to my house . i love how they offer classes and that you can bring a friend with you each time , depending on your membership . overall , i like the environment of this gym .	465
0	do n't go here , grossly overpriced . here it is 160+ for a iphone 6 repair , apple quoted me for 110 for the same fix . i got them to come down in price after arguing it . had apple open my phone a few weeks later after they fixed it here and parts were stolen from the inside ! ! ! i 'm assuming to compensate on the discount they gave me , they just took my parts . wow , not to mention the guy at the front was very rude , not going back .	3817
1	order pepperoni pizza and it was delicious and wings as well ! everything was an delivery service they were fast and food was hot an ready . very decent pricing . would definitely recommend other people and would likely order all the time .	987
1	found these guys on yelp . they were courteous , knowledgeable , fast and thorough . i would use them again .	2248
1	to get away from it all in vegas , you can choose a multitude of places to get away from the city , lake las vegas is one of those places . montelago is a place that does n't offer the most posh amenities , however extremely comfy and comes with a kitchen and living room ( my room did ) i really love the convenience of this hotel . its really easy to get to your room and the decor is light and airy and relaxing . i recommend this for a little `` day-cation '' to get away from the city ! ! !	3916
0	horrible service ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they made us wait almost an hour when the lady told us 20 min . they started a new girl knowing we were waiting . they were rude . they did n't even tell us anything . never coming back .	3509
0	beds do n't fit canadian mattresses . we have been completely misled and have been trying to return a bed back to the store for a week and muji has been asking us to pay for returning the bed ! calls are not answered , messages are not returned and staff do n't seem to know what mujis operating procedures are update - 9 months later muji refuses to refund me the pick up money owed . additionally muji claimed that dimensions in store , catalog and online are for `` guidance '' only when there was no commentary like that anywhere	3363
1	i 've gone to susan twice now and i 'm set on never letting anyone else touch my eyebrows . she never disappoints me and she is quite possibly the nicest person i 've ever met , great prices too .	3016
1	i do n't know their names but i love the little asian lady and the black guy that work here . she is very sweet and helpful and he very funny . there is a blonde woman who works here too who has been nice to me as well	1913
1	this review is only of the restaurant in the casino , not the casino . great food at a great price ! a real value , i 've eaten there many times and never had a bad meal the only downside is the service is so so , you may have to wait to be seated too long and their not attentive enough to your table but i assure you i will be going back again and again .	3378
1	just walked in tonight , it was n't busy at all which was good . thought i can use their thingy right here on yelp but the guy working there told me they do n't use those anymore so okay . haircut is just $ 13 plus if you want shampoo , it 's gon na be $ 3 more . it was n't pricey at all . the lady who cut my hair was really nice , she asked me some questions and really listened to all the things that i had to say . she suggested me this and that too . over all , she made a great job on my hair . i really liked it !	3232
1	this was my first flight with frontier . this was a round trip from charlotte to orlando . the flight was smooth , clean plane , comfortable seat , courteous flight staff . ground crew ( particularly in charlotte ) are a bit stressed out . ( might need more fiber in their diet . haha ! ) . luggage handling was quick and efficient at both locations . prices too were great ( which initially had me cautious ) . online app made it all easy and efficient . i will definitely fly frontier again !	1001
1	i 'll start by stating i am an avid second-hand shopper whether it be boutiques , charitble stores , or large department types ( like savers ) and i 'm a lover of vintage . this savers is by far my favorite in the valley , however , it is also the messiest ( hence the 4 stars ) . with being unorganized aside , i do always make out like a bandit here and the prices are always fair .	128
1	i worked with gilbert and his designer , and i was just really impressed with the results . i told him what i wanted , and his designer gave me a few options , i picked one , and it was that simple . they worked with my budget and i did n't have to go back and fourth . i loved it , and i referred him to my friend .	2721
0	place used to be good a couple years ago when i went occasionaly . we just went there , 5 pm on a friday , we didnt get a server come to the table until close to 15 minutes had passed . the basic chicken curry was not good , the chicken had lots of inedible bits like cartilage and tendons that absolutely should have been trimmed off . other curries we had were good . prices are up from 2 years ago , i `` think '' ... .most of the curry dishes were anywhere between 14 and 16 bucks each .	537
0	crunchy dirty string in my take out meal that went in my throat . they refused to give a refund and it was incredibly disgusting . at least it was towards the end of my meal , i was so hungry ! we finally went back after a year and this is what happens . my husband and i both got food poisoning last april from this restaurant . it is located so close to us so we tried giving it another shot . would not recommend !	973
1	this is a terrific spa on the west side of the valley . talented and caring folks throughout . brenda is the appointment whisperer . she has always been able to accommodate our needs and schedule . the only reason this is n't a 5-star rating is because the steam room has n't been functional as of my last few visits . probably over a year since it worked . c'mon renaissance , you want to be a player in the west valley , at least get it fixed !	1656
1	came for breakfast and the food was delicious . my boss was treating so i also ordered a chocolate tart . now that he has seen that there was a private room , he is considering having our next meeting there . yum ! !	1276
0	big disappointment the fattest prime rib i 've ever seen . came here for the pr . sent it back and was told all if their pr was just as fatty . manager and server really nice but that does n't make up for inferior food	560
0	ordered the veggie pizza , came on time for a great price for something with no flavor . cheese had a plastic consistency and the crust was bland . sauce was also very plain . it seemed like the vegetables even forgot how they 're supposed to taste . fried zucchini was good though , whatever they did to the zucchini they should do to the pies .	987
0	have been going there for past 10 years and loved this place but last 3 times in past 4 months was very disappointing . ordered chilli chicken -all 3 times was dry . on one occasion ordered shrimp fried rice - maybe 4 shrimps in the whole plate . i need to find another good hakka place . : (	522
1	loved the ambience , service and food . i loved every dish which i had there paired with an amazing pitcher of margarita . highly recommend making a reservation as this place is always full .	1305
1	we have n't been here in about a year since we moved quite a drive away , worth every mile we drove ! i love this place staff are wonderful , restaurant clean , pizza is amazing and the wings ... . yum ... i will never be able to say enough about how good the wings are . i would come once a week if i could .	773
0	scheduled an appointment , but the company was a no-call / no-show for the appointment . when i called 15 minutes after the appointment time , was told that he was running behind and would be at least an hour late for the scheduled appointment . at least a text or phone call by the time the appointment is supposed to start would be appreciated . i will not bother re-scheduling with this company .	2888
1	ethernet wireless in rooms . wifi only in lobby . otherwise : excellent .	1190
1	what a fancy location ! it looks as if they 've recently remodeled the store , and it 's very nice . the decor is very modern and there is pink back lighting everywhere . it 's actually a trip to see at night ! i 've been having an issue with my phone lately and was directed to this location to pick up a new sim card . i was approached immediately upon entering the store , even though it looked kind of busy . the young lady that helped me was very friendly and took care of what i needed . i was in and out of there in about 5 minutes . ca n't complain about that !	1169
1	they were helpful , friendly and i had a positive experience . the dress did take about 10 days longer to come in than they originally told me , so allow ample time in advance of your event . alterations were fast and accurate , but needed 2 fittings . dress about $ 75 less than anywhere else .	1298
1	the best place for a late night snack . only down side is the drive thru always has a line .	1382
1	what a beautiful boutique experience ! we had such a great time with liz and were totally successful and found the perfect gown for my daughter ! could n't have been better ! ! thank you ! !	3145
0	i came for prom & & the lady who did my hair seemed like she was in a rush uninterested ! they told me on the phone it was only going to be $ 30 and then they ended up charging me $ 55 for something that took 40 minutes to do and does n't look the best !	3866
0	i 've never had my frappuccino made w/ ice cubes in it instead of being blended before . highly disappointed & they were busy so i did n't want to be rude & have them remake it / :	3154
1	i got the chicken nachos and my husband got steak tacos . we felt it was not bad for airport food . not cheap , but also pretty on par for airport prices . we will definitely eat here again .	623
1	probably the coolest little record store to find some great gems outside of california . i spent about two hours here just crate diggin ' , and the people working here are extremely friendly/helpful . this spot is rad !	2570
0	we went to olives today at 11:00am . there was no air-conditioning on and the place was stifling . the drink machine was not working . i asked 3 employees to help and they all ignored me . there was no tea made . the employees seemed unconcerned . when the food was delivered to our table , the employee never said a word and just stared at us . finally he heaped the food on the table and then walked away . not one employee ever asked about our experience . the gyro was bland and the meat was dry . the rice was tasteless . not a good experience for us .	875
1	great food . loved the service ! ! price was amazing . a must if you love chinese food and are in the area .	829
1	may 2018 - this agency is the best ! my agency for health , life and car insurance . they are quick and so knowledgeable on insurance . highly recommend ! felicia and kathy are the best ! ! kuddos to keith for being involved and for hiring quality personnel . : - )	1912
1	my sister recently moved to charlotte and has been raving about the `` taj mahteeter '' nearby , so when i visited over thanksgiving we had to visit . it 's your standard grocery store , except that it has an elevator or winding staircase bringing you to the second level , which houses a bar ! not only can you drink with friends here , but there is a beautiful balcony outside where you can see the sunset , and they have local beers on tap . why ca n't all grocery stores be this user-friendly ?	1061
1	this was my second visit to this store to get make up done for my daughter . the first time was for her graduation pics and again yesterday for her prom . i must say that abby made my daughter look flawless ! the make up application was everything i requested and simply exceptional !	2479
0	worst whole foods in the valley . and i 've visited all of them . from the rude employees to the layout of the store it 's awful . weirdly everyone i talk to says the same thing . the only positive is that it 's very close to trader joe 's .	3874
1	you can get everything at costco ! most recently , we are impressed with the line of wines ... in our blind test , the kirkland pinot noir won - hands down ! give it try , it will surprise you !	1102
0	buyer beware ! this is the most crooked place i have ever had the displeasure to deal with . even though i had a 15 day warranty , i have been given the run around for a month to fix issues with the car . they keep resetting the check engine light and saying they fixed the problem , but not really fixing the problems . i keep going back to no avail .	3125
0	over priced items you can get anywhere . never once saw an employee or was acknowledged . items in the back on display inside a room were filthy and sitting next to dirty live birds in cages , gross ... wo n't be back .	1987
0	outrageous pricing . quoted me $ 850 to braze a half inch copper tube and to vacuum the line . it 's literally less than 2 hours of work . take the time to shop around .	2203
1	alil pricey . but thats with all casino places . what can you do really . but the one thing is that they have a great selection of fresh baked goods everyday and the workers are great and fast . i like coming here better than the coffe bean downstairs	2397
0	customer service is a joke ! i 've been trying to reschedule an open blanket for a deferent date , but they keep transferring my call to some spa . not only that but when they pick up the phone i can here them giggling and talking amongst themselves and are clearly not paying attention to what i am trying explain ... disgusting to say the least .	3142
1	impossible burger here ! served three different ways , the americana style impossible burger was excellent . the staff was courteous , competent and quick . the only downside to the meal was that the french fries were only luke warm .	369
0	i wish i could give them no stars . we booked an event with them a full month and half early and they did n't show . they did n't call . in fact when we called they said all they could do was say sorry . we have a building full of hungry people who did not bring lunch because we had been hyping up the truck all month . a simple mistake is one thing but they were rude when we finally got a hold of them and knew they had double booked us and never bothered to contact us . their food is good but their service is horrible . do n't rely on them or their promises .	2937
1	clean , and looks quite new . prices are decent , $ 3.50 for shoes and $ 3.50 a game . balls and shoes are not worn out , like new . just remember to wear socks because they do n't provide any , and it 's $ 4 in singles only from a dispensary machine .	2867
0	really bad customer service . i bought a tune box from them and they would n't install it themselves because they did n't want to be liable . wtf ? so i tried installing it myself and had issues . they were n't willing to work with me and kept giving me the runaround . and the manager was always `` in a meeting '' .	978
1	i must say how happy i left this place i walked in from having one of the worst days ever seriously ! my nails looked horrible but thanks to vu i left here with a smile not only did she do an exceptional job she was a complete profesional ! ! this place may charge a bit more but they do quality work vu is wonderful l thank you doll i 'll be back to see vu again soon	2686
1	great catholic church ! everyone is welcoming and enjoys having mass together . check out the websites for mass schedule and other events going on . having gone to church here for a few months i would recommend it for any that is catholic or is considering converting .	771
0	i will not trust this company ! i did service for the owner of this company that would have cost $ 90 . dated 5/14/2015 . check # 317 . the owner issues me a check for $ 90 , knowing that his check is not a good check . i deposited the $ 90 and my bank returned the check for `` un-locate account '' . i got penalized . i can post copy from the bank , if necessary .	2925
1	i have nothing but good things to say about this shelter ; i adopted my little nellie there almost 6 years ago . everyone i met was great on what i 'm sure is a very small budget . got ta admire the staff who does so much with so little . kudos	3626
1	came here for lunch today with my mom . we were sat right away , and our server came to the table almost immediately . the food was tasty , and pretty big portions ( even mom 's plate which was off the lunch menu was huge ) . fast friendly service ! in past visits , service was n't always stellar ( could 've even considered it as bad ) ... . but today we had a good experience . i 'm happy we gave them another shot !	428
1	tried the chicken shawarma which came with more gourmet toppings you would normally not find in regular shwaramas such as mediterranean eggplant , corn , fries , beets , coleslaw , tabbouleh etc . limited seating area and cheap prices for cooked food . to my dismay however , i would have wanted to purchase their salad in the mason jars but there were n't any available when i went . would want to come back and try the other menu options next time !	588
1	i have to say , i was a little skeptical when i drove up to hotel- lots of construction going on ... . the customer service has been outstanding . lynette at front desk went out of her way to find us a room of our request , the sweet lady carol cleaning rooms is so on top of things . our room is spotless , and she asks every time we walk by if we need anything , great smile . the staff here is excellent !	1335
1	since my daughters favorite food is sushi , this place has become a regular place for us . we 've been coming here for a couple years now and love it . the staff is nice , and the food is good ! the specials are almost always a welcome surprise ! we can always count on getting a quick bite no matter what time .	408
1	great customer service . nice guy at the drive through . food tastes great and hot . price was 2.85 for drink and burrito . very nice	1341
1	came in as a walk in for a pedicure and was taken care of ! the pedicure came out great and the woman took her time and paid attention to what she was doing . she did n't rush the massage and she gave me excellent service even though closing time was rapidly approaching . they have a great selection of gel polish but could use more regular polish for those who do n't want to pay extra for gel !	3347
0	miserable , miserable , miserable ... .. midnight approaches ... ... train an hour late ... .maybe longer ... . anything else better than amtrak .	3601
0	i wish i can rate 0 ! worst service and sound ! ! 服务巨差， 强制收取了30 % 的服务费 而且我们没问他们也没有说。话筒唱起来费劲，经常有爆的声音。 以后肯定不会再去了。 除了装修新一点，点歌方便一点，他家肯定不如香槟其他的ktv好～ ... ...	1835
1	the best fast food sandwich place evah ! evah ! puts subway , quizno 's , schlotsky 's and even the cutesy mom and pop ones to shame ! oh the bread . the crusty and delicious bread . the shredded lettuce . the perfectly round and red slices of tomato ... damn it i ca n't get to vegas quick enough now ! i would give a limb to have a jj 's in los angeles . the # 1 pepe is the best ham and cheese i have ever had ! and to top it all off this place is cheap !	1503
0	walked in there today to order a matcha latte and their debt machine was down . the girl behind the counter just turned her back on me after i told her i did n't have cash . service is terrible and would n't even attempt to return .	3180
0	this pizza was so nasty . i paid 50 bucks for a whole pizza and salad . i was so disappointed with this cardboard they call pizza . i do n't see how these other yelpers gave it a good review . we ordered half pepperoni and other half spinach with ricotta cheese and tomatoes . pepperoni was sour spicy and smelled bad . i like thin crust but this crust was cardboard . you will have a better experience if u just order dominos pizza . make sure you give a tip or u will be ignored by the staff .	1371
1	not the best conditions but a great course with excellent views .	85
0	terrible sanitary condition . daughters burrito had a bit off nail in it and the general manager had the nerve to say an i quote `` i 'm not entirely sure the nail is ours '' . unbelievable . i will never go to a dos gringos again . i will encourage others to do the same !	704
0	went to pops after dining in the area . it 's a tiny place and there was a guy visiting with the server so it made it even tighter . he was not eating anything and seemed so interested in what we were ordering . it made it uncomfortable . i think they had about 8 flavours and vanilla soft serve . i expected more . portions are tiny for the price . they also make sandwiches . i do n't think i 'll return . i 'd rather go elsewhere for frozen yougart .	413
0	walked in to a crowded and small location , full of smoke from the grill and no place to sit . ordered the food and waited 15 minutes for preprepared food . no place to sit inside so sat outside on the patio with no shade in the direct hot phoenix summer sun . the food was just ok , gorditas were tiny , the bread was good , the meat was just ok tasted like it was made a couple days ago , jamaica to drink was just ok . i would not hurry back .	270
1	ordered food from here the first time through postmates and the artichoke dip was amazinggggg and so was the other food i ended up going again the other day with a coworker and dined in and had the fried calamari it was to die for first time trying it and loved it the blackened fish sandwich on the other hand was mediocre but overall good experience	201
1	really enjoy playing this course anytime . fairways are wide , lined with trees most of all challenging and forgiving at the same time . course is always in great shape . staff is always friendly , helpful and extremely accommodating . great job tres rios	1138
0	horrible setup , no employees available to help . 1 register open per floor . 20 minute wait to purchase . cutting up jcp card .	1536
0	the atmosphere of cream & flutter is absolutely perfect if you are looking for a cute place to get dessert/coffee/tea with girlfriends , but do n't expect much from the cupcakes . even though they are cute , they are really small and sort of dry . i would recommend going for the macaroons if you are looking for a sweet treat . i have always wanted to try their cookies also but never have .	3749
0	this is for the vans off the wall store . good products but the workers are a bad joke . i bought a skateboard there that came out to 150 $ . they offered to put it together . i went on a walk around the mall and when i came back the grip tape was put on , with chunks taken out the side . then she could n't connect the trucks to the board . after finally connecting them they went to put the wheels on . the wheels where crooked either the bearings or the wheel were messed up . so after all that i just got my money back and left .	2815
0	it is always frustrating to wait with no drink or food and watch the waitress checking her phone and then getting engrossed in a you tube video as you sit and wait for her . ultimately the food was good .	496
0	this place looks nice on the outside and inside . but the employees are very rude , have no clue what is going on in the place . god forbid you ask a question and get a helpful answer . 2 employees thought is was ok for a 10yr old to see a movie that would scare the sh** out of them . emailed the gm and no reply from him . i guess the lead by example .	491
0	a thousand people working in this store and there is huge line . a lady completely cut in front of me and the associate saw it and said nothing . this is so annoying .	3101
0	cox is the most expensive wast of money and time . i was a customer for over 7 years , but got tired of paying too much for high speed internet only . they try to bully you when you threaten to cancel and go with another cancel . their rates go up every year . i finally switched to century link and will only pay $ 45 a month for life . their rates never go up . i will never go back to cox .	2633
1	this is our favorite little eating place . nothing fancy but the food is great and the service even better . it 's a family restaurant and you can tell they care about their patrons . i love going there for breakfast . they 'll serve most of their breakfast entrees all day , which is nice . we rarely have to wait but they 're almost always busy- another good sign of a good restaurant .	831
1	definitely go on a friday or saturday when the belly dancer is here . she is great and really invokes the crowd and kids . i liked the coconut chicken the best . the spicy was n't that spicy so next time i will try indian hot . our server , joe was amazing and knew the menu very well . the best part was the happy hour . you can get a glass of wine for only $ 3 ! ! ! ! ! !	1497
0	came to get a smoothie and even though the website , door sign and yelp said it was open not to mention there was a person behind the counter , the door was locked .	1804
1	got a fantastic patty melt here , nice thick burger not drowned by grilled onions and cheese , perfectly cooked . service was great , nick was very friendly , helped me get my bagels , cream cheese and loaf of rye to go before i finished . ca n't wait to try them .	325
0	how anyone can screw up a steak this bad i am not sure . salads and side dishes were standard steak house fare - not bad but not exceptional either . but our meat feast was not to be . the strip was so chewy that i had to spit out half the pieces as they would not break down to swallow . i mean really ? the rest of my crew were equally disappointed . we left a tip and escaped as fast as possible not wanting to complain and ruin vegas karma . if you like steak even a little bit , this should the last place you ever go . sorry eva , you 're hot , but your food is not .	971
0	the food is good , however , the service is poor . i 've been there a number of times . each time they have had plenty of help standing around and doing nothing , yet i 've had to wait to order ( someone could have gotten on the register ) and then the order takes a long time to make .	517
0	i went with 2 friends of mine for a business dinner and the food was good . came out quickly ( the first round ) . however , we literally had 2 pieces of sushi and some strands of udon noodles left and the waitress said we had to finish them or else they would charge us full price for those plate . are you kidding me ? i understand some people take advantage of an all you can eat place and waste food , but with the quantity of food that we had left was unnecessary for them to charge us .	206
1	we have used brand x numerous times now and they are just awesome . they communicate a clear price , a clear time when it will be ready and they hit it every time . there are a lot of folks that can do t-shirts , i am happy to give brand x the business because i know it will get done right .	2363
0	food was okay , had better . lady behind counter needs to crack a smile once in awhile . she should find another line of work if shes unhappy ... just sayin .	435
1	my daughter 's prom dress needed alterations that were very minor and we were on a tight deadline . time snuck up on us and we needed the dress fixed in 48 hours or less . the gentleman who assisted us looked at the dress and said that he would shorten the tie-back for the halter dress and move the hook for us . because the job was so minor , he did it for free . that is excellent customer service ! the dress fits my daughter perfectly and i am excited to see how beautiful she 's going to look at her boyfriend 's prom tomorrow . alberto & pasquale rocks !	2858
0	extremely rude waitresses . they do n't know how to deal with customers . no proper management , and food portions were extremely small .	1583
0	every time i come here the food is just `` okay '' . i got a half sandwich and half soup and i should 've taken a pic of my sandwich ... it was ridiculous how small the `` half '' was . i think these employees have forgotten that it 's a choice to spend our money here and i will not be coming back .	1387
0	the chinese food was greasy and poorly prepared . the service was worse . avoid this restaurant .	1264
0	meh , got two brazilians here , pretty disappointing . left covered in baby powder and lots of leftover wax . taking the streetcar and finding random wax spots on my leg was pretty damn awkward . also , a big pet peeve was that the girl took soo long , which made it much more painful ! i was soo irritated after . for the price ( very expensive ) , waxers should be a bit more experienced and professional .	228
0	i ca n't say i 've had the opportunity to experience a party - as just trying to book one has been more hassle than what it 's worth . disappointed as i apparently am challenged in trying to communicate what i want and that actually translating . i 'm sure the parties are great - but after 4 phone calls on this to sort through - i give up .	3435
1	as a young professional that does n't want to spend anytime dealing with my pool or cleaning my house , this service is the best . paying one bill for multiple services is so convenient . their customer service is a step above - my experience has been top notch .	2029
1	drive thru donuts on demand . glad to see some classical recipes still serving public to provide sugary baked goods for generations to come	1770
1	soooo excited that earl of sandwich is here ! i rant and rave about this place to all my friends and family but they are never able to try it because it 's out of state . now , it 's here in tempe ! the location is very modern and the staff are super friendly . they are n't kidding when they say it 's the worlds greatest hot sandwich . if i could give more than 5 stars i would ! totally recommended ! the italian is my favorite . you have to try earl ! thanks for coming to tempe ! ! ! i 'm telling everyone to stop by to taste a piece of heaven !	432
1	it is a great school . my daughter loved going and her favorite teacher was ms. stephanie . she was great and they taught my girl how to swim . the manage becca is excellent . hey customer service is outstanding . i recommend this place	2856
1	great price , clean new vehicle , and good customer service . i will definitely rent there again .	3595
0	staff sucked . looked past me and offered to help others behind and beside me that had clearly just walked in . after 10+ minutes of waiting and not one person acknowledging my presence at the counter or that i was clearly there to make a purchase , i left .	3735
1	this placed has tons of stuff from a mascara bar , to some 20+ blowdryers to a bare minerals section . everyone was helpful and kind . loved the opi nail color section and a crazy amount of curling irons and flat irons . i could spend hours in here ! do n't forget to sign up for the rewards program as i received a coupon as soon as i signed up .	2479
0	cheap , tawdry , and dangerous ! great place to run into drug addicts and criminals . it just does n't	1688
0	i thought you opened at 9 ? it 's now 9:30 and i 've called about 8 different times to ask if i can do reservations . disappointed that i ca n't even get a live person on the line to answer a question . you guys must be busy at 9 am to not answer a call . you just lost 2 customers ... .	2823
0	this place is so expensive and they use cheap materials..i did my nails and they only lasted 3 days ! i payed $ 75 for me and my mom and the same thing happened to her . they have students working there , without experience . do n't waste your money and time with this people .	2326
0	we saw a movie here on a thursday evening . it still has the older style seats . they are slightly tiered , but not nearly as much so as a stadium-style theater . and the seats are small and close together . this was the case even though we were in a larger theater . we did n't purchase any snacks at the concession stand , but it looked pretty grubby . it was okay , but definitely not the greatest . it was nice and quiet on the night we went , so i ca n't say how it is when it 's busier .	2450
0	horrible horrible service ! ! the ladies were old and mean . not being stereotype or anything but that is a true description of how they are . they were not helpful at all , very grumpy . i have to ask them to bring out some accessories . before we left we politely said bye to them and not even get the response . too bad it is the only store in toronto carrying vera wang , really did not want to buy anything from them , just because thinking they may get some commission sale from it .	1155
1	great value with the unlimited monthly package . and the free vacuums are great ! they do a great job on getting the dog hair out of my car/canine-transport-vehicle . i used to get my car washed at a not-so-fabulous place , and this car wash does a better job , better price , and much better experience to go there . plus , no one harasses you about getting `` windshield chips '' fixed . i hate that . always get in and out very quickly . professional and courteous employees . will bring all my cars here always .	2093
0	i 'm disappointed with my visit today . in the past , no matter what i have ordered , i have plenty of time as i receive my food rather quickly . today , my waitress was slow and the kitchen was slow enough for a snail to pass it in a race . it took more than 30 minutes for my food to come giving no time to actually eat before my lunch break was over . i might try one more time before giving up completely . last thing ? the guy in front of me was paying and also complaining about the slow service/food .	1504
0	i was n't impressed with this jo-ann 's location . the management was n't very friendly , but the cashiers and other staff were friendly . they lock-up the sharpie oil markers so if you 're looking for them , do n't walk out . just as management and they 'll get them out of the cabinet up front . there is plenty of parking and its not terribly hard to get in-out , but i would n't come here again .	3943
1	food was delicious . a touch pricey for a `` diner '' but worth it one we were eating . service was good too , even when my daughter went into meltdown mode because she did n't want to leave .	975
0	the workers do n't care at all . when i came in a saw them sitting around and chatting . there was no one to help when getting food and in the guy and one of the workers was even sleeping . the place seemed untidy and dirty and the bathroom are disgusting . i will not be coming back here and instead go to gravady or sky zone . terrible service ! !	1095
1	called my insurance to have my car towed for flat tire , scheduled with this towing company . they arrived 30 mins late , was kinda worried after reading their reviews , but it is still fine with me as it was a busy day and time monday morning at 9.00 am . the driver mo was very friendly and helpful , did his job very fast and great . got my car at the shop on time , all without hassle .	2010
0	rude . no customer service . i got there at 4:15 with 1 person ahead of me . they told me bluntly that at 5 they stop cutting so they wo n't be able to cut my hair . i guess they refuse to work past 5 . and this is a place that cuts hair in 15 minutes - it 's basically a greatclips for more money . except greatclips actually sweeps up all the hair clippings as opposed to this messy place .	3624
1	i am a current tenant , renting a home in chandler , for about 8 months . we are going to be looking at renewing our lease for another year here shortly . most of the reason why is the managements quick responses to work orders and the ease to put in work orders via online portal . the house is a tad older so some odd end items come up but that 's expected . so far the best at rental management company i 've had when renting homes in the valley . application process was easy and within a respectable time frame we were given updates etc . online portal for rental payments is a breeze . would recommend to friends/co-workers .	3512
0	gorge was pretty rude . i just came in to trade some games in and he acted like i slapped his mom . he than pretty much begged me to get the game stop card . i would have had he not been a complete a-hole the second i walked in . i will take my store credit elsewhere . he did n't say thank you and threw a little fit when i declined the shopper card . get your act together . not a difficult job to ring people up and act like you are in a good mood .	2687
1	great customer service from the very funny john.. made it tolerable that i waited for 1 hour and 50 mins for an oil change and a brake check.. nothing was done to the brakes.. ridiculous amount of time to wait..	1895
1	this is my first cruise and i was so lucky to get beth . beth answered all my questions was not rushing me off the phone . was very sweet and professional . i honestly thought this was going to be a headache . casablanca express is lucky to have her ! ! ! thank you so much ! !	1777
0	i had to go to this walmart to pick up an online purchase ( the one near my home did n't have it in stock ) . it 's a typical walmart ; but , the location is in a mall and the perception you leave with is not a good one . it 's dingy ( appears dirty ) and extremely overcrowded ( walmart near me is roomier ) and not quite as busy . if i could have given it `` 0 '' stars , i would have ; but , one of the store employees in the fish section was really helpful and very friendly to both me and my 4 year old ( worth two stars ) . : - )	2141
1	this place has been great , our dogs have been loving this place ! the people are very kind and we even got a good grooming . the prices are very reasonable ! recommended	2679
1	i love the menus at aroma , no matter what the location ; but , it 's the people at yonge & pleasant that make the big difference . arta , katelynn & the team are super efficient and are a pleasure to see every morning ! today was the one-year anniversary and what a treat to receive a free coffee to celebrate . thanks everyone !	1096
1	the chipotle here is excellent , i get the carnitas burrito and its amazeballs . i get it with the with the brown rice , lettuce extra cheese , hot sauce and sour cream along with some green peppers and onions . if you need a wonderful burrito in your life you should stop by here . the lines can get a little crazy so you 'll need to watch out for those .	214
1	the guy working on my car decided to tear off the bottom of my jack in the box receipt to steal the part where you get two free tacos for completing a survey and was nice enough to leave it in my drivers seat for me to find . wow . i called the shop and spoke to cliff , he said he would talk to the tech about it . i 'm happy with the service otherwise .	2552
1	such a grear place , we had a great time . not crowded but a good amount of people . the drimks we 're good and not too expensive ... very nice club so much better thsn the big ones on the strip ! we went 2 nights in a row ! we will def come back .	849
0	nope , never again . had n't been here in a long time , but thought we 'd give it a shot . wrong decision . had the wings ... no taste , sauce was lacking flavor . this is the kind of place that charges you extra for blue cheese or ranch if you ask for both . that 's so tacky ! ! wife had the haddock which she said was decent . service from older red headed lady was bad . we were an inconvenience to her . checked on us once , then the check . if you hate it that bad sister , go on to the house ! ! disappointed and will not return ! !	1248
1	i 've been going to your car wash for over s year and just want to thank you for the great service . my car always looks great and the staff is so friendly . i met the owner on s busy weekend and he was so great and i enjoy coming back . thank you so much	1502
0	needed 2 beds to sleep 4 people . received a room with one bed and a chair . no cot or extra blankets available . this is extremely disappointing . we have a 10 hour drive ( with a toddler ! ) ahead of us tomorrow , and no restful night 's sleep to go on . that 's really all i have to say . do n't stay here if you can help it .	1195
0	heads up - people with a peanut allergy . they cook with peanut oil . hard to believe in today 's day and age that a higher end restaurant would do that . unfortunate as i bet that will have an impact on heir business . what a shame . good luck . i hope you make it .	1105
1	kenneth and nate were awesome ! they arrived on time and as soon as they stepped off the truck they were loading my stuff immediately . i would highly recommend them to anyone moving .	2473
0	the whole store is filthy . look at the carpets in the photos , every isle had trash and dirt and stains all over the floor . if the health department visited them they 'd probably be shut down . it 's cool that everything is only $ 1 . but the other dollar trees are not filthy like this one .	2446
0	it started out great ! i requested several quotes on clean-up landscaping and jake was extremely quick to respond . he quoted me a fair price and i accepted . we scheduled for last wednesday and he texted me saying he had a blow-out and asked if we could reschedule for saturday . although i was hosting an event that day and not able to meet him at the property , i installed venmo so i could send him money after receiving pictures of the cleaned-up landscaping . on saturday , he had another vehicle issue and asked if we could reschedule for monday . monday came and gone - no contact , no nothing . so ... time to move on to another landscaper !	1409
1	excellent night out on first friday : great drinks & sweet atmosphere ... it definitely lived up to all the great reviews here . and since it 's in my hood , i 'll be frequenting this place again & again .	3562
0	sadly , i live in aliante and think that my association dues go to keep up with this park . however , it 's always so busy with people that do not belong that my kids can never enjoy it . if people would learn to respect property or others it would be a decent park . sad , it 's walking distance .	367
0	i have received some very good coffee here , to their credit . but no drive through sucks and they still have too small of a seating area like most sbs . there is a peets right across the street and i believe a steep n brew just down the road . i 'm going to try there from now on and see who can win my business .	1934
1	friendly bartenders , a highly eclectic decor , reasonable prices . ca n't comment on the food as i drank my dinner there , but i 'd definitely come back .	2956
0	disappointed . i had purchased a groupon and went online to schedule . i arrived to my appointment and the tech walked out of suite about 5 til my appointment time . she returned 10 minutes later . still not acknowledging me if i was her next client . needless to say i did n't stick around after that . i will contact groupon for a refund . will not recommend this place to anyone and will let everyone know how clients are treated	1875
0	this place is a joke . i was absolutely disgusted with their service and their inability to paint nails correctly . she used 5 coats then immediately used the fast drying polish which then smudged my polish . she walked away while they were drying and did n't have the decency to see the disgusting finished product .	619
0	really not impressed with the quality of ingredients they use on their pizza - i paid 35 $ for a pizza that looked very generic nothing wow or fresh about it - the asparagus seemed from a can all dead and soggy when they should have had some crunchiness on . i 've had had better pizza at those 2-1 pizzerias i 've given 2 chances to this place that supposedly is amazing but frankly if you expectations are high you will be highly disappointed with a frustration of wasting money on bad quality food-	411
0	walked around the whole store and nobody approached me , not even once ! ! obviously they do n't wa n't my business . i 'm even writing this review as i try one of their couches and after this i am walking right out .	264
0	green grotto use to be my go to bbt joint in sauga . however the service has gone down hill . they take forever to take my order . the drinks are watered down and the slush is not blended well and contains big chunks of ice . they ran out of tapioca regularly . it is pricey for the poor quality . i use to come for the atmosphere but now it is usually crowded and takes forever to get a seat . the food is n't even that great . u could do better green grotto ! ! ! ! ! i 'm disappointed ! !	344
1	service & yogurt are both great . there at least once a week . wish taro was always in stock & that fruit selection a little bigger . however still the best around .	885
1	i just had a pedicure with dora . fantastic job . highly recommended .	2148
1	i have never had a bad experience at this location , and i 've been coming here since it opened ( not sure what the other reviews are talking about ) . we have a few favorite servers we ask for by name . if we try something that is n't great , we let them know . but that is rare . and usually if we try something new they are promoting , the servers will tell you if it is a good item or not so good ( so if you are n't sure , ask them ) . the servers are always attentive and fun . they take care of us and really do great with our 5 yr old .	1504
1	order the jun 's special , it gas beef , chicken , pork , korean ribs , rice , salad , and rice . it 's really good and worth every penny . we usually go to north vegas to get a good korean food , and since we discovered this one , we can just stay around henderson to get one .	435
0	service was terrible , drinks are waaay overpriced and i could n't taste the booze . better off staying at the slots for drinks .	2634
0	i wish i could give this a zero but i cant . called to get an estimate for a leaky water valve on my toilet . i could n't even get an estimate and the guy who answered was a jerk . do n't bother calling this place . 104.7 kiss fm needs to stop endorsing this place because they suck ! ! !	1473
1	i got the mushroom burger . it was very filling and definitely bursting with umami , but there was some pink in the middle , which i am not a fan of . the fries were okay .	964
0	hi : i have just learned that a pit bull up for adoption has attacked an employee in the last 48 hours . i am not sure if it is at this location or the other . if you are adopting , please be sure to inquire if the dog you want , which was in isolation , is this one .	1980
0	chicken tandori & chicken marsala not worth it at all . we wo n't be back . full bar but no martini ? ? service was soooooo slow it took forever for the food & our check ! ! only thing good was the nan ! ! !	600
1	needed dinner on a saturday night and did n't want anything crazy expensive . we loved this place . the beer was good and the food was great . when we walked in it was packed yet we were seated right away . i would definitely come here again and try a pizza bread .	670
0	i live in las vegas and i travel for a living so it 's quite surprising that i 've never been here before but i never have been . the menu has never looked appealing to me so i 've never stopped here but i did today . i waited 9 minutes for my glass of water . after that i ordered a hamburger well-done . took one bite of my almost raw hamburger and sent it back . the waitress did n't look thrilled with me sending my food back but she had to agree that they hamburger was raw . ... i 'm still waiting on my hamburger	369
0	it was obvious that the toilet bowl or seat had not been cleaned . new room please ! however , i have little faith that any of the rooms are actually clean , based on my first experience . the room was 80 degrees when i checked in , and the ac is so ancient that after cranking it up all the way for 30 minutes , it only went down about 2 degrees . hotels.com had this rated as a 3 star hotel . i 'm not sure how . i wo n't be back .	1888
0	stay away . the food was not that great plus the long hair blonde waitress was not great and very cold . she made excuses why our food was so late and blamed everyone else . i think she put the order late . she was not nice to the male server who needed help . she is the worst server i ever met . so , stay away from her . lesson learned . i will stick to ihop , at least everyone is nice there , 100 percent of the time .	1504
1	they do n't have as much selection of costco . i also think they are missing some of the programs costco offers such as the auto buying program . still though , the prices are great . i easily make up the membership fee just by buying gas . they have great return policies . for under $ 4 you can buy a hotdog , drink , and a slice of pizza . they do n't take visa or mastercard credit cards ( but will take debit ) , but costco has similar policies so i ca n't complain too much about that . one advantage sam 's has over costco is that it is a lot less crowded .	2172
1	my husband and i took his car in for an oil change this weekend . priuses are very sensitive and when they did my oil change the oil filter cap did n't get put back on just right . so then the map mechanism for the car shut the whole car down . nobody could figure out what the problem was so we had the car towed to the dealer . they figured it out right away . i do pray seek for the tow on the receipt for the will change back to the manager ( jeff ) at walmart , and he took care of everything ! great job ! he made everything all better !	3825
0	some of the rudest staff i 've ever encountered . the bartenders were bitchy and patrick and brandon at the door were unfriendly and treat people poorly . would n't go back and felt the need to let everyone know .	2554
1	love costco , but the other customers are a bunch of rude jerks . i am not sure if the other locations are like this or is it specific to scottsdale . pushy and blocking every aisle stuffing thier ever fattening faces with the free samples . on the positive side , all things costco are great quality and value . i enjoy that aspect very much . and the berry sundae 's do n't suck either .	1102
1	this is one of the nicer cvs stores in the nw and central phoenix areas . i 've probably been to at least two dozen of them west of the 51 . the night cashier , ronald , is funny and friendly . this used to be in an older store in the stripmall , behind the circle k , but now it has its own brand-new building a few hundred yards to the west . i 've also had a few scripts filled here and it 's better than most cvs pharma experiences . they also have 20 cent/gallon water .	3044
1	it 's been three years , and i 'm still using triple m. time for a review update ! i really ca n't say enough good things about michael and his patience while my husband and i slowly manage to send him all of our paperwork . the office is in a beautiful building , his email response time impeccable and he helps you get the most from your refund . death and taxes , man ... they 're inevitable , so you might as well do them with someone awesome like the fine folks at triple m .	3146
0	you would n't think that a movie theater in such a nice area would attract trashy people , but there was a 20 something year old guy talking on his cell phone in the middle of the movie . i asked him to get off his phone and he just shrugged at me . i told the manager and all he did was check on him throughout the movie to make sure he was n't still talking . he never said anything to him ! i think i 'll stick to the galaxy luxury theater where they kick people out of movies for that kind of behavior .	2000
0	we came here on 6/24/2015 at 8:24 pm for the 79 cent slushes and the machine was broken ! he said `` the machine is n't working , it 's coming out just water '' . things happen i know , but the wait was 5 minutes and we finally get to the window to order , then it 's broken .	994
0	i have been to this location a couple of times , has n't been superb service but not terrible . this time was the absolute worst experience , the lady was in the middle of cleaning up and continued to clean for 3-5 minutes before she walked to the register and said what do you want . i gave her my order and proceeded to pull up my starbucks app to pay while she walked away and continued to clean then came back and scanned my phone , made my drinks and did n't look or say anything to me when she handed me my drinks . she just turned around and walked away .	2589
1	drive thru , avoid going in there . i always get the hawaiian blizzard ! yumo	25
1	awesome food , i have the beef kofta and chicken kabob with rice and salad . good was very fresh and the staff was friendly and helpful in describing the the different dishes . will definitely be back soon	808
0	i am literally sitting in the parking lot writing this . the store was dead and the store manager robert was so busy chit chatting on the phone with ramon letting him know that they do n't have rv batteries that he could n't even acknowledge me standing there waiting to buy windshield wipers . i 'll take my business elsewhere from now on .	721
1	this place 's renovation is surreal , comparing to the other one location . the rice boxes are super good . and i mean super good . for the drinks , i have only tried the hot milk tea , pretty smooth and rich in flavor . and this place is location at the ground floor of the mall , which gives me a chance to walk around after eating , not to mention there is a movie theatre .	2971
0	this place is so slow ! it 's ridiculous how long the wait is ! ! i 've never been out of here with my kids in less than 2 hours . how is it possible to run so far behind ! i have to come here too every 3 months just to get my child a dang referral to the specialist ! i have better things to do with my time away from work than wait .	2461
1	my favourite canadian fast food chain ! i came here on sunday night while in need of a quick bite for the ride back to buffalo and it was a great idea . i came in around 10:30pm and was in need of a slice of pizza and some chicken wings and that 's exactly what i got . the pizza was good for what it was and the wings were crunchy and hot , so also very good . overall , pizza pizza is another typical pizza type chain that might not be for everyone , but it is certainly for me !	379
1	i 've been patronising george c. since it 's opening at hazelton in 2007 and have nothing but great things to say about the store and service . george the owner has an eye for picking up the smaller brands for the toronto market and his staff ( i shop in the men 's section ) has always been most friendly . i recently purchase d a blazer at 50 % off sale and jp offered the alterations and made sure it was done right the 2nd time , all for free when most stores charge alterations on discount items .	559
0	i was convinced to go here by some girlfriends . holy gawd , it was the lamest show ever . for the $ 50 ticket admission price , i 'd rather get a lap dance at the spearmint rhino . bad choreography , desperate screaming women , cheesy firemen costumes and short steroided australian men bored me to tears . but then again , you might like it . not my type . where 's my drink ?	2149
0	this place was an absoulte dump ! i went to get a nice dress shirt and it looked like a bomb hit that section ! i should have taken a picture ! words ca n't describe it , worse then walmart ! the employees are absoultely rude , when i asked to use the dressing room they said that this is the girls and the guys is across the store and it is common sense ! how about some signs other then dressing rooms you twits ! this is absoulte rubbish and i 'll never again return to this store or khols stores ever again !	3896
0	normally we have had a good family experience here . but to respond to the snotty dark haired hostess : 1 ) no , i did not know the no wait app was only for your seville location 2 ) yes , i know its march madness - thats actually why i brought my family with me 3 ) then to ask the people behind me if they want a table and not me guarentees we will not be back for a long long long time .	428
1	i love this place for chinese food . i am from the east coast and i was always trying to find a place that even compares to what you get in boston or new york.this place is as close as you will get and they are so fast with delivery.i always get my food within 30 minutes and it is steaming hot . they are always friendly.i have never had a problem and my order is always correct.. i had given up on chinese food in this area ... ..and then i found them and so happy that i did . they are as close to new york and boston as i will get in this area .	420
1	i am so happy with my purchase . the salesman was very helpful and i felt no pressure to buy when i was in the store . the delivery was exactly on time and the men were professional . my love seat looks great ! i would definitely purchase from ashley again !	3738
1	the food came out very quickly and was fresh and tasty . however our order was very wrong , both sizes ordered as well actual items ordered . they did make it right without hesitations .	148
1	hexx is a great ice cream stop on the strip ! lots of different flavors with generous portions . the service was impeccable and we were in and out within minutes !	3722
0	worst experience ever . even the owner is rude . save yourselves some time and look for another place ! ! ... . business name is not accurate because i do regret coming here ...	845
1	it 's just another mcdonald 's with food that you 've come to know and love . i know what to expect and they always deliver . i went here for my normal dinner before running a local marathon . i ordered a big mac meal plus a quarter pounder deluxe . mcdonald 's french fries are the best ! no other place has better fries ! the cashier that took my order was nice and friendly . the food was ready and brought out in a few minutes . i 'm lovin ' it ! : )	1023
0	ok ... ..i tried for 3 weeks to give this car wash another chance after all i have been coming here for 2 years ... i do n't know if it 's changed owners . but every sunday like clock work they only have 3 people working and there 's an hour wait to get your car washed . this completely unacceptable it 's the weekend that 's when you should have everyone working . when you ask for a manager to express your frustration there always unavailable . so for me 3 strikes and your out no more ... . # done ! ! fabulous freddy 's here i come ! ‍‍	2359
1	beautiful property and the backsplash is gorgeous . need to see more of what they offer , but from the looks it 's a great complex .	1897
1	service is usually fast food is great and i can never get enough of there drinks there 's so many choices that i get blown away everytime .	994
0	well , back to zero with this place . the service writer that took care of me is gone , the guy that replaced him is a total a $ $ hole , they 're charging 20 % more per hour of labor than most other dealers and more hours for the same job . i unfortunately have both a bmw and a triumph and these joker 's are the only game in town for either . management must be a real pita to work for as they cant keep staff and the ones who are there have an attitude a mile thick .	94
0	what a joke ! ! 12 weeks for a couch and they deliver it with wrong legs and parts and pillows missing ! and shocker ca n't get a phone call back ! stay away from purchasing here at all cost i would rather go to california and give them more money than dealing with such an unprofessional company	439
0	these guys are extremely rude . second time i have been over here and dealt with many different managers who have zero customer service . all i needed was a change of battery but the attitude i encountered from when i first walked in made me take my business elsewhere . needless to say i got top notch service just down the street . never coming back here again .	3834
0	not too good . we go to antique shops all over the area and this is one of the least interesting . too many overpacked booths with too many small , odd items . nothing really of any interest here . i guess if you live in chandler , this works for ya . i would recommend expanding your search to mesa , at the very least . this is a one and done for me .	1563
0	apparently in the city of phoenix , child abuse is fully acceptable as long as there are no marks on the child . despite it being a yet to be 2 year old being punched by a grown , 40 year old man .	2322
1	today i got my nipple pierced by ana and as ( mostly ) everyone here has stated she is amazing ! pain is of course different for everyone and ana put me at ease . everyone/everything was very professional and clean . will definitely go back and also recommend to everyone i know !	2895
1	i had the pistachio rose with coconut topping in a single serving cup . i enjoyed it 's flavour with the banana base and the crunchy coconut texture . the price point is definitely something i would treat this as an once in a while special healthy treat instead of somewhere i would go every day .	1134
1	easy to find , close parking , very affordable for quality of service . offered a free scrub for checking into yelp app which i was already on before i got there . nice , quiet , peaceful .	2399
1	good thai food for me . fresh tastes and good portions . i had friend who never had thai food before and really liked it . i saw reviews that were mediocre , but i really thought the food had a really good taste and wonder what the difference between their meals and mine were . i 've been around many thai places around the us and thought they had very fresh food that had great flavor . i had red curry with fresh rolls and thai rolls . all had great taste and the sauces were good too . fresh rolls with fresh mint are the best ! if you have a meal like mine you wo n't be disappointed .	50
0	`` hey man what 's the crowd like inside ? ... ... mixed bag . 20 year olds 35 year olds '' definitely not . they conveniently forget to tell you that they drop off university kids by the bus load . not the place for a night out if you 're over 25	1282
1	this is a great little locally owned restaurant in the lake norman area of charlotte nc . i had the burger and it was delicious , fresh , and cooked perfectly to order . it has a great interior and friendly service on top of the great burger . another great restaurant that i highly recommend trying in cornelius .	1046
1	love the crepes , fresh fruit and whipped cream ! chocolate dipped cheesecakes , and great service . very family friendly place .	762
1	great staff and accommodations for meetings . looking forward to planing next year 's meeting here again . the banquet staff was prompt & quick to resolve issues . they even offered solutions to potential issues in advance . meeting attendees all raved about the quality of the meals .	587
1	i 've been here several times . yes , it can get busy on the weekends . but if you have the chance to go earlier on a weekday morning ( they open at 6am ) , please do so . my usual menu selection is the greek omlet however i decided to try the bologna egg and cheese sandwich this last time . both items are highly recommended , delicious and cheap .	406
1	thanks donnie ! nice driver and very helpful -- he is the shuttle driver and the shuttle was very clean .	3576
1	very classy pizza joint . you can not order by the slice ... just personal pies ... you get to pick your dough , sauce , cheese and toppings ... delicious ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i had this multiple times when i stayed at the sls hotel . so freaking good ! i am actually craving it right now .	282
0	the experience was very cool but our flight time was reduced to to 1 minute instead of a 1.5 minutes because they were behind . when we asked why we had less time than everyone else they said it was because they paid for more . they told us ahead of time that they were running behind but reducing our flight time so that the team can get off on time is n't right . it was a fun experience but will not do again .	3736
0	i used to go here all the time , and recently craved for it . got taro milk tea with boba . boba was overcooked , and falling apart , and the milk tea taste so powdery . wasnt a pleasant taste , and feel to the mouth . feel like the quality went down . if it starts to become like this , i probably will find a new spot somewhere else .	490
0	will not return ! service is horrible . stood at the front door for 15 minutes before anyone even came up to me . was seated right beside the door so , i froze to death . they served us pink chicken wings and they said it was the marinate they use . the marinate they use ? what kind of marinate makes the inside of a chicken wing pink ? horrible and completely unorganized service . i also asked for a glass of water 5 times and finally got it after the 5th time	733
0	room pictures in the website do not match with the room ! just like the burger you get always not the same as it was advertised . lady at front desk keep on explains to us because all rooms was booked , can not give us the room we booked on line ! anyway finally she give us a room that was all the way in the back , that was much smaller room ! what we get was not worth the money we pay for !	3091
1	the staff here are all nice and the food is fairly priced ! i love their pastries most especially the cookies ! it gets pretty busy around 6-8ish , so try to go there at a later time . will definitely recommend this place to anyone who 's counting calories before they eat !	148
0	been here a few times and have been disappointed with management / employees . today i went to make a simple return which took about 15 minutes . i waiting in line until finally someone who was just standing around decided to help out at the register . during this 15 minutes at the counter she called me `` hun '' and `` sweetheart '' maybe 5 times - unprofessional . she did not know how to make a return and had to ask for help . teach your employees at the register how to make simple returns and how to treat valuable customers professionally .	3153
0	this place sucks , they cant even get their billing right . i 'm sure i 've been over charged as they are so greedy they come with every conceivable way to charge for this and that . you 'll see , go there . over 6 months since i 've been there and i 'm still getting bills from this place . look , this is it , you will never see me in your overrated office again . i will never go there or ever recommend this place . i 'll only say this , jimmy the pa was a nice guy , that 's it .	3598
0	i heard the mall is getting renovated i do n't know why you have driven out all the shops that i liked i only shop at the anchor stores now i wo n't even go in the mall anymore it 's a waste of time it 's full of teenagers and teenagers are n't the ones with the money wake up and smell the coffee you idiots . it 's a ghetto mall !	2815
0	the previous time we visited for lunch i thought was decent but maybe because my expectations were low . their taiwanese chicken is still good but everything else on the plate was bland and the rice was way over cooked . service was non existent .	176
1	came to get a facial for the first time . i got a deep cleaning facial . the ladies were welcoming and very informative . it felts soooooo good . she sucked out all my dirt and grime from my face . i fell asleep after she applied my peel mask ; ) that 's how relaxed i was . upon leaving my face felt sooo good . took a shower later that evening and i could tell a difference as i touched my face . a lot more soft and smoother . will be coming back for more facials .	2647
1	staff is very friendly and attentive , the weight loss program works great . nikki is the best ! she rocks !	297
0	i did not even try the food , why ? because the way the people that work there talk to me told me they did not wanted to work there . rude and just for the money people . then i came to yelp to see their reviews , i knew these were going to be low , and they were low . i can tell you , it is difficult to ruin a simple burrito , but if you have the wrong people on it , they will ruin anything ! to the owner : `` take care of your place ! ''	623
1	pixy cakes made the wedding cake for our wedding at secret garden . they helped us make the decisions on the design when we were n't sure what to go with and they were flexible when we wanted to make changes . the wedding cake looked absolutely stunning at the reception . we could n't ask for a more beautiful cake . the cake also tasted great too !	1806
0	the gentleman who gave me a pedicure was angry at my feet . it was definitely painful but i anticipate they 'll look good after they heal . nine out of 10 toes have visible wounds . the massage chair attempted to violate me . it was the first chair i have experienced that attacks your butt hole . no intended humor , it 's a fact .	2686
1	excellent . broth is fantastic . i had nishikawa black ramen and it was as good as any asian noodle dish i 've ever had . ok , i 'm lying . it was better than any asian noodle dish i 've ever had . not particularly inexpensive at around $ 10 a bowl , but totally worth it .	131
1	looking for a mercedes and/or a new/used car ? ! i 100 % recommend this dealership . no hassle , no pressure . my wife and i bought a car two weeks ago and never once felt pressured into making a decision we were n't ready to make . from beginning to end , the experience was impeccable . do n't take my word for it , go experience it for yourself . ask for peter . tell him i sent you ... that is the sales person that gave us the wonderful experience . with that being said , thank you , peter . : )	1557
1	i come to chicas quite a bit.. the girls are cool and laid back i usually just tip the girls on stage but there 's a sexy black girl name mercedes i must say very hot ! she took me to do private dances let 's just say i will be back every day just for her other than that play good music not the fanciest place but a lot of hot chicas	3751
0	food was horrible ... and service was even worse . all food was over salted and tasted horrible . it did n't seem fresh at all . had to wait multiple times for drink refills . had to wait 10 minutes for waiter to pick up our bill . `` budd '' ... u might want to find a different line of work !	560
0	horrible horrible company they been to my house about i do n't how many times for the same problem so they blamed it on nv enrrgy . nv energy came out and figured it out right out which had nothing to do with them the guy told me i need a new electrician . oh and if they need to make holes to get work done they do n't do patch work so your stuck with super big holes thru out your house . true story	1867
0	i 've passed this place a few times and today we decided to give it a try . the service was very slow , the food took even longer . i had a ham and cheese omelette and my ham was charred and the omelette tasted so so . it 's a cute diner but the menu selection for breakfast is ok. just simple things like pancakes , french toast , eggs , and omelettes . it 's not spectacular like a few other places around town . i do n't think we will be going back . the waitresses do n't really pay attention and do n't come around very often .	406
0	c'est ok. not somewhere i would return to or order from in future . chose it for convenience ( was in the neighbourhood on labour day ) . friendly and fast , but average quality and overpriced .	649
1	i have n't been in too many sprouts , but this has to have been the nicest one so far . great service , very clean and organized and have found this to be my favorite place to get fresh and beautiful flowers for a very great price . also a good place to get healthy snacks and fruit . there is one closer to my house , but since we were in the area i stopped in to pick up some flowers and fruit .	304
0	i have definitely experienced better . i had read the reviews on the tipping part , they are pushy about it but i left my tip in the room on the table in an envelope . when she asked , i told her and she ran to the room to retrieve it . she returned , seemed disappointed that i gave her $ 10 , sorry but that is what i thought was fair .	2320
1	we just had our first service and we are amazed at the results . the staff was very thorough and did an excellent job . the owner was prompt , responsive and was willing to work within my timeframe and budget . i am glad to have hired them .	2424
0	we bought a box of 20 macarons , ate some of them in the restaurant together with an eclair and flan . the place is pretty old and clean but smells like cheap cleaning material . when we got home , we tried to eat our leftover macarons but to our disappointment they all tasted `` cheap cleaning materials '' . the smell of the cleaning products was in the box of macarons ! we have to throw them all away coz it was so disgusting ! not recommended !	284
1	seriously go here asap of you like hotdogs . no really . go now . the bulgogi hotdog is great and the gangnam is better . a hotdog and half an order of fries is plenty fill you up ! also is a 10 % off yelp coupon if you check in .	1566
1	this gym is always clean . the equipment is always in good shape and working . i personally enjoy spending time in the pool and steam room . their juice bar is amazing , great smoothies.the staff is always accommodating .	3268
1	since i moved out of the area , i miss a lot about madison . one of the things i really miss is monty 's . i made a point to bring several friends here and their assessment of this diner-gone-upscale was good as well . the food is diner classics with an updated touch as well as a few things that are probably best described as new american . the food is excellent , especially the numerous vegan and vegetarian options . the ambiance is clean and bright ; the service good . the only downsides are that the wait can be long , especially on weekend mornings , and parking is limited .	975
1	the experience i received at this store was amazing . i had originally gone in quite frustrated , and thinking of switching companies ... . i left feeling relieved and will stay with cox demetrius was amazing , had us in and out and even walked us to the door !	2633
1	great atmosphere ! friendly service ! professional cuts and even do razor fades . they give $ 5 off for military . worth a visit .	2467
0	my dog has cushings disease and his vet started him on trilostane whic , is a compounded rx that we ordered from this pharmacy . after 2 months and hundreds of $ $ , our dogs health declined as his cushings grew worse . on thursday aug. 17 , 2017 we get a call from this pharmacy stating that they have suspended their trilostane shipments due to `` quality assurance '' issues with this medication . beware of this place . lawyer contacted .	2827
1	i move to vegas 2 years ago from los angeles . every stylist i went to ruined my hair . i was about to give up until i purchased a groupon for the boulevard salon . i checked on yelp and saw the reviews for jessica so i made my appt with her . all i have to say is wow ! ! ! ! ! jessica nailed the haircut . best haircut i have ever had . i get so many compliments . i have been back twice with the same results and am so happy to find a stylist who knows what they are doing .	636
1	great , kid friendly office . amazing and sweet staff . dr. brown is great with making sure your kiddo is comfortable . highly recommend !	3301
0	i am officially done with this ewc location . i 'm not sure who manages this business , but clearly not someone who values relationships nor its experienced employees . in less than 6 months , i have seen 5 really good people go . and i do n't appreciate being lied to about their reason for leaving . they have established clientele and would not just up and leave out of the blue . switching locations despite being further from home .	2300
1	i go to happy feet at east town mall when i need a last minute foot massage and back massage and ca n't get in with my regular therapist . amy does an amazing deep muscle massage ! she hits on all the pressure points and really gets the knots out ! i like that you can walk in without an appointment . the mall now offers many more stores and options . jcpenny now has a sephora inside their store .	2594
0	do not stay here . robbery ring for which sheraton refuses to be responsible . stolen luggage not compensated . if you want to leave with what you came with and be safe do n't stay here .	3166
1	their salads and bowls are incredibly filling , healthy , and delicious . the best healthy food option in the neighbourhood by far .	9
1	great sandwiches ... .some ppl say the neighborhood is sketchy ... .but the ppl are harmless and add character . sandwiches are legit , you 'll never want subway again	3820
0	for the love of god , stay away . we were greeted with a frown and the look of disappointment only considering there was only one other family there besides mine .	1029
0	sorta mediocre , never been impressed , would n't go here unless someone else wanted to go . have n't found a dish i liked .	534
1	second time here and bought this piece from a very helpful worker ivan . he was very knowledgeable and fun to interact with . definitely a reason we 'll be back . plus the quality of all their products are amazing and reasonably priced ! ! ! definitely a go to place ! i am very satisfied and i 'm sure everyone will be !	1025
1	the hotel itself was a great choice for our girls weekend in the city of toronto . i 'm not typically one to jump to yelp ( for the good or the bad ) but what brings me here is the amazing above and beyond customer service my group received from dave the concierge . dave flawlessly guided us through an experience to remember in the city , our one regret of the weekend being that we strayed from the path and went to the worst night club any of us had ever been to ( tryst nightclub , not recommended by dave and we instantly regretted the decision ) . would stay in the hilton again specifically to view more of dave 's toronto .	73
1	the bread , brownies and hazelnut cake are over the top in my book - well worth the steep prices ! the panini 's are always good here too and they have offer a lot of other great lunch items . the last time i was in they also had a breakfast sandwich - which sounded very yummy . you ca n't go wrong with mj 's bread - best in the valley ! the cupcakes on the other hand were dry and somewhat bland . yes , the icing is good but i like to taste the cake too .	1125
1	were here for spring training and stumbled upon this place . oh man , it 's the best ! today special was all you can eat beef ribs , 2 sides and a salad . the best ! ! ! they have a special everyday . wish this place were in our town in gilroy , ca	144
0	this place is clean and they use sanitary products , so from that standpoint i would give them a 5 . however , no one is friendly and the whole staff pretty much ignores you when you walk in . also , dont bother making an appointment because they do n't honor your time . i made an appointment for 4:15 and did n't actually have someone start working on my pedicure until 4:45 . i would understand the wait if i was a walk in customer , but if you have an appointment you assume you will actually be seen at that time .	1429
0	this place sucks . frank the so called manager is lazy as hell . thay allways make mistakes.never have a host at night time .only one cook gettin slammed in the back.manager just sits back and enjoys the shit show.. what a joke feel bad for the people who work for this dump	1504
1	best artisan pizza in existence ! the dough is delicious , the ingredients are premium quality , and they bake it in an actual wood burning oven in minutes , right in front of you . people who said the crust was n't soft or the cheese did n't melt ( lol ) would be better off with pizzahut , seriously . i love 800 and i only go to other pizza places when it 's late at night and the 800 is already closed . and i must add i 'm never completely satisfied with other pizzas , nothing stands close to 800 for me .	282
1	yay ! i became a fan after my first visit . honey did my eyebrows and cut my hair . i got a l'oreal treatment before i got my cut to ease the frizziness . i absolutely love my cut and my hair is shiny . my mom thought i had dyed my hair at first glance . this place is huge with lots of staff . apparently they 've been in business for more than 30 years . i 'm definitely going there again . honey has 10 % off on blow drying and women 's cut on wednesdays .	1813
1	i have been there in the past and by far , much better experience this time . i was there when they had give away deals and feed lunch . it is cleaning up , but the perfect location for me !	1408
1	great place ! love their boba and the atmosphere here . their calamari is pretty good too	490
1	i love this place ! romantic , sexy , great staff , and the food is delish ! definitely my go too spot in vegas for indian food !	600
1	normally come in here and get banana splits we tried something different tonight we got the thing called the waffle bowl sundaes ( turtle ) actually this pretty good .	25
1	omg ! ! ! why are these cookies so addicting ? and why do they they serve them warm , so they immediately melt in your mouth ? uh ... so i thought i was on a diet ! stopped here because a colleague of mine said we have to go to insomnia when we 're in pittsburgh ! well this was a lot better than visiting the local stadiums ! insomnia cookies you have stolen my heart ... maybe i can order some via fedex ! lol , idk that they 'll stay warm ... until next time ! ! ! fyi do the six pack , anything less you 'll regret it !	181
0	3rd strike your out . rude employees ! ! they never put enough cheese so i always ask for extra cheese ! 20 minutes for pick up . boom there to pick up and wait another 15 minutes . get home not extra cheese ! call and they are so rude ! solution come back in 10 minutes and we will give you a new one . honestly they should have deliver at no charge ! but just based on how rude they were i do n't think i 'll ever go there again ! !	192
1	they always goes above and beyond on customer 's request and expectation ; always patient and deliver with a smile . when you 're looking for real estate or want to work in an incredible real estate office this is the team that can take care of you . great place to buy & sell real estate with helpful and professional agents .	1578
1	my experience here was a good one . very clean dealership . the employees are very professional and nice . my service guy was gary . he was very knowledgable , he definitely knows his land rovers . i received outstanding service from him . i will definitely be back here for my futures services .	2659
0	i am very disappointed with the customer service . my family and i went in looking for a new dining table and we were not approached once by the staff . i almost felt like it was because of our appearance . we wanted to buy a specific set but not one employee asked us anything . we were there for a total of 45 minutes before we left .	439
0	charges an unnecessary 4.7 % cnf tax . did n't even know about it until i got home from my trip and looked at my receipt .	3722
0	i 've never done this before and usually brush off any bad experiences i have . this location was beautifully set up , and had an awesome happy hour and maybe it had something to do with it being busy ? i have to say i was pretty embaressed i invited some people here to have drinks and dinner i had probably the worst all around service i 've ever had . they were either under staffed or the waitress we had was miserable but mmm we had three different waitresses and they were all the same miserable ! sorry to you loyal customers but i will never go back : (	1520
1	pho-king amazing . i 'm wary of food in vegas , and this place was absolutely fantastic . i got a mixed seafood pho and it was really good . pretty easy to get to from the strip , and great service .	673
1	pv mall is just what you would expect from a mall , except it does have a added bonus : an indoor carousel and a nicely lite children 's play area . for those two things , it 's worth the extra drive from your run of the mill mall near you . if you want to take your little one to the play area , park in front of the starbucks and it 's just down the way . if you want the carousel only , park near the food court . carousel rides are just $ 1 , cash only for that though . you have to insert your money into a machine for a token . hope that helps !	2815
0	i really want to like this place , but i have never had that `` omg , this is awesome ! ! '' moment in the 4 times i 've been there . yay : *food and dessert selection is yummy *free wi-fi *independently owned blah : *tables are hard to get *service often takes a while *honestly , not a fan of the coffee *lighting is weird ( ca n't relax & ca n't work well ) i will come back if i need to be in mission to meet up with someone , but only because i 'd rather support a local business than the starbucks across the road .	1035
0	nope , not that great . seriously . for a $ 1.75 for a very small taco , not worth the price . everything here is actually overpriced ! people have told me to just eat the tacos not the plates , burritos , tostadas , etc . cause you might get food poisoning . eh . i would ratehr go to another taco place down the street .	857
0	brought my dog in for a relatively minor procedure . he had a skin tumor that needed to be removed due to excessive bleeding . he had no other problems beyond that upon arrival for surgery . a little over two weeks later , after severe pain and suffering , i had to put him down . he had a bad infection that got into his nervous system causing horrific symptoms , loss of use of his back legs , severe contortion of his spine . when i brought him in to address these acute onset infection symptoms the doctor was dumbfounded , stating that it was just a coincidence . i do n't believe in coincidences . : (	1980
0	use to be a good place to eat with generous friendly staff . not anymore went in today and the lady behind the counter looked annoyed that i had come in . she was just plain nasty .	1629
1	the pharmacy is great ! there prices are great if you have the pay cash for your prescription . and all the techs and pharmacists are very friendly .	3638
1	rosie and nancy are such kind ladies who always greet me with a gentle smile and a loving posture . they absolutely get that they 're not just selling quality food , they 're selling an atmosphere of friendship and loyalty . there 's a reason we always return to our mom 's house to visit ; it 's because of the good food and love we feel . that 's why i return to panera at ocotillo . thanks ladies . : ) ps . the cheddar cheese and broccoli soup is delish when it 's cool out ! : )	148
1	i love louis vuitton and the fashion square store is beautiful , clean , and has awesome window displays . the associates have always been professional and nice to me . the store manager lynne is an absolute sweetheart and will show me tons and tons of stuff to help me make a decision . i have always been greeted upon entering .	1493
1	as many time as i 've been here it 's about time i review this place . one word `` outstanding '' comes to mind . they do cheesesteak right and their original hoagie has all the other sub shops beat by a mile . the owners could not be more friendly . great family run place . it 's really nice when the family thanks you for your business and they are sincere . get yours with their hot peppers !	777
1	came here around 2 am ( on a friday night into saturday morning ) . they had a dj playing lounge hip hop . very cool . there were plenty of people and plenty of seating . the spicy flamingo cocktail was fantastic and i highly recommend it . i will be back !	2513
1	great pizza and it 's consistent . love the specials and the honey that comes with the pizza for dipping the crust . they support local businesses so that 's a bonus ! ! !	809
1	great outdoor shopping mall for all ! i used to work here and highly recommend everything from food , to boutiques , to yoga classes !	3285
0	had some free time so decided ill try this place usually just shave my own head but wanted to try a 2 on the sides and longer on top lady could no figure out what i was asking her all i wanted was it to look like a smooth fade into the top making more of a military hair cut rather then a bowl . after she did my hair it looked like she did it with her eyes closed one side was longer then the other and the other side did n't fade at all went home and shaved my head waste of $ $ $	3557
1	came here for dinner . i know it 's a little off the strip but i 'm surprised it was so slow because the food was phenomenal ( ! ) we started off with the chicken satay and continued to share cashew nut cx the panang curry ( also with chicken ) . the portions are really big and the taste is spot on . we got medium spicy for both entrees and it was just enough to give you a little kick and get the nose going , but still be able to get all the flavors . friendly staff , and it looks like they have good lunch specials too ... would definitely come back .	1361
0	owner threatens customers who leave negative reviews instead of resolving the issue . rude staff and terrible service . not recommended .	1583
1	i had the spicy salmon poké bowl . my lips are smacking and the drooling has started , just thinking of it . the protein to rice ratio was not a lot , but it did work for me . so thrilled they moved into my hood ! : )	2719
0	this dealership and the ford one next door are the worst . do n't ever speak to the controller ! she 's a total bitch to say the least . the sales people here will haunt you forever . you ca n't even go inside just to see what they have without being harassed !	2754
0	: ( i hate writing reviews and specially if there bad but it got to this point so i had to !	265
0	updated : may 2 , 2018 unfortunately , there have been no changes to the property since my last update . we were notified , upon renewal , the rent will be going up $ 175.00 . from $ 1325.00 to $ 1500.00 for a two bedroom apartment with a 2 car garage . the only pro i can give this complex , is the garage that is attached to the unit . we are currently looking for a new abode , as this one is never going to get better . we , like so many others , will be moving out upon the completion of our lease .	2992
1	i stop in here with coupons . if you have a coupon then you get a better price on certain things . they have a coupon book that if you are going to actually use then would be very ideal . the store is pretty clean inside . the cashier is nice . i like to stop in after going to the bank and get a fountain soda or snack . you can get your oil changed , car washed and munch on a snack while here !	2198
0	i contacted this company for an estimate and was told that i was out of their service area . their website says they serve `` the greater phoenix area . '' i am located in central phoenix . not sure what the issue is , but i find it pretty unprofessional .	3590
0	used rhino maid today . they were ok ... would i use them again , no . the women were nice enough , however one seemed to be on her cell phone a lot . there were missed areas . they were here about 2 hrs and 10 minutes ... short of the $ 149.00 3 hr cleaning i paid for . i will try someone else . not impressed at all .	3647
0	have been going to ewc for years & got burned last week . wax was extremely hot and it literally felt like a chunk of skin came off . eyebrows are red , raw & hurt like a mofo . will continue to go for other waxing servies but will never utilize for eyebrows ever again .	2300
0	i been here for the first time and i will never come back . technician should learn how to respect customer . and when i came for my appointment they act like they are busy but the store has no customer . i just sat there and wait . beside this is so over price .	876
1	very good pizza . good ranch too , i like to dip my pizza in ranch . but the service when we went was painfully slow . not the waiters fault , seemed like the kitchen 's . a family of 5 came in maybe 5 minutes after us and got their food first . it was just me and my mom there and it took 45 minutes for us to get our pizza . : / will probably get it to-go next time due to this or just go to rosatis as it 's also close to home . either way .	192
0	i had americano - it was tasting just like brewed coffee , just like cheap watery coffee . very disappointing .	207
0	recently had an unpleasant experience at this location . no greeting , no hello . told me to get out of the car and turn off ac & radio . mumbled i owed $ 17 when they were done . realized i left a personal item behind . it was easier to park across the street and walk back . i walked into the back of the garage where you exit from . i started to say i had left something there . one guy walk by me and said nothing ; the other guy did n't respond and just stood there . very rude . disappointing state employees who could not summon the courtesy to even give a polite smile !	138
0	this was one of the worst meals we 've ever had . warm beer , cold burgers , terrible service . our burger was replaced with a turkey burger ; the fries were soggy and cold . drive past this dirty place , and do n't waste your money .	496
1	super friendly and helpful staff for a total newbie like myself . nice selection of various outdoor equipment .	3339
1	we went here for lunch and we had a great experience . we had 3 rolls and all of them were great ! service was great as well . not overpriced .	626
1	this is a very nice club . the decor is upscale , the service is excellent , and the entire atmosphere is not pushy at all , which i appreciated.if you are looking this type of club in las vegas i would definitely recommend you go here .	1779
0	pro's- fast same day service , good technician ( joe ) con's- extremely high prices , rude operator ( amy ) would not budge on price in short needed to replace fan motor and fan quoted 850.00 they are charging 8 times the price of parts ( 100.00 ) 700 dollars labor for a 30 min job . motto- get it while its hot !	2031
0	the food here was fine , but not outstanding . favourites included the calamari and paella . we did n't like the tapa de salsichas or beef dishes as much . the restaurant was quite loud , with a dj playing edm all evening . later in the evening , he started playing more 90s hip-hop and dance . i 'm not quite sure why the would have a loud dj with no dancing . it was a bit annoying .	1167
0	as much as i want to love this place there 's definitely some problems . first and scariest is the handling of food . i 've seen cashiers handle money before food without even so much as a glance of a wash. add in pure apathy towards customers ? the pork was amazing and the burrito fulfilled its class expectation , but we must progress .	31
1	always always have a great time here . the food is fantastic ! ! service is great ! love how friendly brenda the owner is and virginia is always on point when we get our usual back table ! it 's my local spot as i love right around the corner ! i love all the food because they make almost 90 % of it in house . you got ta try some of their dishes like the mac n chesse or the buffalo chicken sad/wrap . love their ever changing weekly specials !	717
0	one star because as a donut shop they never have any of the donuts i went for . i have given them a few chances and each time they never have enough types of donuts .	1774
1	i had to cancel my service the next day , but there was some misunderstanding over the phone with the front desk . i received an invoice for it a month later while my thought was this was cancelled . my sales rep went to work for me and fought to get my billing issue resolved . this shows her professionalism and salesmanship . amy was great , i will definitely go back to her .	3417
1	i brought in two suits to be dry cleaned . the little blonde lady helped me out with a recommendation on what she thought would be best . everything came back great .	2593
1	all of the staff members are so sweet and the tanning rooms are very clean ! loving it so far !	980
1	this chinese buffet does n't really stick out from the other chinese buffets . it 's clean , has good service and the food is decent , but there 's nothing really special about it . like the fish were pretty fresh and some were n't as much ... but the food is more than edible or tasty . and the atmosphere is good also .	1302
0	ca n't see these guys lasting in the competitive restaurant industry in calgary . overpriced , poor service , no attention to detail . save your dining dollar for a worthy restaurant like charcut , the nash or shokunin ( right next door ) .	1204
1	lou gordon is the best ! he takes care of all the details that can be grueling when purchasing a car or truck , that 's why we keep coming back every year !	2432
0	golden dragon used to be pretty good but they changed more than just the inside when they remodeled . the wonton soup is not as good , the wontons have almost nothing in them and they no longer have shrimp chips or anything to go with the soup . they changed their lo mein noodles and they are n't as good . the service has always been sketchy but the food was worth it . the only redeeming factor is their new sushi bar . the sushi is pretty good . i am disappointed with the new golden dragon .	1009
1	tried the chicken pad thai , singapore laksa , and the tamarind beef . i found all 3 dishes very good .	801
0	the filet mignon was literally the worst steak i have ever eaten . this is not an exaggeration . i sent it back and they brought another and i wanted to puke when i tasted it . the side dish of potatoes was inedible . i will not be going back . one gets the impression of very weak management .	1147
0	i like the products but the store is not very well run . cashers were yelling at eachother tons of clients in line , and very very slow transaction times . i like the stuff but i think i will find online from now on .	2267
0	this place is not good . tiny portions , dry bread , overpriced , flavor of the food mediocre . i appreciate the effort , but they should put less into the ambience and more into making the food worth eating . -my vegan boyfriend .	1127
0	attended the ancient ales , modern science event with several others and was very disappointed . the ancient ales that we had the privilege of tasting were fantastic but unfortunately only 1 or 2 of the breweries made it the whole 4 hours . we spent most of our night waiting in line for the breweries whose booths were open and did n't get a chance to see much of the science center , thankfully i was with good company .	3891
0	having used uber in other cities with success we were disappointed in the service of uber in montreal . some of the drivers cancelled on us just before a surge leaving us to try and find other arrangements . all the cars we rode around in were rusty , dirty and dingy econoboxes past their prime . some drivers were extremely rude and openly sexist which i did n't appreciate as a paying customer . overall service is sporadic and not worth the hassle .	2549
0	ca n't get a drink here after 15 minutes of trying on an early friday afternoon , but you can get lots of 'tude for pointing out why you 're leaving .	3343
0	this place is horrible , the owners are so rude and just take your money ! i bought my sister a gift certificate of $ 80 and they said it expired which is a lie , do they think imma donate $ 80 just for fun to their store yeah right , i paid for nail service ! the owner wife is so rude and doesnt know how to run a business and the employess smell like smoke , its disgusting and unsanitary ! place is horrible !	3017
1	i when to licence iv yesterday evening to try it out with a bunch of friends and we really enjoy it . i definitely recommend this restaurant for its delicious dishes , great cocktails , warm and magic decor and cool staff . first time i 've seen a server in montreal get on his knees to deliver a cocktail to a customer because he was late - priceless . a gem in griffintown . try the beef or salmon tartare & the homemade gnocchi	709
0	owners please read this ... ( by the looks of other reviews they obviously have not been reading their yelp reviews ) is all i can say is go somewhere else ! i tried this place twice and will not do it a third time . bad customer service , bad food , and very slow to serve . even the people at the table next to us was upset with the service . it took them over one hour to get their appetizer . i could go on and on but i do n't want to bore you . there are a lot of other good restaurants go somewhere else .	211
1	i come here with my friends because they love the country dancing and music diversity , the specials they have are honestly really good everyday they have specials as well ! we usually come here in weekends and never spend so much like other overpriced bars . the vibe is really great and the workers there are amazing people . if you 're looking for a nice , chill , and friendly vibe then this is the place for you . it 's also not super overcrowded like other mainstream bars which is nice for a change of pace .	2860
0	i wish i hand 1 more hand so i could give this place 3 thumbs down . i make better french toast in my kitchen ... i am not sure if they know what vanilla and cinnamon are . the eggs were alright and the bagel was ok as well . nothing special at all , but i was actually surprised how they were able to make their french toast so tasteless .	325
0	amazing how a poor experience at the front desk can knock off stars . the room was a similar to most business hotel rooms . the front desk could n't handle a problem and upset a bunch of guests . watch our entire review on youtube .. : //youtu.be/_akgt8utdgs	3859
1	i 've had 3 other laser tattoo removals before i came here so i know what i should be getting . honestly she did n't even go over it all the way with the laser . there 's quite a bit of the tattoo that 's untouched . i 'll be going somewhere else for the remainder . it 's not worth the pain if it 's not even going to make a difference .	3000
0	i ordered the margherita pizza with pineapples and bacon . it was disappointing ! the lady who helped me was so stingy with the toppings . she only put 10 pineapples . it was really soggy . i really do n't know why it 's soggy . she barely put any cheese and sauce . it was so plain . pieology is way better than this place .	282
0	worst cinema in town , dirty and the service is just unbelievable bad . they kicked out an elderly couple for seating in a restricted area , 30 min after the movie started . this place is just sad !	491
0	just save yourself some time and go somewhere else when planning on buying a vehicle . totally disappointed on how they conduct business .	855
0	omg ! what an f ' n craphole ! overpriced , usually broken , sometimes used wal-mart garbage . i hate having to go here .	3094
1	the ladies here are awesome ! i always leave very satisfied with my manicure or pedicure ! the only reason i did n't give them 5 stars is because a 30 minute polish always turns into an hour and a half visit ! i had a 5:30 tonight and they did n't start until 6 because someone walked in before me . then one lady went back and fourth between the two of us while two other employees sat around doing nothing . later i realized one was waxing the others eyebrows . great work , just wish their customer service was a little better ! also it 's always hard to get an appointment ! especially weekends !	3635
1	always a fun time and friendly staff . food is really good , a little expensive but still good . i love that we can sit and relax and have fun hitting balls .	1483
0	foul mouth hispanic worker on the phone that should be working . she used the f bomb no less than three times on the phone when i was in the store at 1050 am . this is the kind of person that can and will ruin your business . i 'll avoid this store from now on .	3395
1	our server lori was great she was very attentive and our food came out piping hot . for a late night stop we 're very satisfied .	221
0	horrible snotty customer customer service stinks hotel manager lisa is horrible people skills pool hours and spa personnel are rude	2651
1	this is my go-to for mexican-american food in oakland . it 's a chain restaurant , so you can expect a similar experience to any other chipotles that you have visited . the main reason i would recommend chipotle over the other mexican restaurants in the area is that this seems to be most students ' favorite spot as well . this means that new customers are continuously being served throughout the day which means all the meats were prepared recently . food is constantly on rotation , so you do n't have to worry about ingredients being left out for too long .	1418
1	i am in awe ! ! ! ! ! ! every time i go to chick fil a , it never fails to disappoint . the service is always fast and the employees are all so sweet and accommodating ! i got a spicy chicken sandwich and i ca n't even describe how perfect it was . i have attached a picture to prove it ! very great food and worth the money ! prices are average but i find the value to be remarkable !	1350
0	the food here is delicious . pho tai is not on the menu but they serve it . i used to frequent this place but recently had to stop eating here- every time myself or a family member got sick . super bummer : (	673
0	overpriced and nothing special.. starting to sell lots of retail products with prices through the roof ! owners are getting greedy !	2
0	really rude customer service . it 's a real forest lawn business . smells like dirty feet . will never go back .	3918
0	i 'm of portuguese decent so is my wife i 've been going to brazil bakery for as long as i can remember but i 've since stopped the prices here are way too high some the breads are sold by weight so are some of the cookies . it 's seems they like to over charge i 've gone to other portuguese bakery 's and their prices are considerably cheaper do n't get me wrong the quality is good just not worth the price go somewhere else and you 'll save a few bucks .	3184
0	the cupcakes need work . if they 're using all natural & local ingredients , you should refine your recipe around this concept before you sell them . i give them a 3/10 for cupcake quality because it was dry and so small for the price . also -- a 1/10 for owner professionalism and business ethics . decor ? ... . an attempt . this place is only popular for cupcakes in champaign because there 's nothing else around here . nice try .	3749
0	my last 3 cars have been toyotas , but i really liked the looks of the kia soul . i decided to go down and look at one . i really like how roomy it was and bought one . im very happy with the car . 5 months later the battery is no good . called and told that was n't covered . this will be the last kia i buy . i 'll stick with toyota from here on out . it 's really hard to sell a product i like and still lose my business but somehow sands kia found a way to do it . they saved $ 100 for the battery , but lost any future business with me .	624
0	the food here is not good , and the service was n't very good either . sorry pepe 's tacos , i will not be eating here again .	857
1	fresh and clean . vast , menu while still covering the basics . no potato salad in the greek salad though ? ? ?	875
1	i 've been coming here for a decade . my favorite place to be pampered . owners lana and wayne are wonderful .	1256
0	over priced items and some of the booths are trying to recreate old items and sell them as antiques . do n't waste your time here . there 's better ones in phoenix and worth the drive .	1563
0	ok so i just called today at 2:00pm to get a one month old check up for my son to be scheduled for next week some lady named amanda said that newborn 's do n't need a check up until they are 2months . that 's false ... . i had an appointment previously scheduled with my pediatrician in the east valley but , i 'm moving to the west valley and needed a new pediatrician so i thought to give them a call but obviously there staff do n't know what they are talking about . well she doesn't.. so i scheduled one with a different office that said they do .	2221
0	ok , ok , ok , been a loyal customer since i lived in vegas around the block for 6 months . i made daily treks to this place , to kill tons of time on the peeny slots and the arcade . the cheap dinner / lunch specials were kick ass also . now : semi decent food , no arcade , wack slots . they went totally downhill since 2002 !	3378
1	best car wash in town , brand new . they have mat clips to vacuum your mats easily and mini detail dryer . they give you a car wipe to wipe down inside of car . extremely good vacuums that got rid of all the dog hair in my car ! ! love this place	2044
1	we checked in online and arrived 10 min before our appointment . we were greeted by the nice lady at the front desk and sent to triage within 5 minutes . our daughter needed stitches for a cut but it was n't really an emergency . nonetheless , she was taken care of immediately by dr. armaghan , who is very nice and efficient at what she does , and we were out in 30 minutes or so . we are very pleased by the care our daughter received from dr. armaghan and her communication skills- addressing all of our questions and concerns . we will definitely return if needed and recommend it to everyone .	2580
1	my client bought a new wallet & the sales lady was very kind & helpful w/ him .	2979
0	overpriced and underdelivered . if i order a dish that has meat as the main ingredient , unsurprisingly i expect it to contain an entree portion of meat . i would have never paid $ 12 for 37 cents worth of sautéed veggies in broth and a half ounce of meat . this corner-cutting , blatantly cheap maneuver on their part is completely unacceptable . gtfo ! ! it was n't one dish , but rather several . cheap bastards	1361
1	such an unique spot . the music choice is something that 's so hard to find - 80s and 90s hits ! there 's an expensive cover charge ( $ 7 ) but it 's worth it . the drinks are modeled after 80s and 90s songs ! it 's a cool place with a vibe that 's really hard to find .	677
0	went in there today to check it out since i have 2 dogs myself and nobody greeted me or said hello . i smiled at the lady at the register and she did not acknowledge me at all . i walked around for a minute and decided this was surely not the place for my babies .	137
0	took almost 10 minutes before i saw someone at the front . waiter was not friendly . food did n't have a lot of flavor . bill was over $ 60 for two large pizzas , a childs meal , 1 drink that was n't water . i wo n't be back .	1482
1	getting ready to sell my car , and want to get best price possible . saw miracle touch on groupon , but failed to buy . called ramsey he quoted me groupon price . we set an appointment for today . ramsey showed up and did much more than i expected , and i am amazed at the finished results . if you are skepical about `` quick fixes '' , take my word for it , this process and ramsey 's talent are worth more than he charges .	2888
1	great place for a quick bite to eat & hang out . come here when you visit pittsburgh . andy warhol museum is down the street .	2532
1	i just moved to az from orange county ca. , where reflexology places are pretty much on every block ( garden grove ! ) . this place measures up quite well , i am so impressed ! i have been 3 times now and i got lucky and had amy the first time and have since requested her for my other 2 . very clean , quiet and friendly . i would highly recommend it ! ! do yourself a favor and request and amy : )	2014
0	stay away ! ! ! ! ! i recently spent a weekend at the montalucia resort and booked a spa day at joya . the men 's sauna and locker room is a gay sex hotspot ! ! i was sitting in the hot tub when a guy walked up to be and asked for a blow job ! ! i left and went into the sauna and he followed me in there and brought his phone out to watch porn and jack off ! ! ! this place is disgusting for your safety please stay away ! ! ! ! ! i spoke with the employees at the spa and they could of cared less stay away from this disgusting place	2305
0	another downtown disappointment ... ..old , smoky , and uninteresting . the slot machines are not up to date , the place needs a major remodel or needs to be imploded . yes , the table games have low minimum bets ... .if that 's important to you , good ... ..but it does n't do it for us . my friends and i walked through just to see if we were missing anything ... .not . return factor - 10 %	2500
0	i was charged $ 12 each for two dishes listed on the menu for $ 9 each . i pointed this out to the waitress as we left . she said she was sorry but did not offer to correct and refund the difference . we certainly will not return and suggest anyone dining at cinco review their bill closely . ripping folks off seems to be part of the business plan .	1330
1	walking in your not sure which direction to start . this store has everything electronic . customer service is amazing , they actually walk you over to the item your inquiring about . they also offer reward points so make sure you sign up .	494
0	this theater just does not stack up to the others in the summerlin area . seemed a little outdated . there was thrash on the floor and they only had one poor girl working behind the concession stand . also the concession stand was poorly situated and was not set up very good . when i got my popcorn ( which was cold ) and soda i had to go all the way around the concession stand to get to the other side of the theater where the movie was playing ... had no thru way to make it more convenient . will probably not return to theater or casino .	2000
0	ordered a driver 4 days ago called in to see what was the status on shipping . just to find out they sold the club in store . i am not mad that they did not have it in stock , i am frustrated at the lack of service to call me . i am golfing this weekend and now frantically looking for another driver .	1013
1	i must say that this is one of the only restaurants that my wife an i really stand behind . every time we come here , we are always blown away by how wonderful the pho is . no msg , free range chicken , super sweet music on fridays ; it 's great . in all fairness , i have not tried much on the menu because the pho is just that good ! we did however have some tiger prawn spring rolls and some green tea ice cream that pretty much knocked our socks off as well . we are regulars here and will be for a long time .	1260
1	this place was such a pleasant surprise ! ! we came to crocker for bonefish grill , but then we noticed a lot of cars in the parking lot and cantina caught our eye . we decided to give it a go and we were seated right away . the inside is beautiful . the food is delicious . the prices are amazing . i can not recommend this place enough ! !	398
0	i ordered a cake for my daughters 2nd birthday and when i picked it up it was the wrong cake . i was so disappointed . the cake was already paid for and it was her birthday so we had to make do . we ordered sprinkles and got fondant . i will not be ordering again . i was really surprised at the way they handled the situation . you should at least get what you paid for .	1125
1	i recently had my hair cut and balyaged by nikki at alchemy . i made my appt . based on the great yelp reviews and they really lived up to the reviews ! the atmosphere is unpretentious and customer focused and i felt so comfortable during my visit . the haircut i received is amazing , maybe the best i have had since moving to nc . i love the balyage as well . nikki really listened to what i wanted and then made it happen . i get compliments on it constantly ! looking forward to my next visit !	3631
0	what a ridiculous experience i had at this starbucks . i ordered three drinks totaling around $ 10 . i offered a $ 20 which was s little mangled but definitely in one piece . the cashier wanted me to give him another note and got all hissy when i refused . what kind of training does starbucks provide to their staff ?	3208
1	great hotel ! worried a bit about my stay after reading some reviews , but glad i decided to give it a shot . there was no noise issue in my room even though you are directly at the end of the airport . nice breakfast selection and other food options close by .	51
1	dr. jill oliver was amazing , gentle , and informational . i will be going back to her for all my non surgical facial needs !	2811
0	bland food and indifferent service . ! my food had no taste and the service was n't very personable . it 's cash only and wo n't split the bill for you . decor is beaten down and not the most comfortable place in the world . i was even battling with 3 little fruit flies at one stage . cool location though and it 's cheap . the patio is n't too bad either but there are much better options close by . first time going , maybe last . might give it another try when i 'm in the mood for a cheap meal outside on a sunny day .	2718
1	my experience was n't as bad as previous people . i personally like to be left alone when i shop and like to seek help when i need it . they have an information booth i went to it and got someone to help me answer some questions . i asked for help lifting stuff from my cart and to my car and got it . the staff was very nice to me and did n't try and sell to me . which i appreciate .	99
0	used to love going here for the specials until my past two visits ! the so called female manager is not professional in any manner and the excuse of being slammed is not acceptable ! i placed my online order accordingly left her ample time to have it filled was n't ready when i got there and she treated me like crap ! then i called to ask for a manager she tells me she 's the manager i called little snake she hangs the phone up on me . then i called back and she let it ring ring ring and ring ! then i call another swell and i was informed she is not a manager ! never will go back at all	1444
0	the airline employees get first dibs ... so if you are traveling with your family do not park here . we have been waiting 40 minutes after a full day of travel . my wife called early . they arrived with shuttle and made it clear that airline employees had priority . we were n't allowed on . now we will be waiting another round trip for the one shuttle they have on service . they said someone did n't call in . we will never ever park here again . you should n't either .	1786
1	cute animals ... from elephants to donkeys.. pre-election . which one are you ? heck , if it 's yummy , i 'll be both ! their dark chocolate bars are pretty cheap and pretty yummy . i think i 'm going to make this a regular pit stop from now on . the guy at the counter 's pretty nice and patient too ... though i guess this is the trend in small towns like champaign .	3787
1	one of our favorite places to order from regularly . great pizza , usually extremely quick from order to pick up time . some of the best wings from a pizza joint . done all the way through , crispy skin . only complaint - they only deliver on weekends .	878
0	worst attitude from the person who was checking customers ' recipients . she was located left corner of exit with small warmer/heater and small black cushion pallet . she never moved her feet for the customers . all customers including me tried to go to her place to check their recipients . i saw that some customers was dumbfounded about her attitude because they smiled bitterly . she was happy today 's evening with heater and cushioned pallet , but customers .	2469
1	great place to go for some milk tea . i would say that this place is better than most other places in terms of dećor and food quality . the prices are slightly higher than other places but that 's okay . i would recommend going in a little after they open as they do n't have any free popcorn ready or any `` big '' ( as they call it ) bubble tea .	344
0	i loved dr . bond but had to find a new pediatrician because the office staff at this office is terrible ! ! if you do n't like people or children do n't work in a doctor 's office ladies ! ! ! too bad though cause dr . bond is an amazing doctor . but after 4 years of horrible treatment from the staff i just found a new doctor..	2712
0	been going to these vets for 15 years . something has happened rude staff , will no accommodate urgent issues anymore . got a new vet , very nice accommodated our urgent issue . do n't need bad vets messing with my animals	3445
0	i 'll give this a 2-star only because they were able to get me in the same day i called . i found a 60 min massage with hot stones on groupon . the worst massage of my life . mind you this was not a deep tissue massage and it hurt . she completely pressed too hard on my neck , temples and back causing me to still be in pain four days later . not one part of the massage was soothing or relaxing . and i get massages regularly . worst experience . do n't remember her name but she was an older lady , dark hair in a pony tail .	2320
0	never enough tellers . usually never more than 2 . lines always reach past the shelf of magazines . it would be nice to have more people ready to tend to the customers . bank of america in general seems to have this issue .	20
1	excellent noodles ... love the pho ... would give it a 5 but i 've had better and some similar in phoenix .	205
0	very nice and welcoming but not professionals . waste of money . will have to do a pedicure again .	265
0	i 'm so dissatisfied and disappointed . the sooner i 'm done with this place the better . if i could give negative stars i would . it 's ridiculous . this school is the reason community colleges are looked down on .	2787
0	service was pretty good . thes staff was very attentive . expected more from the food . not likely to go again . not worth the money . way too many places with great food , for the same or less money .	1534
0	just avoid this place , worse hoa ever ! the rules are ridiculous and the way some of the security guys treat people here is really bad , i 've heard these things before but i never knew how it can literally ruin my experience and the way i feel about my `` home '' which is very not welcoming , especially if you get fine for every little thing or letter that warn you for something you never did . stay away there is many places that will treat you right and will make you feel home	3264
0	still trying to wrap my mind around the $ 120 oil change i paid for today .	3078
0	amazing facility , shitty customer service . they 're polite , but they 're lazy and do n't pay attention to detail . they say one thing , then retract that statement and say that their `` policy has changed '' . each employee has their own idea of the `` company policy '' and it 's so , so annoying . many of my friends experienced this first hand , and we all have agreed to never step foot in that gym again , no matter how big and spacious it is . ridiculous .	2762
1	so far so good . made an appointment and as i walked in it was super busy . the tires i ordered were here and they got me right in . it 's clean inside , ac works and they have a bathroom . just down the way is culvers and a circle k. they have free water ... i think that is good for at least 1 star .	3158
0	last night was my first time here & it will for sure be my last . i went for dinner with my girlfriend & my mom but none of us were happy with the food or service . it took us at least 10 minutes just to get water . the server started to take the order of a table that had been seated way after us , but we spoke up about it . even though he stopped & took our order first , the other table still received their food first . the food did n't have much flavor . i had the chicken pho & was extremely disappointed after waiting for so long .	205
0	thank you for your reply jwrv but it 's an excuse only . a friend just had their rv in your shop - that they did not buy from you - but it was out of warranty and they were taken right in . making excuses for your poor customer service and threatening sales tactics does not fix this . your service department also said `` we will not do warranty repairs because you did not buy it here '' . that 's quite the customer service message ! we 've already been in touch with media and jayco .	3890
1	i 've been to tammie coe a couple times as i live fairly close to this location . they have some pretty delish baked goods ... . i 've tried the crack cake ( chocolate and mocha deliciousness ) , red velvet cupcake ( cream cheesy frosting of wonderfullness ... but hard to eat due to the top being larger than the base and all of the sprinkles ) , ooey gooey cupcake ( ummm yum ! ) , and the brownie ( just ok ... way too much frosting ) . overall , i do n't think this is the most delicious dessert in town , but it is very good and i would ( obviously ) go back .	1125
1	rose is my go-to girl for gel manicures - always . my nails look amazing for three full weeks after her . she takes the time to really clean out my nails and examine each one for consistent length and shape . love her ! what a sweetheart . they also have a lot of nail color options for gel , which i love . i gave 4 stars because the inconsistency among staff is a little annoying , but overall you wo n't be disappointed .	2297
1	had a great experience ! they did a beat rate ( i had one with fox ) and upgraded the car . service was fast with no problems !	3595
1	best place around for the flu shot ! thanks for making my arm sore ...	1730
0	i called them for an emergency need and they said they would come in 20 mins . but it took 60 mins for them to actually came ! the price was expensive too ( total $ 124 to open one single locked door ) . i would not recommend this place for any emergency needs .	3822
1	came in for a regular check up since i was pretty sick with the flu . they took me in and attended me really quick . great service . great facility . def recommend it .	609
0	being inside this store literally gives me so much anxiety . the isles are so small and cramped with inventory that does n't properly fit . it 's also very confusing to find anything you need . i recently came in searching for a sharpie paint pen and after being unsuccessful trying to track them down on my own i had to hit one of the service buttons just to find an employee to help me . the cashiers are also not super friendly & seemed to be really pushy on signing up for the rewards program . i do n't think i 'll be back here again . i 'd rather make the drive down the street to hobby lobby .	1615
1	i came home to find my garage door would not go down it opened but i could see the wires were loose . i found this company on yelp called on a thursday they came on friday . it was the cables on each side he replaced them an told me id soon need to replace the springs an gave me a quote on those . he repaired the door in less than an hour an it works great . i will use them again , great customer service on time no delays .	1699
1	has a number of tables inside-great for meetings or if you need a mobile office . the staff is on top of things too . the only downside is the wifi has been spotty for a couple of months now and is currently unavailable .	1532
0	if i could give this place and negative star i would ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this place is so so sooooo unprofessional . i have been trying to get a hold of a manager for almost 2 months and i can not i have a manager contact me to say my life . i 've call every single day and still nothing ! ! ! ! ca n't even get my money back and i live out of state now . but their rules are i have to go back to my home store where i 'm started my membership to resolve to problem . i would never never join with this company again ! ! ! ! !	2959
0	really ? playing country music while i have to wait for the movie to start ? that 's dirty amc . seriously probably wo n't come back .	2406
0	i went there when it open and the bagels were actually decent ( i am from nyc ) the second time bagels were horrible and undercooked . i figure ok bad day . third time the bagels sucked and the danish were old and dry not only that but the people were rude . i went in for a fourth time early in the morning and the only bagels they had were garlic or onion ? come on ! i will never go back to this place ! what a shame ! people running this place seem to have no idea how to run a restaurant	960
0	the meat counter is never open past 6:30pm when craig is working . constantly have to go to the fry 's on chandler just buy chicken breasts . he says they are conducting inventory ; this does not need to be done twice a week . not very friendly .	1967
0	i wish i was able to say something positive . my story ... well on their actual website , i clicked the reserve button . i was so happy to see that i was able to reserve on boxing day , my birthday . so i reserved a table and received a confirmation number . my husband and i got ready , took a cab ride and ended standing in the rain outside a closed restaurant . thanks so much for nothing ... .well we ending running in the rain and had a great dinner at vivoli . thanks vivoli for a great dinner and beautiful dinning experience .	348
0	i got so excited when i found out that this place had open to give the queen west market a litte livelihood . all the treats are nicely displayed on the counters , from doughnuts to macarrons . the counter helpers were both very well dressed too . i decided to try one of the infamous cronuts for once and for all . i do n't know what i was expecting but i was dissapointed to find that cronuts are not that amazing after all = (	518
0	run ! ! ! worse service ever experienced from beginning to end in any establishment . bartenders clueless , forgetful and confused . sadly food was decent ; but this place will not survive with poorly managed staff imo coming from industry . could list over 10 complaints and not a complainer . my customer and i could n't wait to get tab and leave which also took forever and they had items we did not order . at that point did n't matter ; paid more just to run ! ! !	398
0	horribly managed . just waited for 20 minutes for my car watching one young woman clean the whole interior/ exterior while 5 other employees stand there and talk . not to mention they would walk over and look , get in my car and talk about it to each other but not help at all .	3899
0	i went here one sunday afternoon on a whim i did n't really enjoy it the menu was kinda confusing to me i order a salad it was average something i could 've made at home honestly	58
0	food and service were ok . but it is overpriced , spotty service , the `` patio '' where they stuck us is basically a tent in the parking lot , no salad included , smallish menu with no pizza . if you are thinking of going here , do n't . just go to mama ricottas .	563
1	when we went in it was completely empty . the bartender was friendly and knowledgeable . i would have definitely patronized this establishment in my college days . very dark inside and a fun place to drink . i think i will go back there when i return to tempe .	2765
1	super rare when i give 5 stars but this place is super deserving of that . this is about the 3rd time i go & i never have any issue with the food , people & establishment . the portions of food is huge . the price is super cheap for 2 . the waiter cindy was super nice & eager to work ! she helped us with everything . this place is better than any other breakfast establishment i 've been to .	1319
1	good food and good value as well . go on tuesday for $ 5 sandwiches and discounted beer .	839
1	always fun and clean . joe always hooks it up and steph always makes ya feel at home . i always laugh and have a good time in the shop . love the old school barbershop feel . tools are always clean , hot towels and warm lather are always applied . i can always count on a clean fade and beard trim . thanks joe !	2591
0	phone number disconnected , closing does n't appear to be temporary	399
1	my motorhome , built on a freightliner chassis , did not track correctly and would pull to the right even after having a front end alignment by freightliner in elkhart indiana . i had a 3 axle alignment completed by ewing brothers . now my motorhome tracks perfectly down the road and i can even take my hands off the wheel . many companies say they can do an alignment . ewing brothers knows how and has the proper equipment to do a great job .	3654
0	had my initial piercing done there and it was a great experience . i went back months later because i had questions about my piercing . as soon as i walked in , 4 staff members at the desk gave me a look like i did n't belong there . when i started asking questions , they all spoke to me condescendingly . there were 2 other customers who were there that had great customer service . i guess i did n't get the same treatment because i was n't covered in piercings or have my ears gauged like the other customers or staff . i ended up leaving , needless to say i 'm not going back there .	2895
0	whoever manages this location runs one damn loose ship . i just walked in and wanted to order food only to be greeted by teenagers who just stared at me like a martian with their hands in trash bags . i asked them if they were closing thinking there must be a reason for the very odd atmosphere ... no response . what the hell did i just experience ?	1528
0	super comfortable bed and pillows ! carpets will make your feet black ... gross ! ... especially when your toddler wants to lay on the floor and drag her blanket all over it . sheets did n't smell fresh , asked for clean ones and put them on myself just in case . breakfast is only for the early risers- we came in to grab breakfast 45 minutes before breakfast hour ended ... it was too late and they were not about to make anymore . there are a bunch of other hotels in the phoenix area , next time we willl look elsewhere .	404
0	this is n't cheesecake , just a large spongecake that costs $ 12 . a sponge cake . very misleading and terribly underwhelming . i do n't ubderstand what the hype 's about .	2253
1	movies and imax theatre by simons shopping and underground mall/food court .	3728
0	24 hours later , i still ca n't get regular shoes on ! covered my legs in antiseptic spray and that helped the pain . where my cuticles were trimmed too deep , they are still sore to touch ! this manicurist needs to have her license jerked !	838
0	just ok . decor was good but food was not good . nothing was tasty . not even the cocktails	1094
1	my first time here , this salon came highly recommended . i 'll definitely be back when i 'm in town ! clean space and friendly staff and prices are reasonable . my pedi and mani were thorough and delightful .	3508
0	they did n't know what a hot toddy is . and the coffee was cold . i know this is arizona but c'mon , it 's december .	211
1	very nice grocery store offering a wide variety of international delicacies . also has a cafeteria area offering various dishes , mainly of asian cuisine . their bakery is heavenly : everything is delicious ! convenient location not far from freeway access and a large parking lot . staff is also friendly .	3269
1	i have been with this huntersville ups store for many years as services client including a mailbox and postage needs . the staff is always friendly and they know me by name when i walk in the door . ups rates are higher than usps and you do have to buy a box however i gladly allow them to package my shipments for me saving me time and hassle . i know they always do a great job which makes up for the price of the packaging materials .	1853
1	unfortunately could n't get a table at the teppanyaki tables but we had sushi and the tumi and yem bento with beef , and their crunch roll ! ! the sushi was extremely fresh and even the miso was excellent ! ! best part was the service ! ! it was my sons birthday and they went above and beyond to make his day special ! ! i would love to go back again and again ! !	733
0	seaweed salad is not included in any of the custom bowl ? this is quite disappointing , given it 's standard at almost all other poke locations . bowl size is good , but fish portion and topping portion is measly . ie . small amount of food in large container . would not return .	2719
0	i got the whistle pig dog and the coney chili cheese dog , both terrible ... to much onions , cheese was still cold not very filling . i also got chili cheese chips which were nothing to brag about , it 's basically chips with half melted cheese . the place itself is not bad , weird music , sports on the tv was a plus but subtitles was annoying . service was prolly the best part of it , very friendly .	58
0	very disappointed . took pants to be altered for my husband.called after a week and pants were not even started . they had forgotten about them . when trying to call phone would ring and ring no answer . stopped by to check and employees were outside smoking while we waited to find out pants were still not ready . when we did speak with an employee they were very rude and unprofessional . this was our first and last time	2593
0	for a few months , they were good . they were n't terribly consistent on the date they were supposed to be there , but overall the job got done . then a couple months ago , the service just stopped . i 've called and texted many times with zero response , similar to everyone else here . i travel constantly , and just got a notice that i 'm being fined because my yard has turned into a jungle . it 'll cost $ 300 just to get it put back together . not cool .	2139
0	this sprint store has the worst customer service in the world worst than fuckin walmart..i was trying to return a $ 10 item got to the store no one shot about there job because only manager can do a return ... wtf ? ..having to drive 15 miles to this store..dont go here there a rip off too..this store sucks ..if i can give negative 100 stars i would ..i wish this place burn to hell ...	1237
1	thank you ! this place is golden ! we came in from an exploded right steer tire with some pretty major damages ... they got us squeezed in and out in about 3 hours just getting us legal to drive it back to louisiana . so nice ! thanks again ! lady at your repair shop front desk is worth her weight in gold !	2707
0	stay away ! ! ! ! ! ! ! horrible service . the old man cussed in front of my 5 year old after i had my husband 's watch in the store to have a link removed and when i picked it up the pin was gone and the watch would not work . i was told it would be 30 minutes and still not ready after an hour . will never go near the store again .	3533
0	i am giving this salon two stars out of five because it 's nicely decorated . other than the decoration , the salon is not as great as they make it seem . all their services are just way over priced . the receptionist is rude if you miss an appointment and the staff is unprofessional . my friend got a haircut there and her hair was uneven and choppy . cutting hair with razors is not good for curly hair ! ! ! i will not recommend this salon at all . go to akron or cleveland .	2292
1	we had such a good time with my 5 yr old granddaughter at the fair . she loved the log ride and the play area the best . my only reason for the 4 of 5 stars is that the play area jungle gym attraction is quite dumpy and dirty . i want them to come back but i wish it could be improved . we enjoyed the food and the street performers too , especially godfrey the magician . we will definitely be back ! !	2076
1	my family and i have comes to lumberjacks a few times . breakfast is always delicious ! the service is n't the quickest and it 's probably do to not have enough servers but they are always very nice .	1319
1	the tavern does not disappoint . yes the service may be slow , but what do you expect when 1 bartender working the whole bar . so you have to wait a little longer . no big deal drink another beer or talk to your friend . so i have not been here in a lonnnnnnggggg time . well the roxbirger has not changed , well except for the bun is different . it is still everything it used to be a meal and a half . so happy to be back .	353
1	this place is in my neighborhood . they produce amazing vanilla lattes . they are a bit too pricey for me to go all the time , but it is a treat when i can go . only 4 stars because the service can be slow .	1175
0	worst store to go to for anything other than to pay your bill . hardly ever have new stock . if you try to change your plan or get a new phone they will take forever , that is if they can even do it . they 'll tell you their system wo n't let them do it without even looking all the while a service rep is on the line with you telling you they are able . do n't waste your time here .	170
1	absolutely no complaints - fast , friendly service , enjoyed my complimentary coffee and flipped through a magazine while my dirty little car was cleaned ! yay !	3546
0	wanted to check out there prices for an oil change and fluid change somve i had received coupons as i arrived i walked into the build and no one was there ( keep in mind that in walked past there open garage where the employee could see me coming in ) . i waited for 15 mins and no one came so i left and i walked past the garage and none of the employees acknowledged me . i wantwd to give them a chance since i had good service at other big o tires , ol well	3860
0	paid for major detail ( over a hundred dollars ) on a car that 's already kept clean , they ran it through the automatic wash , shampooed the floor mats , vacuumed a bit and let it sit around for almost 4 hours ( arrived 11:30am , got car back 3:15pm ) .. no hand washing or any kind of wax of exterior at all , they did n't wash the steering wheel or dash or console at all , in general a $ 15.99 wash anywhere else is better than what they did with my hundred plus and my four hours . cobblestone should be ashamed of themselves .	127
0	stay away from this garbage ! their cloud service sucks , customer service sucks and they will not honor warranty ! 2 months cam quit working after firmware upgrade . they would not give me a rma n6mber to return , then told me they would send me another camera , then return my old one in same box , but which they never did send me another . they are morons ! stay away from them	2131
1	best service you could ever get in my opinion . good coffee and the best of all ... the doughnuts they were the best doughnuts i have ever had in my life or maybe it 's just because i like dunkin ' donuts	579
1	i am so glad i did n't listen to the reviews on here ! ! this place is da we ordered the vegetable korma and samosas choley rais malai & keer ( desserts ) and a mango lassi . seriously omg ! best ! the desserts were sweet creamy one had a sponge cake thing . both had cheese . the vege korma was so tasty and rich ! the choley was a fried puff with delicious vegies inside . i highly recommend this place ! we will be back	1497
0	oh look they deleted my bad review . hmmmm ... . looks like i 'll be canceling my membership .	2762
1	was a nice , well laid out store for its size . i 'm not interested in the `` arcade '' side , so i did n't go there , and ca n't comment on that , but i did go in to buy some toys for my wife and i that we had been looking at on their website ... . it turned out they were much more expensive in the store , even with shipping , and i ended up going home to order them online ... ..we can wait for a significant savings .	2914
1	just saw pedro this time for a cut . he 's great also . so far everyone here cuts really well .	3469
0	they are not very quick on responses leave voicemails and emails takes days to hear back	3608
1	we are here yesterday for lunch . first time customers . the food was really good . prices were good as well . my daughter and i ate for $ 12 . the chicken tenders were cooked just right . i really liked the mashed potatoes and gravy too . i ordered a family size fries . we had a bunch left over , you get a ton . the staff was super friendly too . we will be back for sure . oh , we tried a bunch of sauces and they were all good .	862
1	my niece and nephew love coming to this location to watch movies ! i enjoyed it too . went on mygeneration day ( i think that 's what it is called ) , $ 4.00 for matinee shows . but , you need a members card which is easy to get and if you have a regal card , you get extra discounts . very pricey for popcorn & snacks & drinks without regal card , though ! but , hey , you have to have popcorn & popcorn and if you order a large popcorn and large drink , you get free refills . also , arcade is right next to movie theater so a plus for my niece & nephew .	3947
0	super disappointed with the service and decor , do n't try booking through a third party , they will down grade your room . we booked through bookings.com for a king room , we got a terrible queen room instead . this was extremely disappointing because it was for a birthday surprise for my husband . when we asked if there was any chance of moving , they said not likely , sorry ca n't help you . we paid $ 230 for a crappy room , and terrible service . the bed is lumpy , there is missing art on the walls , and the walls need to be washed , or repainted ... should have stayed elsewhere ...	409
1	they have a really good sale on carter brand baby clothes today . half off ! ! ! so i got a few good deals for my baby under $ 10 with a coupon as well .	3896
0	great location , great neighbors . close to the strip but not ghetto , you get what you pay for here . unless i leave vegas or buy a house here i will not be moving out ! only issue is having guests over can be a hassle , getting in the gate can be long but , it does make the place safe . we rent from a tenant and we are lucky to have a very helpful and attentive one at that . i have heard of many bad stories tho . 24hr pool , bbq , gym , hot tub just feet from my place , and i can see the cosmo and palazzo from my couch as well as the hot tub .	3718
1	free parking here , which can fill up quickly for an event . i 've been here for concerts and the various warehouse sales . the place is always clean inside and very spacious .	382
0	i got two things delivery through ûber eats . i got the pesto cavatelli and spaghetti carbonara . the cavatelli was sub par at best . but the carbonara ... was so terrible that we threw it out . there was very little sauce and it was really dry and salty .	252
1	clean , friendly , fast and good quality dry-cleaning will make me a happy person . plus , their prices are totally reasonable ! their coffee machine has a joke written on the side of it . i love a solid sense of humor . i will drive the extra few miles from downtown to lakewood just for this place .	2332
1	very helpful ! bernard was very willing to help with a problem disc . store credit/sell back option cool .	3530
0	came in for the first time and picked up two of their baked buns . the cashier asked me if this was to go and i said yes so she sealed them into two separate clear baggies . i expected them to be placed into a bag after but they just sat there on the counter . so i asked for a bag and she shook her head and said they dont give bags for two items ! ! unbelievable . i was speechless . what kind of cheap service is this when you are already selling overpriced baked goods ? ! the buns in the end didnt taste like anything spectacular either . will not be coming back .	2971
1	best hotel for a honeymoon ! this hotel is just off the strip and has amazing views . the room was so clean and big for the price we paid . the tub is amazing and totally fits 2 people . the room service was very nice and the hotel staff was so helpful . best bed ever ! i would stay here again . for the price that we paid , we had a nice suite . best value in the city !	2973
0	just ordered combo # 11 dinner combo drive thru . it 's chicken strips , onion rings , hush puppies , and toast . it was ridiculous ! ! ! ! there 's only 1 onion ring and the rest in the dinner box was hard as rocks . i did n't checked my order before i left but i should have not trusted these kids . never again i will order at these place ! wasted my money and had to throw the food . this place just do n't care ! ! !	994
1	great food , great service . i had an issue today where i was told by the cashier that i was getting more food than what i actually got . i drove off and noticed i had about half the amount of food i was expecting . i came back a little upset and asked for a refund . the staff explained the misunderstanding and ended up giving me more food than i payed for . in the end they rectified the situation and the food was delicious . only reason i did n't give 5 stars is because of the price .	1362
1	great physicians and staff . very professional they really care about their patients i definitely recommend this office	3593
1	had a very pleasant visit at this location . went there with my son for an evening treat before we head home to yuma , where there is no baskin robbins : - ( . the employees were very nice and helpful . we will definitely be back once were in town again .	220
0	worse nail place ever . the only reason they probably get business is because there are hardly any other nail salons on the strip . i could have done this my self . do n't let the guy touch your nails . i should have just done it myself .	2686
1	lots to love , here . really amazing happy hour ( extended on wednesday and friday ! ) . nice selection of beer and wine make it perfect for pre-pirates games , and sitting outside will get you a view of all the action . inside , the bar is spacious and there are plenty of flat-screens - definitely a sports bar ! the menu has generously portioned apps plus some vegetarian friendly fare on top of normal pub grub . also , great bloody mary bar on sunday !	839
0	this place started off awesome . their portions and quality have gone downhill while prices have remained the same . they started off serving their rice roll order ( the ones that come with squid patties ) with 3 pieces of the squid patties which were larger than the 1 piece they now serve it with . came here to eat a couple of nights ago and the rice rolls tasted like they were on the verge of going bad . some parts were hard ( meaning they had been refrigerated rather than freshly made ) . i will be looking for a replacement place for steamed rice rolls .	287
0	java house . the pit stop for broke students .cheap booze . cheap food . everything a student really needs ( screw textbooks ) . the chicken curry is damn good , but the caesar salad and quesadillas tasted the cheap 5 bucks they were . service was tolerable , and the scenery was eclectic chic , very befitting of the neighbourhood .	2718
0	the prices are fair to above avg . for a new , unknown restaurant in the vegas market . decor is plain both in the restaurant and the restroom . needs more excitement happening in the restaurant . just had a lumberjack video running over and over on the tvs . felt like a cafeteria . food was good , but nothing to write home about . the meals that we were served lacked presentation . burger and fries on a plate and nothing else . silverware was very cheap . bathroom soap was cheap stinky kind . salad bar was plain . have to pay cashier like at ihop .	1319
0	tests on animals . used to shop here , liked the stuff but ca n't go there anymore because they test on animals . wish they would change that !	2409
0	so i 've had three sessions and there 's been no change to my skin . unsure if i was n't given as strong of treatment because i purchased a groupon , but i 'll be getting a refund and go to my dermatologist .	2620
0	i 've had several massages in and around las vegas and by far this place was the worst in town . we called for an appt with massage and shampoo for $ 60 and they verified..people then took us to room and spent 1/2 the time going back and forth getting items then when time was up..no shampoo..45 mins of soft rubbing my arm and patting my back..this equated to $ 60 for one hour full body massage and they literally burned me with their stones atleast 3x because it was steaming hot and i did n't even ask for it . then the session consisted of what seemed like an `` indian rug burn '' style massage . this place terrible .	2399
1	after complete frustration and humiliation from a leslie 's employee on mcdowell and power , i went to a & m corson . a & m took great care of me . they did exactly what leslie 's said was n't possible . they treated me with respect and professionally . i 'll be back . thank you .	2019
1	i would give this salon the highest recommendation . the owners offer a wide range of products , always with new things coming . i tell everyone to go here . customer service and quality of services offered -- awesome !	2050
0	this place is a copy cat of what they offer next door . from signage to specialty drinks to crepes . now they even sell breakfast and meals . for a place that fit like two people you can think how fresh are their ingredients if they can make meals , crepes , bubble teas , juices , breakfasts , everything u can think of at a cheap price . you give that a thought . how good/fresh are these drinks/food for such a low price . the taste is not the same . if you support plagiarism and fake cheap drinks then go ahead . what you give is what you get . my experience was disgusting .	3080
0	should 've read the review first before purchasing , horrible attitude ! ! if you hate your job that much , then leave . nobody is forcing you to work there .	3124
0	one of the worst magic shows i 've ever seen . of course , what can you expect from an afternoon show ? maybe it was just my angle , but i swear i saw all the wires and the people `` disappearing '' walking in/out behind every trick . they need to work a little harder on the misdirection cause it did n't work for me .	865
1	this is another one of my favorite lunch spots in chandler . if i feel like pizza for lunch when i am working in our chandler day spa , i always visit jimmy and joe 's . the slices are giant and come with an individual pizza cutter . there is outside and inside seating and the staff has always been friendly . definitely worth a stop if you want a slice of pizza in chandler , az .	417
0	customer service blows . their employees are all rude and unwilling to help you order things online which they are more than capable of doing . their system is down often and they do n't even apologize that they 're unable to help you . they make you feel like a burden that you even come into the store . definitely lost my business for good .	1920
0	worst limo service ever do not use . limo was filthy dirty no air conditioning and ripped my wedding dress in the door . charged us extra money without telling my husband and i until the limo picked us up . i am absolutely disgusted with everything about this limo services .	2578
0	their bogo deal is no deal at all . spent $ 360+ on 2 pair which both broke within 1st year . got a great pair at costco for $ 190 . will never shop there again .	909
0	i had a groupon for a facial , used the online appointment application and received a confirmation of my appointment . when i arrived for my appointment , there were no signs anywhere indicating where the salon was so i called and got no answer . i waited in the lobby for over 10 minutes , called multiple times and always got voicemail . needless to say , i left and have cancelled the groupon . proceed with caution !	750
1	located right next to greenland supermarket , this bakery is very tiny , but has many unique korean pastries . i bought a mugwort cake , thin almond cookies , puff pastry roll and a croquette which was a crispy doughnut filled with potato , onion and yam noodles . the items were well made . only wish they had more variety , but that may have to do with the small store .	3229
1	polite , professionalism and great service . replacement product for shower broke and the company came out at no cost to replace the part in a timely matter . highly recommended !	924
0	the girl working the front desk was so sweet ! however , went in for the organic pedicure yet they just did a regular pedicure and my feet do n't even feel clean . when it came time for my gel manicure the guy did n't even paid the top of my nails and when i mentioned it , he just added an extra coat to one nail . and my pedi/mani nail color does n't match , when he said it did . disappointed , wo n't be back .	1288
0	tried to get a haircut here and there was a long wait line . best thing is to call in ahead of time . walk ins are not good . it seemed like a bunch of older people cutting hair and an older crowd walking in . the mood was gloomy and did n't seem like anyone wanted to be there ( employees and customers ) . haircuts are $ 13 and usually wait time with haircut will get you over an hour there . do n't waste your time here . i left right away and found myself a better place . there are many cheaper places and pricier places that are better and more worth it .	3281
0	staff was horrible , greens not in the best condition ! ! i wo n't be back ! to golf staff was rude and rushed unnecessary	3869
1	if you need athletic shoes this is the place to go , knowledgeable staff , state of the art equipment to assess your walk or run , one of the biggest selections of various name brands .	2557
1	drive through very slow at this location ... but i love taco bell ! !	859
1	this place was amazing ! i got there when they opened and was there until maybe 2 am . the piano player was named frank and there was n't a song he could n't play . there were many people from all over the world . i sang a couple of times and it was a lot of fun . fyi : if you tip the piano player a lot of money you can sing a whole bunch of songs at once . i got a beer and it was like $ 6 but did n't care . the bartenders who were there that night should have grammys ! i ca n't wait to go back there .	3326
1	best car wash in town . they guys are fast , friendly , and the customer service is amazing . i 've reached out to the manager several times to tell him what a great team he has . truly , these guys are great ! i will never go to any other car wash .	127
1	henry and gustavo thank you so much for the best customer service ever ! ! ! ! you guys were fast , efficient and got us the right part we needed with a smile ! ! ! thanks for the gloves too keep us clean doing this dirty job ! ! thanks for going the extra mile ! you 're the best ! ! !	2850
0	my husband signed up for a class and was first on the waiting list . i called 2 weeks before the class and made sure they had our cell number because we were coming from out of town , before the class , for thanksgiving . we received no calls the week before . we called the day before the class began and were told nothing and that they were full . we returned home to find several calls saying he had been accepted and then replaced because we had not called back . this organization is unprofessional and completely unorganized . beware ! ! ! !	3552
0	great sale going on , but did n't find anything worth buying . i did eye a couple of cute winter caps for 60 % off . however , after purchasing 2 burberry caps the previous day , i decided i was capped out ...	1655
0	not accepting new patients . why is it so hard to find mental health providers in las vegas ?	272
1	fun place with decent happy hour food . i would go back for sisig fries ! music is hit or miss depending if there 's a band or dj . service was n't bad . house draft beer is a good price for the taste . should be coming back again some day .	817
0	great food ... but they throw whipped cream in your face if anyone requests it . no birthday necessary ... .sorry ... not professional..	1518
1	first of all , this is known as ecuadorian style gelato . that was the very first thing i was told when the friendly staff was helping me and explaining to me all the flavors and stuff . the dessert is great tasting . very smooth like a sorbet and fruity like one as well . now if you 're lactose intolerant this place is perfect for you , if you want to try the traditional italian gelato you 'll have to go elsewhere . they also have other flavors besides fruity ones like chocolate and creme brulee which were great !	499
1	if you sit at the bar you seem to get taken care of better . the tables seem to be less personalable .	408
0	web site indicates this place is open sundays . heard great things , made the trip on a sunday only to find it closed , no explanation . called and message gives `` hours for this week '' which do n't include sunday so clearly there was no emergency to explain the closure . i do n't think this is a good way to run a business . people do n't call to check hours if they 're posted on a web site .	638
1	i 'm the program chair for the az museum of natural history and we used wandering donkey to cater one of our largest yearly events . they did an extraordinary job . the food was amazing , for the time in the history of this event we had no negative feedback from customers or staff on the food choices . the service was wonderful . thank you lance and beth for a great experience .	388
1	great market with all the good stuff . mostly covered ( shade ) . come early as things go fast .	1500
1	i recommend the bacon / cheddar egg sandwich on a chile bagel . also at the top of my list is the asiago bagel dog . the pastries are always a high quality . i suggest the strudel or the cinnamon sticks .	477
1	upon approaching the register , the lady gave us a nice greeting . military discount was added which is always great . the seats were very comfortable , i only gave it a 4 star because the arm rest would n't go up for some reason .	2000
0	when i moved out west , i also left behind my great team of awesome doctors back east . i do not like the service i 've gotten from this location . the service is abrupt and abrasive . there are no smiles , understanding or good service . it 's quite obvious that their patients are not top priority . i have n't changed to another doctor frankly because i 'm either too lazy or busy . it 's one extreme or the other . but i plan to before my next physical .	3739
0	total scam company from top to bottom . they will lure you in with promotions and discounts and then not honor them . when you call them afterwards they will give you the run around and eventually not return your call . look closely , they use different names for their company and different addresses and various phone numbers . do not trust them , better yet , do not do business with them .	1699
1	the hot dog was delicious , i had 22 toppings . the service was terrible , my wife 's hotdog came missing a couple of ingredients . the order was remade incorrectly - we all finished before they said she needed to reorder . she will finish at least 30 minutes after the rest of us- boo ! update - they comped the meal to make up for the poor experience , glad they took positive action to address this - thanks !	1407
0	i was really disappointed in this place since it has such great reviews . i ordered a plain waffle , bacon , and a hash brown . they were all terrible . the bacon was so burnt i would n't even give it to my dog . nevermind that everything had a sort of medal taste to it . i do n't know how they cook the hash browns but it had the weirdest flavor . while the waffle was light and crunchy , it also had a weird taste of aluminum . i do n't know what caused the flavor , but i suggest they by better ingredients and clean their cooking mediums . could not eat any of the food .	580
0	today a guys who work in this subway station said me : the canada speak only english ! he do n't no that his country speak english and french ( ottawa , québec and montréal 50 % speak french ) please how he can have this work ? i am french and i know more about his country than this boy ! bad representation of his country !	3864
0	worst expirence ive had left unhappy with my eyebrows , the lady helped me , was in soo rough , i specifically said only need to clean around please dont touch them , she literally made the soo thin , uneven its horrible ! ihad my mom with me she said the same , they look all nice and smiles until we paid , idid not tip ifelt angry , she gave my mother and awful face expression !	2062
1	if you like in northwest vegas and like wine & beer this place is like disneyland for grown ups . they have wines from every region and every varietal . they also have an extensive craft beer selection where you can fill a mixed six pack . check for coupons in the rj for deals off the wine . as a professional red wine consumer , this place rocks ! wine selection : a+ prices : a- ( a+ if you use the coupon ) craft beer selection : a snacks : b+ spirits : i do n't really drink hard liquor though it looks like they have a decent tequila selection	3199
1	the seats are spacious and very comfy the air condition is really high in the theaters and even with using my regal cinemas card the snacks were still very pricey	2671
1	great service , excellent prices , and knowledgeable staff . this was my first visit and i 'll be going back to them for all my car needs !	3379
0	horrible wait time personal in front desk staff do n't know what they doing system gets down often ! !	3059
0	what a waste of time and money ! ! nothing but tiny baby fish ! ! the shark tank was the only thing worth seeing ! ! way too exspensive for what there is to see ! ! very dissappointed in the city of cleveland for not being able to build a better aquarium ! !	706
0	i am new customer . i arrived there 5 mins before my schedule appointment , could n't find a parking . i did n't know that finding parking is hard here . they do n't have their own parking space.so i end up being late on my appointment , receptionist did n't even told me right away the other parking options , and my massage therapist has to be the one to tell me where to park . it 's just frustrating . your suppose to go to a massage place to relax not to get stressed instead ...	2791
1	great show ! amazing energy . venue organized very well . they take pictures for you before you enter hall , you can purchase it after the show $ 40.00 per pic . before the entrance they have metal detectors , for safety purposes . concert is about 2hours long .	1771
0	do n't eat here unless you want to be overcharged ! on december 15 we decided to celebrate my daughter 's asu gradation dinner at black and blue . the atmosphere was pleasant and the server was attentive and polite . the food was good and calamari was excellent . at the end of the evening i tipped the waiter exceptionally well and signed my credit card receipt . the problem came when i received my online back statement . i was over charged . i called the resturant . both times i was told a manager would call me back . this never happened . finally , i called my bank . i wo n't be dining at this restaurant again ! kris	1529
0	two weeks ago i went with my daughter and grandson . the photographer got great shots . we purchased the father 's day package , the disk , and extra sheets with enhancements . photographer had problems with the machine and could not print our photos . we were told they would be available the next day at the latest . two weeks , multiple unreturned phone calls to both this location and a message to corporate and still nothing . would like our pictures or our $ 200+ or both .	1749
0	needed a nail fixed because i broke it coming into vegas . stopped by the shop and they were too busy . came back the next day and requested to have it fixed . not only do they charge $ 20 to fix one broken nail but they totally did not even match the nail length to my other nails . when i asked her to fix it her solution was to cut down the rest of my nails down . never going here again .	2686
0	this review is specifically towards the deli . they are constantly slow when they finally come out of the back room to help a customer . i waited in line for over 20 minutes to find out they were out of turkey that is in their ad this week . they cant bother to put a sold out sign ? ! ? worst deli in the area .	2105
0	polish bubbled off within a day . i told them but they did n't follow through with the solution . and this was after they lost my appointment . ( not to mention that what they promised to make up for it , they did n't do . )	1370
1	the staff is very helpful . we opted to order cupcakes in a jar for my hubby 's birthday . cupcakes in a jar = 2 cupcakes and around $ 6 each . we got pink champagne , cookie monster , and custom made chocolate cheesecake flavors . yum ! the store smells fantastic when you walk in . need to go try more flavors ! ! !	1806
1	we came into town after a long day of driving . after checking into the hotel we needed a good meal . o'charley 's was the choice because of the variety . you have to come here ! the food is great . the service is better ! the bartender , latoya ( toya ) is top notch . our food arrived fast and piping hot . overall if you want a melt in your mouth prime rib , delicious seafood , and veggies cooked ... just so ; visit o'charley 's .	1549
1	great place to hang out ! bar tenders alexander , ryon with an o is awesome ! so is raul if you 're staying at the mgm come here to just hang out and play games such as beer pong , pool , dance dance revolution , etc . kinda like a dave and busters .	2494
1	this is new restaurant , very nice decorations , located in fun and beautiful area . staffs are yong and excellent , they made great food , sushi and asian food ! their mix drinks are so good ! good temperature here . we love it	973
0	beware ! do n't use the on-line booking tool ! even though it gives you option on-line and even via yelp , i was told it does not work . i was told to come back in 2 days . really ? why would a medical company this large allow a tool to be shared with their customers that does not work ? calling my primary to use another provider .	188
0	i guess we do n't f***ing learn . my wife went here this morning to take advantage of their 2 sausage biscuit with egg mcmuffin deal for $ 3.33 . she ordered 2 of them for $ 6.66 and it turned out to be a devil 's deal . they charged her for 4 mcmuffins and gave her only two . this is n't the first time i 've been shorted a mcmuffin here , but it is the first time i came two short and i 'm getting pretty cheesed off . they always give replacements when you go back and speak to the manager , but how about not having this garbage happen in the first place ? down to one star .	1220
1	i 've been to maison many times , but i took a hiatus for about a year . i went back last night and had a blast . i do think it 's much better on a fri than a sat ( if you 're into house music ) . the crowd is definitely on the pretentious side , but if you love to listen to some good house beats and be in a nice venue then you wo n't pay the crowd too much attention . try to find a comfortable spot to dance and guard it with your life . i would n't recommend bottle service , because it 's very pricey and you 're not really secluded .	2873
0	a stain stick gets stains off better . i 'd rather hose my suit off and let it dry outside than go this place . horrible customer service	2982
0	had a bad experience at this location- i ordered a photo calendar online , the confirmation email stated my order would be ready after 3:16 . i came in to pick it up at 3:20 , there was no one to help me , has to wait 15 min for the right person to come help me . turns out my calendar was n't ready and needed another 20 min to be printed . no apology whatsoever . i do n't have an hour to waste , yet i had to . unacceptable	3937
1	fantastic ! chilli chicken and beef curry with vegetables are amazing ! they can make it as spicy as you would like and they are very friendly ! the restaurant smells like bleach but it is clean ! totally recommend it and it is n't very expensive !	522
0	just have to say read read read your contracts . anything that you get told by them have written and signed with date because honestly their word is n't worth much . moving past the deceit and their shameful tactics , the gym is fairly small . stations constantly needing to be fixed . the only reason we went here was due to location and although this one was not the worst pf in the valley , if it were not walking distance i would not recommend .	2285
0	not happy - just had lunch here , and had the worst mandarin experience of my life - went for a nice lunch out with my best friend , only to be treated like sub-human because of my friend 's appearance ( very short hair , tattoo 's ) server must have assumed we were a lesbian couple and treated us as not worthy of the same service as every one else in the dining room . not a lesbian couple - but if we were , we came to your restaurant to eat , have a nice lunch and would expect the same level of service as anyone else . unhappy.. does n't even begin to describe it .	486
1	i 've been to a lot of bike shops in toronto , and this one is my favourite . the staff are friendly and helpful , and they have a great selection of products . i 've had my bikes serviced here a few times , and the work has always been good , fast , and reasonably priced .	1624
1	love how comfy this place is . it 's an watering hole for the locals , and they are quick to take you in and hear your story . one of the coolest bars i 've been to in toronto .	3077
1	i visited the barber of choix recently and was very impressed . i got a shave and a haircut . i had never had a straight razor shave and the experience is great . it 's very much like the old-style shave you see in movies with the relaxing chair , the hot towel , the mug shave-cream , the straight razor and then the after shave . the whole experience was very relaxing and fun . i would definitely recommend it .	2677
0	i bought the floor model and it has taken them forever to set up delivery . i understand the need to replace the one i bought before they ship it out but it has been over a month now and still nothing . i 'm not even getting updates on the status or anything . very frustrating .	679
0	it 's a nice enough store but the prices at this safeway just seem crazy sometimes . and the mandatory club card to keep the prices from just being outrageous is one of my personal pet peeves ( also the phrase , pet peeve ) produce is good enough here , store is clean it 's just those ridiculously bad prices . oh on a positive note they do have one of the better floral departments of any grocery store in the area .	2785
0	do not go here ! i was seen three days ago for a uti and given the wrong medication . when i called back yesterday to ask to be reseen since my symptoms had returned , they refused to help me . now i 'm headed to the emergency room at 3 am in hopes of getting some kind of help .	2580
1	i love my therapist sharose , she is the best of the best period ! ! ! ! the front desk girls already know my name and they are always ready when i get there , they check me in and everything works perfect for me .	528
0	i did not even drive 15 miles on my vehicle before it shut down in the middle of the road with my mom and daughter on board . a burning smell came from the engine and hot air blew from the ac . it was a 2015 traverse with only 33k miles on it . i was reassured it went thru a rigorous 120 point inspection and would not be on their lot if any deficiencies from that inspection were found . no car would break down like this without an identifiable major defect . we shall see how hertz opts to rectify this situation on monday . i will keep everyone posted .	290
1	i love the staff here they help inform me of the personality of each dog that i was looking into . i they have such a great amount of animals i wish i could have taken more home with me than i did . i also appreciate that if the dog is n't fixed they do that and microchip the dog . you also can take the dog in for a free exam at some locations within ten days of the adoption which i believe to be really helpful . i am so happy with my experience there .	3626
1	really great neighborhood bar . well poured drinks , cheap pool , what else do you need ? will definitely go back .	1567
0	very rude and unfriendly employees ! ! overpriced compare to other asian stores but no choice since this is only korean market in town .	715
1	this place just rocks ! a bit pricey , but you truly get what you pay for . the food is awesome , the menu has a ton of great dishes . the live music was great . my girlfriend and i went during restaurant week . we went to the arboretum location . check out their menu . from top to bottom , it all tastes great . wish i could afford to go there weekly : )	1147
0	no restaurant , order from bar . this is a $ 6.00 cheesecake ! really ? i should get a candy bar from the vending machine .	230
0	had a coupon so i decided to try this place . i had 2 suits dry cleaned and one was ruined . there are now several indents that i can not smooth out . save your money and go somewhere else . i 've used pine cleaners , which is across the street , and had a pretty good experience . stay away from this place unless you want your clothes to get ruined .	861
1	one of the better target stores - not too crowded , nice selection of products , friendly staff .	3355
0	i think this place changed ownership . they are horrible now . the phones we have had repaired here consistently keep falling off . they try to say it 's bc our phones are bent but they are clearly not bent . brought back and they reglued the screen on.. but now there are bubbles under the screen that is there forever . just horrible . when i called to get my money back , they refused . go somewhere else .	2930
1	i only come here for the hot table combos which imo are a great deal and are fairly good in quality and quantity . also a great selection of latin american food products at reasonable prices	2069
1	have had a brew here and bought some beans a while back , but did n't sufficiently impress to return . a friendly venue , they are usually packed but then their space is quite small too . quite possibly the best stand-alone specialty drink place in the kensington area ( better than second cup and the faded star ... of the industry ) , but i 'd have to go again to re-assess .	2163
0	there prices were okay although not great ... my issue was service . i got there at the same time as another young lady and they fell all over themselves to help her ... while i waited and waited and waited . they brought her a veil and talked all about things with her . meanwhile they could n't seem to care less about my business . their loss . i bought a dress this afternoon .	3394
0	they stripped my lug and now i have to have the entire thing replaced . they charged me for fixing a flat that really just needed air in the tire . they told my friend her flat was fixed . the next day she brought the car back because it was flat again and they could n't get the tire off because they tightened it too hard . i 'm not sure what 's going to happen with that . if it seems to good to be true it is . do n't go here especially if you are a woman .	247
1	i love top golf ! came here from portland , or area for vacation and went and played a few games . also had the buffalo sliders and pickle fries . such good food and fairly priced !	1483
1	the staff at spectrum dermatology is wonderful , everyone is so kind and helpful . specifically , i have seen lauren miller twice now for laser hair removal and she is both professional and personal in her practice . she explained the procedure to me from a scientific standpoint , as well as what to expect , leaving me with no surprises . she made me feel so comfortable , and i am already seeing wonderful results in just two visits ! thank you lauren , you 're the best !	2099
0	this place is just an awful place to eat . i bought the shish kabab meal . paid . 23.50 for about 2 oz of meat ( tasted rancid ) it came with a spoon of rice and a salad that was worse then the meat . i threw the food in the garbage and made my way to maimanna in ajax . i have never been so displeased .	1235
1	$ 5.99 vegetarian platter for lunch ( tues-thurs ) is a great deal and delicious ! dal , mixed veg , rice , naan , dessert i 've had the buffet here in the past and loved it enough to come back .	1507
0	are they still open ? just went by and the doors were locked , lights low and someone was in there . tried to open the doors and the person did n't do anything . told a friend about it and apparently they went recently too and the same thing happen . however no signs anywhere saying closed and it was 5:30pm when we went ... . weird !	84
0	meh ive had better . its not much cheaper than pretty in the city either so just go there .	2961
0	these offices are filthy . for the price they want it is definitly not worth it . i went on a tour with the manager jenifer and she was very rude and pushy . it was very chaotic and not a place i will put my office .	1157
0	came in here for the first time and honestly it was not good i order the poki salad with ahi tuna and shrimp first off the tuna was really disgustingly fishy and smelled bad it made me a little gross out because fresh fish it 's not supposed to be fishy i would n't recommend this place but i 'm glad i tried it out	129
0	i visited earlier this month . we were alone on the ground floor . no server came for 40 minutes . i had to call for a server . we planned to stay for an hour . by the time food and drinks came , time was up . unfortunate incident . have been there before but never had this issue .	1483
1	station is clean and staff helpful . but pittsburgh deserves a more grand venue . city needs to invest in the place . took train to harrisburg and return to look at leaves . on time departure and arrival both ways . lots of fun sights along the way .	3601
0	terrible atmosphere . not only do you have to eat your food with your hands it 's an extremely uncomfortable environment in pitch black the food is sub par with very fishy fish and low-end beef . you ca n't complain or say anything since your dining in the dark but the food tastes horrendous . the prices are extremely high for the quality of food and service you are receiving . would never recommend this place	449
0	good for state street , could use some interesting shops ( boring ) . this is a great interior , nice selection ... . but.. too expensive ! !	1045
0	celebrated our 21st anniversary last night , should have gone somewhere else . service was ok but food was over cooked , tough chicken , medium steak was burnt . told waitress , she apologized , took $ 7 off of bill ( probably ) cost of chicken ) . very disappointed , will go to other options in the madison area next time	951
0	do not let these people in your home , broken tiles , broken blinds , and terrible service . these people did wrong by me and i would stay far far away from them . they would not fix the broken tiles or blinds and left my home much worse than when they came .	1836
0	after contacting boehmer the other day to fix my ac ( ok fixed the heater and now ac , what else can go wrong ? knock on wood ) sadly , this time i feel totally taken advantage of so i need to downgrade my rating . several people we have spoken to have stated that we paid way too much for this part replacement , and i agree after seeing how much this part actually costs . the moral of the story here is call around for estimates . get the diagnosis and get several estimates to compare . it seems like all these hvac guys are out to take advantage .	1601
0	i 'm sure that the turn around is high at this place because the manger is very unprofessional , especially wanting to argue with everyone who wants to write a negative review . check out the google reviews lol .	1806
0	i used to be a customer at their warner/alma school store for years . the people that worked there were consumer friending and fast . i took my desktop to their new location on baseline and it looks like a whole new crew . all young kids . not once did i get an update call . i had to call everyday for updates . their people have no communication skills . it took five days for a small fix . once i got it back , it started back up again but now my email will not work and the computer will not recognize my cell phone when plugged in.. they lost me ... ..	2523
0	i went there for an inspection and an oil change . they failed to refill my wiper fluid , they left a half-attached windshield wiper , and they also left a wrench inside of my engine . despite all of this , they refused to give me a refund . this place is a complete joke , and they do n't care a bit about their customers .	3020
0	beware this place has no consideration or care to finding you a home or even letting you know before you waste your time applying for a place that it has already been approved . if you are ever in a hurry this is definitely the last place you want to go . the owner is a complete jerk with no sense or customer service what so ever .	3126
1	ever seen an old tv show where the service station actually gave you `` service '' and wish you had a time machine to go there to get work on your car ? i give you that time machine by heading over to don and his staff at brakemasters ! they have serviced our car a few times for various ailments . the price was always fair and the work was always done impeccably . it 's a clean shop and they are straight shooters and they obviously love cars ! what a pleasure . can recommend without hesitation .	2485
0	only one authorized person who can handle fish ! ? waiting for 30mins with no help . last time for me	2174
0	i was really disappointed with luckee . while the dishes were generally well-prepared , with good ingredients , the menu was very limited , and all the dishes were overpriced . when it comes to dim sum , however , i 'm more of a traditionalist . i do n't need fancy crab dumplings topped with truffle . also , $ 18 for a beef short rib lunch rice bowl ? ? overall , while the flavors were pretty decent here , i 'd recommend you head elsewhere to one of the many other great dim sum restaurants in toronto .	1441
1	i am only giving 5 stars because the girl that vacuumed my car was amazing ! ! ! she is very friendly and clearly the hardest worker there ! ! give that girl a raise ! ! !	1502
0	average boba at best . i 've had far better in the phoenix metro and nearby areas . my taro boba had very little flavor and way too much ice and not blended very well .	2980
1	great service in the office , calls etc . adam and damien did a great job , done in 20 minutes . very professional	3933
0	07.06.16_they installed new payment stations that accept cash or credit card . i put in $ 2 in quarters and it ejected $ 1.75 . that pissed me off , so i tried the card payment -- which had no display to tell the amount you would pay . lo and behold , it then charged me $ 10 , after displaying i had used $ 2.71 worth of time . what a ripoff . used this place for years -- no more . i 'm going down the street to saguaro carwash ( 11419 n saguaro blvd ) .	3531
1	went into the t mobile store to find a phone for my brother amir was very helpful . he was able to give us the best deal possible . including me still being able to pay $ 20 for my unlimited data . thank you amir you 're the real mvp . we will be back .	1772
0	i have been to this dealership twice now looking to purchase a explorer and both times walked out with nothing ! ! bryce , our salesman is clearly no help ! he was n't willing to work with us . on our second visit we found the vehicle we wanted but , clearly the tires needed to be replaced if i bought the vehicle . i do n't believe i should pay $ 28,000 for a vehicle and have to turn around and spent another $ 1,000 for new tires . i	1949
0	use to love this salon . was there last tuesday ( 6/26/18 ) with my husband . pedicures and manicure . my husband was happy with his pedicure . guy doing mine got up several times to check his phone and to go to the back . when he did my manicure he made a not so nice comment about my nails . less than 1 week later , polish is peeling off my nails and cuticles look like they were in a war . i live on the other side of town and specifically went to this location due to previous experience ... .never again !	3374
0	over priced coffee with too much sugar and fat rolled into it . slow drive thru too .	2145
1	this is one of our favorite chinese restaurants in town . over the years i have probably had everything on the menu . the sizzling rice soup is the best i 've had . i usually have one of the shrimp dishes , my favorite being the kung pao shrimp .	1264
0	i have had too many bad experiences with the manager at the car-x on bradley avenue to return to this shop ever again . upon first impressions , dave seems like a likeable , knowledgeable guy . however , after multiple visits to the shop for a recurring issue with tires i purchased there , i can come to no other conclusion than he has no integrity . beware !	1044
0	horrible customer experience ! ! ! walked out not buying anything . i have never been disappointed at t.h.c the holistic center	3491
0	one of the worst airlines . my flight was the last flight of the day from bellingham to las vegas , 6:53 pm . i was notified by text that the flight was cancelled and i was rebook ed the next day . went to the airport ticket counter - no hotel , food or transportation expenses covered . no solution , tough luck corporate doublespeak from the zombie ticket agent . never fly allegiant	3127
0	have been a loyal patron for years and i tell everyone about how awesome the food is here ! had out of town guests last saturday and really wanted to introduce them to blue 32 . the hostess completely ignored me , standing right in front of her , not once but twice , and seated people who came in after me , while i stood there ! very unhappy ! ! ! i will never be back ! i 'm pretty good sized to miss seeing ! no excuse ! !	428
1	shaved ice with fresh fruit and condensed milk . delicious ! owner operated , friendly service .	1898
0	i 'd rather have root canal work done then return there . i had a few questions about having a weapon shipped and all i got was short rude answers as if i was some second class citizen . it was obvious that my business was n't appreciated so i walked out .	1183
1	love there pastry and soups ! i do not like the sandwiches got one of mine burnt . other that that , great service	867
1	good chinese style food with decent prices , like the ambience and proximity to metro so you can easily get there . overall a good place to munch	1016
0	do your research people , this place is completely unprofessional . i went in for a juvederm procedure in my lips , and i was very disappointed by the way i looked right after the procedure and even several weeks after . my lips were extremely painful , swollen , bruised , and disproportioned . this place is not a good place to go to for lip augmentation , be aware . choose a good md .	306
0	atmosphere is great ! hamburger was barely mediocre at $ 17.60 for a plain one . meat was tasteless & in a ball , so did n't fit bun well . fries were good . french onion soup not hot enough - was n't that brown crusty melted cheese we like and too . sweet . asked for mayo-got one teaspoon -no kidding . service was not greatest , so overall , not going back & rated it one star ( especially since it was overpriced )	1538
0	do n't try ordering something you see in their website . the work is amateur , then they treat you like crap when you are disappointed because it looks so amateur . my cardinals football cake has two 50-yard lines ! ! !	1806
1	after getting frustrated with a damaged natural nail , i decided to just get acrylics . went to vy 's for a full set and have been back once for a fill and a pedicure . i like to call earlier in the day and set up an appointment , they can alway fit me in ! they are very friendly , do a beautiful job and have excellent prices .	3732
0	worst service i 've ever had . every time i ever go there the waitresses and bartenders act like we 're doing them some service by coming . they do n't treat us friendly they do n't smile they do n't like even act like they like you . i 'll never go back .	704
1	my son wants me to bring him here to vipairsoft every week ! i do n't understand the addiction , but if he loves it that much ... i 'm happy ! i 'm glad they have rules so i have no reason to worry .	3058
1	this leslie 's location is by far the best in town , ignore the reviews from years ago , they now have all new staff that are very knowledgeable and greatly courteous . the store manager anthony seems too know everything you need to know about pools , he was extremely helpful and got my pool looking absolutely perfect with his chemical recommendations . i will tell anyone with a pool to go to this specific leslie 's location	3311
0	sandwiches are okay , but it 's the little things that will keep me from going back . like charging for a drink refill , charging 4 % to use a credit or debit card , but then not taking a check .	675
1	walked in this place and ordered an bagel , with salmon and all the fixings . $ 9 bucks ! ... ... .well worth it . will be coming back again .	325
1	never had a bad experience at this store but today was even better . came to exchange and return a few things i bought online . unfortunately , they did n't have the size i needed in stock . reordering and refund was easy peasy thanks to kim . she took care of everything for me . it does n't hurt that she has a very sunny personality as well . they also offer military discount btw .	2617
1	this is the goodlife location i 've been coming to lately . i have n't been organized enough to check the class schedule before i come down here , but the machines are in pretty good shape . they have a ladies only area , it 's pretty clean . i 'm not afraid of the showers . really , there 's not much more you can ask of from a gym .	3409
1	i visited the arizona science center on sunday for the new exhibition regarding animation and it was amazing . definitely kid-friendly great activities that even i as an adult liked . all the favorite cartoons are there the simpsons , spongebob squarepants , looney tunes , all of them .	3891
0	this place is so dirty . i lost my appetite and left the store without ordering ( its ok , there was n't a team member in sight to notice me in the store anyhow ... . ) if that is what the dining area looks like , what do the kitchen and prep areas look like ? gross .	2902
0	i feel like they went from a discount store to a pretend discount store . after a recent remodel their prices have gone up substantially . i loved shopping there for dresses and the last time i went the dresses i were looking at were close to $ 40 . that price is basically what i would pay at dillard 's or tilly 's . i prefer ross much more .	1608
1	one of our favorite restaurants in south charlotte is mickey and mooch . we 've dined there for special occasions ( just the two of us ) and hosted and attended parties for 35 or more and have always had wonderful service and our guests always rave about the food . the chef and the owners will occasionally visit your table and you 'll find it difficult to get a better steak at any other restaurant in charlotte . great food , service and atmosphere .	1147
0	i got a @ starbucks gift card as a gift from a dear friend of mine , so i placed an order 4 refreshers on my mobile app spending my own hard earned $ forgetting about the gift card . i pull up to the speaker and decided i wanted a frappuccino so i order it , go up to the window to find out they did n't activate it . the cashier turned into a c+×÷ acting like i was trying to get 1 over on her after i just bought my own shit . i tell u what i 'm calling corporate and telling them what happened . and , personally i will never go back . f+×÷ leavitt road lorain starbucks .	2206
1	this is my first experience with allegiant and i have no complaints . flew from fayetteville , ar to las vegas . all flights were on time and all employees very helpful and friendly . i even had to call customer service a couple of times and had no problem getting thru and wait time was maybe 5 minutes . they were very helpful . we paid extra to pick our seats and check our bags and it was still cheaper than other airlines and a direct flight . had no problem with mobile check in and boarding pass . just remember if you want snacks or something to drink take your own . they do charge for all drinks and snacks .	3127
1	love this museum , there is a play kitchen , a craft area and big squishy blocks for the kids to play with in kidtopia . the museum side has exhibits and a black light room , painting and lots of hands on stuff for kids . my kids are 4 and 3 and they love it there . the only drawback is they do n't have a snack bar , but they have a lunch room so we just pack a lunch and eat there before our naps .	3018
1	i just had our trees trimmed and i have to tell everyone what a great job they did ! they were on time , professional and fast . the rate was reasonable . we highly recommend 2 white guys ... and a dog .	2387
1	pricey but clearly worth the cost . best pizza i 've ever eatten . so good you wo n't care the cost . family owned & the owner is often on premises . explains how they started and how they import their ingredients . this is some good pizza , you better come get you some of this pizza ! ! ! ! the pasta dishes are just as good	1371
1	what makes this place so good is their homemade tortillas ! i am picky when it comes to tortillas but this is the real deal ! one of the best salads i 've ever had ! my favorites : pork barbacoa salad ( no beans , no rice ) w/ half house dressing & half cilantro lime vinaigrette	1365
0	i used to be a pt of doctor o'clair and she was the best doctor i 've ever had . once she left , i should have too . i wo n't mention the other doctors i saw because i never had a negative experience with them . great doctors . i moved to florida last may and called them in september to have my medical records faxed over . then they decide to charge me the annual patient fee ! ? i 'm not even a patient anymore and i am being charge for a fax ? very upset that the practice charges a ridiculous fee .	236
0	another rant ! residence with dogs ... if you 're going to use the doggy park clean up after your animal . there is feces all over the place in there and its over 100 degrees the smell let alone it will attract roaches ants ect . respect your community . i mean jeez there are poop bags there for a reason . you show no class . oh and signs on the gate unless your dumb and ca n't read . ill be snapping photos when people are in there using it if i have too . its disgusting . i dont want to see the inside of your home . smdh	2992
1	this is a great dealership . i had very good experience when returning from a trip to utah , my bike broke down and was towed to this dealer ship . major repairs were done on my bike . the staff , management , and technicians were very knowledgeable , professional and care about customer . i highly recommend this dealership , even if you have to go out of your way .	94
0	buy a burrito somewhere else - complete garbage . $ 15 for a `` super '' burrito and a water - the burrito was the size of a taco bell 7 layer burrito . sour cream and guac ? ? ? though ordered , they must have run through this burrito in track shoes because those ingredients were outta there . ya feel me ? ?	623
0	rory r. i brought my dog in for a groom only . the groomer was very nice and accomodating , however if are asking me to rate the actual grooming then i honestly have to say it was a very amateur job . my dog 's coat was very uneven , and pretty much butchered . also after two weeks or so , he kept scrtching his ears , so i took a tweezers and plucked out the fur from his ears , which is usually a standard procedure when he goes to other groomers . his ears were not cleaned at all and i pulled out lots of fur . i also paid the most i have ever paid any other groomer .	2988
0	this place sucks ! apparently , you ca n't watch the steeler game because someone downstairs wants to watch the cincinnati/san diego game according to bob the manager . he sucks and so does this place . i am here with a group of over 30 tailgaters . you 'd think they would accommodate us since we 've been giving them business for years !	2532
1	i had the pleasure of getting jesus piralta the other day to help with finish some kitchen hookups . he was extremely professional and did an amazing job . he was super friendly and a very honest and hard worker . ca n't wait to get him to finish a couple other projects i have to do . thank you guys for your honest hard work .	1015
0	the actual product part of the store is not bad or not all bad at least . the pharmacy section is another story . some of the `` pharmacists '' are down right rude and unprofessional . as a paying customer , there 's absolutely no reason for the non-courteous treatment . if they are unhappy with their current career their , they should probably get into another field .	2080
0	i had came here one previous time and had such a great experience i did n't mind paying $ 60 for a great car wash . this time it all changed . payed $ 60 for a superior interior and definitely received an inferior interior . the cup holders were not wiped out at all , the shifter still had a coffee spill that they did n't try to wipe off and it just does not look like i had my car detailed when after paying $ 60 you want your car clean . i wo n't be coming back here and i recommend everyone else find a different car wash .	2198
1	i 've been in twice after crossfit workouts with my crossfit family and i must say that the service has been excellent both times . it took them a little longer than expected to get my quesadilla ready last night but gabi and makenzie were great servers . my only complaint and it really is n't a complaint was the $ 7 i paid for the tall shock top . both of my experiences there have been superb so far and i would recommend it to a friend .	1520
1	convenient location off the beltline . same coffee as every other starbucks . only pet peeve is that they store mobile orders behind the counter so i have to wait for an employee to retrieve it vs. picking it up on my own .	1934
0	just got home from visiting brass taps with a friend of mine . the food was pretty rough , beers were standard , but the service was slow . both me and my friend felt pretttty awful after eating the burgers . a definite bummer .	311
1	chisty is amazing . i drive a bit to see her once a month . i got my full face done and am so happy . will be back .	2986
1	pricey alternative but good alternatives - this panera bread is pretty busy with friendly staff who will kindly help with the ordering process . i especially like that what i ate was very filling and nutritious .	251
0	great menu , but poorly executed . kitchen was afraid to use salt and pepper on the burger . unfortunately , they were n't afraid to overcook the burger . probably one of the worst burgers i 've ever choked down . i love craft beer and burgers . i live nearby and want it to succeed . i 'm doing the business a disservice if i do n't share my experience . when we were there , it was very `` echo-y '' because of the high ceiling . it needed some music to counter that effect . we wo n't be returning anytime soon .	68
1	love coming here . decided to go after passing by everyday , i was impressed ! the chicken lettuce wraps are delicious ! ive ordered so much sushi from here that i cant name but it is always really good and well made . popiahs are good ! no complaints for this place , i 'm a regular here !	961
0	2/10 home warranty uses this company ... and their service is horrible . they would n't fix my tenants refrigerator , because the `` coils needed cleaning '' ... newsflash , nobody cleans refrigerator coils , and they know that . just a simple excuse not to repair the appliance .	3885
1	connie is the best . she has been my hairdresser for 10 years . she always recommend me about color and style that will match me . always walk out of her salon with my beautiful hair . also she recommend me about hair products that my hair need . she 's awesome . the best hairdresser in las vegas .	3500
1	petit café sympa , peu de place assise . bonne bouffe , bon expresso . un service correcte , sans plus . idéale pour casser la croûte , avec un ami , ou simplement lire sur la terrasse qui donne directement sur l'ambiance de prince arthur .	332
1	i love it here ! the food is delicious and the service is awesome . the salt n vinegar waffle fries are soooo good .	580
0	this place is just `` ok '' . the macaroons were very disappointing . they were really chewy and cold . the macaroons at the kak shop are so much better , which really surprised me given that this establishment is supposed to be more authentic . the croissant i got was nothing to write home about either , and i felt like the service and ambience were just lacking . ultimately , i was disappointed and probably will not waste any time coming here again .	1160
0	the people are nice but it is pretty unsanitary and the man/boss that works at the front desk is all about volume . they will tell you 5 minute wait but it ends up being much longer . they are also not very good at honouring appointements .	3592
0	okay , so i 've been in to this bakery four times . the first time was great and the cookies hit the spot . the second and third times i went in the cashier was rude and the cookies were overdone . today was the fourth visit . there were no cookies and when i asked i was told , `` not today . '' i had apparently interrupted the cashier and get friend 's conversation . i do n't care if the cookies were good . i will never go to this place again . pretentious , rude , and hit or miss on the treats . there are better places to go .	981
0	this place is bull , i have a friend the just had a party for her husbands 40th , top golf just screwed her . the management is not very cooperative . they have the worst customer service , took all the food and drink chips 1/2 hour before the party ended . our party of over 20 people will never have a party here . will go somewhere else .	1483
0	took over an hour to get a fill and it was n't busy . nails popped off in less than a week .	91
1	it was pretty good . we would order again . i 'm from jersey and i have n't had a 5 star pizza in town yet . friendly and punctual .	1399
1	love this bar ! everyone here treats each other like family . the bartenders are terrific and so sweet and fun to talk to . great atmosphere . eddieoke on thursdays is a blast ! always a good time to be had !	245
0	thank you to sarah l for bringing to my attention that the lunch menu from which i got my information about the $ 34 crab cake entree was for the nyc location . however , i did note that the crab cake appetizer at the scottsdale location - presumably a smaller portion than the lunch entree - is $ 16 . yes , yes . it is barney 's and i understand the premium pricing . what i question is how fred 's scored only $ $ . i often eat out with those on a tighter foodie budget than mine ; the $ $ is misleading , when oregano 's is also $ $ . just sayin ' .	941
1	great quality at good prices . i was the only and first one to use a coupon . elyse was awesome !	2071
1	sierra gold is a nice bar to chill at . plenty of people if you do n't like the dead atmosphere . the food 's pretty good . it 's good to know the bartender too . there 's pool tables there to play on which is about it . it 's spaced out pretty nicely too , and people can enjoy watching the games on the flat screen televisions .	1520
0	weeks ago my partner went and got a cut from a guy that scraped up his neck very badly because he was distracted talking . but , since there are n't a ton of options in to , he went back today hoping to get cleaned up again by someone else . he waited nearly 2 hours and got then got bumped when the dudes ' buddies walked in . when he approached the staff about this he was told `` maybe you 're not our type of customer '' . got that right !	3239
1	snoh is such a great place within walking distance of asu 's downtown campus to indulge in a variety of sweet and refreshing treats . i have yet to try their brick toast but milk teas and their `` snoh '' are both very good and not repulsively saccharine . i particularly enjoy the matcha flavored snoh with condensed milk glaze . atmosphere = casual and trendy with some cool murals . snoh also offers plenty of board games and outdoor activities such as cornhole .	3556
1	i love how the store smells ! the place is open and inviting . staff is friendly and knowledgeable on the product . beautiful handmade natural soaps that leaves your skin super soft . do n't even get me started on the bath bombs ! : )	3171
1	worst mistake i made was when i moved out of peoria was to take my cars to showcase honda . arrowhead has always done me right and i will drive the extra miles to go there service .	2210
0	first timers drove 25 minutes to get my sons hair cut here after reading the raving reviews . i walk 2 children in 112° heat from the car to the shop and there 's a sign posted that they closed early . unfortunately we wo n't be returning .	3548
1	so far super impressed with the service and sushi ! you have to try the flaming roll : ) yum !	774
1	excellent spa ! relaxing , fresh fruit . clean ! enjoy my day of spa treatments , it 's the typical spa , nothing really stood out to me , but very nice to come and relax .	2317
0	my wife and i go to the spa for massages quite often . we always make a day of it using all the hotel amenities and enjoying a quiet evening meal at one of the restaurants . unfortunately , 3 days after our spa day last week , i woke up with a rash that has been diagnosed as `` hot tub folliculitis '' , a bacterial infection from unsanitary hot tubs . i hope the management takes note of this as i have always enjoyed my time there .	2305
1	let me start by saying i 'm very particular about my hair but do n't want to spend an hour for a haircut . my friend brandon said they have great staff and know what you want with a couple questions . he was right . the work speaks for itself . try it out	3232
1	great place . friendly staff . no small side phone but they do have medium and larges . their rice dishes are good as well . got the rice with pork chop and a large pho . wish they put more beef in the soup as well but i 'm not complaining . i ate there two days in a row so far . vietnamese ice coffee was great ! not too sweet , not too bitter . loved it	1114
0	i came in to the office 10-16-17 i was in pain and i was a walk in . they did n't take full x-rays i think because of my insurance over the phone the girls told me in 's may cover what i needed and i told her what i needed . waited about 4 hours to tell me insurance wo n't cover it . i was so up i 'm in pain and they waisted my time because i could have paid somewhere else cheaper i only went because they told me the insurance would cover it . make sure you have an appointment when you go in . expect to be there for a while . depending on your insurance they will prioritize .	3618
0	just your average starbucks . nothing special . the breakfast sandwiches are so hot and burn my mouth on every occassion . i have told the sales people but they say they have to cook them at a certain temperature .	2723
1	living here for 9 months . quite decent apartments . all service requests are attended on same day . close to all stores and eateries . cleanliness and greenery is good . the staff do come out arrogant . but rest all is great	1698
0	food is good but the service is questionable at best ! i ordered sushi , my family ordered from the kitchen . they were done eating before i even received my food . i always tip the sushi guys before the meal out of habit , since it will often ensure prompt service . i was seriously tempted to take my tip back . that was ridiculous !	1326
0	horrible service ! employee nathena was loud and very unprofessional . i would not recommend buying from this establishment or working for a poor management .	1940
0	do not go here ! ! ! i came in with a nail in my tread and a bent rim ! ! left with a busted open rim and a good ole `` you need all new tires '' when i just got new ones a month ago ! ! do . not . go . here . waste of money . they will try and fool you ! !	946
1	i know why victoria 's secret models love gold therapy . this is really amazing . right now on sale just $ 99 . omg i love my skin now . so glowing	2647
0	the worst place ever staff to management . there contract is a bullshit even if your dead they sue you to collect wo n't let you transfer membership .	3268
0	horrible customer service ! the counter girl needs some customer service courses big time . when i asked to speak to a manager i got the owner and she was non apologetic about the quality of her staff . she spoke to me with just as much attitude as the counter girl . very unprofessional business practice .	235
0	what is the deal with the new property management company ? ? everyone in the leasing office has a major attitude problem . when you bring in a concern , instead of addressing it or taking it to the right person they tell you how it 's not their fault and it 's someone else 's job . it does n't matter what the problem is , billing issues , maintenance problems , packages they signed for ... no one in that office accepts any ownership or accountability for finding a resolution .	3299
1	was here for the grand opening and it was way worth the wait ! no more driving down to avondale this is a perfect location . on the inside everything is even better . got to see the new movie the accountant in the cine 1 xl which has the widest screen not only in the valley but in the whole western region ! 83 ' ft wide to be exact . plus the dolby atmos sound theres nothing else like it . for being the opening day everything went smoothly ! i think this place was more than we could all expect but much needed for the area . ca n't wait to come back again !	564
0	the food is great but the outside is gross , there 's nothing but transients outside , i kno the area is rough but there should be human poop on the walls along with the smell of pee . owners should hire security during business hours to escort these people off the property .	1455
1	completely lovely in every way ! the delicious food , wonderful people , and soothing decor . : ) we enjoyed the kanapki , kartofle , and pierogis . the mixed drinks and authentic polish beer ( okocim ) more than hit the spot . everything we had was bursting with flavor ! great job apteka crew - ca n't wait to come back .	21
0	if the rumors are true and starbucks is moving in across the street- they better get it together real quick . sign says they open at 6am yet they do n't have any coffee brewed or tea ready until 6:20am . be prepared to wait for your drink ... or you can go thru the drive thru at starbucks ( it 's probably cheaper too ! ) great coffee but so unorganized and lacks management and discipline ! !	407
1	solid nail salon in shadyside . parking lot is adjacent which is very convenient . prices are reasonable and the place is clean .	1817
0	confirmed our rental twice the day before we were supposed to pick up the car . arrive the next morning to pick it up and they tried telling us we rented a small car instead of the nissan armada ? then they proceeded to say the armada had been recalled this morning and they took it to the nissan dealership ... keep in mind we showed up at 7:45 so they would 've had to take car earlier than that . no one seemed to know what they were doing it is an absolute mess here i do not recommend whatsoever . seemed very shady	2862
1	i took the daughter and this time i tried the pho ga ... it is yummy . they give you a tray of condiments that you can add , i chose to add the spice paste/sauce to give it a little kick . i have also made it back to get my take out of ginger and chicken when i was feeling a little under the weather ... bought 2 orders and the hubbie got to try it and enjoyed it .	194
1	this is my place to go when needing a massage . the place is lovely , the staff is amazing and never disappoints me .	1192
0	i should n't have gone on without a hazmat suit ... gross , smells gross , drinks are weak and not cheap which they should be . i enjoy a dive bar but this place is just a place to go when you are at the end of the rope .	1091
1	was doing some looking around for apartments and stumbled upon this great place . i walked in was promptly greeted by ventura vargas . he brought me over to his desk . he was very professional answered all of my questions and concerns . showed me around the property very nice it has 4 pools a gym and a great common area with internet pool table and a movie theater . parking was the best you can park anywhere plus when it comes to guests they can park anywhere . . so close to the asu campus and tempe market place .	3148
1	i 've had mr. penny and his crew out to our house for our hot tub electrical installation and a few other items . i highly recommend them . their prices are great , the service is outstanding and we 've never had any issues with their work . a great company !	1867
1	i 've been a member of this bank for about 5 years . this is my favorite branch and i come here often . i get treated with respect.. the atm occasionally does n't work . that 's my one complaint .	2023
0	... the theater is alright , i guess , and it is n't very crowded ... .plus it has a merry-go-round . i think that sums up the good parts . just not sure why anyone would go here considering some of the other malls in the area .	2815
0	do n't waste your money on their food . the beef and chicken they use in their dishes is precooked so it has no flavor and is dry . if you are charging $ 15 for thai fried rice it better be good but no .	779
1	i love this place . the chicken tenders and waffle were great . the potato scramble was also good . will def be going back	580
0	i ate here once , my patty was cooked rare . the fries were old tasting swimming in kewpie mayo and then blanketed with seasoning salt . employees were vaping in the back of building . im glad many people like it but i will never return .	964
0	went to melrose on sunday , we waited an hour for a table which was to be expected , come to find out the dining room was half empty with dirty tables which seems to be why the wait was so long then the waitress informs us that it was buffet only which was sub par which is being generous , the service was lacking for a buffet style service in a restaurant that is typically a full service venue . we will not be back to melrose .	1432
1	ran in for something to eat after checking into the hotel ... . greeted by friendly bartender . we ordered the black n bleu burger , with a side of vegetables . it was good , the bacon was a bit salty but than may just have been me . we will be back , maybe next time to catch a game .	2532
0	doctor is probably great but you would never know that because after calling 3 times day for over a week neither me nor my insurance was successful at getting the scheduling staff to answer . finally started pushing every single extension to try to make some headway and the lady that answered the phone sounded irritate and flustered before i could even say `` hello '' .	3798
1	love boba tea house cause they will redo your drink if you do n't like it ! sometimes the service is really good and sometimes they look like they hate u . overall their drinks are yummy i like their flavored teas . but their boba is flavorless so i usually get the jellies . i wish the place was bigger so there 's more seating cuz it 's usually busy . also the snacks are good and the owner is super friendly !	490
1	great service and a very friendly , warm atmosphere ! the classic pedicure was awesome and even came with a nice massage . also , i got a full set of acrylics that turned out lovely ! i 'll be coming back and i definitely recommend this nail place	3309
1	my friend and i went here for my birthday weekend a week ago today and boy let me tell you these men know what they 're doing very sexy ! ! .we will definitely return ... its going to be our tradition every time we 're in vegas , which is quite a few times a year thank you hunk mansion to the best birthday a girl can ask for..see you soon	5
0	some of the worst customer experience i have ever come across . i came into macy 's looking to buy a watch and instead had to hunt down an employee that would finally allow me to spend money in their store . when i asked multiple employees if they could assist me in trying on some watches they would point to another employee instead of helping me at that moment . i waited way too long to be helped and could not believe the lack of customer service in that store . especially the day before christmas . i will never shop there ever again .	2815
0	i 'm visiting from san francisco and the chipotle quality here is extremely distasteful . the workers also look hella miserable to say the least . i will not be eating chipotle in vegas ever again . # yuck the cashier also had acrylic nails and one of the workers on the line had nail polish . they obviously do n't care about health code here either .	214
0	antoon 's pizza is okay , but it 's really nothing special . at pitt , there 's a rivalry going between antoon 's and sorrento 's -- you 're either on one team or the other , and it 's the subject of many a heated debate in the dorms . sorrento 's pizza is much more flavorful and less than a block away from antoon 's , but i would recommend checking out both and deciding for yourself lol	662
1	i ' v searched high and far for a hair dresser that is reasonably priced and actually good in the city . terry is funny and took good care of my hair . he took his time and was masterful . the prices are more than reasonable . $ 17 for a cut and wash. with tax and tip i walked out a happy customer for only $ 25 . this will be my new regular hair cut spot : )	1597
0	i 've been to many whole foods ( due to work travel ) and typically love their salad bar , prepared foods section , and fresh produce . this location in particular , was a huge disappointment . in my salad , there were 4 different things i had to pull out because they were sour , and from the produce section , my apples were not ripe , and once i peeled open my orange , i found it was rotten . considering the amount they charge for their groceries , i would minimally expect fresh food . the quality and taste of the items in the prepared section was quite subpar to other whole foods .	3874
1	four words . sin city and shit show . i guess that is really 5 .	315
1	a place to go and relax and leave stress at the door	3674
1	i do n't have a ton of experience with waxing ( i think i 've only been to 2 other people ) , but i definitely have an idea of what i like . she was quick , efficient , friendly , flexible , and very knowledgeable ! it 's never fun to go in for a wax , especially down there , but she made it as painless as possible and really got all the hair , which is something that other waxers can skimp on . she also gave me great ideas on how to keep skin supple and natural ways to exfoliate . 5 stars ! ! ! great experience .	1426
0	service is very slow and the food quality is average . they mixed up our order and gave us chicken instead of fish , white rice when we ordered brown . the prices are about 20 % to 30 % higher than the better competition . the decore is nice and the seating is semi comfortable . the music is classical and at a moderate tone so as not to impede conversation . bathrooms are relatively clean and well lit . tables were moderately clean .	408
0	great hotel , but do not eat their restaurant . my brother got sick right after he ate their burger , and was up the entire night , right before an interview the next day . totally ruined the experience .	1633
1	a wonderful place . pedicure and manicure and i feel pampered . i highly recommend . such a nice atmosphere and the customer service is exquisite	154
1	i 've been taking my son to little einstein preschool for several months now , and i can honestly say that i feel good about dropping him off , for one they have cámaras which is nice because we have access to seeing our son at any time on our phones so that 's been really nice , two the staff is just wonderful ! ! ! i was really impressed when we first took him there cause everyone seem to know my son who is 4 , and would greet him , teachers that were n't his knew him , and the director ms. kim and and ms. heather are wonderful , my son is really happy there he loves his teacher ms. maija	3582
1	this is a great beauty supply stores . there are three other locations who did not have what i need . i called the location and james gave his recommendations and helped me match the hair . his customer service is superb	2826
0	i would not recommend going here . my dad took me here and the first thing that was disturbing i saw here was the environment.it was dirty . the next thing that was gross here was the water . it was foggy and had a dead maggot in it . the worst thing was the roaches ! yes , about 5 roaches were in the same place . i think this was the worst restaurant i 've ever been to . if you think this sounds good you try . now my stomach hurts ! ! it 's most likely food poisoning	294
1	very nice casita with room for us and three friends . it was july 4th , so it was literally hot as hell outside and our unit had great a/c . yes , this is very important . pool area was awesome , as were all the employees we met . unit was clean and fully stocked with all the amenities we needed to settle in for a girl 's party weekend .	2883
0	slow , surly , shoddy & expensive . i can work around the first , sort of appreciate the second , and can even justify the fourth . but it 's shoddy that runs through . i just came back with five shirts . the press-job for the top half was great , but the bottoms all had some oblong shaped , like a giant tongue depressor , neatly stamped into the pressing . below that , the runner around the bottom of the shirt looked like a twisting dna strand . probably ok if these shirts were meant to be tucked in , but they are n't ! so i 'm done .	2374
0	this company tried to charge me 4000 bucks to do a very small move from pittsburgh to philadelphia . what a rip off ! got another company to do it for 1200 . weigh your options !	2603
0	this was my first time at this restaurant & i was definitely not impressed . everyone was nice but what should 've been a quick bite turned into us being there for almost 2 hours . the place was n't very big and it took forever for me to even get my drink . waited maybe 30 minutes for food & our server did n't even let us know what she was doing . she just kind of came and left a few times .	1127
0	found plastic in my food . staff offered to exchange my meal and the food came back with plastic in it as well . waiting staff were very rude and slow .	577
0	this review is based only on the incredibly rude receptionist . she was rude from the minute we walked in the door and had it not been for other employees would have lost our business instantly ! she was only concerned on closing the store within the minute of it 's reported closing time . she did n't even want to show us to a salesperson so that she could close exactly on time .	403
1	what else is there to say ? tim hortons is the dunkin ' donuts of the great white north . they have boston creme donuts , and boston creme donuts with maple glaze instead of chocolate . tim hortons is what it is- unpretentious , cheap and ubiquitous . you 're not going to have an amazing gustatory experience here , but it does the job after a late night slumming around rue sainte-catherine .	3422
1	came here for breakfast and had julie as our waitress , she did an excellent job ! food was great , service was great and the environment was great.. i had the egg a bagel and it was awesome ! !	325
0	i used to shop there frequently . i usually found what i needed . the prices were competitive and the employees were helpful . lately however ( probably 4 visits in the last year ) i have left annoyed by the service . the employees are rude and unfriendly . i will try again in another year or so and allow turnover to , hopefully , bring in some friendly and courteous employees .	836
0	yelp fail . we used yelp to decide between hibiscus and bonchon next door . i ca n't believe what a let down this was . the service was awkward and the food was n't good . we went for an early dinner and it was n't crowded . the fried dumplings were okay , but the thai and sushi just did n't taste fresh or have good flavor . will not go back .	973
1	i love dr.pervaiz because even for those of u who do n't have insurance visits are only 50 bucks ! i 'm always in and out and feel comfortable coming here with mild illnesses . the staff does seem over worked but still always willing to help	1466
0	there is a reason why this airlines get a low rating . i flew this airlines for the first time . flight out good , but over five hour delay coming back from idaho falls . they kept pushing back the arrival time of plane taking us back . airport is tiny , and facilities non-existent . no complimentary drinks or food on return flight . limited flights in and out . wo n't fly this airlines again .	3127
0	i dont understand what the attraction is . it 's definitely cute , but my cappuccino was cold and the cake was dense and not very good . my husband had chocolate cream pie that was literally pie crust with a very thin layer of chocolate . not good .	2410
1	we have been dealing with casablanca express for several years , over 10 years now , and for several years we have been taking for granted their good services . when we recently encountered a problem we had the pleasure dealing with julio , one of their reps , who was very helpful and proved that casablanca express cares about their customers . in fact we were surprised how quickly julio resolved what we perceived to be an issue . i wish that customer services of other companies ( including one i am working for ) were so caring about their customers .	1777
0	this place will not split your check because they 're so f*cking punk . it 's really inconvenient if you come with a larger group . go somewhere that acknowledges the fact that it 's 2015 .	279
1	# yyz for a long time i have been searching for good thai food delivery in the dixon area by the toronto airport . this is it . i have had fake thai with weird veggie combos and watered down sauces . i was so amazed by the delicious creamy green curry chicken and spicy basil beef . great quality , real thai spices and very satisfying . definitely recommend ! ! ordered online via justeat.ca . just give an hr for delivery . it took 48 mins . food was hot , fresh and delicious .	1501
0	nope not good atall was very disappointed . salsa was weird tasting , tacos were bland , and the rice tasted like ricearoni not sure where the authentic mexican food angle came from but it could n't be further from the truth . not never coming back . if you have trouble finding it take it as a sign to go somewhere else .	1317
1	i love coming in here to see all the puppies . they always have the cutest ones . i wish i can buy one but its too hard with two dogs since my dog is already spoiled lol i also come in here to buy new clothes for my dog . they do n't have much to chose from but they have cute ones . i love how the bird cages , hamster , rabbits & other animal are open for you to pet them : )	1894
0	fouty dollaz for a fade and it ai n't even five stars bye felicia . i walked in and it was looking rinky dink like a random barbershop in the desert not a friendly environment or costumer oriented , this place charging so much for so little work . the only shop i pay 40 $ a cut is oskars barber shop in la cause they deliver results every time . heyyy oskars shout out . lastly i walked out this dump and went down to great clips further down the stree .	2295
0	dawn does a horrible job of communicating . i called . i text . zero response . they may do great work and it may be very nice that they 're so busy that they ca n't return a call but their customer service seems to be less than stellar	2387
0	mediocre service , does n't keep up food allergies and the food quality and presentation is bad . would n't come back .	670
1	john bead has everything for a person who enjoys beading . you will find a good selection of beads from all different colors , shapes and sizes . beads made in china to beads made in japan or czechoslovakia .	2445
0	nope nope nope . potstickers were freezer burned and must have been warmed up in the microwave . the meat crumbled like powder . the chicken pad thai was floating in what tasted like duck sauce . really disappointed .	895
1	we came in here on a whim because we did n't want to wait 20 minutes for sushi at kaya next door . i got the miso ramen and my boyfriend had the shoyu . they were both very good , but we were a little disappointed that the egg is hard boiled . the service here is great , good ramen , liked the kimchi ... the only thing that would keep me from coming back is that the soft boiled egg is my favorite part of ramen !	930
1	great place to visit and have beer and pub food . they have big long tables , so you will be sharing the table with more people but that might be actually a good opportunity to make new friends . they have inside and outdoor seating , whatever you feel more comfortable with . there is a big beer variety , the server will be able to suggest something good for your taste . i also learned they have buck-a-shuck on tuesdays , so i 'll be going to check them out : )	630
0	eye exam completed and doc and staff were very nice . i placed an order for eyeglasses at the time of my exam . next , i received a bill for a specialized eye test that i never received and spoke with the billing manager to resolve . now , i call ( almost a month after ordering my eyeglasses ) to inquire about my eyeglass order and they refuse to return my calls . i want to like/recommend them , but the chaos is ridiculous .	663
1	this hotel is a bit off the beaten path for being in downtown toronto , and they do n't understand poutine , like , at all , but if you 're here for business or love a good indoor pool , you ca n't do much better . two towers include great gym facilities and nice , big rooms . if you 're staying downtown for business , the westin harbour castle is likely right up your alley .	1859
0	this is a convenient location , but at least between 4pm and 8pm , there are smoking , screaming , snuff-spitting , ranting customers sitting in the outside patio , and people spraying perfumes , dancing , singing , inside . the staff was shouting at each other , as well . it 's like the wild west of dunkins . i figured it was a blip the first time , but no -- the second time i tried to do some work , the same thing . so i 'll never be back here . it is a waste of time unless you 're in and out . that being said , the staff is totally friendly .	2902
0	very poor customer service . have a special listed saying 10 items for 39.95 but if you have 11 items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate . they also do n't count your items and list the number on your claim check so if something is lost your out of luck . there are too many options in uptown . i will not try them again .	3672
1	i love coming to pastel ! my favorite items are the black sesame crepe and the green tea crepe . their waffles are good too , but i personally like crepes more . the ice cream and whipped cream is not too sweet which i like . i recently tried their matcha batter crepe , it was n't bad , but i prefer sticking to plain crepes with green tea or black sesame ice cream . i think pastel is a great dessert spot after having dinner around the area . the outdoor seating also makes it a perfect date spot in the summer .	891
0	negative 5 stars ! i bought a warranty from homelife to cover major repairs . my pool pump had to be replaced every year for 4 years at $ 55 each because the rebuilt they replaced it with failed . then my a/c broke and they refused to cover it , thus costing me thousands out of pocket to replace it . i fired them the next day !	2369
1	the staff is very friendly and personable , and they make you feel like you are at an old family friends ' house . the pappardelle bolognase and the chicken saltimboca are my favorites . the caesar salad has cashews instead of croutons and is amazing . half price wine nights on wednesday and saturday also ! family owned . give it a try !	368
1	i 've been coming here every couple weeks for almost a year and i love what these ladies do ! very affordable pricing , so thoughtful and kind , they can always fit me in ! i 've never been disappointed !	3841
1	ramsey did a great job for me and my wife 's car . very happy with the results ... would definitely reccomend	2888
1	cdc did an amazing job resurfacing my pool 2 years ago . unfortunately though , the scupper , which was put on 20 years ago , fell off last week , and cdc came out and reattached it for free . thank you cdc for the amazing service , warranty , and my outdoor paradise ! ! ! love what you did for us ! ! !	659
1	this place seems to be busy all the time , and it was completely jam packed on a saturday night with a ufc fight . drinks are the cheapest i 've seen in montreal , but they are priced differently depending on event . i tried their nachos and poutine and both come in good portions .	574
1	the food and service was amazing ! michaela was extremely personable , knowledgable , and really added to our fantastic experience . our water was always full and the staff was attentive and courteous .	131
1	i was a lille leery about this practice after reading many of the yelp reviews . but this is the practice i was referred to . i had an 11am appointment and was in the examination room by 11 . the medical assistant was professional and made me feel very comfortable . the dr i saw was dr allen . he was great . cordial , professional , explained everything . i have a torn meniscus . he did n't suggest surgery or even physical therapy . time should heal this . all the staff was nice . nothing negative to say about this office .	2176
1	drew showed up on time , work hard and took my heater all part . he was able to fix my heater with the correct parts that he had on the truck which was very helpful . he was also able to save me some money by signing me up for a maintenance plan which gave me a discount on the parts and labor .	1718
0	came here today and there was one person in the restaurant other than us . greeted with a less then friendly reception . followed by an even longer wait for 3 food items . more than an hour for a chicken hoagie . i 'm not kidding . the warm young man behind the counter who was tipped 20+ percent by the way - made no sincere apology or explanation for the wait . the aggravation is not worth the gluten free options . there are plenty of other options in the gluten free area . do yourself a favor and go somewhere else .	608
1	everything about this place is 5 stars ! my whole family goes here now . you wo n't be sorry . state of the art !	663
1	such a great night out ! i had so much fun ! ! the guys were not only gorgeous but very personable and sweet . i am physically disabled but every one of them jumped off the stage and kissed me . made the whole trip worth while ! ! thank you for a beautiful night !	2149
0	this store has the laziest employees i 've ever worked with . they refused to help me install my headlight like most auto zones would and even refused to tell me how to do it or give me any tips . then refused to do a return on it because it was 8:45 and they were closing in 15 minutes and `` we 're doing other things right now getting ready to close . '' lazy lazy lazy ! ! castillo was the sales rep. wo n't be back here again . thanks castillo !	2850
1	sol'exotica is the best tanning experience in the market today . spray tan , collagen booth , tanning beds all are amazing and produce amazing results . check these guys out they always offer deals and the service and tanning experience is super relaxing . talk about getting refreshed try my triple dip . tan , collagen and spray . instant feel good visit in 30 mins or just tan . products are very current and always deals on minutes and lotion . owners are fair and great . staff are always friendly and knowledgeable . sweet place .	3329
0	by far one of the worst experiences i have ever had . if i could give a lower rank i would wings were terrible over cooked ruben was sooo greasy , never received my onion rings . the fries were over cooked . my son had hair in his salad and the could n't replace the salad because the ran out of `` salad stuff '' . absolutely the worst ! stay away ! finds somewhere else to eat .	788
0	the only reason i 'm a repeat customer is because the beer is ridiculously cheap . do not eat the food . i 've had a handful of friends fall ill after eating there and i 've personally witnessed kitchen staff use the bathroom and walk out without washing their hands . ( not to say they did n't wash them once they got back upstairs , just sayin ) go for the beer , stay for the patio .	2718
1	love this small hip vibe they carried over from the truck ! from the anime on tv..and the tacky karate tv..just oozes `` cool '' ... well . .the flavors..no need to go there . ..great as always !	964
0	was n't impressed with the hair cut . did n't ask for a wash , but got one because i thought it was part of the hair cut and got a bill for $ 25 . a wash is not typically included , and most guys do n't want it . the guy also does n't know how to do a proper fade/ blend .	1768
0	this place is extremely expensive . $ 28 for one ride . then they hound you for drifting or doing anything fun . i understand safety is important but this crew is too up tight . i did n't have fun and i could have spent the day at carowinds for the same as 2 rides at this place . i will say it is a clean and modern facility though .	1969
0	second visit to this vet . my dog had a stomach ache . doctor said it was a life threatening condition , suggested multiple unneeded test . doctor was not helpful , only interested in creating a large bill . i give them a 1 star , beware unhelpful and expensive .	1810
1	i love this store ! ! they have a good variety and deals ! way better than platos closet .	1446
0	we brought some of our mill avenue-based company to happy hour here ( 8 of us ) and will not be returning .	3336
0	i called and spoke with mindy and i felt that that my conversation was rushed . confused because their yelp rating was very good .	1593
1	food was good ; wait was not we had surprise meat and filet mignon and surprise seafood . surprise seafood was good . it 's okay but the dessert was okay we had the dark chocolate mousse and the fruit sorbet overall it tasted very good the atmosphere was very different and special it felt like it was an adventure and the problem though is that we had to wait too long for the food	449
1	love . love . love . absolutely love coming here . chisty always does a great job . always leaving satisfied .	2986
0	stopped here in a afternoon , was n't impress with the selections . the stuff they do have were looking that great either , got nothing and walk out the door ... ..smelled fishy just like the name .	3310
1	went of a friday night for the first time and had a very enjoyable experience . my husband and i arrived at 7pm and had about a twenty minute wait for a table . the prices are very reasonable , especially for the good quality ingredients . there was a special going on if you buy a kirin you get a 99 cent appetizer . the sashimi was great too . we also had a 'tootsie roll ' which was very good , and a 'boston roll ' which we probably would not get again . it was just a cali roll with tuna on top - meh . but overall it was a great night . we will be back for sure !	198
1	good car wash . it was quick and clean . the pre-sprayed the wheel wells and pressure washed some of the harder areas . the cost was reasonable . nothing broke on my car going through it , so it gets a a+	3061
1	**vegetarian friendly** at least half of the sandwiches on their menu are vegetarian ! i love that their menu indicates what is vegetarian or vegan . i tasted the capreezy sandwich from my friend , and that was just as delicious . you could taste the basil from the pesto . entree : hummazing vegan just as it 's called ... it was hummazzzingg . all the flavors complimented each other very well . i will be back for brunch ! unlimited french toast ... how can anyone say no ? !	277
0	i think this was an interesting place to go and see but the front fee of $ 22 to walk into a small walk in freezer was not really worth it . if you have never been in the ice or seen snow you might like it but do not buy the cocktails because average price of $ 12 for less than a shot of liquor . i also really disliked that i could n't bring in a phone or anything at all . i was not a fan of how strict they were being and it was not fun .	2245
0	we have n't had much luck with the ground beef in the meat department lately . the ground beef used to be good . now it is terrible . i 'm not sure if the meat is just a mixture of old and newer meat ground together . but the smell when you cook it is not the same . does anyone know if they are using fillers more than normal ? not happy with the quality . go back to your higher meat standards	3107
1	the pbee bowl is delicious ! ! fresh fruit and just the right amount of sweetness . will definitely come back when i 'm in the area !	2726
1	they seem to have way more patients then they can handle at times . so sometimes it takes a long time to be seen . but they are very good at what they do it 's well worth the wait . the staff is very professional .	1964
1	i love this place . the staff are always friendly and polite and the interior decor is very sleek . i love the coffee and the fresh pastries . my weekend mornings always start here . top grade .	1092
0	what a shit hole . ..ca n't believe this place is open.. the food is over priced..prices are set for a wine and dine not fast food atmosphere . .dishes are big . .but the taste was n't that great ... the floor was so slippery and wet i could n't get up to get napkins was just gross..never ever going back..	420
0	very cool atmosphere ... that 's where the compliments stop though . a group of us went here during a pub crawl and we literally saw the bar tender once in the hour we were there . it took us 35 minutes to get our first drink . it was so bad that a member of our group went across the street to circle k and bought a case of beer that the group drank on the bus while we were waiting to leave . will not go back here again .	3562
1	very helpful on providing information on a used vehicle i 'm purchasing . i highly recommend them to you to answer all your questions , and assisting you with all your mechanical needs .	1895
0	i had a app for my son a few months ago . we did n't have a terrible experience but it was n't a good one . i found the office dirty . it smelled . in any health facility it should be clean well kept . a assistant had sweat stains and a ripped t shirt on . i did n't feel the care could have been good based off the facility and the professional nature of the workers . we did n't get any procedures and are looking elsewhere .	2626
0	services was fine but i was pretty upset that after everything was said and done they would n't accept my living social voucher because i did not call first to schedule an appointment . not returning , i can take my business somewhere more accommodating and grateful for my business .	744
0	yuck . i am a huge fan of the montreal location and was looking forward to taking some friends to the toronto o.noir , that was a bad idea . unlike the montreal location , there are no lockers to keep your belongings , the bathroom is n't clean and the chairs and table were super uncomfortable . our food took forever and it was cold when it arrived and our waiter did n't tell us what we had after each dish , there was no explanation or anything . at the middle of the meal we started rationing our water , because we knew that it would take forever to get more . i would n't go back .	449
1	i actually love this place , very good food and excellent salsa . its a little seedy around the gills but has the biggest selection of tequila in the world . 99c margaritas are good but small , salsa 's are very tasty with the gratis chips . i 'm not a vegetarian by any means but do get the repollo and corn enchilada ... .its a fantastic mix of grilled cabbage and corn on a tasty tortilla . mmmm , fabulous !	1346
0	very disappointed in the service disorganized meat was dry i can make it better to stick at home however the bread was excellent	777
1	hands down , booker and his team at first class auto detail are the best there is . their attention to detail and passion for what they do truly shows in his work . they are mobile , friendly , on time , and thorough . i always look forward to working with these guys ,	2382
0	deserves 1 star ! came in with my 3 yr old . i 'm dieting so i didnt buy any but my daughter filled up her cup . when i was ready to check out they charged me regular price instead of happy hour half off bc i guess we only bought one cup ( i think she thought it was all for me ) the cashier kept arguing with me about the happy hour deal they have from 2-5 daily for kids 12 and under . she said something about the cup being to full ! ! ? ? sooo ? ? my daughter could be eating it all ! ! so rude ! ! ! never going back here again	1454
0	the location is beautiful ! ! my husband and i went to dinner last night and everything was going well . our server was super nice . however we noticed the blond bartender talking horrible about a group of people sitting at another table . we saw the whole thing go down and the bartender is in the wrong . she was mean ! my husband and i were shocked how horrible she was treating customers . it ruined our night and we will not be coming back here .	751
0	decided i 'd try this shop to get my nails done for prom . while the men were very nice , all the female workers had attitudes and were rude . did n't get the color i wanted or asked for and a few of my nails were put on crooked and i was told it was because my fingers 'grow like that ' not worth the 50 dollars i paid at all .	3274
0	i should have checked the box before i got home . i ordered for pickup . i understand this is a pizza place but i paid over $ 10 for 5 burnt chicken fingers and 10 burnt fries . i literally counted 10 fries . how was that acceptable to serve on a plate as a cook and then as a cashier how could you let someone walk out with that ? i was so hungry and too pissed to go back when i got home . extremely disappointed with the sky pointe location .	192
1	will was awesome , took time to explain any issues , and had genuine care for his product and the house we had inspected . also called with a courtesy call when stuck in traffic , which i supremely appreciate !	684
0	unfortunately i ca n't leave jae a good review ... .jae had another customer booked about 20min after me lol ... jae rushed my cut and was more focused on apologizing to his other customer ( several times ) ... . '' sorry for the inconvenience '' wow , and to think i actually booked this appointment in advance ... but worse ... .jae messed up my hair . ... warning to those needing expertise , seek another barber ! ! !	2295
1	hair is always great whenever i go to the salon to get it cut . it 's perfect for asian hairs because they know how to cut . got ta admit tho , i do n't trust everyone at the salon to do my hair , but i do trust hisato , akina , and jina to do the job . they 're my favorite and i 'd definitely recommend everyone there to get a cut !	2181
1	this place was awesome ! ! as soon as you walk in there is so much to look at and so many little gems . it 's really neat because there are different vendors so that makes for a wide variety . also the staff was very friendly and more than happy to help with any questions we had . i will definitely be back soon for some new finds .	1526
0	i was there opening day and there were only 4 flavors available . they had 4 displays out and only two had cupcakes on them . seemed like they fell short of their goal . i thought the icing was the best part of my cupcake . i was not overly impressed with the cupcake itself , i thought it was a bit dry and lacking flavor . service was fast and friendly , but in my humble opinion the cupcakes are overpriced for what you get . maybe they would do better in scottsdale where people can afford to spend outrageous amounts of money on tiny cakes .	1806
0	wish i could give no stars . fyi had the worse time with this business getting a refund due to them canceling on my daughters 21st birthday party . luckily i paid through paypal and they issued me my refund since this business no longer took my phone call . thank you paypal .	2122
1	dr weingarten is my twin daughters ent . he is very personable and great with kids . my girls love him . he is the only doctor they run up to and hug every time they see him . he put tubes in their ears about a year ago and we have been back several times for follow up appointments . his office gets busy and sometimes there is a bit of a wait . they have a cool table top video game that keeps the kids and some adults busy . i definitely recommend him if you are looking for an ent .	2573
0	i bought the groupon for 6 laser treatments but during my first visit i was told it really was only 3 visits with 2 passes of the laser each visit . this was not explained in the groupon . be prepared to be upsold all their product . and you 're told a tip is pretty much expected . lynette was nice but i saw absolutely no lasting results after using my groupon for `` 6 '' laser treatments . i was n't looking for anything unrealistc , just some minor improvement to fine lines . a total waste of money and very disappointing to say the least . just being honest .	2620
0	2:00pm on a weekday and it 's not busy - why would it take 50 minutes to get food ? go to drink , then shop for candy . the lousy service and way overpriced food is not worth your time .	2021
0	do not shop at this store ! i spoke with two separate employees over the phone and both were very rude , defensive and condescending . they can not locate a receipt for you , even by a credit card transaction , unless you are a `` member '' , where you have to pay them to join lol ! you can find much lower prices online and they do n't ask you to pay them to be a `` member '' , not to mention you wo n't have to deal with jerks ! i 've heard many other very negative stories from tennis buddies about this place , they just have n't bothered to take the time to post anything .	794
1	best place to go . go see nick c. great compassion for my serious car trouble making my car unsafe and not drivable when i took it to him . now safe and sound ! they are so busy because they are good and lots of people use their good business !	3594
0	i took my iphone here when i was visiting vegas to have a broken screen repaired . the glass was shattered . the price was $ 115 , which is much higher than the other iphone repair shop that i 've used locally in arizona , and the customer service was very poor . after just a couple of weeks i took my phone out of the case and saw that the screen was coming off of the phone , so now i 'll need to take it in again somewhere to have it properly fixed . i came here based on the yelp reviews , but i would n't recommend this place to anyone .	1104
1	it locate between t & t supermarket and zenq and offer taiwanese snacks , desserts and drinks . their popcorn chicken are delicious as well as most of their shaved ice desserts . it 's a must to try .	176
1	never once have i been to a casino where player card slots free play , is actually ( free play ) like it is at this casino . they have table games for everyone 's budget . $ 1 craps 25cent roulette $ 3 blackjack $ 2 3-card poker slot machines sports bets . hungry stop on by the food here is good for being a casino . the pit boss and staff are great remember to tip your waitress and bartenders they live off tips take care of them they 'll take care of you.. ps . you might just see me here so say hi , cheers and good luck gamble responsibly .	3580
0	love starbucks iced americano , this is one of the worst i 've had from any starbucks , even after a remake , extremely weak coffee . : ( unhappy	3154
1	i ordered the pork chop . was a little dry but the presentation was really good and overall flavor was very enjoyable . very nice atmosphere , had a very nice business lunch . it 's definitely a place i would come back to , i 'd probably just try something different .	632
1	the better of the local ts 's .	3225
1	i 've been buying my tires for all my vehicles from discount tire for years ... i 'm always pleased with the products , service , and customer support . anyone that is in need of tires i would n't go anywhere else .	806
0	terrible service so terrible that i thought i was on some kind of tv show where they secretly film you to capture the moment when you break and start complaining slow slow slow with at least 5 people working	3604
0	had issues w car i rented from other location . talked to garret there . in my view , customer experience was really bad .	269
1	dr j is an excellent physician , always makes sure all questions are answered , you get real appt . no bullshit . they are very efficient and accessible , prior to obama care . have not been in since that stupid law kicked in . really knows his stuff very easy to talk to and he communicates very well .	356
0	i went there one time . er wait time was 5 hours . then in room another 4 hours to see dr . went in puking and severe abdominal pains i 'm already prescribed meds n could n't hold down . dr was rude calling me a seeker when i was there cuz i was dehydrated n all . spent a total of 16 hours in er ... staff extremely rude	3214
0	the worst business practices and false advertising ! ! ! owned by disrespectful people and they do n't care about you or your opinion.. going to be suit for false advertising of his unlimited car wash and overcharging customers . check your statements guys	2044
1	dropped the car off after driving it back from nj saturday evening to fix the accelerator and get an inspection when the mechanic found a leaky valve . a part had to be ordered and the guys kept my baby parked inside until it was ready . quick and reasonably priced .	3197
0	even after you take into consideration that this restaurant/grocery/bakery/pastry shop started life as a convenience store , the decor still feels sad , drab and uncomfortable . my lunch , a slice of quiche loraine and the world 's most over dressed and vinegary side salad , was deeply ... ordinary . the macaron i had for dessert , however , was lovely . for the prince , i 'd rather eat at ihop where the food is better , the atmosphere is cheery , the seats are comfortable and i do n't have to stand in line to get my order taken .	1160
0	the viognier was great but my salad tasted like someone poured 10 lbs of salt on it ! go here if you like your food super salty .	967
0	went back lastnight for a birthday dinner . we decided on cibo for convenience since we were going across the street for another reservation . underwhelming is the only word that comes to mind . i ordered the rigatoni baked pasta with strip steak on top . it was flavorless , the sauce tasted like it came right out of a can , the steak was flavorless . we were confused by the amount of wine we were given for $ 14 a glass . the per glass price did n't make sense with the average price of the bottle on the drink menu we do n't bother ordering desert . i 'll never go back , even if i was paid too .	102
0	a simple meal ruined . i just ordered a bacon egg and cheese . i was n't given an option on to what bread is like . walked to the register and was told $ 8.64 ! ! a $ 9 bec ! ! ! now the kicker , inedible , the bacon was rubber they thought they were doing a favor by piling it on . at a normal place where the bacon is good , fine otherwise gross . waste of money .	447
1	staying at a fancy hotel in the area , there was no way we were paying thirty dollars a person for breakfast in their lobby serving some stale banquet food buffet . so we took a quick walk down saint catherine and visited mister steer . eggs , oatmeal , breakfast meats , montreal bagels , local tomatoes , crisp toast , fresh fruit and high octane coffee served quickly and cheaply with a smile in a no nonsense atmosphere with well-maintained 1950 's booths and tables . and do n't forget s side order of those suzie q potatoes . unforgettable .	1280
1	i am not a dyi person and i have found in the past my home depot experiences in other branches ( in the dc area ) to be frustrating and exhausting . this one has been great ! always have been able to find someone to help ( unlike in dc ) . they actually walk you to the item instead of saying , `` that 's in plumbing , not my department . '' ( unlike in dc ) . and they seem happy to be at work ( unlike in dc ) . i have done a lifetime of home depot trips in a week , but i would actually shop regularly at this one for cleaning supplies , etc .	124
1	i ordered custom-made cushions for my patio furniture . unfortunately the manufacturer made some mistakes on the final product . kim , the manager took the necessary steps to insure my complete satisfaction . i could n't be more pleased with the results .	3872
1	dropped in for lunch yesterday to order carry-out.. very warm and friendly greeting . offered water at the bar while i waited for preparation of my order . food was delicious and ample portion for the price . i will return .	50
0	this food truck used to come to our office park at ibm drive . the one time i ate fthere , i got an upset stomach immediatley . actually had to leave work early . same thing happened to a co-worker . was told they recently a health inspector came and shut the truck down right in the middle of lunch . security came and ushered truck out of office park and they have not been back since . i guess their food is not `` farm fresh '' after all ...	872
0	so besides the bad service waiting for 30 minutes for a big n toasted that they forgot to order . the manager bad mouthing an employee about not showing up and in her words she used to live at stapley and broadway and walk to work at 3 o'clock in the f -- -ing morning . this is only part of what was heard by me and others in the store . this is what it has all come to . we get to hear someone 's bad mouth early in the morning thanks dunkin donuts .	1131
0	shelled out $ 10 for the driest chicken caesar wrap i 've ever had . definitely would not return .	872
1	my old amd 1200 crashed so i came in for a new hard drive . i had difficulty formatting the new drive so i took it back and decided to purchase a new system . ended up with an intel p4 that cranks out at 3ghz and a 250 gig hd . i think the video board is 100 times better than my old pc because when i watch tv on win-tv it 's like watching high definition and i do n't even have hi def service from cox . got out the door for less than $ 300 and i 'm a happy camper . their prices and service are 100 times better than frey 's electronics .	2523
1	been here a couple of times but never reviewed on yelp . great theatre and since it 's so close to home ! ! used every viewing methods and i say the vip service is the best . it is a great location as markham is growing . food choices are great if you want to save the $ $ . as the recent movie prices do go up i guess it gets more expensive when you come with a family .	884
1	dr. philipp and staff are always professional & friendly..no matter the circumstance ! they always explain anything you ask & want you to ask questions ! give them a try the next time you need dentistry done ! thank you latasha for my clean white smile ! !	905
1	nice , comfortable place . go here with my wife about once a month and the women that work here are very friendly . free wifi also ! nothing but positive things to say about this place .	1720
0	i went here a while back . and thought i would write a review after seeing an offer on a local discount site . do n't go ! ! ! ! this place is more salon than spa . it 's not relaxing at all . and i got my brows done . and i was crying by the end ! i know brow work is not always pleasant . but it can be ! i 've found an aesthetician that actually makes me fall asleep while she 's waxing and tweezing . and she is not at carmel day spa . the place was cold and lacked a relaxing atmosphere .	3554
0	i really wanted to like this place . i bought 3 flavors as a gift and all were a huge disappointment . for the huge price they certainly do n't deliver in satisfaction . the `` cool ranch '' doritos style flavor was a miss on every level in the bland department . the chicago style which should be a mix of sweet and salt and spice is a cheap mock of mostycarmelcorn ( charged extra for a special flavor ) and the red velvet was just as forgettable.i felt ripped off and wo n't fall for it again . blah !	479
1	favorite breakfast place to go ! very friendly and polite . we have been here multiple times for breakfast , lunch , and dinner and keep coming back ! this review was for a saturday morning .	1029
0	do not stay here ! the price is nice but you get what you pay for . our room smelled of smoke and air deoderizer . the room is old and out dated . the floors were sticky . the ceiling and walls were painted over bubbled water damage . bugs kicking it on the curtains . screen torn apart in the bathroom window . our 2nd party entered their room and were met by 3 very rude men already occupying the room . we complained to the front desk about it and got a `` men can be rude , sorry about that '' and a smile .	1412
0	this place is tolerable but not preferable . the paint in bathroom is peeling off pretty bad probably because the exhaust fan does n't work . the exhaust fan may not work because of the layer of dust caked on there . the a/c wall unit cranked up so loud in the middle of the night , woke me up every time . after maid service came to `` clean '' , the bed had some dirt marks , looked like someone was walking on it with dirty shoes ! the bed and pillow otherwise were comfortable enough and we had plenty of room to spread out .	2866
1	i would recommend promise hospital for a skilled nursing facility . one thing though , you have to keep up on them every day . if you are not happy about things , let 's them know and they will fix it . all the nurses were very nice .	2413
0	customer service is rude and short on the phone . also they do not stay open past 10 on friday nights after pirates games , so clearly not run by very hard working or smart individuals . never had the pizza .	293
1	a little pricey , but i ca n't say i 've ever left hungry or unhappy . a simple , well-done spot that i could come to over and over .	780
1	this is a hidden gem in this garbage airport . i had the beef and prawn burrito-upgraded it to `` super '' ( includes sour cream , guac and cheese ) . it was bout $ 10 . open salsa bar and fast service is always nice . i expected little meat and small precooked shrimp . boy was i wrong . i had it on the plane after 2 hours and it was sooooo good . huge shrimps with lots of carne asada . it was fantastic . best airport food in vegas . definitely recommend this place .	623
0	as an unashamed woman , openly on birth control , i 've been coming here for 3 years . the staff is pretty friendly & helpful . although waiting times can get ridiculous . it varies because with or without appointments , sometimes i 've waited 5 mins . then theres times i 've waited an hour . it 's ridiculous how slow they seem to work ! i recommend looking at doctors who will accept your insurance , especially if you want to save money . planned parenthood provides many treatments & help , but it can be pricey because you 're paying with cash . take care of yourself either way ! it 's never too early to check for cancerous or infectious signs .	2334
0	they would not grant my free bagel coupon after i spend $ 32 because she had already ran my card . really ? what a joke never going back again .	477
0	pretty ordinary take out place . assumed they were related to the gladstone hotel across the street ( ? ) which is pretty good . staff somewhat indifferent . food takes a long time to come out and is just average .	1042
0	friendly staff . i only came to buy some macarons but it did not taste as good as i thought . the seasalt caramel was way too hard and it looked really different from all the other ones i 've tried . instead of a white shell with light brown filling , it was a bright yellow with tan coloured filling ... and when you bite down , its rock hard ... the blueberry lemon was the only decent one .	1217
1	i took my old briefcase here a few months back to give it its old shine ! they did a great job ! it did not take long at all . great service , great repair . why buy new when they can make it renew ! !	1948
0	okay . hostess had no idea what she was doing . food came out really late and undercooked too . the atmosphere was bleh . i would n't recommend this place to anybody . would n't come back even if i was starving to death .	817
1	cool nitrogen ice cream and flavors are all very rich . i liked the caramel salt flavor .	3900
1	came here after dinner date night to get dessert . it 's in a convenient location . staff was friendly and they were quick with our desserts . lots of options and lots of toppings . very pleased with our ice cream .	3537
1	come here all the time . the food quality is very good . panang curry is always very good .	895
0	rude and abrupt person on phone . misleading website . there is n't even the remotest chance i would ever use this company .	2537
1	i do n't know if it 's just luck but i always find good stuff when i go to this location . you have to dig and hunt but i usually walk out with something . it 's not very organized , always insanely busy , and a bit understaffed but if you have the time and the patience it 's worth it . every ross i 've ever been in is always unorganized ... it just makes me feel more accomplished when i do find some treasures . to me it 's a fair trade off for the great deals .	764
1	love these guys ! they fixed our 2001jeep ( no bumper jeep as they know it lol ! ) . she needed a new tranny ... they rebuilt it well they they fixed the transfer gear case & u joints ... very impressed by office with call back times and the knowledgeable skills of the mechanics ! well recommended place to fix our jeep !	1360
0	2 stars bc their fresh made parfaits are super good but the whole point is coffee and on that they suck ! it tastes burned like just over brewed or something it 's really nasty .	3238
1	checked in to cvs minute clinic online at 9:45am , saw doctor and had prescription in hand by 10:30am ! super fast and easy ! but check in online before you head there !	1555
1	phenomenal food ! ! had the beef ribs and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection ! ! ! really glad we found this place	673
1	pilar has been doing my cut and color for years - she is such a great stylist and always makes my hair look fabulous --	3448
1	the guys at artistic tattoo are awesome ! i have been tattooed by levi , weeze , brent , and their apprentice candice . all of them are very professional and are incredibly talented . weeze 's color and shading is well beyond satisfactory and levi 's art work is one of a kind ! everyone is friendly and there is a great atmosphere about the shop ! i highly recommend anyone to go there !	443
0	i didnt get to go into the salon . i called to make an appointment , and had one set ! when i mentioned the groupon i purchased all of a sudden my appointment was canceled ... im demanding a refund .	636
1	yay ! ! it 's back from the days of my unlv days ! the owner of our favorite ramen spot from the past is back ! yay ! for the beer ! and yay for the ramen ! whoot ! it got scored low for no more yagyu// but the owner had the right stuff in mind ! ! ! love it ! thank you ! new spot from sora and monta !	930
1	met a friend for drinks and sat up at the bar . sierra gold is large and open with enough tv 's to watch your favorite sports . the service was quick and the drinks reasonably priced . the menu looked good and the people next to us seemed to enjoy there food . good location right off the 215 .	1520
0	worst hotel ever . no ac , my kids are crying , it 's disgusting . stay anywhere but here .	2185
1	this is a fun speakeasy with great drinks . i loved the simple decor and elegant uniforms . there was a short line to get in but it was worth the wait .	1582
1	after a christmas party , i vomited all over my suede stuart weitzman boots to which it dried and stained . for $ 30 , kaner removed the dried stains , cleaned it and recolored the suede darker to original black ! it looked completely brand new . the setting and vibe of the place does seem questionable but on my way out , alot of regular customers with designer handbags and shoes that said hes only the best ( i asked to make sure ) .	631
1	one word : perfect ! their service is the absolute best i have experience at a foot spa . the massage it self was just what we need after a weekend long event and all that dancing . enjoyed every minute of it . weve been to tons of foot spa in california and other states and i must say that is place is the best so far . honestly this beats some of the high end experience 5 stars hotel massages i 've had . tip : check in on yelp and get a free sea salt foot scrub .	2399
0	terrible intrastate move . the load shifted during transport and resulted in a lot of damage . daniel 's settled but 90 days i still have not received a check .	2353
1	i dig this spot for lunch . it reminds me of being home in new york . sitting in the 7th street market and taking in the things around you while eating this nearly perfect pizza is heart warming . almost as good as standing in the streets of nyc with a slice the size of your head on wax paper . almost . good job pure pizza . good job !	809
0	yes he food is cheap and you get some good deals . the food is usually spoiled or molded . i always get the salmon sashimi , and it seems past its prime . i do n't know one time i asked them to load more salmon sashimi could because they ran out and the guy started cutting salmon from the regular salmon that was non sashimi grade and that really scared me away . maybe the guy was n't trained at the same time that 's a very scary thing to come across as a customer . now to their credit i never got sick from eating it but still unacceptable .	3269
0	we say for 10 mins while our server was flirting with other servers . never got to order food . they even just watched us walk out . no one even tried to stop us . wo n't be back	201
0	i moved here about two months a go in a more expensive 1 bedroom , because it has a pool view and a covered parking spot assigned . when i tried to look at other cheaper options , they said i would n't get a covered reserved parking spot . after moving in i was told that my parking spot cover is being built . why am i paying this much when i still have n't received my assigned spot ? i am paying this much to park my car in the street out the apartment complex . i am now considering moving out of the apartment as fast as i can .	2538
1	had a great family dinner at cantina laredo ! the margaritas were fantastic ... both the cabo flip and the perfect patron . very fresh and no juice mix . also , had the table side guacamole which was a nice touch . all the food was very fresh and delicious . it was a little pricey for mexican , but you get what you pay for . shout out to laura our server who was on her game !	398
1	my kind of bar . incognito , curious and fun . i always feel like i 've been pleasantly finger f****ed after i go to sidebar . the drinks are amazing the atmosphere is cosmic . a place good straight and gay friends can both feel at ease and enjoy the night . now the music is ultimately awesome . i think the bar tender selects the music . anywho , 5 stars and five dollars for sure .	3562
0	$ 10 whack ass burritos no thanks . they 're meat is dry old refried beans i 'll pass .	857
0	i 've had 2 visits in 2 weeks , judging from what i 've experienced my confidence with a particular dr is not that great . i 'd rather a dr say `` this is what you need , this is what you should do '' then i would decide . but instead i got `` if you want to try it , do you want to '' ? hell i do n't know what i should do , what do you recommend ? ? ? ? ? ?	2755
1	we searched all over for a good deal and came acoss here . great selection , prices and customer service . paula helped us pick out what we wanted and needed . manger and others helped with loading . not pushy at all like other places . our living room is now perfect . thank you !	1794
1	friendly staff and very clean restaurant . ordered the chicken shawarma and rice plate , chicken and beef samosas , and hummus and pita bread . the chicken and shawarma plate was large . you can share with this size portion . the beef and chicken samosas were flavorful and came with a spicy sauce . the pita bread was hot and fluffy . everything was delicious , flavorful and i was stuffed with only half the chicken sharwma plate and sharing the rest of the food with the rest of my party . next time we 're in toronto we 're definitely coming back .	808
1	sign up for birthday emails and you can get a free egg sandwich . the bagels and coffee are also very good . get there early for the cranberry bagels ! one thing i do n't particularly like is that they have a different register to order and to pay . i feel like they never have enough workers or orders to have someone queued up at the orders and pickups . just use one !	477
1	i had a great experience in the best buy in henderson . the sales associate gave me all of his time . i even came back to take his class on home automation ... ..love the workshops ... will join more of them .	494
1	i 'm updating my original review . after having a poor customer service experience , i must admit that this place knows what they are doing . they have gotten lipstick out of a white dress , horrible unknown stain out of my husbands dress shirt , and all of my clothes turn out perfect every time . in the future , my only hope would be that when a customer ( me ) expresses a concern , that the management take it seriously , reach out with a genuine response to fix the issue . that 's all .	232
0	i wanted to try this place , as i was coming to phoenix ... and i always make sure i scope out where i can get juice while away from home ... .sent a message to the business and never heard back ! made me sad as i really wanted to try them out ! and the star is n't for bad business it was just because i did n't have the opportunity , because no one ever got back to me .	1808
1	employer of choice ! ! ! usaa is consistently rated a top employer in phx , as well as the nation . fortune 20 company !	3429
0	awful customer service . greedy . wanted to charge $ 2 for a couple inches of scotch tape . go somewhere else .	2052
0	i used to frequent this place when their stuff was thrift store priced and the gals at the counter were nice . now the prices are ( often way over ) retail and there are a couple of loud mouthed old gals that make for a very uncomfortable shopping experience ( they just ca n't go on enough about themselves . ) one of them blathers on relentlessly about her days as a school teacher and how essential she was to the rotation of the planet ( and there for a minute i thought she was just another moderately compensated public servant who wears the same clothes every day . ) blah , blah , blahhhh ...	3276
1	love vic great service and his cooking is almost as amazing as mine love ya baby keep going big	459
1	i feel as though by 2017 , frozen yogurt shops are mostly all the same . i 'm giving this tcby four stars due to the fact that all their machines were working and that all the toppings were filled and fresh . other than that , it does n't blow me away enough to give it a 5/5 .	2046
1	very good food and great service . me loves the zalook appetizer , the lamb anything and the chicken tajine . the lentil soup is mighty tasty . my dh loves the hummus and the salmon and the souvlaki . we are regulars here , and have never had a bad meal .	109
1	stopped here for a late night crazing for ice cream . i went with the peanut butter chocolate milkshake . the kid was very helpful he even had me taste two different chocolate 's for my milkshake . it was very good not the best i 've ever had but far above average . prices were n't too bad but not cheap either .	3537
1	great food , very clean , however , the service is very rude and even a little racist . i 'd give 5 stars if it was n't for the service being rude and racist . also the bathroom was a little dirty . other than that the food was great	902
0	slow service . staff was pretty stuck up and yet did n't know what german reisling was when i tried to order it . small , small and smaller portions . on top of it not being very impressive quality . super expensive . and after 2 hours of being there i am broke and hungry again . no thank you . will not be returning here .	1534
0	experienced horrible customer service and horrible dessert . 1st off ordering my cookie sandwich they had no toppings menu so when i asked what toppings they had they told me to cut in line just to see what they had which was super annoying and stupid . when i went to pay 2 workers were messing around and were very unprofessional to myself and other customers who were also upset over there performance . after $ 16 some dollars later i took my 1st bite which was melted ice cream by then i managed to take 2 bites and threw it away in the trash . worst tasting dessert i 've had in a while will never recommend this place to anyone .	3722
0	came here on tuesday just to pop in for a quick drink . the bartender and waitress seemingly didnt get a long well and seemed very annoyed . i decided to get a spicy jalapeno margarita while my boyfriend just ordered a beer . i thought id get a nice refreshing margarita with some fresh muddled jalapenos . i watched the bartender make.. i was given tequila , triple sec , pickled jalapenos , the vinegar juice from pickled jalapenos , and pepper . needless to say i couldnt finish said drink .	882
1	wow i moved here from raleigh this is the first dive bar i 've been too since i moved out here . def a place to let loose and get wild . karaoke night was fun also great music selections will be going back again .	3320
1	great variety of breweries in a fabulous setting . i received great customer service , very friendly people . i really loved the food i indulged in including : pimento cheese burger with sweet potato chips , burger with friend pickles and lobster mac n cheese . my personal favorite was the pimento cheese burger from bang bang burgers which definitely got my best burger vote . my one thing i would mention for improvement is requesting of those not getting a beer to step out of the beer tent area . it was very hard to tell who was waiting in line because people were congregating around the lines . overall great experience and i look forward to visiting the festival in years to come !	3694
0	the complex may be nice buy the security leaves allot to be desired . there is one there in particular that every word that comes out of her mouth is a lie . if i were any of you i would stay as far away from this property as possible .	3718
0	do n't know how this place went up to a 5 star rating , unless owners are rating with fake accounts . all the reviews . including mine have been removed ... . if you care for your pups , do not take them here . owner always has sweet voice , `` oh your baby '' blah blah blah but both my dogs had severe damage done while there ... . look deeper for other reviews ! beware ! ! ! ! !	1847
0	the food and service were great . our waiter andre ' was a good waiter and the restaurant is a nice place , however ; what 's the deal with the owner ? ? this old and crusty owner was on the staff so bad my wife wanted to leave and not finish her `` spigola '' ( which was superb ) . he was really abusing his staff and we could see that one of the servers ( who we were told was new ) was visibly upset and we watched the owner chew him out behind the bar . not sure if we can recommend this place based on that type of behavior . too bad .	28
1	this place is exactly what we needed . it 's a get away from the hustle and bustle but still close enough to get to the las vegas strip . it 's a nice place surrounded by a lake and water activities . by boys went kayaking a few days and enjoyed . there is a village very close by with a pub and a few restaurants . my boys were in the pool everyday . it 's a great place because it 's not overcrowded and its low key . we 'll be back .	3916
0	i ca n't speak on their service , but i can speak on them not returning your calls twice or texts once . i waited 4hours for someone to respond so i could schedule an appt . for that day or another . but never received or heard back . she mentions texting and i did . i can understand she could have been busy ( it 's friday ) but i doubt she did n't have 1min to not respond to a text . anyways took my business to pop lash and nails and have no regrets ! ! ! highly disappointed in the lack of communication .	2742
1	went here for mother 's day and it was n't that busy surprisingly ! it was only a 30 minute wait which was great compared to the cheesecake factory next door which has a wait of 3 hours . our whole family was really satisfied with the food . the service is okay , it seemed they were really busy . it would take a while to get the attention of a waiter to help serve us .	534
0	family friendly , terrible food . it 's called a bakery but also has an entire section called the hot table where you can order lunch or dinner dishes ( such as pasta , lasagna , and various kinds of meat , etc ) . the lasagna was really watery . salad was also too drenched in dressing to enjoy it . they also did n't have penne pasta that day , so got the spaghetti . which was also drenched in tomato sauce . if i 'm ever back , i think i 'll stick to their bakery goods . despite the food , service was really good and the ladies are extremely friendly .	1629
0	i 'm sorry . never have i ever left a bad review . but , honestly . this is n't great clips ! suppose to be an upscale salon . horrible cut . did not listen to what i wanted . cut it way too short for the style i explained . now , once again . i have to grow it out and look for some place else . i 'm so angry . what a hot mess waste of money .	2577
1	had and amazing time last night ! my sister and i are from out of town and we went in not really knowing what to expect , we were blown away ! the food was great , our server dave was absolutely phenomenal and helped make the night so fun , and it was such a unique experience ! definitely recommending this place to all my friends ! the reviews that are saying negative things really should have gone in with the thought that this is more than dinner , it 's an experience , and a new perspective ! had so much fun ! !	449
0	i bought 40 boxes of pepero ( chocolet dipped cookie stick ) they are expired best by date by 9 months . i know it is not illegal to sell such food but at least they should let customers know why they are on sale .	715
0	probably my least favorite sephora to go to . horrible customer service and they do n't give you enough product for the samples you ask for . look at the pictures . i asked for more of the foundation because the amount they gave would literally cover only half my face and she refused to put more in because apparently that was 5 pumps already .	3153
0	great items . great prices . came in here to buy a few things . would n't accept a roll of $ 5 dimes . rolled or unrolled . they should accept all legal tender . wo n't come here again just because if this . shame , asian lady said she ca n't accept it and blamed it on the register being off at the end of the night . excuses .	2293
1	food is amazing & very delicious ! sunny , the owner came out & greeted us , such a nice guy and very friendly ! we had tandoori shrimp , they were amazing ! i would definitely come back , the setting outside is very romantic & vibrant , plus you are right next to the fountain ... definitely coming back !	1497
1	monica has been my counselor for 3 months and has really helped me . i feel more confident and at ease . she listens when she needs to and gives me feedback when it 's appropriate . i feel excited at the possibilities . all of those issues that have been weighing me down may finally be resolved and set free . if you 've ever wondered about talking to a therapist , you should go ... and speak to monica . : )	272
1	this place is great ! ! good food , neat atmosphere , and makes for a great country drive ! ! definitely recommend checking this place out ! !	353
1	i lived in shadyside at the essex house while i was in grad school at pitt . the building is in a really good location , and i enjoyed my time there . pros : big apartment , great balcony , good price . cons : they do n't do online payments for rent , which is kind of a pain and there is very limited guest parking . i got my full security deposit back when i moved out , so no complaints !	3852
1	went in for an upgrade and to make some changes to my plan . i got a really great deal on a new phone and accessories , and tammy was very helpful and patient , and went above and beyond to make sure i got the changes to my plan that best suited me . i 've been a happy verizon customer for about six years now and will continue to be for many more . they never let me down .	3037
0	nice hotel with crappy wireless . when traveling for work you need wifi and this place was bogged down every night to dial up speed , if you could even get onto the network .	952
1	japanese owned japanese restaurant . i had a chirashi couple of days ago , it was very good ! they have verity of japanese food not only teriyaki , sushi or rolls . 5 stars .	1
1	so close and so fast . my nephew was in and out in no time . hertz is my favorite car rental company and you can get delta miles for every rental . the have a fill up prior charge and its better than at the gas station . unheard of	2862
1	bill pretty much covered it on fitzgerald 's . i like this casino , it 's a fun place to hang out and gamble , it 's low key and full of interesting people . i never stayed in the hotel , but there 's always next time .	2500
1	i was selling some jewelry i called this place of business and the owner was extremely polite and very helpful and generous with his knowledge i then arrived ... he appraise my jewelry and gave me some tips as to how to sell it if i did n't want to sell it to him ... . this was a pleasant experience for someone in the vulnerable position of selling jewels.. i would definitely shop here again and refer any friends and family to this business ...	2032
0	the food was ok , 21 ingredient soba salad was nice and refreshing . main course of shrimp scallops and octopus was not good , seafood was way over cooked , rice with veg was bland . my companions dish of general tso chicken was much better . dessert trio was nice , although despite telling the server i was allergic to milk , was served a milk based panacotta . overall rating was ok , but deffinitley not overly impressed .	1441
1	this location basically looks over the lexxor and the strip , but i wonder if it is going to look at the new raiders stadium when that is finished . if it does , i bet game days will be booked solid and expensive . right now it is affordable , and looks at the strip . the rooms are fine . no frills , just a room , a bed , a shower , and a night 's sleep . no one is particularly friendly or mean . there is a security guard on duty . the light was on . no complaints .	3772
0	wow , have to `` go in '' before they will even tell you how much membership is . ghetto ! facility is old and kind of run-down . staff is what you would encounter at a typical fast food establishment . odd smell and in a sketchy part of town = no thanks !	2072
1	super cute macarons ! ! loved the black sesame flavour and milk tea flavoured one best . ca n't remember if it was the roasted one or the hk style one i liked . it 's because of its cuteness it got 4 stars ... there 's definitely the perfect crunch to chewy texture that i feel is missing here , but overall , ca n't resist the adorableness . a box of 9 makes for a wonderful gift for that special someone ... or for yourself ! ! !	2191
0	came into this facility and told long wait and did not offer an appointment or another time to come . this is not the kind of greeting a business should give . i 've been to salons where it 's worth a wait but when you can not smile or offer more information i find it 's a waste of my time money and tip to give . i 'm certain they will continue such services as the community is at their beckon call . i would n't give any stars . only 5 stars for ignorance and rudeness to prospective clients . after reading reviews when i returned home i see they 're ripping off the whole community of scw ! do not patronize !	3425
0	the girl who did my pedi ... was confused . did some kind of off things i 've never encounted in the many pedia i 've gotten in my day . gel mani was a slam dunk . i think this spot has a few good gals but at least an equal number of nail techs that are n't great .	1954
0	i called at 6pm , was told to expect a call between 7-8am the next morning . 8:45am , i call them . the person who answers , i repeat my need and that i had been waiting for a return call . she asked `` did you leave your information ? '' yes , yes i did . she put me on hold , came back on the line and advised me that they could have someone out the next day ! over 48 hours from when i called , no thanks .	2748
0	terrible job ! ! ! messed up my hair . i do n't know why the barber thought it was okay for me to leave the way i did . i specifically told him to trim the top , but instead he cut it down to a inch and i had a lot more hair than that when i came in . he cut at least 2 inches off and he did n't listen to anything i said when he asked me what i wanted to with my hair . i will never go there again .	2591
1	there is a good selection of garden supplies at reasonable prices . their plants and trees were in great shape . i ended up buying some herbs , plants , pots and containers . i have also bought landscaping materials in the past . the staff here is always willing to help and carry your items to your vehicle without asking . i am happy with this nursery .	2039
1	the new bbq is fantastic ! ! everything is fresh , and they know how to smoke and sauce good meat !	1295
1	i really loved this hotel the staff were friendly and the hotel was very clean . the food was very good this is my away from home place when i visit arizona again .	1335
1	very friendly , clean , and quick ! she is very meticulous about every detail to ensure you get the exact shape you are looking for . good prices as well ! been coming here for a year now .	3907
1	i rented a triumph tiger for 5 days from this dealership . the bike performed flawlessly for the entire trip . the bike was ready for me when i arrived early . everything was explained carefully and the guys at the dealership were very accommodating . dylllan in particular was very helpful . the whole rental experience was seamless and i would rent from them again in a heart beat . planning next years trip now , in fact .	94
1	i 've used michael 's services a few times over the years so it 's nice to see when a small business finally makes it onto yelp . he 's always managed to get my stove or dishwasher back up and running without the run around and at a fair price . this is a wonderful option if your appliances need repair and are past their warranties .	1573
1	the staff is super friendly and they are pretty quick . i would say the best thing about the place is the front desk staff . they actually are really nice . the doctors are not bad either . i will say though if you have an appointment and you come over , you should not have to wait an hour . with that being said i like the place and the workers	1677
1	great customer service and beautiful cake . will definitely be a regular for all cake and cookie orders !	868
1	i 've been to this labcorp twice now and both times it was a great experience . i was hesitant because of the bad reviews but i 've experienced nothing but good things . the staff was friendly and helpful . they were organized and professional . i had different phlebotomist each time and both were great . i 'm not the easiest stick so i was really impressed . i highly recommend this labcorp .	2587
1	i have n't been to village inn since high school , and i must say it was better then i remember . the staff was good the food was great and the inside was a dope modern diner feel . open 24 hours a day and definitely better then denny 's lol !	1029
0	where do i start ? ? first off they had a `` clearance sale '' that included items not actually a part of the sale , and when i brought that to the attention of the obnoxious cashier she would n't honor it , she then proceeded on giving me some of the worst customer service i 've received in some time . my suggestion to this place , clean house and get a staff that enjoys customer service ( or at least can fake it ) and actually knows what they 're doing . ridiculous	2275
0	do n't waste your time and money like i have - keep looking around for a lawn company that respects its customers and does n't lie and threaten them . if you need details , let me know . i will be more than happy to lay it out . update ( reply ) : looks like you do n't understand what it means to bear false witness against someone and then submit false documents on their behalf . you will be held accountable for that evil should you act on it ! careful .	2091
0	for $ 5 a pie , how bad can it be ? great for the price , although i think it 's not as good as domino 's or papa john 's . i used to order mass amounts from this place for student dorm council meetings at cmu .	662
0	warning ! do not book ! i called the hotel directly in january 2014 to book a room for march 2014 . they messed up my reservation and made it for january . i was charged a night stay ! when i called the manager magel to let them be aware of their error , he was unwilling to help ! he mentioned i would need to dispute my credit card bill ! to make things even better , on the reservation for march 2014 they had down the wrong nights ! i was charged again ! i will never book this hotel ! poor manager ! so you have been warned if you book this hotel , there is poor customer service !	2017
1	love coming here for myself & with my daughters . usually , we had sheldon , but he has graduated . today , i had kai & she 's fabulously meticulous with the cut & styling . great service .	354
0	grumpy barista . very curt and dismissive . did n't get a chance to order a pastry because she rang me up too fast . is the opposite of upsell downsell ? i was obviously looking for a treat . two bad visits in a row . too many other choices to come back . very different from my first experience . the owner lady , who is always pleasant , made me an iced americano i still think about . never been duplicated by her staff .	816
1	best smoke shop in town . awesome mlm selection and the best prices i 've seen in vegas	2310
0	had my makeup done at smashbox at nordstroms . what a terrible experience . my seven year old could 've done a better job . and she only took 20 minutes to do it .	1907
1	such nice surprise ! after going to recommended furniture decor warehouses that were disappointing with the quality available and customer service , i googled and found the best source for quality pre-owned furniture . will be shopping here a lot more !	2924
0	location is the old neos med spa . got ta say i prefer neos . bought a groupon for maintenance of a previously treated area . they no gel was used , which is fine , but they certainly were skimping on the coverage area of a large area compared to what neos would do . also , they went super light on the strength of the laser knowing that i previously had treatments and this was maintenance . hair did not fall out like in the past because the laser was not strong enough . it basically wasted my session .	366
1	had a problem with engine light , erratic tach and minor surging which was diagnosed and repaired in reasonable time and fair price . polite staff all around , nice waiting room and excellent facility . would be a 5 except that they are so busy that there is a long wait when getting work done . have also used them for parts and they are very efficient .	3914
1	been in twice . both times fine . helpful staff . had what i needed . on one visit there was a mixup at the register so a manager came over and handled it . he was friendly and apologized . no harm done . it 's a big box electronics place people . not sure what all the neg reviews are about .	494
1	beautiful setting on an island in the bow river . go early and walk around the island park . dinner was great . wife and i sat outside on the patio overlooking the bow river . good service and very good food . they try to use locally source food items whenever possible . also try their other restaurant , deane house .	437
0	myke the piercer is the coolest cat in that place otherwise everyone else is really into themselves and their work ... or actually not work but money bc work would entail caring about the client . jesse tattooed me twice , both small pieces , both really great prices but he was so rude and unpleasant i will never return or suggest anyone else go there even if it is one of the cleaner studios in madison . do n't go to downtown either they way over charge	2192
1	i grew up on middle eastern food and this place is exactly what i 've been eating at family functions since i started eating . nothing bad about the food here , it 's as authentic as can be . prices are a little expensive , but it is a nice , large and clean restaurant . i 'm looking forward to their evening entertainment one weekend .	1235
1	very friendly staff ! the woman helping us made sure she went through the menu with us as it was our first visit . the food was good . nice smoothies . i 'm not allergic but have gone no dairy so requested almond milk . i had a little doubt in my mind that they used the almond milk because i could taste the difference . but aside from that it was a nice meal .	580
1	nice store to shop at , workers are friendly and proactive with customers . i like coming here , great savings .	2398
1	good food . had the smoke trout , very delicious , sticky jelly and had maybe a couple rotten pieces of arugala but it 's alright . bit pricey but good food . fun staff and air conditioning .	995
1	loraine in the photo department was so patient with me . i wanted some booklets made of my late father and was emotional looking over the pictures with her . she was so nice and even fixed a couple pictures manually that cut off the top and let me choose the order and made sure every book was in the order i want . i would recommend anyone to come here to get pictures printed .	1207
1	i 'm an iguana mack 's kinda girl but we often go for `` one more next door '' or for food . dos is a fun bar . i think it 's even more fun on a night that 's kind of slow . bartenders are all fun and attentive which is really important to me . the stuff that 's painted on the walls is pretty funny , especially in the bathroom . great specials . i love that they have $ 1 shots when it rains !	704
1	absolutely great customer service ! remarkable management . today i stopped by just to check why i have oil leak on my car , and what they did , they fixed the problem without any charge . the problem happened 2 weeks ago when i did an oil change at a different jiffy lube location . this guys excepted to do reclamation what they did n't have to . it was n't their fault . thank you . vw cc .	2086
0	ordered online for quick meal and not the best food . fries were horrible . tasted old and reheated and wings were overcooked with very little sauce . not the best work by bdubs . disappointed .	383
0	horrible service ! we had to wait 1 hour and 30 min for food and they did n't get everyone 's meals even ! my aunt left because they never got her meal and they could barely refill our sodas .	1483
1	tried so many tea shop in china town and this one got ta to be the best one ! the bbt tastes so good , the original one is a must try !	3033
1	i was visiting family in las vegas and needed to get my nails done asap ! lol i looked on yelp and came across a couple of places , which i actually stopped at prior to calling here . the other places were unable to help me , so i headed over to diamond nails . i have to say i was not disappointed . the place is under new management , super clean and sanitary which for me as a must ! i have to say that although i do n't live in las vegas , i will definitely be coming back . i was really happy with the service , the cleanliness and overall my experience .	1033
1	first time here for studying . it 's a really cool place to hang out or just study . they have all kinds of kool seating and the decor is awesome ! a lot of old things to look at . they have coffee and tea and free wifi . i got the chocomint tea with a blueberry muffin ! they were yummy in my tummy ! i will def be comin back to study !	2219
0	went here to try and buy an iphone phone case . they had so many empty spots where the phone cases are supposed to go . i was so confused why there were basically no phone cases and asked a guy that worked there why they had no stock . he said to come back on saturday when they stock their latest shipment ... this is why retail is dying . went online and bought one off of amazon .	3192
0	this walgreens has yet to fill my prescription right the first time . i do n't know whether it is management at this particular location or walgreens in general . eighteen months of promising me they have fixed it this time . only as usual , they have not . time to find another pharmacy . patience has run out . too bad walgreens executive offices do n't give a damn .	3799
0	great service & nice place to hang out . unfortunately , this has to be the worse milk tea i 've ever had .	490
1	great deal ! this hotel has very comfortable mattresses and 4.99 breakfast specials . large , clean rooms and directly across from the 100 ft fountain . gary ( front desk ) was a great help and excells in customer service . will definitely stay here again .	2866
1	place and food was great . friendly service and clean . location looks out of place but do n't let that fool you .	131
1	love this place . the staff are friendly and the guy on the piano can pretty much play any song that you ask for . heck , he was even able to play songs from my home country in new zealand including our national anthem . make sure to give out tips to the pianist and the staff when they get up to sing . they are really good ! they put the wannabes to shame haha . lots of fun for a sing and a few drinks before heading out in vegas ! thanks do n't tell mama	3326
1	the silver nugget has been around for a long time i have seen a lot of changes as i been coming here and so far all for the good keep up the good work . the staff is very friendly i love the new changes to the restaurant and i 'm bringing my family back here	3378
1	i 've been coming here for a couple years now . never had any complaints before . love their gel nails and pedis- would n't recommend getting your eyebrows done here - made mine oh so thin ! manicures- yes . very reasonable prices .	822
1	we 've used daisy mtn for about a year now and are so happy with them . i called for an appointment for my dogs wellness exam and shots this week and they got me in that same afternoon . they were all super friendly and answered all my questions and i loved that they called the next day to see how my pup was doing . i 'd definitely recommend taking your pets here .	2545
0	went to look at a ring that was 1525 $ . i brought 1400 $ cash in my hand and asked for a deal . they looked at me like i was an alien as if bargaining is n't what pawn shops do . they were n't interested in working anything out expect no tax which is expected if i pay cash anyway . snobby unhelpful staff refused to work out anything . i am shocked at the greed and general disinterest they show their customers . i will definitely not be going back to this place ever .	143
0	if you need access to the wireless internet . dont stay here . speed is less than 1mpbs . that 's if you pay extra per night for high speed internet . lololololol . you can wait 35 seconds to pull up yahoo.com if it does n't time out . front desk says too many people are on it . duh . really . how about sizing it for max usage jackas -- -	1246
1	wetzel pretzels is a typical food court staple ( that or auntie anne 's ) . their pretzels are pretty good when fresh . the dough is really doughy and it 's amply salted ( unless you ask for no salt ) . i think it pairs really well with the sweet glaze dip but it costs you extra $ 1.19 for each dip . the food is kinda greasy but they do n't give you any napkins by default , and when i went the napkins were nowhere to be found ! credit card minimum $ 5	551
1	pour la pizza . je n'ai jamais osé commander autre chose puisque j'ai toujours été satisfait de la pizza ici . toujours la classique toute garnie . le service est rapide et amical . le soir à partir du mercredi c'est un endroit très occupé . après avoir manger , allez donc faire une petite marche en face sur le bord de l'eau . superbe vue à proximité .	411
0	i had the worst men 's manicure i 've ever had today . and it cost $ 19.45 plus tip . the young girl did a lousy job and basically dismissed me . my nails are uneven , my cuticles unfinished and the buffing subpar . no offer of clear coat . stay away ... .lousy and only in it for the money . no customer service at all ! i was amazed when she told me i was done . it was my first and last time . no wonder they are uncrowded . lousy place	2127
0	i have stayed here several times . the staff varies on friendliness and helpfulness - sometimes great , sometimes pretty bad . the breakfast is pretty good . the last time i stayed i was told i had a nonsmoking room . when i opened the door to my room i was hit with very powerful odors - a combination of heavy cigarette smoke and heavy perfume that was obviously meant to cover it up . it was disgusting and gave me a headache . the lady at the front desk just insisted that it was a nonsmoking room , did n't apologize and did n't offer to do anything to make it right . ugh .	1244
1	my *the* goto place if i am in that part of downtown . it 's a microbrewery , so of course the beer selection is good . food is decent as well as pub food goes . service is always good . only down side is that their washrooms are located at a weird level ( you have to climb up and then climb down a few flight of stairs ) ... .a bummer if you are drinking copious amounts of beer ! : ) . but that does n't keeps me from coming back ! cheers !	670
1	enjoyed an evening catching up with a friend . we sat at the bar . the bartender was attentive , but allowed us to sip and gab . noticed that most of the tables with food had the calamari . decided it was a good indication they would be good , and since our first visit i went for those . happy to say i was not disappointed . my friend wanted to get something a little healthier , and asked about salad selections . the bartender steered her towards the salmon salad . i am not a fan of salmon , but i can say she said it was delicious .	428
0	update ! ! if i could rate below zero , i would . this place officially gets -11 in my mind . the day after i got my pedicure , the bottom of my left foot got really itchy . it had progressively gotten worse and appears as though i caught something ( probably a fungus according to my doctor ) from the tools used at this salon . beware .	1222
0	the pictures looked great and promising so i tried out this place . was n't really good at all ... got the pomelo mango sago thing , can say that you could get this anywhere else and it 'd be better than this place . mango was sour , the sago was kinda hard , and it was kinda warm ... so yeah . verdict : can try this place if you do n't believe me but i think that any other dessert place will probably be better than here , plus it 's pretty expensive too . so , nah . that 's all .	1062
0	extremely unprofessional . i wo n't be coming back and most definitely will never recommend this place to anyone . i did n't even go in because i was so extremely disgusted by the way the girls at the front desk treated customers as they walked in .	354
1	i was visiting the champaign area with my family who just recently moved there . and they suggested that i try this buffet . when i got there was amazed how good their food is . it is far better than my regular buffet in lansing . if i ever return back to champaign i will be going back , even though it is a little pricy .	135
1	pat saved this company from losing my business . when they abruptly stopped accepting the prepaid coupons i had . pat on behalf of her manager juan took great care of me and honored the coupons . you might get mad at a company for their policies but the people they employ can make up for it !	988
1	big thanks to the staff , especially kate ! ! food and service was exceptional ! ! the steaks were cooked perfectly , our glasses were never empty . i will definitely return to this location .	560
0	update four months later . we thought to give it another try . rude employees . rude . super long line on a saturday morning . line out the door . one cashier working the register , when there 's like 20 little employees running around the back . the line was slow . they were not very courteous . they messed up our order . it took us probably 20 minutes to get our order . and when we inquired about it they looked at you like we were idiots asking where what it was . they were not very nice . wo n't be coming back to this location again .	1770
0	this place is very dark and uninviting . the employee stared at us the whole time so we just left . he made the experience very awkward and uncomfortable . i could n't even look at anything because it was so cringey .	2337
1	always have what we need - sales staff is the best ( knowledgeable and friendly ) and the geek squad not only knows technology , they also speak human	2477
1	my kids have been going to this school for years and it is excellent . the teachers really care about the kids and they seem to keep them ahead of the curve . great school .	3102
0	the most disgusting burlington i 've ever been in . the bathrooms are horrendous . poo in the toilets every time i 've been . blood on the floor . always out of soap . seriously gross	922
1	went in to pick our walmart.com order and a gentleman and i waited over 25 minutes . a young lady was leaving for a break and asked if we needed help and we said we did . she told us she would be right back and she came and helped us both to get our orders picked up . thank you very much diana . you were the only one going in and out those doors that asked if we needed help . talking with you we found out you were heading out to lunch and you still took the time to serve us . walmart , you need more employees like diana .	2443
0	my husband ordered a cake for my birthday . he asked for 3 specifics and sadly that did n't happen . white cake ... it was a yellow sponge type cake , no fondant ... it had a big slab of fondant on the top of the cake , and all buttercream frosting . well the buttercream is really good but i had to scrape off the fondant which left not much on top . it 's an 8 '' round cake that cost $ 70. ! i 'm really not sure why it was so expensive . it had a cute butterfly on top but it was n't a hard cake to make !	868
0	not big on writing reviews and use yelp all the time . this place was n't good . service was slow . food was really salty . two tables around us were extremely disappointed also . i came here because the reviews were strong but not this trip in wish them luck but i wo n't be back .	57
0	well the slot machine my mother was sitting in front of was broken and the bar was full but she wanted to play the machine and drink while playing but they charged her for the drink she bought because theeeeeeir slot machine was broken . by the way a baileys and coffee is 11.50 in case you were wondering . terrible country music covers . did not give me my .50 cents back out of 12 $ ugly ass old white dudes . never again will i go there . no wonder the monte carlo is 2.5 star rated .	2634
0	went in for lunch with my family as it was my brothers birthday , we had waited for about an hour for a waitress to take our drink and food orders ans when she did she seemed a little distant and inpatient . food was okay but definitely not worth the wait .	1579
0	fantastic massage and reset as usual , however , upon checkout i had the unfortunate check out with margie , who made sure i was aware she was the `` lead sales associate `` . she was extremely rude , unfriendly at best . i am so thankful that i have never had to deal with her before and will make sure to never again . i went from feeling amazing after leaving anthony , to feeling belittled and somewhat accosted . stress level in turn went right back to what it was when i got there . thanks marg ! ! !	2120
0	we have been using tidy for a few months , hoping it would get better , but after today 's service it 's time to call it quits . did n't clean any toilets in the house . did not sweep , or mop . did n't clean the counters very well at all . left dirty dishes . completely unsatisfied customer .	2623
1	love this place ! so much fun ! i would say come before noon for the best prices ! lots of different games you can play that are fun . the food is delicious and the drinks are awesome ! i would recommend this to anyone who has n't gone here . so much fun !	1483
0	the service here is extremely lacking . i should have known it was horrible based on the lack of customers when all of the neighboring businesses were packed . tea and good were horrible . pass on this business	215
1	the imperial pub has been around forever . one reason i know this to be true is because the only pub that every ryerson professor seems to know is the imperial . there 's a very authentic pubby feel in here , what with its wooden everything and a staff that knows their bar and their menu like they know the back of their hand . the place certainly feels aged , and that age comes off as a charm . generally , i 've found the imperial to be a good place to go for a quiet drink with some friends . it 's not really where i imagine a wild night , but rather a relaxed evening over a pint or two .	1091
0	i called to make an appointment for my husband and the individual who answered the phone was not very friendly . they did n't use a great tone wich made me feel like they really did n't want to help me . i ended up not making an appointment with them due to this encounter . it is sad because they might have great doctors , but with my initial interaction it has made me not want to go there for services .	3566
1	i have been into this location several times and have never had a bad visit . this morning i was thrilled to see the addition of macchiatos on the menu . mine was perfectly made , and my kiddo enjoyed his donut . also , the interior of the store is still absolutely spotless . i know it 's a newer store , but they seem to take good care of it .	1532
0	great sandwiches and bagels ! authentic new york deli , even down to the lack luster , crap attitude of the staff that waited on me . which is why you get 2 stars . i suggest the pastrami . ... with a side of grumpy !	960
0	omg where do i start . i came here a few years ago to get a contact exam just to have them order me or give the the wrong prescription , which ever excuse they had it was messed up either way you look at it . the customer service is awful . they talk to you like you work there and should know what to expect and how insurance works . what a bunch of wild animals that work there . they should be caged up and put in the zoo .	1345
1	wasnt bad . fit the bill for killing time . divey . cheap food , $ 5.00 pitchers of pabst . $ 5.00 for a bucket of five coronas . $ 2.00 a game . t-pain on the loudspeakers . whats not to like ? $ 12 for two people , including shoes & two games each ! dont go expecting lucky strike . after we went to the cheap restaurant for some $ 5.99 prime rib , medium rare . i was too pissed to drive , so we ate there . pleasantly surprised . service was nothing special , not great but not bad . came out to under $ 10.00 ! this place is totally out of the way , but worth it .	451
1	clean rooms with coffee pot and empty mini fridge ... ( i liked that . we added our own water bottles and sodas instead of using a fully stocked expensive mini fridge ) , super nice friendly staff , tasty restraunt , comfortable sitting areas in lobby and coffee , tea , cold water and snack table was a nice touch..will definitely stay there again ! small pool but was n't planning on using it .	1633
1	after making a huge mistake and trying out a local beauty school , i asked around for a reputable hairdresser that could help fix it . holly came highly recommended by numerous people . so i gave her a try . she was terrific . i was a little worried , but she was patient and made me feel she had everything under control . and she did . not only did she fix my hair color , she also gave me complete new `` do '' . i love it . i 've been going to her ever since . she 's great ! ! ! !	2693
1	delicious noodle dishes and asian food prepared fresh to order . since discovering this jewel , i 've had lunch there every week . i have enjoyed the singapore curry noodle dish which is served with both chicken and shrimp with a kick ! it 's delicious . the pad thai is very good as well . there is a daily special where you pick your protein and chose your style such as : sa cha , mongolian , mixed vegetables etc . served over steamed rice in a large bowl for only $ 6.95 ... i had the sa cha chicken and it was loaded with fresh veggies and it was amazing . check this special place out ! ! !	1026
1	like most asian markets , they have some overpriced items but they also have some really good deals . considering this is a small market , they have a good selection of filipino products , which is what i mainly shop for . the first few times i shopped here i felt the customer service was a little cold , but now that i 've been shopping here for a while now , they 're a lot more friendly . i really love that they are open late and there 's always parking available .	2965
0	i 've really want this place to succeed as its in the neighborhood . however the inconsistency with meats , usually towards the rancid end , is increasingly frustrating . most recently , the kelbeisa that i purchased , which they have a pretty good reputation for , was of a weird crumbly pseudo-sausage consistency and full of sodium . once in a while , if your timing is right , you can get some good quality high-end meats . however , typically selection is very slim with questionable freshness and cleanliness .	2794
1	my go to nail salon . i get bio-gels and always go to tom ( he is the best ! ) the service is quick and good value , i tend to get 3 weeks out of my nails which is great considering every other nail salon i get maximum 2 weeks ! they offer you tea or water on arrival which is nice .	3247
1	i have been using their corporate parking / monthly pass program for over a year . i 've never had an issue . they are timely , efficient and courteous . david is on of my favorite drivers . always professional , polite and gracious . sometimes i wish that they would pick up at terminals on arrival a little quicker but the wait is usually no more than 10 minutes which is understandable given the distance between the terminal and the lot . would define recommend .	2531
1	my family has bought 3 dogs from this location over the last 19 years . all american eskimos . none sick . no issues . pricey though . one we had for 15 years . one for 14 . and one we still have .	1894
1	the only reason i did n't put 5 stars is because of the price ... other places are a few bucks cheaper but this place was close to my house . it took them about 30 minutes for the techs to repair my iphone 5s cracked screen . i went shopping at the next door whole foods while i waited . they were kind and professional . i will recommend wireless md to my friends .	3838
0	drinks way over priced ! bww and hooters captains are 3 dollars right now during the games , this place is $ 5.99 . no wonder there is nobody here watching the games and the other places are full . i know times are tough , but good god . do some market research and at least make an effort to compete .	1187
0	their quote was $ 269 to send my car there i found other shops between $ 130 and 180 in 5 other places	1052
0	if i could rate below one star , i would . i used freedom auto glass in march for the replacement of my windshield . less than three months later , the windshield had large crack in it starting at the point where the rearview mirror was attached . upon calling the company to explain the situation ( stated not the paperwork was a guarantee of work ) , i received not only a negative response , but was also treated unprofessionally and dismissively . i now have to put in a second auto claim into my insurance when it has only been three months . consumer beware ! ! !	3933
0	after booking several spa experiences for my friend 's birthday the person on the call said , oh make sure you buy a groupon , it will save you so much money on these services ! so i did . when it came time to pay they would not accept it , even though i bought the groupon she told me to buy , they said they would n't honor it . our spa day ended up costing 5 times what we had planned in paying we also waited over 40 minutes to get our drinks and food . there were only 6-8 other people at the pool . terrible customer service and huge disappointment for what was supposed to be such a special day .	2305
0	pretty bad experience . ordered a basic item and was promised completion in 3 business days . 5 days later it was complete ( no biggie , stuff happens ) . except for the fact when it was finally finished , it was done wrong . tina said `` no problem , we will make a new one '' . well now 16 business days after my original order , the replacement sign still is n't ready . tina does n't respond to emails unless it 's for an order . she clearly does n't have a desire for happy customers and does n't love her job . will never use again .	2656
1	tonight 's dinner was very good . i had the 8oz filet it was cooked great and tasted very good .	560
0	whenever you tell them you want your nails like this and like that they get mad then look at each other and talk shit about you and make faces with each other . why ca n't they talk crap in english so we can understand them .	1834
0	i took an ipad 3 to them so they can replace the screen . worst job ever ! ! after a week of them replacing it the screen was coming off . i took it back to them and wanted $ 50.00 to fix it . i then took it to another location , where they fixed it for $ 10.00 needless , to say i '' ll never go back there again !	1104
1	awesome first visit ! staff and dr. tran were very friendly . went in for my issues with acne , dr. tran was very understanding and explained my tx plan moving forward , walked out excited and confident to clearer skin .	3598
0	as a chinese , all i can say is : gross！ their food are over priced and does n't taste at all ! totally gross ! dirty , not many choices , taste like shit ! i wonder where are the good reviews from	1103
0	had this lady named tesa . cut my hair in under ten minutes flat while pretended to be interested in my life . terrible hair cut . had to recut mine somewhere else . never going there again ...	1030
1	the cold stone in squirrel hill is in a fantastic location at the corner of forbes and murray , making it within easy walking distance after a movie at the manor or dinner at any of the plethora of restaurants and bars in the area . the store is well kept-up and the service has always been friendly . my sole complaint would be that for the premium prices they charge it would be nice to get premium peanut butter as a mix-in instead of mediocre generic store-brand stuff . choosy bachelors choose jif !	3646
1	definitely the best hotel in messa vintage nice quiet clean rooms brings back memories 15 years ago when i was in mexico in a hotel	1888
0	terrible service it 's like your bothering them when you ask a question it like one lady at counter did , ignore you and act as if they did n't hear you just terrible feeling screw you crew	1937
0	terrible . they advertise clear any drain $ 64 . then they say it is too long a run for their 100 foot snake so it is $ 219 for another 100 feet which includes a camera . then they say they ca n't clear the blockage and need to install a closer clean out for $ 6639 . the total run is not 200 feet and there are already 3 clean outs along the way . they say theirs is a directional clean out . installing the entire line originally cost less than $ 6639 . they tried to hard sell me . i paid the $ 219 and go someone else to clear the blockage .	2203
0	terrible customer service . they should treat the last customer like the first and they do n't . pathetic	1342
1	these guys are doin a great job down here ! fixed my internet problem i was having . simply by upping the internet speed for 5 bucks a month xtra ! since upping internet speed have n't had a problem since . our 2 options here in vegas are century link and cox . cox is defineately the winner in my book . they say a price and stick to it for the whole time i 've been with them unlike century link .	664
1	so funny , and great tricks . we had a group that ranged from 14 to 70 years of age and everyone was completely entertained .	2489
1	i had a great experience purchasing my car from camelback lincoln . rudi was very professional , considerate , and helpful throughout the entire process . he follows through and is very honest . my car is very nice and everything went better than planned . i really have changed my mind about the car-buying experience because of the service , professionalism , kindness and support i received ...	2754
0	any time i have to walk around and find my own utensils , 5min after the food is served , there is a problem . and i was n't the only one .	1310
1	staff were helpful and very friendly . prices are a little high , but you can choose many options to choose from .	3219
0	went here the other night with a few friends , it was rather busy so we gave them some time , but after 20 minutes of waiting we asked aboit our hookah only to find it was given away , so after shooting pool for 30 minutes we left , they actually had the audacity to charge us for that evem after their shitty service	3634
0	this food is not meant for human consumption . coworkers wanted to go and i tagged along . there was actually a `` sushi '' roll with tuna salad in it . it 's like an asian pb & j ?	1302
0	i 've been with this doctor for the last 5 years . i do n't know what happened but i can not book an appointment anymore . i 've tried on many different occasions but it seems as if they are always in break and/or get put on an extended hold . i 'm definitely looking elsewhere for my medical needs since they do n't seem to care or see me anymore .	2631
0	been here three or four times and doubt i 'll go back . the restaurant itself is nice , more upscale than your regular pho joint . service was better too , but oh the pho ... it lets me down every time . there seems to be something added to the broth itself that tastes different , but good . but the meat and noodles just are n't right . egg rolls and spring rolls are n't worth getting in my opinion , really some of the worst i 've had . like others have said the crème brulee is good tho	205
0	after being charged $ 60 for my $ 15 co payment i thought it was okay at first they could n't do a refund so i would just use it up anyways with future appointments i had to get blood work done , come to find out the dr . i had quit so they had no record of me needing blood work so i would have to make another appointment ... i just called to make another appointment and they did n't call me back in 3 hours and did n't answer the phone.. i would totally recommend finding another doctor wait time is terrible and staff turnaround seems to be high.. now i am sick having to find another doctor.. terrible	1562
0	after 3 emails and 1 phone call -- -- -still unable to setup a appointment for a free estimate . amy is not good for your business .	2916
1	what a great find . the food is first rate and plentiful . we tried green curry and bourbon chicken . both were fresh tasty and colorful . the staff is helpful and polite .	474
0	clean , new and nice friendly staff . i wish we could give them more stars unfortunately they were so short staffed , a few rides and games did n't work . so we had to kept asking front to use the staff card to use some machines . food came not at once so kids were hungry and left . than the rest of food came . we asked what happened . she said only one cook working ... she was nice too but still if we pay more than $ 1250 . wish that they all knew what they r doing ... ... .	1958
1	sharyn was incredibly helpful tonight when i came in unhappy with a different location when trying to find a specific fabric for my aisle runner for my wedding . she helped me search the aisles as well as looked at other stores .	3876
1	been coming here long before the scenesters and hipsters . 1990 when it was just an old man neighborhood bar . still like to stop in for a beer . super cheap with a kick ass staff including my amazing friend michelle . she 's one of the best bartenders in the city . great shot and beer bar .	3840

1	i went to the maya hair salon based on the reviews here and i can honestly say that i was very impressed with the cut . sam was the stylist who cut my hair and she executed the cut based on the picture that i brought with me to perfection . will i return to the salon ? absolutely ! ! !	2181
1	any kind of hot dog you 'd like with a side of tots , ca n't go wrong with that ? my only disappointment in this place is that it 's a little overwhelming . i would have enjoyed having some suggested dog combination or a waitress that would help out in that area . if they were a little more accommodating to first timers , i 'd give them a five .	1407
0	decent place for apps and standard american bar fare . not a huge fan of this type of food , but if that 's what you like , they do a good job . chicken fingers , fries and dipping sauces . tasty , but not great for cholesterol levels . mid-to-lower-mid price hangout joint / bar area . staff has always been friendly . do n't see a lot of managers ; but , that does n't seem to have made a difference in a negative way . wait personnel , greeters , etc. , all young . . .but nice .	201
1	great ballpark and good game but too bad they lost today .	2005
1	best chinese in phoenix for real . you must try the egg foo young . it is amazing ! if you 're vegetarian the family bean curd is also delish . the owners are awesome and we always enjoy our visit ! ! ! !	1264
0	very dirty facilities , rude staff , horrible management. ! there 's even mold in the patient rooms.. ! please dont go here , dont send anyone you care about to this hell hole..	2068
0	room not as described . the suites are not suites ; they are a room with a kitchenette . had to upgrade to a bedroom suite to get room with sofa bed . this used to a candle wood and converted . front desk clerk scott did his best to satisfy us but we were not happy with the way it went . hotel seems clean but there is an odd smell in the hallway . parking lot pretty limited too . will skip this one next time . oh and they do n't know what handicapped access room means .	3308
1	we have searched all over for a decent pediatrician and after many years we found foothills pediatrics now called bright future pediatric . the first time we came we met with dr. mendoza who is very friendly , funny , and made my daughter feel comfortable , which she was frighten in the past with other doctors . now that we are over that fear we have been seeing dr. mendoza for our yearly checkups . i am happy we found a good doctor near home .	2223
1	great experience ! very friendly , although had to wait quite awhile on a saturday ( no surprise ) - will likely make an appointment next time . jasmine did my gel manicure- one of the best i 've gotten in a log time , as it lasted a full two weeks .	43
0	i 've been to a lot of hookah bars , and this one was quite easily the worst . the service was ridiculously slow , and the hookah tasted kinda funky . i ordered some moroccan mint iced tea that was strange tasting as well . luckily , the diet coke i ordered to replace the mint iced tea was normal . though i 'm not sure what other options there are for hookah in vegas , i would recommend avoiding this place .	1229
1	casual atmosphere and friendly bartenders . we like the new menu that is more mediterranean .	1295
1	just attended a wedding here of 50 plus people from all parts of nyc and wahsington . the restaurant and design are very unique ! amazing out door terrace for everyone to flow out to . the food and service were second to none . the staff super friendly . we would defiantly return !	149
0	i 've never given a review based on service before ... but after being yelled at by the staff here on multiple occasions , i need to voice out . i usually come here with friends because of the favourable location , but we 've been ... -chased after to tip more -told to be quiet rudely by the owner -yelled at to order faster -been pushed aside while we were lining up while i do n't expect 5 star service , i think it 's common courtesy to use an indoor voice when speaking to customers and exercise basic manners .	1290
0	the saddest little menu i 've ever seen.the guy behind the counter was not friendly.the food was tasteless and cold .	1186
1	outstanding service and selection of eye glasses . i 've sent friends and coworkers here and they have all be satisfied with the service .	2126
0	everyone told me , `` go to cheskie for the mini croissants ! '' and so i went . perhaps there are other things on the menu better than the mini-croissants , but if you are going there just for mini-croissants , i think you might be disappointed . i was . the place smells divine , but the croissants do not taste fresh . and there is coating on them that sticks to your mouth . they are sweet , and the fillings redeem the flavor of the dough , but still -- it is not the ideal croissant experience .	3118
0	terrible terrible service . we were there for dinner . food was good when it came but anticipate waiting for a long time . we were there during chinese new year 's celebrations and they should 've anticipated that it would be busy . it was disorganized and chaos with servers and kitchen staff . all the patrons seemed annoyed with the service .	0
0	shittiest club ever f*** the rest of the reviews this place is garbage no people music keeps on turning off fuck this place never coming back	849
1	this place is amazing ! ! ! adopted many animals over the years from this place . they have great customer service and they take excellent care of the animals . excellent facilities . very knowledgeable staff .	1980
0	such a wonderful property , but it 's a shame what incompetent management can do . avoid at all costs ! ! ! tenant requests are met with complete and utter disrespect . the putrid smell by the elevators had me so disgusted that i packed up and left after 2 weeks ... .in case you missed it earlier ... .avoid at all costs !	3354
0	in the front of many petsmart stores they sell betta fish ! ! ! ! ! these poor fish are in small clear plastic cups the day i first walked by and really looked at them , there were about 1/4 of them dead just floating in the cup this is a horrible way to treat fish i did call petsmart and made a formal complaint but have not heard back from them if petsmart is going to treat fish like this , what else is going on there ? ? ? ? ? ? will update when i hear back about my formal complaint ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	2108
1	dr. wellish was recommended by my regular eye doctor and after much research , he was the best candidate . not only does he use the latest technology , his staff is very friendly . i was a bit nervous right before the surgery but speaking to dr. wellish calmed my nerves . he was friendly , very down to earth , and accommodating to any needs i had . this is the 1st day after surgery and i 'm already seeing 20/20 . if i can give the doctor and his office 7 stars , i would .	2312
0	i recommend avoiding this place at all costs . i ended up with fungus infested nails after one trip to this salon . in over twenty years of nail services , i have maintained impeccably healthy nails until visiting this place . i had high hopes , but ended up extremely disappointed . not only did they give me the fungus , they tried to charge me $ 15 to take off the acrylics which the fungus was under . they could have at least saved themselves some respect by doing that for free . i 'll never return . so sad .	2434
1	i stopped by for some non-plastic wear ( cups and bowls ) and was delighted to see their fun juice/coffee bar . they have a nice selection of different fresh juices , coffees and they even have kombucha on tap ! i do n't remember the name of the juice i got , but it had kale , parsley , celery , cucumber , apple and spinach and was soooo good ! overall , i really appreciate the fact that they support local business and stock their shelves with products that have some freaking integrity . if it were n't so far from where i lived , i 'd probably shop here more often . keep it real , guys : )	3874
1	this place was amazing . never got any kind of piercing or anything and they just made my experience a lot less nerve wrecking . both the ladies there know what they are doing . the lady there was really funny and made me feel comfortable . would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get a piercing . thanks !	2895
1	me and my son came here today to watch it ... the wait time was nothing ( going on a monday ) and the recliners were very comfortable and we love the fact that you can reserve your seats for the movie you want to see & the most wonderful part ? for the month of september it 's only $ 5 per person ! ! what a deal ! !	491
0	these guys should become a marketing & sales company since that 's all they do well . terrible screen printing . and they did n't own up to their mistake and stuck me with it .	2363
0	lang van was disappointing . was on vacation with my parents , and wanted a really good pho to eat . so , took to yelp to see what restaurants had great reviews . parking lot small and limited . interior was ok , atmosphere was nice and casual . services was good and attentive . i ordered the beef pho . the waiter brought out this huge bowl filled with beef broth . however , much to my surprises there was very little noodle or meat . the noodles were kid 's portion . come on now , whats a pho without noodles . not really a pho in my opinion . save your money and go somewhere else .	947
0	very unreliable . their eta is no where close to when they actually arrive .	2010
1	row after row from floor to ceiling of anything your heart could desire in regards to hardware . the store was near and organized . i did notice that most of the employees stayed behind the counter even when we asked where certain items were- they just gave us the row # and let us hunt down the items on our own . other than that , a superstore that 's for sure !	3086
1	needed snow tires changed for regular ones i had & a brake check . everywhere else in the area would 've taken 1 week+ for an appointment . walked in and done in 20 minutes with no appointment . originally said it should n't cost anything then they charged me $ 20 for a rotation ( which they did ) but i did n't expect to have it done for free anyways . prices for other services were high ( oil change $ 45 ) but if they 're low on customers and you want it done fast this is the place to go . no appointment system available , just walk-ins .	2375
1	amazing ! we tried 3 different dishes when we visited and all were delicious . great place if you 're wanting breakfast mid-day as their breakfast was very good . will definitely be back !	1276
0	the menu is annoying as are the prices . the sushi was mediocre at best . the boat we ordered did n't come on a boat . they had no hot sake , though the cold sake list looked good . beer is list is dog shit . waiter was pretty useless and too many white people for an asian place . fuck that stupid menu !	740
0	called this location 2 times . jeffrey answered both times . kept putting me on hold coz he was busy . first time asked me to call back coz they r busy , understand . called back second time asked the same question about battery warranty , he put me on hold for 10 mins . very bad service there	424
1	i rescind my earlier rating . even though i waited an hour and the computer was down and the np was meeting with her boss , i must say the nurse practitioner , susan , was superb ! ! she was thoughtful , thorough and nailed my diagnosis . and the staff apologized profusely for the delay .	2906
0	walked in expecting something similar to frost , however as intriguing as the flavors were - the pricing was outrageous - 20-30 % higher per size than frost - so we left and did not partake - to are how it could have tasted 20-30 % better so this is strictly a pricing review .	164
0	they have little to no customer service when you need assistance . the employees are rude and have no desire to help when needed . calling the corporate office does not help either . they do not wish to become involved but say to take issues back to the local site .	2939
0	advertised as gelato - it is not . it 's more like sorbet but at gelato prices ! unless you are allergic to dairy , go to bruester 's down the street if you want ice cream of any sort . very disappointed .	499
1	complimentary water or soda . i will never forget because i was asked three times . $ 30 for a pedicure . that included the extra charge for the callus remover . this will be my spot for any emergency mani/pedi situations when in vegas	2448
0	you will get a car at a cheap rate . but it will be one beat up piece of crap . staff are rude . reserved an economy got a minivan that had been put through the ringer- dents , scrapes , missing parts , stains on upholstery , funny smell from the vent . spend $ 20 more and go with another company .	2138
0	i 've never met a more rude staff or a doctor who could care less about you . dr. timothy came in with a `` why are you here '' attitude . interrupted me when i was talking , talked down to me . did not listen when i said that my son , who the appointment was for , does not talk , then proceeded to run a verbal hearing test . i told the nurse that my son does n't talk so he will not respond to the verbal test . she said that this is what the dr ordered . seriously ? never coming back here and never recommending this place to anyone .	737
1	great service ! we also had a nice lunch and breakfast downstairs in their restaurant . our room was very nice as was their fitness center that we used . i would definitely recommend staying here if you have the $ $ $ !	1671
1	it 's always fun to go into a store that does n't have sale ads and the stock changes all the time . just like the old big lots which used to be macfrugals . found an awesome couch/futon for $ 400 less than a similar item at costco . staff took it apart so it would fit in my car which was appreciated . kevin was very friendly and helpful . will enjoy future trips back to see what great finds i 'll bump into .	692
1	seriously fast and friendly service . i call and tell them i need to reorder my cat 's medication . they do all the work checking with my vets office to get the green light . they even asked if she is still enjoying the chicken flavor they add to her meds . really great all around . even send a little toy for her ! : ) love this service !	2827
1	one good thing about vegas is the wide variety of dining options . and one of them is definitely sonic drive-in . i go out of my way to find a sonic ( i have to , since there are none near the strip ) . everything at sonic is delicious . i wish there were sonics in northern california , then i would n't feel obligated to visit one every time we 're down here .	994
0	several screen theatres inside leave their mood lights on which sucks cause it takes away the movie experience . i though i was n't sure if i was going to stay , i should 've contact the manager and next time i will .	3947
1	first time here and it was a treat ! super nice service and delicious desserts , i had both stewed papaya w/ white fungus and almond great for the cold weather ! and the stewed egg w/ ginger juice is silky smooth and delicious . great place for traditional chinese dessert ! would come back and bring friends !	1513
0	i have always loved roberto 's , never had a problem at any location.. until i got food poisoning from this one . pin pointed that it was the pickled carrots at their little salsa bar , i was down the whole christmas weekend . never again ! beware of this location ! ! !	322
0	as you enter , you 're 'treated ' to some of the tackiest green everything . nothing spectacular here . safe . room quality and service varies , but ok place to stay . the fremont experience is free and very cool to watch.. the first few times . fairly safe location for downtown . new owner needs to invest in updates . place looks worn .	2500
0	.created erronoisly wbile trying to revise the 5-star review no longer even deserved .	1436
1	i 've been to many authentic chinese restaurants in my life . this one is the best . the staff is very professional and helpful , the place is clean and the food is exceptional . there is one tv screen , and instead of the usual highway traffic-camera and the breaking news , they show clips of how traditional dishes are made in china . i will definitely be back with more friends .	0
1	i rode five or so ubers this weekend in cleveland , including one from the airport to downtown and another from the hotel to the brew pubs when it was bucketing down with rain . it was all perfect and the same uber that i 've ridden in charlotte , in fort lauderdale , in san francisco and in wilkes-barre . what an amazing technology and it all worked well in cleveland . only one bump , where i rated my driver four stars instead of five . he gave me a pretty solid attempt to get me to call him to talk about his multi-level financial business . i took his card and proceeded to bin it . other than that , a great time .	2878
0	no explanation needed but here are a few negatives ... ..never get you in on time and wo n't get your children in last minute . find somewhere else who have more loving doctors care for your precious children . these doctors are n't the most knowledgeable nor the most compassionate . very sad	3134
1	so glad to finally have an asian supermarket on the east side . place is very clean and staff is friendly . they also serve filipino cooked dishes to go . just really glad do n't have to go into town when i have filipino cravings .	1595
1	i love santo 's homemade pasta , especially the cavatelle with exceptional marinara sauce . it 's up there with the best i 've ever had the pizza is also yummy . salad , however is horrible iceberg lettuce with a harsh vinegarette and that cheap shredded cheese . so 5 stars for pasta , pizza , and sauce .	1242
1	after having a pretty rough day , i came out to my car that would n't start . i called my carrier and they advised it would be 75 minutes before the towing vendor would arrive . freddy , from central towing arrived within 10 minutes , was extremely pleasant and made me smile even after the day i had . i drive an european car and freddy took the time to ensure it was towed properly and based on the manufacturers recommendation . if i ever need roadside assistance again , i will only call central towing and request freddy .	1607
1	michael from red carpet vip is amazing ! i reached out because i needed help planning my soon to be sister in law 's bachelorette . it was a group of 10 girls so i was a little overwhelmed but michael saved the day ! everything was super smooth and easy ! we got good deals and had the best time ever ! we booked hotel and a bachelorette package for a great price . i have saved contact info because i will for sure reach out again on next vegas trip ! ! !	1616
1	all because of my server lindsay 's very nice service , i am giving 4 stars . she was very very nice and kind . the food , bbq pork salad was quite good but the onion rings were a bit weak .	1400
1	christina is amazing she did my easter nails perfectly ! ! ! ! love all the girls ! ! ! ! ! !	1288
1	we were very happy with our dealings with az veterinary specialists . we had 2 golden retrievers each with a different problem kona saw dr beaver for bone cancer in his back leg and cricket saw dr felchle for eye problems . the whole front staff and doctors were just wonderful with our babies . we are so glad that they were recommended to us .	3334
1	love harkins . they are always good with loyalty cups and free popcorn passes . we love to come here for date night and always have a good time .	1240
1	this would be 5 stars but ... .the parking is atrocious . you have have to valet , its $ 24 , do not bother with the garage that 's also $ 24 . no , it 's not included in your hotel price . no it 's not very clear . just valet . $ 24/night . the layout is screwy . i love everything else about this place though from the staff to the decor to the showers to the location . it 's just very cool , very unique , it was well worth the money , and was adequately priced . you wo n't regret it once you figure it out ; )	3337
1	impressive service , comfortable guest rooms , nice fitness center . nothing unique , but nice location . good room service breakfast . great for business travel . i prefer more boutique style for personal , but this hotel fit all of my business needs .	1690
1	i love tijuana flats ! great place to have a location at . the food is always good , and they always have specials . i remembered they had a $ 5 bowl this month and that 's what i usually get . so after doing some shopping at the mall , my daughter and i decided to stop here on our way home . i got my bowl and she wanted nachos . very filling for dinner . i got mine powelite style , where the dairy is reduced or fat free items . we always try sauces to see what we 're in the mood for that day . as we ate , it got busier . this location is hiring as well .	1137
0	they almost go out of their way to not be helpful or serve drinks , even when semi empty . not the friendliest service , which i can get over in vegas , but on top of that , the music selection does n't always fit with the vibe ( e.g . gangster rap and lounge music ) and there is n't a lot of good people watching either . time to go somewhere else . maybe try the chandelier bar .	456
0	the worst experience at a hotel in years . dirty halls , room , pool ; no towels in room or at pool , blanket for fold out bed smelled and was seriously stuck together when trying to unfold , elevators did n't work , ice build up on windows inside of our room , drafty , no grill service in restaurant , soda dispenser in restaurant did n't work , clocks set to wrong hour in room and no one knew how to reset , ice machine broken . do not choose this hotel !	2296
1	l came to the solution first when l was broken and had nothing to say about myself . i was able to work on my steps and work with a wonderful sponsor . while l became staff and the solutions closed down l was able to move to the new solution and work with others . the new solution changed my life as well to . i am 3 1/2 years clean and sober and l want to thank all my friends that l became close to . thank you new solution and that we are able to help others . this is the best place to get sober and learn the right way of life .	2255
1	great customer service ! becky was very knowledgeable in assisting me with getting just the right trail runners and in-soles for my feet , that would benefit the way i run and my challenges ( runner 's knee , and some back issues ) . it had the best selection i found locally . i ended up buying montrail mountain masochist voted gear of the year by outside online . i was very happy with my purchase and the service . another plus is they seem to organize group runs tues , thurs and saturday 's at reach 11 .	2557
0	their listing here says they are open until 10 so i went and they closed at 9 . super annoying since i drove 15 minutes to get here . it 's not hard to update hours so you do n't inconvenience folks . the place looked really clean and i 'm guessing it would have been yummy .	2162
1	delicious vanilla bean cupcakes ! cute shop and great friendly service ! i 'll be going back for sure .	3749
1	this is my go to coffee place . there coffee is definitely better than starbucks and more convenient than the coffee shops . they are located right across of unlv so they can be busy at times but i 've never waited too long for my order .	3238
1	i called about my cars air conditioner broke . she said we are out 10 days 0n service ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! what . she said wait let me check with john service manager , he said bring it in and do the best he can ( wow ) gave me a loner and said it would be ready in two days.wow wow wow . i love them i will always go back to them	2432
1	one of my favorite korean food court in az ! i am a spicy rice cake lover and i always go there for this dish . their bibimbap is pretty good too ! i think most of their dishes are pretty good ! the price is a little expensive but reasonable	1028
1	been here a few times for bike night and various other occasions . same bar food and tall-ass beers as all the other quakers . staff is always nice , even when the place is packed with suburban rebels draped head to toe in coordinating harley and affliction gear . i could imagine this is where sonny barger would of hung out , had he sat when he peed and wore womens panties ...	1487
0	this store offers the absolute worst exchange & return store policy . i do not recommend spending your money here . customer service is very poor . shop online if you can !	794
0	had my brakes routine checked here and a squeal started immediately after they serviced them . returned it twice for adjustment and the problem got worse with an added `` pull '' to one side when driving . they could n't find any problem . took it to another local place ( woodies ) and it was fixed first time . i got the feeling firestone did n't want to warranty their work and just focus on getting the next sale .	1297
0	worst customer service ever ! ! ! walked into the store to look for a dining table , the blonde looked at us like she saw a ghost and continued to ignore our presence .	3854
0	if i could possibly give no stars i would . i have been to this location now two times . first time i had an appointment and i waited for 35 minutes with a 2 year old . this was the second time i went waited over an hour with a 2 1/2 year old and than was told they could n't get me in today by karen . who is very unprofessional and no patients with small children anyway . this place is a joke . wonder why i was told when i moved here never to use this place . now i will spread the word as well .	3087
1	very impressed of how knowledgeable and safe they made my experience . i will fer sure go back ! for being new to all this i feel way more comfortable handling a gun ! thank you for making me feel safe and teaching me a few things ! !	1128
0	so many rules and this place is so so so small . it has a lot of potential but it 's just not a big enough venue for a trampoline park . for the expensive price of everything it would be nice if there were n't some ridiculous height rules . there are other trampoline parks that are a lot bigger and more kid friendly . my daughter could n't jump with her brother because she was 1 inch below the cut off height . and for her size there are only 3 tiny trampolines with tons of little kids on it . very disappointed in this place	3173
1	by far the best gamestop to get recently released used games . whenever they run their buy 2 get one sale this is where you wan na be . the staff is also very nice and the store is clean and organized . very much my favorite of all the gamestops . now back to gran turismo 6 !	2562
1	stopped in for breakfast -- the stuffed french toast is amazing ! piled high with a variety of berries and filled with a sweet cream cheese , it hits the spot ! pair with a big cuppa fresh coffee and you 're set !	277
0	free and i want my money back . these comedians are not funny . most of the comedy is low brow and the host is usually the only one laughing at his jokes . it is a small venue so there were no bad seats in my opinion . free is the only way to go ... maybe groupon if you are desperate to do something in the evening .	2458
0	horrible . i went there once and had a horrible waitress . i ordered a small deep dish pizza and it was dripping in grease . the only thing good about my experience was the beer i had , but you ca n't really mess that up . i do n't suggest going to this place at all .	705
1	was recommended the gyro omelette . fantastic , good amount of food , good service , good value .	6
1	i have eaten many times at delicious thai . that i had to learn how to make curries myself to my own spice ness level . i do n't agree with mike a. i eat curry four to five times a day for a few years now for lunch or dinner alternating between different pastes , and i 'm lean . i think coconut milk and thai food in general is very healthy . i 'd eat everyday at delicious thai if i could afford it . i really loved all the dishes i tried .	1439
0	this place is 100 % awful . bad service , substandard food ... a lot to pay for lame chinese if you 're not getting it comped . do not come here .	171
0	horrible service , drove from chandler because we heard this was the best . picked up our to go order and no noodles in the chow mein . we called and the said they would deliver the noodle after we told them were we lived they said its too far they are too busy to deal with it and we get a 3 dollar credit . the dish was around 8 dollars and the reason to get chow mein is the noodles . after spending time on the phone the lady said the noodles are n't even that good and `` customer do n't like '' why are they on your menu then ? the way they deal with customers is horrible save your coin .	420
1	excellent customer service & security . well worth the short cab ride from strip ! take your appetite and eat in hometown cafe . huge portion and above average service . the chef even says hi at the table . we were not lucky on the slots but seen other win . old style happy type place . we will make sure we return each time we are in vegas .	3378
0	this place has a variety of exotic drinks and chocolates but it is kinda pricey . i could have gotten better chocolates at that price elsewhere because theirs taste like hershey 's . the drinks are worth trying but it is not great . i love that they have a nice view from the second storey especially but they do not offer free wi-fi . so , i ca n't study or do research while in there .	3787
1	the gas station here always has the cheapest prices in town ! the car wash is okay . i always get my gas here if i can help it .	3057
1	although this place seems like a tin box from the outside and yes you can hear everything from the outside , let yourself get past that and go inside , the staff is great and helpful and will get you feeling great out on the range !	1128
1	came to the park for some free play time and there 's bday parties and ducks and turtles to see . great place to play a friendly game of football .	367
0	this store is absolutely disgusting . nothing is in the right spot , the staff is frazzled , and everything is so close together that if there are two people in the store you ca n't help but bump into them . boxes are half open , i am certain the shrinkage in this store is huge , and the prices are high for the quality . why , you ask , did i even enter this den of despair ? because they sucker my tween in with minecraft , pokemon , and my little pony paraphernalia . however , this store is the worst hot topic i have been to .	2291
1	mike at the rental center was a consummate professional . very warm and friendly , great with the customers always follows through . my crew and i needed a few options on our rentals and he took care of us 100 % . and did while dealing with our distracting shenanigans . i will be back my next trip to sin city !	3078
1	it 's been a longtime since we have been to a cici 's . 1st time at this location and the pizza was good . the staff is very helpful . asked for a veg pizza and it was at our table a few minutes later . our table was always clean also .	671
1	this place is just phenomenal . open late , great music , atmosphere , excellent food and cocktails . it 's always a treat ( and a super fun night ) when soju is involved and they had a good selection . the poutine was probably one of the best thing i ate in toronto ! wow ! so many unique flavors working very well together . the staff gave us suggestions on other spots to check out and were all around friendly . will absolutely visit whenever i 'm in toronto again !	688
1	great monday night casual dining and the staff is very friendly i had rebecca ! she was very nice	201
1	i found my new favorite filipino restaurant here in las vegas ! the food was amazing & delicious , the place is very clean , customer service is excellent and the owners are so warm & accommodating . now i know where to go every time i visit from san diego . i will definitely keep coming back & recommend this place to my family & friends . for the best filipino cuisine , cebu inasal is the place to be ! you 're the best , hands down	658
0	this lane bryant is a hit or a mis . i have been buying things for my wife here for years , some days i go in the ladies are very helpful but most of the time they are totally rude especially if it is a skinny girl . lane bryant has opened a new location over at tanger outlet mall the ladies that work there are all ways friendly . so friendly they even went so far as to model a dress for me .	653
0	really awesome bar just be careful of the bartenders they 're drinking on the job and they will screw you out of your money however the patrons are freaking awesome i just wish i could trust more bartenders	850
0	not at all as advertised . would not recommend getting a haircut , at least during the weekdays . idk what the weekend is oike. , maybe some actual barbers work there ? ?	2677
1	been eating here for 35 years ! lunch specials are the best . house special chicken and shrimp with lobster sauce are favorites !	1264
0	i made an appointment for 11 am . waited for 18 minutes and left . what is the point of taking appointments if you 're not going to stick with a schedule . there are tons of other salons around . poor customer service is not acceptable	3309
1	the service we received from calliber was exceptional . brandy at the front desk made us feel very comfortable as well as chris our service advisor ! we dropped our car off last tuesday and was told it would be this friday before she would be done but she was done yesterday to our satisfaction . we could not be happier with the daily updates and service we received . thank you all for your exceptional and timely work !	1819
0	i went back here , and it turns out i was wrong . way wrong . i do not like the way this shop is ran . the high prices are still high . the management is not friendly , nor are they cool . i really missed the mark on that one . do n't waste your time with this place , pick up a cigar down the street and smoke at remedys right next door to this place ... more comfortable and with less aggravation to deal with .	2337
1	alana is awesome ! i love how she does my hair every time . i 've been coming here for years and everyone is so sweet . there 's prices are very reasonable ! make sure you ask for alana and she will take care of you .	2908
0	horrible service ! rude ! will never go back to this starbucks ! the girls were chatting most of the time during work , even when they were taking my order ! my drink was good because it 's starbucks but will never go back to this one for sure !	3809
0	this place is horrible ! they bait and switch you first of all and never have the promised deals . the employees are all ex cons i 'm sure including the scumbag management . terrible , no , actually zero customer service . they act like they are doing you a favor to take your business . i would n't recommend this place to anyone . i had to give it one star because it wo n't let me post with zero stars . in all fairness to any current employees or management my experience was 2 years ago . my wife just suggested using them to install a system that was gifted to us and it made me remember my awful experience .	2427
1	everything you could want from a pizzeria . i recommend the pizza boats , i get them about once a week and they are always cooked to perfection .	900
1	just started here but i love it . it has a great vibe . evwry one is friendly and helpful . it is clean and well maintained . there are plenty of machines some reviews say it is too crowded . yes there are people but i have always been able to do my work out without waiting for the equipment i need . the parking lot is huge and there seems to be plenty of room for all .	3268
0	all my experiences here have been horrible including their north las vegas location . stay away ! :	460
1	oh so lo-ver-ly ! this is a quality coffee shop and bakery import from nyc . it 's very busy during the workweek , but do n't fret as things move quite quickly . try the white chocolate lavender blueberry loaf for a unique and rich treat !	207
1	such a cute place , love the ambience.. very french countryside cottage inspired . it 's a order and seat yourself kind of place . all i had was an almond paste croissant and wow it was amazing . going back soon will definitely have a meal next time	1276
1	awesome subs ! ! i love the number 13 and will not go to any sub place to eat.. must check it out ! the staff is very friendly and always happy	1528
1	first time to this place . i came based on yelp reviews ! i loved my gyro plate . very flavorful and a generous portion . i requested the half salad , half rice side . i personally did not care for the rice..i would rather have a double greek salad for my side . the dressing is unbelievable . overall , all of the food is so fresh . we got a hummus app . the pita is so fresh . my only complaint would be the hummus . it thought it lacked flavor . i would not get it again . great job with the atmosphere and customer service !	860
1	i wake up beautiful and ready to dash out the door everyday with my beautiful eyelash extensions by jenny . she is meticulous and talented . an artist and the sweetest lady imaginable . she always takes her time and does beautiful work . so worth it .	1288
0	decided to take a break from walking around the strip and found a movie theatre so we went to go check it out . first of all the theatre is hidden so it 's kind of sketchy and secondly the theatre is n't as nice as other ones . the seats were so uncomfortable it was hurting my back so me and my bf left the theatre and got our money back and i would not recommend this place to anyone unless your okay with horrible seats and a sketchy theatre .	2061
0	avoid like the plague . tiny sandwich served on crunchy rye , not steamed . the bread was more like a cracker , not soft fresh bread . the pastrami was served cold . i guess i should have known better when the server asked if i wanted lettuce on my pastrami . the server was brand new and just did not know ... oh well i 'm sure the bagels are ok .	325
0	i think my wife summed it up when she remarked something to the effect of , `` why would anyone want to go in that dive and buy overpriced , mediocre pasta ? '' yeah , it was pretty mediocre . little more than edible , the pasta really did n't make the prospect of returning very attractive . the marinara had so much oregano in it that it probably doubled as the pizza sauce . the minestrone was okay , but the bread roll was a tasteless ball masquerading as sourdough . service was friendly enough , but that 's not going to save this place . i love me some pasta , but i do n't love me red devil . pass .	1482
0	very inconsistent food and service . first time awesome , loved it . a week later , horrible ! steak was mostly fat , did nothing to rectify it . hot veggies- cold , 20 minutes to get our drinks after being seated , requests were slow and at times had to be reminded . repeats are a flip of the coin .	560
1	this is my favorite favorite favorite place to go ! i wait every year for october just to go to ren fair . the retail & activity booths always take up the whole park , so you get your money 's worth & it 's always fun and the prices are n't bad either ( i always buy a bunch of rings/necklaces when i go ) food , drinks , music , and 1 $ -for-10 incense . the only downside is that parking is insane . i suggest going super early or not going until it starts to get dark in order to get decent parking . other than that , this place is perfect !	2665
0	worst pharmacy ever . i was told it would take 10-15 minutes to refill my birth control and i ended up waiting for an hour . if i had known it would take that long i would 've gone home to do some much needed studying . students just use the cvs on university ! ! ! !	3318
1	prices are pretty high but it 's haagen dazs and it 's located on the strip . if your kid wants ice cream and you want to reward them with delicious cream and high quality of haagen dazs , then you came to the right place . the quality of the ice cream and shake is really good ! service was fast and the lady who helped me was very friendly . even recommended some shows to watch around in vegas !	1308
1	amazing food . with a diverse and flavorful menu , this restaurant has something for everyone and is priced affordably for healthier options . i got the hummus nachos to start and they were excellent as well as the new harvest sandwich was very tasty . i highly recommend and cant wait to come back .	1458
1	quick fast painless and i loved the results . must try to believe ... .. the stuff are amazing and i will come back next year for sure	2667
1	okay , let me explain the 5 star review . this is not because it is a big fancy restaurant with gormet food , quite the opposite . this is a good old fashioned diner that does what it does very well and consistently . the whole staff is great and i love watching the 'show ' in the kitchen area . the food is all very good and plentiful and i usually eat too much . the prices are good too . this place just brings back memories , pretty much exactly the same as the one in orlando that my dad used to take me to 40 years ago .	241
1	loved this show wayyyy better than chippendales . these are realistic guys and are straight . way more entertaining for the girls ! !	2149
1	as a former homeowner in which colonial was our hoa , i must say the few times that i have had to deal with them they have been extremely nice , professional and addressed all concerns promptly . i honestly can not say anything negative about them .	3608
1	this mall holds a special place in my heart . it 's a fun place to simply talk a walk during the hot summer heat - the stores , although they are not as prestigious as kierland or fashion square , are quirky and unique and offer a form of respite from the bland , whitewashed and otherwise 'luxury ' image that malls in arizona try to exude . it will be a giant mistake if they tear this mall down and build just another outdoor mall . who wants that in 117 weather ?	2815
1	this was a great place it was a in and out thing and all the employees there was very nice i gave all the ten cards out to my friends	3851
0	cheap price and horrible customer service . casino staff and management unfriendly and not helpful when asked for directions or about services . did not post a disclaimer regarding no full face paint or masks until two days before halloween . if i had known about it , i would have gone to a different hotel . the only reason i did not give them one star is because they have a great cleaning staff .	2500
0	they were more than happy to be friendly and helpful up until we signed the lease for our house . now , no one seems to know wtf is going on , and getting a return call from leaving a voicemail is impossible . will never use this company again . sadly , we are only in our second month of our year-long lease .	2744
0	very rude to new clients . my dog got hit by a car and after a visit to the emergency animal hospital they recommended that he get x-rays at a local vet clinic . after calling arcadia animal clinic i was told they do n't schedule new clients for 2-4 weeks and he would not be seen until then . they refused to assist my dog in need and i am very disappointed in their customer service and willingness to care for animals . i would not trust them with your animal , do not go here for vet care .	2009
1	excellent prices and a good selection of products . click n pull ordering system allows customers to pre-order dry goods . you order and the order can be ready as soon as the next day . its glorious for those of us who dislike searching for items in the store , or for those who need to stay on a budget . note : there are a lot of seasonal items , if you want something seasonal ( ie , down comforters in fall ) and see it at the store purchase it right then ! odds are good next time it wont be there .	2469
1	best gas station i 've ever been to . great service ! great prices for gas . love the atmosphere and super clean	2920
0	ran a battery of blood tests/x-rays on our pet over a weekend , missing the root cause of a problem that our home vet picked up on a quick physical examination the following monday . staff seems sincere and well-intentioned , and with the new ( home vet ) diagnosis in hand they operated on our pet successfully . would like to rate them higher for the end result ( the surgeon did a v. good job ) but i was frustrated throughout the process and the bill was unnecessarily high .	345
1	i was so sad when monte lago closed , so i am relieved they have reopened . i 'm particularly glad the cafe reopened and still has the best portabello fries i 've ever had . the are very lightly breaded , somehow crispy and juicy at the same time . i noticed a few things have changed in the casino . all the black jack tables are now automated , which i guess is a more sustainable model for their business . my brother in law is also pretty happy about the new free soda machine in the casino area . it 's great having such a conveniently located and intimate casino with good ventilation , so it 's not too smokey .	3692
1	i chose this establishment for my braces and do n't regret it . dr. luke and his staff are professional and good at their work . they are busy so always make an appointment . ayla i love as she does detailed work with my cleaning all the time . i drive from tempe to glendale just to show how i love their service .	2459
1	we found this place from reading yelp . ohhh my ! ! what a find ! ! ! i wish we lived here to come every week ... maybe every day ... truly one of the most unique ways of cooking food . the bacon had a smokey , maple glazed flavor that was out of this world ! ! ! everything we ate had such an incredible flavor ... will definitely spread the word to family who lives here , and come back when we visit . wow ! ! !	57
1	the decor was really cool in this place . loved the liquor selection . they had a very thorough selection of whiskey . open kitchen so you can see what was going on . drinks were good . we sat at the bar and got to talk to the bartenders . they offered excellent suggestions . got drinks and an appetizer . i will say it took 30 min to get our bruschetta . other reviews did talk about the slow kitchen service . it 's still a new place though so hopefully they get their groove .	1331
1	everyone at this office is very caring , from the dr to the staff . crystal , the person that did my skin tests and breathing test was awesome and dr tottori has a great bedside manner . i feel very confident that i 'll get my issues controlled .	1964
1	decent little family-run vietnamese place . popped in before a sporting event for a quick bite and had the chicken com , mango smoothie and tea . exactly as ordered . homey , filling and tasty . grilled chicken was yummy , soup broth was fine but watch out for the little cup of chopped peppers - they are hot . tea was delicious and so was the smoothie . we 'll return for sure .	287
1	i have been coming here for over a year now and they always do a good job .	1719
1	my mom took me to this practice when i was a baby/child and i 've been taking my son since birth . sometimes have little customer service issues with front desk as far as courtesy goes but they seem to be getting better ( new staff i think ) . either way , awesome doctors- love dr. richardson - known him as far back as i can remember ! it 's a shame there are more than a few here who do n't have positive experiences to share , but it just goes to show how important it is to have decent frontline staff .	3893
1	both the manhattan and newengland clam chowders were delicious ! they have $ 7.95 lunch specials monday thru friday . i had the fish taco 's they were amazing ! ! !	1255
1	came in seeking for help after i got a flat this morning . they were able to patch up the holes from the nails quickly , and for free ! thank goodness for big o tires !	3379
1	i have been coming here for over a decade and have nothing but good things to say about this place . it 's not cheap , but it 's worth it . and book ahead , if you 're a walk-in you could be waiting awhile .	2509
0	probably the dirtiest harkins ive been too . im afraid i might get tika masala like joey boy from live 101.5 said	564
0	not worth your time . i went there to get a page printed and a fax done . their fax machine did n't work and i waited around for about 20 minutes until it finally sent my document . they charged me $ 4 to print one page , and sent a fax , and i had to bug the lady to let me know the total price and give me my change when i gave her a $ 5 . she just wanted to keep it .	3090
1	i came here to buy my friend 's favorite perennial as a gift and not knowing a thing about plants i felt a little lost but the staff were extremely helpful , knowledgeable , and accommodating . i had originally intended to buy the perennial and have it potted , and based on the exposure of where it was going to be located , and bloom time my `` assistant '' selected a few other complementing plants/flowers and also helped me pick out a really nice looking , modern pot ... not one of those ugly terracotta pots . it 's like she knew my style ! great customer service , and overall excellent experience .	3645
1	i love the this starbucks is inside the hotel ( westin ) . it has a huge seating area . you can sit there , enjoy your cup of coffee and people watch . i always order the skinny vanilla latte . this one was ok , the vanilla flavor was missing . maybe they forgot to add the syrup , but i did n't feel like getting up to say anything . i much rather enjoyed my time alone while everyone else in my party slept and drank my coffee .	3690
0	paid $ 1,300 for probably a $ 800 repair , but even more irritating than that was salt and pepper haired service manager asked me `` if i robbed a bank '' to pay the the bill . i guess since i had an older car and the repair was so overpriced i must be so poor that i had to steal money . jerk . wo n't ever go back .	2485
0	very disappointed with this place . new to the area looking for a nail salon that is clean and provides quality manicures and pedicures . first and last time to this place . did a poor job on the overall quality of my pedicure . massage was weak at best . went in here with my boyfriend asked for the deluxe pedicure the lady ended up asking me to go up a level . which we did not want . however it was hard to understand her so we ended paying more than we were planning for poor service . only adult beverage they had was red wine . very disappointed . i would not recommend . not worth the money .	3603
1	awesome craft cocktails , great staff , especially the bartenders . the interior design is amazing and the 90s hip hop music kept the scene alive !	2513
0	so i called and asked if i bought a headlight bulb for my car and asked them if it was possible if they could change it ... i was told . '' yah just come in '' i get there 5 minutes later and stood in a 10monite waiting line ... to be told that they ca n't do it . waste my fucking time . fucking joke .	424
0	it is a great bar , if you are single and have low standards ! their brunette bartender , priscilla , is the primary reason we longer go there . between her crazy and rude antics and the bar fights amongst the meth heads we have decided that although the bar may be close to home , it 's just not worth the drive !	2894
1	i have never been so impressed by a nail salon . cutest little boutique ever ! my sister is getting engaged & this was one of the `` stops '' on her scavenger hunt ! they even played a song for her per request of her soon to be fiancé . will definitely be coming back ! the attention to detail they put into my nails and toes was extremely exceptional !	3502
1	great place for pork barbacoa burrito and tacos . variety of boutique sauces to choose from . home made tortillas , beans and other veggies . excellent !	1365
1	they redeemed themselves in a big way around a month after grjd replaced the battery in my watch , the watch conked out . they cheerfully replaced the battery , no charge . it could have been a bad battery or my watch is messed up . it would n't surprise me if the two-year-old casio has already outlived its usefulness . the world revolves around a throw-away paradigm . replacing watch batteries is n't a profit center . jewelers probably do it only to generate goodwill . grjd went out of their way to be gracious and welcoming .	2923
1	good stuff but only worth it with coupons for free entree when you buy one and it is still pricey , they really get you on the price of the coffee .	520
0	well today i went to go see deadpool 2 . great seats really comfortable recliners . the snack bar attendant provided great customer service , however the reason for my 2 star review is the ac ( air conditioner ) during the movie . please stop turning it off when you have a full theater room . we are in vegas , it 's a desert out here . and when you had 40+ people in one room it 's going to get hot . so i hope this review gets seen and they fix the issue .	491
1	they have helped me numerous times . each time was wonderful ! ! ! very professional and courteous !	1015
1	always love their burgers as well as the options they have to get them custom made . always fresh ingredients and made to order and not just sitting in the back under a heat lamp . awesome fries and beverages as well . yum ! !	669
1	rien a redire de cet endroit ! service bon , rapide , nourriture excellente et ambiance plus que parfaite ! un petit bijoux montréalais !	628
1	love the way they do my nails here ! ( : the place is family owned , i recommend getting nails done by anyone in the family ( if possible/available ) they are all very good ! my favorite is the owner she sits at the front desk , very kind and helps when picking colors my gel fill is only $ 25 which is a good price to me !	2892
1	thank you to richard at autozone . called him from az when my gf had just driven to las vegas and found her car battery had died . she made it over there and they replaced it and got her on her way . service is n't dead in las vegas . it 's alive and well at autozone thanks again	424
1	i 'm a big fan of wingstop and the quality of the food that they serve at this location . the employees are nice and do n't mind if you need to take extra time to figure out what you want . the establishment is clean and very open . the food is always good and hot wings taste delicious everytime .	1395
0	what 's all the hype about this place ? this place sucks , i just do n't understand how this place stays in business ? it has to be some kind of money laundering business , who else would serve food like this ? it 's pretty disgusting . flavorless tacos that are way out of line on price , nope never again , you 'll never get my business again . the cashier thought i should be serving him ,	322
1	the first cvs i 've been to in years where an employee walked up and offered to help me find something .	1039
0	first and last time here . the food was horrible , it was like frozen food . the drinks were terrible , you 're better off sticking to bottled beer cause it 's a safe bet . and having a parrot squak while you 're tying to eat and talk to your friends was not fun !	704
1	i love supporting this tiny small mom and pop market when i 'm home . however i feel like the groceries are old and sit on the shelf forever ... the staff is young and always friendly ! support local ! !	473
0	wish i could give it less than one star . the furniture finish was so poor that a soft fingernail could scratch it . they will not refund our purchase price even though their store ads say you will get a refund if not satisfied . problem is each store is individually owned , so do n't trust what you read about refunds online .	1442
1	this mail order pet pharmacy is easy to work with and efficient . my vet was kind enough to let me order medication thru them in order to save big $ $ . shipping is free and they always include a toy or two for my cat , princess who loves them . thx roadrunner !	2827
1	i never spent time in real flower shops before finding az florist . i live nearby and drive past the building every day and after a few months , noticed the big signs in the window and stopped in . what a lucky day ! they have the most beautiful flowers and they last forever . i literally bought 2 bunches of carnations that just started to brown during the 3rd week i had them . amazing . i stop in nearly every week . the staff is always awesome and friendly and they have a nice selection and super reasonable prices . highly recommended !	38
0	would never go back here . worst gel nails i have ever had . super rushed service and super expensive . so many great places downtown . save your money and do n't go here ! !	2148
0	every time this business gets bad reviews they somehow make a new account on yelp lol ! ! this place should be called crookstone dental ... .con artists that should n't have licenses to work on even a dogs mouth ... overpriced and poor quality are two things to expect when you come to this establishment . got a root canal and was n't able to eat on my left side of my mouth for two years ... shut this place down ! !	2439
1	gateway , kannapolis . staff very friendly and helpful . ordered online and went in for pickup , so i can not say about the ordering process on site . had my order correct , so that 's an improvement over many pizza huts . ordered a large ground beef and mushroom hand tossed crust with the balsamic accent . very very good for chain store pizza !	1373
0	i hate to give a business a 1-star , but i am a firm believer in giving credit only when credit is due ... i had the butter chicken . i read the reviews prior to ordering & should have listened to the one that said it tasted like can tomatoes and chicken because they were so dead on ! the chicken even tasted canned . reminded me of campbell 's tomato soup with grated parmesan cheese added . the naan was even weird . it was not prepared traditionally.. it was just a pita warmed up and brushed w/butter and garlic . i did not even finish my $ 20 meal for one : (	600
1	they 're doing it right . i 'm so pleased that a place like this opened in my hood . i 've been eating here every couple weeks since it opened , and it has n't let me down yet . today i tried the ginger stir fry , and it is certainly going to be my goto dish . the lady running the place is a sweetheart , and i hope her all the success in the world . check it out	352
1	it 's a very cute place and i had a nice conversation with the owner who was there at the time i visited . i ordered a chai latte on ice which was excellent and the place is really cute and clean . next time i am in the area i will try a different drink along with one of their cupcakes . i am doing the best i i can to support locally owned/operated places . you should too .	3072
1	a group of us went to celebrate a friend 's birthday and had a great time ! we were given easy to follow instructions yet still encouraged to add our own flair to our paintings . anthony is friendly and funny and at the end he even showed us what some of the paintings looked like framed - though everybody 's piece was unique and beautiful , they looked amazing with frames around them ! i purchased a voucher to go back and plan on going regularly !	3048
0	my neighbor took me there last night to meet his brother and a friend , had been waiting since 6:30 employees everywhere but they could n't seem to figure out how to get the people waiting to actually play ? we had seen open areas to up to 20 minutes before they got filled we left at 9:10 frustrated and disappointed . what a joke get your shit together what horrible organization . i do n't understand for a franchise that is suppose to be successful fail on so many levels . when we complained on the way out everyone was apologetic but did nothing to make it right . the parking was a joke as well .	1483
0	horrible service .not friendly . ..dark and very dirty place warm beer ! really ! ... definitely not recommended ! absolutely	299
0	these guys are thieves ... bought two drinks on my debit charged me for 8 ... second time they 've done this..manager would n't do anything to help or make it right ... never go there again	704
1	great service and price . i 've shopped around and this is the most affordable best tasting water out there ! !	2519
0	i went in there for a oil change last week they treated like it was very low priority since they wont make a lot of profit for a `` basic oil change '' . very rude , do n't know how they got good reviews . i would definitely go somewhere else	2123
0	got to get rid of the sushi on the all-you-can-eat menu . somewhere in the history of asian restaurants people felt that the only way you can get a popular asian restaurant is if you also have sushi . the only problem ? having crappy sushi is no good ! so ... may i propose a novelty in the asian food business ? ayce thai and japanese . the non-sushi items on the menu are awesome . they 're so well done . so tasty . expect nothing if you 're going to get the sushi . and restaurant , take note . save the money on the raw fish order and just focus on what you 're good , and unique at .	1362
1	awesome ! ! first off i bought a starter for my 98 accord for wayyyy cheaper than the big wigs wanted ( corporate ) if yu are a do it yourselfer or a weekend warrior or just need a part this is the place to go .. i 'll definitely be referring folks here . also purchased was a main relay and of course a lot more inexpensive vs. all the other corps .. good place to go for parts and more . the only thing they do n't sell is refurbished batteries lol if yu did n't know about refurb batteries like i did they work just as well as a new with a warrantie as well .. happy campers yup	2027
0	i used to enjoy coming here , the staff was always friendly and typically received good manicures . this last time was the worst manicure i have ever received . so sloppy & rushed . the end of my nails are n't even straight and they are so jagged they are catching on everything . the top coat is all over my finger . yes should have had him correct it but it would have just made them worse . if you come here , just be aware you may or may not walk out with a decent mani .	3508
0	used to be a five star joint . new management must 've taken over because the place is ruined . burger patties are super thin , bun is too big ... gravey has been watered down ... there 's also one tall lady there who always messes up the orders and is super rude . too bad . this used to be my favourite place . now it 's been added to my boycott list .	652
1	this is probably the most underrated restaurant on yelp in mississauga . largely because of all the 1 star reviews for poor service . despite this , the place constantly has line ups for their dim sum so they must be doing something right . i 've honestly never had a bad dim sum dish here . har gow , beef balls , sticky rice , lotus leaf rice , shiu mai , tofu with crab meat , congee , pig feet , etc.. everything is great . the service is ... plain spoken and frantic but that 's dim sum for you . it 's certainly not worse than other similar restaurants .	0
1	the best authentic mexican/ carribean food in pottsburgh ! we had the avocado fries , the salsa that came along was the bomb ! my husband ordered the goat curry which came along with rice and beans and fried plantains- absolutely delicious . there truffle was the most amazing shit i have eaten in a long long time . it 's kinda out of the city but very well worth the drive if you like authentic food .	1358
1	if you like a quiet , resort-like lifestyle , this is a great place to live ! i liked it so much i purchased a unit after renting for ten months . the new management is pouring tons of money into the complex . great amenities - underground parking , beautiful pool and gym , gated , security , gorgeous community room , and the location is to die for ! everyone who visits comments how nice of a complex it is . the negative dog reviews are outdated . lots of dog owners here ( including myself ) . i love aderra !	3475
0	took my daddy here to get his beard trimmed and while they did a fairly decent job of the cut , victoria needs to learn a little customer service ( and how to even out a mustache properly ! )	3182
1	the person who ended up helping me was amazing and i ended up spending over $ 600 but i had to wait for over 30 minutes to get help . i asked several people and they said they would call someone over but no one ever came . when it is close to christmas , the store should have more associates working so ensure guests have all the help they need . also , the roof was leaking all over the store and although i like rain , i usually do n't want to be rained on inside .	494
0	the service advisor i worked with was pretty fantastic , but that is the most positive thing i can say . it cost me $ 65 and took the tech 50 minutes to tell me that my heat shield was damaged and hanging . that i knew and told them when i drove in . oh well ... i could n't fix it myself ...	3074
0	will never ever again return to the brown aveda after my previous experience . it has cost me a small fortune to fix the color they butchered .	1228
0	they told me my car had a lot of loose stabilizing parts . i installed all of those parts myself , they were not loose . i went in for a tranny seal replacement . they did fix the seal , but they also messed up my alignment ... what kind of repair shop breaks something , trying to replace another ?	281
0	if i could rate these words in one word dirty the tables were all over the place , forks and napkins on the floor and graffiti on the tables	857
0	this location is g-h-e-t-t-o . the clientele are like people of walmart ; i saw four people shopping in pajamas and slippers . the selection is not as good as the one on grand or the one on 67th ave. of all things , the alcohol section has the most variety .	3935
1	i love macy 's ! for me the only issue with this store is lack of staff . it seems every time i go shop , there 's not many cashiers , and there are n't many people around the store to provide assistance . really like that they do in store pick up . overall nothing wrong with the store . lots of finds .	139
1	i shop this store frequently . i have a 1 month old baby and discovered clicklist ! so happy hey offer it here now . the in store experiences i 've had are fantastic , from deli to cashiers and all departments ! the clicklist staff is kind and personable and i love it . kuddos to the entire store and management for having a great team !	2220
0	steak place that can not cook steak the way you order it . the waitress was pleasant and the food was delivered quick but if you can not cook steak the way i ordered it then what is the point ? the man sitting near me ended up returning his steak back as well because it was undercooked .	560
0	i have tried parallax three times now and it is the worst sushi i have had in cleveland . the appetizers were great but skip the sushi if you go .	487
1	great for a quick lunch ! such a large variety on the menu , it will surely meet anyone 's needs !	705
0	the moment we walked in , the place looked like a ghost town . i did n't see any attendants up and walking around . a guy forwarded me to the back where i could pick up my tuxedo . the 3 attendants who were supposed to help me were more engrossed in the novels they were reading . i tried the tuxedo on and the pants were way too baggy . i knew this was not the way it was supposed to look , but the attendant said that 's how they are supposed to be unless they took it in at the waist . i would have expected much better service like when i was fitted in the phoenix location .	1972
0	i generally like heinen 's , but not this one . it 's not so much the employees , or the store , but the other shoppers . this was my first experience where people intentionally blocked the aisle with their shopping cart , and there is no attempt to accomodate others . even at the giant eagle down the road you will find people at least move when they realize you are attempting to look at the same items . not here ! there is a definite me-first vibe that is just ... unsettling .	3909
1	i 've been to many of the locations close to and around tempe and none of them can compare to the consistency and quality that these employees hand me every time i go through the drive thru . it 's nice pulling up and knowing i 'll be getting a great coffee every time .	606
1	solid place ! ! their vegetable juices are freshly made and their best products ! ! their smooth is a little bit too sweet for me but some may like it . the all green energizer is really green juice flavor ... no sweetness ... i think it 's delish ! ! i heard others saying the hangover is really good and healthy and less green juice flavor and a touch sweet ... may try that next time . their acai bowls are excellent as well ! ! i got the hawaiian acai bowl and they added a layer of coconut for me ! ! will come back ! !	3026
1	okay so tire shine may be working , but the tires do n't come out super shiny like they did on my first visit ever when i paid for a 1 time wash. maybe the unlimited washes comes with less than when you pay one at a time wash . i wonder .	2939
0	customer service is okay . but stopped going because my nails ( hand and feet ) became so brittle and began cracking after the few times i started going to get my nails done there . on top of that my shellac manicure started chipping the next day ( literally ) . horrible .	2148
1	marc is the best pharmacist ! he is super knowledgeable across the board in pharmaceuticals & otc . he always provides excellent customer service going above & beyond . thank you !	3318
0	update - there is a `` for lease '' sign on the building . it 's safe to say they closed .	1330
1	best thai food in charlotte . i have been going here for 9 years and it 's always good . try the pad thai ( thai style ) and the som tom ( green papaya salad ) . i also like the rad nar with seafood and the yellow curry and the penang curry . you can order spice level 1-4 so they will make it your spice level . the servers are some of the sweetest and kindest people i have ever met . i consider them family . beautiful souls . also the sweet iced tea is great . they use jasmine tea and it 's perfect . this place is pure love .	895
1	omg ! 1 of the best burgers i´ve had . me and my friend were in the area and took a total chance and it was worth it . the fries w/ gravy are bomb !	964
1	ordered our hot subs over the phone within an hour of closing . the person taking the order did n't know the subs by their number . when we showed up our order was still being made and the person cleaning their seating area was giving us the death glare ( even though we did not eat there ) . the person running the register did not know how to use/enter our coupon so we did n't get a receipt but our order was hot and accurate so ‍	1528
0	i 've been to messina in melbourne , so i thought i knew what to expect , i was pretty hyped when i saw an aussie export . the taste and quality was nothing like what i 've had previously , the choc mint tastes bland , if it was n't for the apple pie being delicious , i 'd give it a 0 rating . the server also looked bored and uninterested .	3735
0	service from waiter was okay if this was olive garden . in fact , food was about equal to olive garden . even with groupon we paid way too much for food that we did n't even finish . the hostess and her team were loud and unprofessional . the wine was sub-par and overpriced . we will never return . go to fiamma instead , it 's amazing .	563
1	i placed an order of 50 small cactii for a special occasion with ecostems after i found them online . i had some special requests , and had no problem reaching the owner to discuss options . he coordinated the delivery to my office building . the service and quality were on point ! the order was beautiful and fresh , and carefully packaged . we were even pleasantly surprised to receive a few coloured cacti to add to the variety of cacti received.. overall , great professional company to order from .	2585
1	great bar to see live music..not many left in the west end..usually an older crowd..great staff who are always friendly	1693
1	everyone is so friendly here ! ca n't say the same of the lady who works at bell and 35th . everyone at this location was kind and helpful .	23
1	had the turducken burger . burger was moist , duck was great and the egg was cooked well . could have used a little more sage aioli , but other than that it was solid . substitued fries for mac n cheese . worth the dollar up charge . pros : food was solid not very busy on a wednesday for dinner decent beer selection cons : bartender said there is only a happy hour on wednesday . overall a solid place for food near the stadiums . should be fun once the pirates start playing .	839
0	this place is poorly run with no communication and extremely rude management . if your looking for a cheap place , this is great . but if you are looking for a professional grooming with love . i would go somewhere else . highly disappointed ! !	1943
0	some front desk snot named austin likes to rude and condescending while on the phone . you 'll be best served elsewhere more welcoming .	3859
1	janet m was very patient with my return today . then we went shopping and purchased a bunch more which she rang up with a smile . you need more employees like her	1937
0	the food is good , the wings are tiny . i placed an order for `` three dozen wings '' and the girl that placed the order failed to mention they do n't sell wings by the dozen , but they come in orders of 8 's . so it was a total cost of $ 23.95 for 24 wings . needless to say , i 'll stick to small businesses for a good pizza and good wings .	271
1	so first off , i love this location . always prompt service . if i ever do not like my drink it is always fixed . i always seem to run into this woman in the front that goes above and beyond . i actually asked for her name this time and she wrote it down for me . letesheia sage , is the name . she has this power to up sale me on anything and im so happy with it . just the whole atmosphere of the employees seems welcoming . great job and ill make sure i keep getting my morning grub and caffeine here .	606
1	i had an excellent pedicure and the atmosphere was extremely relaxing . def not the usual buzz of other nail shops . the prices are great and all services are discounted until the end of may .	2008
1	this place has an amazing ambience and is great for a date . the dishes are delicious with tasteful drinks menu . overall i would recommend this place . great lighting and music as well .	1441
1	i was in town for a funeral when my check engine light came on i called 2 other honda dealerships that were closer and was told they could not help . called sunnyside went out of there way and scheduled my vehicle in the next day . they found the problem fixed it and had my vehicle back to me in a few hours . the service department did a great job . if i lived in the area i would only consider using them .	3074
0	even though it is closed to home , it has never been my favorite gas station to go to . sometimes , there will be some kids asking for gas money . another time , the gas pump did not stop filling up my car and it leaks all over the place when i was cleaning my windshield . literally , over $ 15 worth of gas was all over the floor . unless i absolutely have to come here , this gas station is n't my first choice . the reason i still give it a 2 star is because they do have a small usps office here inside the gas station convenient store .	2681
1	this is my local repair shop . yep he is a grouchy old man but his work is excellent and quick . got a flat ? by the time you walk to 7-11 and back he will have you on the road .	3156
0	horrible service . we went with our landscaper designer . no one at the nursery had a clue . we ended up asking one of the laborers for help . none of the actual nursery attendants could help us with answers at all .	99
1	its a dollar store so some stuff is horrible quality but do have some great finds . they are amazing for cards ( 2 for $ 1 ) . they are also a great place for kids books , coloring books and puzzles . i usually use these as a gift fillers for kid presents .	1831
1	ask for james , he gave me a 90 minute deep tissue that was therapeutic and relaxing . i highly recommend him .	3079
0	i usually come here all the time and my nails turn out looking great but today when i got my nails done the lady that was doing my nail made them way too short when i asked for them long . i paid $ 50 for horrible looking nails . my thumb nail looks way longer than my other ones and they are way too short . i wo n't be coming back here again . always way too pricey for the quality that you get .	3347
0	first off , i was annoyed for waiting over half an hour for waffles , it was n't over crowded so that was just lame . this place is over hyped , nothing special . just a bunch of different toppings on waffles . big whoop ! the food is n't bad it 's just not anything special .	580
1	great lesbian bar . mostly women with a few men . they have a decent size dance floor and people were line dancing as well as couples dancing . there is a pool table and darts . my girlfriend was the designated driver and they gave her free sodas . the people were laid back and friendly . there are tables to sit out , a few couches on the perimeter , and of course same space . the bar line was always a bit long . the bathrooms were clean . they also have a big patio with lots of tables and chairs .	2860
0	a week later and the mess left by a temp rite employee still has not been cleaned up ! extremely unprofessional and lazy ! if this is the mess they leave outside , i do n't want to see how they leave your house .	2339
0	i 've been calling the past two days straight and leaving voice mails just trying to make a damn appointment to be seen for an ear infection and perforated ear drum . i 'm going to find a better ent doctor even if i have to pay out of pocket .	737
0	this place is garbage and their doctors are garbage too . two different doctors have n't been able to do anything for me but send me huge bills ... thieves .	236
0	movers intentionally work very slow to run up the clock and subsequently the bill . took them 7 hours to fill barely half a moving truck drive 4 miles and unload the truck . i could have done it myself in half the time . typical bait and switch scam .	864
0	it 's fast and not as expensive maybe i am over thinking it but what is a spa pedicure ? ? ? ? well i was not greeted but they did eventually offer me service . i had soak , bath beads , trim , wash , and choose a color to paint on . maybe they did not like that i had request for a shorter trim i did n't feel as relaxed . one and done	1637
0	good news , bad news good news : this hidden spot has a great parking lot and awesome vibe in a warehouse district i did n't even know was there . good news also that you can book the whole space for events ! bad news : when you plan your day around working at this cool spot with good coffee and you have to pick a new spot because someone else rented it out for the morning . argh ! frustrated that i drove all the way out and have to find a new spot to do some work .	576
1	this place is awesome . first off , the pizza is so good ! do n't forget the joes sauce ! the wings are magnificent ! and now to top it off , they have eegees there !	417
1	i must say , the first time we went here in an extremely large group we had quite a negative experience . however , hacienda more than redeemed itself with our next visit ! was absolutely amazing from start to finish ! the ceviche , faloutas , jerk lobster tacos , pollo tinga , la truck , braised short rib were all beyond delicious . and of the course , the churro poutine was the perfect ending ! my personal favorite , the jerk lobster taco ! may be too spicy for some , but i loved it ! will definitely be back again , very soon !	1305
1	i started taking the 407 etr a few weeks ago when i got a car . i ca n't believe how much time its saving me - but god its draining my wallet ! ! i heard they are going to do the same thing with the qew and make it a toll road . this is going to be awesome for people that have to get somewhere fast , but i hope it does n't cost as much as the 407 . i think i will take the 407 only on days when i am running late . i 'm interested to see if the hwy is cleared any better than the other ones - at that price , it should be heated ! !	2336
1	we found this place from the awesome yelp ! reviews . it did not disappoint ! ! from my husband 's fried mozzarella to my gluten free spinach artichoke dip , then on to the fabulous gluten free pizza , we left stuffed . we were celebrating our honeymoon in the area and through conversation they found out and gave us an appetizer on the house ! if we lived here this would be a go to spot for us ! thank you nypd ! you made us feel so special and full !	581
0	i bought the smallest , overpriced , greasiest pizza in town , the toppings were overcooked and i 'm not sure if it was just my pizza or if they serve it like that in general . regardless , i am never coming back , i feel like little caesars would have been wayyyyy better .	1116
0	rude . extremely rude . very snooty . unwilling to assist or answer questions . take your money to gucci where they serve you champagne & make you feel like a vip even if you 're not a celeb .	1493
0	i am giving this salon a 2 solely based on the reviews i see , website and photos ( which look excellent ) . having only lived in scottsdale for 1 year i was in desperate need of finding a stylist that could work with african american hair ( especially in scottsdale ) . i had called here twice and left messages , going weeks without anyone calling me back . even drove to the salon , walked in and left my info on a piece of paper ... . nothing . was really happy i found someone on yelp who could do a relaxer and extensions . but guess i wo n't experience it as i have now found another stylist in the area .	82
1	was a first timer & had victoria , she was great ! would recommend . the receptionist was very friendly as well . it was a fast process and she did a great job . it seems very clean there & they never use anything twice so you know it 's sanitary .	1875
0	this ups store is the worst ! the older employees are very rude ! ! ! ! ! ive never been to a store with such rude employees . just avoid this place use the robinson store or fedex . i asked for a cart and the cart was junk nearly lost my boxes in the parking lot .	1320
0	i was better off nearsighted before i was talked into having an iol put into my eye here . $ 10,000 & im still wearing glasses but have 3 different focus points . now i 'm searching elsewhere to have them removed . dont do it ! find somewhere else to go !	1635
0	heads up to parents that use backpacks for diapers bags . you wont be allowed in the store with the bag . there were people with bigger purses than my bag in the store . and i was told to leave . ill never return to another savers . i dontbuse purses or diaper bags .	2178
1	gud . may be too oily for others . i used to love the pricing for their bbq skewers part of the menu , ~ $ 6 for 5 lamb skewers , which is a really great deal compared to other restaurants . but recently they changed the menu again and took off the bbq menu , which makes me less likely to go back there now .	1329
0	the latte is good ( trust me , almost any coffee would be good after a night out in vegas and early morning conference wake up call ) , but the lines here are ridiculous since it 's right next to the conference area . save yourself some time and go to the starbucks outside . it 'll be faster ( even though it looks farther ) .	2397
0	i 'm a big dollar tree fan . i am currently on a crusade to organize my home and their plastic bins & baskets for a dollar are a smoking deal . this particular location was pretty small and had almost no bins or baskets . they just had overall less inventory available than most other dollar trees , so i 'd say skip this location & go to another dollar tree .	1831
1	wow . i 've never had shave ice like this before and i 'm an instant addict . it 's this perfect combination of taste , texture , sweetness , substance , flavors- i dig it . i will definitely keep coming back and i like the fine of the place too . employees are cool but professional . it 's a great place .	3556
0	skip this shop all together . the pricing is ridiculous and the candy i purchased ( gummy coke bottles ) was so stale i had to throw it away . this establishment has pictures displayed all over town of celebs licking their suckers . the true suckers are the shoppers paying a fortune for walmart quality candy . save your money .	2021
1	it was n't until we were escorted directly into hakkasan that i actually was convinced the service was legit , and legit it is . the individuals we met up with for both hakkasan and surrender ( to see macklemore ) were very professional and polite . i will be using this service every trip , it was awesome !	1616
1	this place has lots of shoes for men , women and kids and medical uniforms too . they carry quality brands at reasonable prices . i buy all of my uniforms here and they are happy to order from catalogs if they do n't have the size or color you are looking for . very helpful staff .	1627
0	two bad haircuts in a row . i am done with great clips . bad haircut in september , took three months to grow it back out . went in with a picture of exactly want i wanted . ignored . cut it back above my ears again . i asked why and was told it looked better . i wanted what i wanted , not what somebody else wanted . do n't go to great clips unless you are happy with the one haircut they know how to do . me ? i am done !	2299
1	i have used mavis many times , and she has always been very friendly and nice . she is prompt , and has a decent selection of polishes to choose from . her salon is cute , and very clean . she always does a 5 star job	196
1	this place is on the south shore of lake erie , not the north shore ! unfortunately , that 's the only thing i can complain about . best selection of garage door remotes , best prices , and delivery was so fast even jimmy john 's is impressed . i have made multiple purchases of garage door remotes and will continue to use north shore commercial door , even thought they seem to be confused about their own location . i can live with that , though .	3470
1	a true escape into a paradise of relaxation and pampering . this spa is one of the best i 've ever visited and i 'm a spa freak . the facilities are immaculate and luxurious . you can relax before or after your treatment in a room filled with beds ! i hope they never get rid of those rooms because they are unparalled . next time i go , i will spend more time in there with my companions . this is a must on your next trip to the phoenix area !	2305
0	i went to urban outfitters at yonge and eg last week to do some christmas shopping and while there are some outrageously adorable gift items , the staff are unfriendly and have a huge attitude . shop from the uo website instead ; you 'll still pay an arm and a leg for the merch , but no one will act like they 're doing you a favour by taking your money .	1163
0	a clicky , trendy place , whose ( to me ) only two redeeming qualities are its eateries , and its proximity to my house . whoever designed this small outdoor mall never took a course in traffic flow patterns or how many parking spaces a mall of this size would require . on slow days , it is difficult to get a spot . on busy days , it is virtually impossible to park . after my second trip in the last 3 weeks when i was unable to find a spot , other than for meals ( where i can valet ) , i wo n't be going back .	387
1	cute stuff reasonably priced . always a fun trip ! customer service is usually pretty good but they also let you just kind of journey in on your own to discover all of the treasures hidden amongst the junk ! i like that stuff seems to turn over fairly quickly so it 's always new . i like that they advertise their bigger pieces on craigslist so you can see what they have ahead of time but for the little stuff it 's still pretty much a `` pick through '' event . worth the trip since there are several worthwhile little similar stores on indian school near here .	3400
1	wonderful car , fast trip . driver was very nice , water bottle appreciated . would use again for sure . travelled from danforth east to pearson .	2952
1	very nice and welcoming . i liked how informative my girl was . their prices are amazing ! $ 8 for brows and $ 4 for upper lip . definitely worth it ! !	3806
0	came for a cup of coffee . they had the pistachio loaf to sample . not impressed , offering burnt pieces which was tough to chew . i do n't know , i prefer my loaves to be light and fluffy ... . i ordered the mocha coffee , it was very weak . it was more cocoa with very weak coffee . the decor was very feminin , country style quaint .	207
0	had breakfast here on saturday with the kids . we got seated right away although the place seemed very busy . my executive summary of the place is this : - the food is just regular breakfast fare , nothing special . i had the spinach omelette which was ok but really just like any other spinach omelette somewhere else . - the decor and resulting atmophere is bad ! to us it felt very cold and unfriendly , almost like sitting in a bus station ... just like a large , unfinished room . we wo n't be back .	364
0	this is closest location to me . i usually only shop here when the kids have a school oroject of for gifts for grandkids . the staff ( if you can find anyone on the the floor ) are not friendly or helpful . their standard answer is to give you and aisle number and walk away . when you get to the aisle , its usually the wrong one . do n't bother coming to the lake mead location if you need any kind of help or assistance because you wo n't get any . there is plenty of staff by the registers just talking amongst themselves . go elsewhere .	1615
0	worst breakfast sandwich i have ever had . a packaged frozen sando from costco would have been better . been shitting my brains out all day ; seriously i 'm worried i have internal bleeding . when i decide to dump my girl friend i will make sure to take her to this cheap place and feed her one of those fat nasty pieces they serve and call sandwiches . and watch her poo all day .	3137
1	an awesome place for all you can eat sushi . the price is right , the service is excellent . some of my favourites are the cheese wontons , kanda shrimp . for rolls the arctic roll and golden dragon roll are my go to 's almost every visit . the sashimi portions are absolutely perfect and all ( almost all are choices i make every time . ) .	1231
0	this has to be the slowest bubble tea house in the world . i 've been here multiple times hoping for a better experience . every time i come here for take out the order takes 30 minutes . 30 minutes . for take out . unbelievable . this makes chatime one block west of here look more and more appealing . the tea itself is just average . last time i came here the tapioca was overcooked and mushy . this is the last straw ( no pun intended ) . not coming back .	344
1	found this place by accident and boy am i glad . excellent service , a really good selection of japanese items . the cocnut shrimp was easily the best ive ever had . sushi and miso etc were all top notch as well . try the wine ball ! flame grilled chicken was also amazing . the chef even came out to greet us !	1277
1	we were n't what sure what to expect from a 1:00pm comedy/show . maybe we were n't expecting a lot since the tickets were very reasonable ( expecially through one of those half-price tix places ) however we thought the show was great . glad we noticed the good reviews here on yelp . definitely a good choice to fill a couple of afternoon hours if you want to get off the casino floor .	2489
1	very fast , and very informative . i did a smog test and vehicle registration here . i would definitely use this location again next year .	2208
1	i enjoyed that i got to get it done quick . within 15 minutes of getting my eyebrows threaded , i was done . it is really affordable ( $ 8 plus tax ) and the lady that helped me thread was very nice . she did a great job too ! ca n't wait to go back !	1729
0	ridiculous.i spent 150.00 for 4 people for this whole in the wall dump.with a guy who did not even know how to put on a show.although even if he was not there why on gods green earth would anyone charge that much.i paid about 60.00 for a boat that had barely no food on it.believe me this is not worth it.i do n't care how good the food is.the amount of money you pay for it is not worth it.hell i could have bought two tickets to disneyland for that amount of money .	431
1	jimmy and matt ( the redhead ) had me in and out in 35 minutes for an oil change . use my rewards and coupons and saved over $ 40 . good job .	2960
0	not friendly at all & $ 10 extra charge to round out nails . poor customer service ; do not recommend	3333
0	disappointed to say the least . bought a staycation on groupon for $ 125/nt in july . we are locals and accustomed to great summer rates on local resorts . this place is a step above a motel 6 . we ended up leaving and losing the $ . went around the corner and stayed at the scottsdale plaza resort for less . much prettier , better value . groupon let me down on this one .	2883
0	hookahs where tasty but i did n't get the smoke i wanted out of it , it was hitting real light and i kept flagging down the staff to fix it , the customer service was awesome but the prices and quality of the items were a bit iffy	1229
1	i love hakkasan but love it even more now that i know there 's a room dedicated to hip hop ! sometimes you want a break from edm and this is just the place to go for that . this room 's layout is more spacious than the main hakka floors . music was good here too .	1481
1	i am really happy with the service i received here ! i used to come here all the time back in the day , but the quality and customer service started to decline so i stopped coming . i found that they have been under new management for a while now and i am happy with the changes . i get a gel mani , deluxe pedi and my eyebrows waxed and they come out great each time . i am especially satisfied with my eyebrows because i am so particular and like them to just be shaped and stay thick . anyway i would suggest at least giving them a try . i am very satisfied .	1829
0	heng did a good tailoring job but i was just there today and he said he is closing . he was packing up everything in the shop .	136
0	they charged me $ 1 to slice and toast my bagel and did n't tell me until giving back my change . this place can burn in hell .	1156
0	honestly not sure what all the hype about this place is about . the food is nothing special . the atmosphere was n't anything special either . i really wanted to like this place but it was just so-so . the toppings are extremely overwhelming on your hot dog and everything just seems to get lost when mixed together . my tots were cold and try . possibly willing to try this place again ?	1407
1	this taco bell is always on point ! their staff is friendly , the food is always correct and they 're fast .	859
1	i have a rental property in scottsdale and i live in denver , being long distance property homeowner i am glad i have a company like firebird housing to manage my property . they found a great tenant and handle any issues that arise .	3512
1	without a doubt best flower i 've had in the valley . great staff , very knowledgeable and friendly . i have n't had too many of the concentrations but i had their house made cartridge and it was very clean and tasty . good deals and lots of options . i can see how the volume of product can be overwhelming but i like that the options are out there to try . again , get the flower , grown so well , simply beautiful . my new favorite spot .	1849
0	unprofessional , employees yell at each other , our consultant was new ( 1 month ) , slow , dirty inside , all around poor car buying experience .	1890
1	best pizza place ever . you walk through an assembly line where they throw your pizza together from a buffet of ingredient . they all looked fresh and super weird . you want oregano , they 're shaking a bush on your pizza . once you get to the front of the line , they throw your pizza in a 800 degree brick oven pizza for 90 seconds . it is amazing how quickly they move the line through , but even more amazing how great the pizza is when you get it .	282
1	serious slice of pizza . it 's huge ! taste 's great . try them , you 'll love the pizza .	417
1	the extended hours are enough reason to go here . everyone was kind a genuinely cared for my dog . he was a tad difficult trying to get weighed because the scale terrified him haha , but they were still sweet and patient with him . maybe though ... it would be a good idea to allow owners to weigh themselves then hold the dog and just subtract the owners weight . seems that 'd be less traumatic for everyone . in any case , i definitely recommend the office to everyone with a fur baby .	1766
0	nice people but my nails never lasted more than a few days or a week when i got them done here . i think it is typical owner cheapness that makes them try to stretch the product out so they do n't use a sufficient amount of product on a customer . i wo n't go back .	3260
1	been here twice and each time has been amazing ! i love my nails from them so much and the lady who helped me was very friendly and honest if she could n't do something	1661
1	i am not a runner but i 'm on my feet all day . the staff was excellent ! jenelle was so knowledgeable and helped get me personalized insoles to help keep my feet happy : ) winston was very patient and helped get me the right shoes ! ! the experience was awesome ! i will never buy shoes at a general sporting good store again ! ! thank you road runner !	2557
0	came in for propane before football started and was turned away . short staffed to make more profit does not help the customer .	3395
1	dr. zedek is great ! he listens to your concern and he know how to ask the right questions and how to address your issues . he helped me with a family member who had been suffering from a condition from years without knowing she even had a problem . when we went to dr zedek he immediately diagnosed her , prescribed a medication and she said her ups and downs were much more controlled . his price is reasonable and i would recommend him to my friends and family again . his treatment worked and my family is better now because of him . thank you dr zedek .	3928
0	the price quoted was not the final price ! the difference amounted to $ 50 above the quote , which was far more then i would have paid . in fact , i would not have had the work done if they had been honest in their original quote . when questioned , all staff said sorry , which while warranted did not rectify the situation of the misinformation and incorrect price quote . not acceptable , feel scammed . wont return and wo n't refer others .	1624
0	worst place i have ever been canceled appointment s set me up for tests i did n't need ! all i wanted was an iud 5th appt and hour wait and they lost my file so i could n't get it done ! connie us rude and has no bed side manner a week later i received a letter saying not to return to them ! never go there ! ! ! !	3059
1	had sort of a communication problem trying to schedule , but once i got an appointment i have no regrets . i have nerve pain in my feet and the sea salt massage is wonderful . i go there now after every work out . there are more luxurious places , but for the theraputic value i highly reccomend it .	463
0	i almost never write reviews , but i feel as if i have to . i ordered the cajun alfredo and it was horrible ! my food was like warm and there was waaayyyy too much sauce . there was no spice at all to the pasta , it actually tasted sweet . i could not eat even a quarter of it . i tried and tried , but it was horrible . that recipe needs to be taken off of the menu .	1380
1	always the best service and best tacos in town ! ! ! plus you can not beath the price anywhere ... i 've eaten at almost taco place in az and no taco compares	593
0	great pizza wait for it ... ... when your near broke or drunk or both . and it is open late on weekends , always a plus .	662
0	each person i spoke to gave me about 5 diff prices for my service . the employees speak in polite tones and appear to be chipper which is a total farce and extremely insulting considering the fact that you 're trying to rip me off because i 'm a woman . they tried their hardest to get $ 850 out of me for brake pads ( +rotors that they insisted were needed ) . the entire experience made me nauseous and i 'd rather have a root canal then go back there .	2040
0	unorganized , inconsistent and irregular product offers , and rude staff who do n't know where anything is . whoever 's managing this location is doing a bad job , worst walmart i 've ever visited .	3721
1	i 've been taking my cars for repair work here for the last year and a half . they are always friendly and honest . they 've always allowed me to come back and showed me the wear on parts prior to replacement . they are spot on on their quotes . i 've recommended them to co-workers and each of them has positive things to say about the level of service they get there .	2711
1	i love coming here . they have an incredible variety of coffees . i 'm a huge coffee snob . so , we like to try different types before we buy in bulk . they offer smaller bags with decent prices . not only that . but , the coconut oil is usually cheaper here then any place else . i love their lunch foods . easy to grab and go . if you have n't checked them out . i would give them a try . an awesome change from the big chain grocery stores .	495
1	leelee does a beautiful job with gel nails . last time they lasted over two weeks ! i have gone to kelys for about 4 years , i am always pleased with their services ! my daughter got a full set . they look fantastic !	2683
0	this the worse barber shop ever . barber dre straight disrespectful asf ! i set a appointment with dude at 4:45 he still cutting somebody hair on my so called appointment slot when i made it on time . next i 'm sitting there 20mins waiting until he finish no complaining just chilling two people walk in he take them like i 'm just invisible like i did n't schedule a appointment i wouldnt recommend this place to anyone its unprofessional ! !	3042
1	the wings are delicious , the drinks are priced right and the staff is friendly and fun . not to mention there are plenty of places to sit . if you do n't want to sit at the bar you can opt for a comfy booth . garth is the greatest .	86
1	this is a great place for korean food , i do n't know why they are n't more busy ! me and the wife usually go here whenever we 're craving some korean food . the service is usually really good and friendly , and the food is authentic and excellent . some of the bbq items can be a bit expensive though , and maybe there are better places to get that kind of thing . for everything else though , their prices and quality are solid .	1287
0	dinner took 45 min to arrive despite few customers in the restaurant . how long are you willing to wait ? staff kept saying it would be ready soon . will think twice before going there again .	205
0	well the place was not busy at all . when an older women asked for management a tweeker came out of the office . he could hardly stand up , and could n't stop fidgeting . there was poop all over the bathroom and the place smelled horribly . i do not suggest visiting this wash house .	2306
0	the owner is rude , obnoxious . the service is bad , and he ruined our cabinets when he fixed our dishwasher and the dishwasher leaked after he left .	1573
1	i love my bandeau bikini top from forever young . it fit perfectly ! the strapless option actually stays put too ! i have gotten a lot of compliments on it .	2661
0	if i could give zero stars i would . do not waste your time and money here . michelle failed to show twice for my appointments , and did not return my emails or calls . there are many better aestheticians in madison . save yourself from the flakiness of michelle .	750
1	placed a pick up order though i wish i ate on site ; the decor is warm and inviting . the chu chee was delicious ! if i am in town again i will definitely eat here and try more of the menu .	895
0	the girl at the front desk was rude and unprofessional ! we walked out and did n't get a haircut for my daughter . she had an attitude right when we walked in . will not be going back . first impression was terrible !	260
0	seemed to busy to respond promptly to messages . had to call both guys just to try and get appointment . seems like the concept of getting an itemized estimate , setting an apointment , and acting interested in my business is foreign to this company . excuses , lack of estimate appointment time and communication are standard procedure with competitors but not the case here . seemed like the attitude is you are supposed to hound and chase them for your business . definitely dropped the ball with me i 'll choose a competitor and pay more .	2773
0	i have to say this car wash has been the worst , every tine we go something is missed . we 've tried this place 3 times thinking maybe it will get better but it never has . car is not cleaned properly windows with spots and we had them vacuum our car again . you 're not suppose to baby sit people who should be doing their job .	127
0	i tried to make my daughter an appointment to see the pediatrician . i did n't even make it past the front office girls . they would n't accept us as patients because my daughter is n't able to have vaccinations due to an allergic reaction from them . i guess we will just find another pediatrician that is more understanding .	3570
0	horrible customer service from the cashier , angelika w , was very short , un enthusiastic , and made me feel like i was inconveniencing her . will not be coming to this location again , and recommend nobody else does as well .	1315
0	first and las time here . we found an entire piece of a glove in the hash , we all know they cook all the vegetables together , but we only got a refound for the plate with the problem , so the rest at the table had to eat the exact same , which means we did n't eat at all . service was also terrible , we had to get a chair ourselves cause they did n't let us take one from another empty table . so disappointed , upset and stilll hungry !	308
0	get my espresso cold after i was waiting for it 28 min ! ! ! ? ! told the lady that her name is johanna and she told me : sorry but that 's what you order ! are you kidding me ? ! ? ! ? ? ! ? who in the whole world will order a cold espresso.she was so rude and she did n't even care because she had to take care of another 1000 from the convention ! ! ! you are not a customer for this place you are a $ 5 bill !	2397
0	the only reason this company is still in business is that the home warranty company makes you use them . my service guy was the rudest person i have ever met . i did n't get his name because he did n't talk ... at all ! ! ! i 'm still shaken my head saying. `` what just happened `` . i would n't ever use them again .	3885
0	if you enjoy waiting , to have your plasma drawn , then this is your place . staff in bay 1 unable to track people , they enjoy talking about people , and seem pissed that your there .	1974
0	nous nous y sommes arrêtés pour le brunch le we passé . bilan : sans plus . les assiettes sont correctes mais la qualité laisse à voir : le jambon braisé goutait l'eau , la salade n'était pas fraiche , les oeufs pochés étaient franchement pas bons . en revanche les pancakes étaient bons ainsi que le pain perdu .	628
1	great local water delivery company offering fair prices and great quality water . no contracts with this company , just a service agreement that you will take at least 1 bottle per month . they offer alkaline , spring and purified water . 5 gallon , 3 gallon , 1/2 gallon & 1/2 liter . they deliver every 2 weeks and rent coolers super cheap !	2519
1	we ordered pick up and it was a flawless experience . easy order , fast , and most of all amazing food !	131
0	this location i am currently sitting in is super super hot ! it 's nicer outside then it is inside ! personal opinion this is crazy ! it 's unbearable to even sit . not coming here again .	1315
1	i am constantly amazed at how some people live without starbucks . i need it . i must have it . until it 's a life or death situation it will always be starbucks .	2778
1	we had a great experience w/ olson iron . our 2x8 feet custom security doors look fantastic ! the office staff was super helpful especially in the initial stages of scheduling a day for the installation . angel was professional and ended up giving me a great deal along with a faster timeline than what others have quoted us . the entire installation happened within 2 weeks as promised with no hiccups either and within the budget . the installers did an excellent job . i love how the colors match the dark green color of my front door just like i wanted . they did a great job at understanding my needs and giving it to me .	3506
1	amazing staff , love the services and wellness options , my favorite is the hydration facial	2672
0	store is currently under renovation . call before spending $ 50 in cab fees . disappointed .	357
0	very disorganized and slow . cute idea , but the service needs work .	953
1	dr. berelowitz is an amazing doctor . he takes his time and cares about his patients . he literally saved my life 35 years ago . i thank god for him every day . he is in high demand because of his quality of care , so , yes , his waiting room is always full . he is highly respected in the community . i personally have never had a more caring and concerned doctor . i do n't know if he is accepting new patients , but , if he is , consider yourself lucky . you can not go wrong with dr. b .	2143
0	they place adds on craig 's list and list their cars for low amounts like 1500 dollars when in reality they want a down payment for that much and the vehicle will be 7000 dollars . terrible bait and switch .	3518
0	worst experience in a while ! walked in to employees arguing amongst themselves and ignoring the guests at the register . once she decided to help me i had to repeat my order twice while being interrupted by the constant arguing about the side work . the crew was not wearing hats , they were using cell phones on the front and were unapologetic about the poor service provided . will not visit this location and continue going to the rainbow and flamingo one ; at least there are respectful there . no manager seen or perhaps she was part of the motley crew !	1214
1	great customer service and love to see smiling faces every time i go in .	3056
0	deserve zero stars . stay away ! ! ! when i tried to get the car i reserved ; first , the sloppily dressed guy said they were going to put a $ 350 hold from my account ; then , he said that they could not rent me the car because i wanted to use a debit card . guy was very rude . at least alamo next door had cars and did accept the debit card as long as i showed my return flight information . and no ridiculous `` hold '' on my funds . payless rental car = worthless rental car	3595
1	andrea & larry made a crazy day more relaxed - my daughter ( 24hrs before ) wedding tells me she forgot to have her vail and grooms pants and shirt pressed ... they were amazing ! ! they made sure it was done and it was and was done great ! thank you : )	3075
0	save your money ! talk about a shady business . the owners continually write the teachers bad checks . i guess i think people need to know this . i know a few really great teachers who left because of this . i stopped attending classes here on principle . the owners are super shady	908
0	the food was good but the portions were very small . it was extremely overpriced for the amount of food that we got .	563
0	i stopped by target this afternoon to purchase boots for the winter we 'll never actually found what i was looking for because they never did have men 's shoes not even snow boots . but the one thing that i did not like was when a customer ask for salt to be put down outside because of ice how nothing was done .	1815
1	not sure why this hotel received such poor reviews but our stay was fine . pool was clear and hot tub was warm though not a lot of strong jets . breakfast was fine for a free breakfast , waffles , boiled eggs , link sausage , pastries , biscuits and gravy , cereal , juice and coffee . room was clean , sheets crisp , pillows and bed ok. staff was friendly . housekeeping was good . we have pets so they would do our room early so we did n't have to leave our cats looked in their kennel all day . would stay here again with no problems .	1335
1	what ! ? ! ? ? ! a jimmy johns on my street.. here in sunny arizona ! ? ! finally a sub shop that i can eat at again . love this place , its a staple in my diet . motha fuckin beach club , no cuc 's , add hot peppers , on whole wheat . yeah !	1475
1	above & beyond what i was expecting ! there are sooooo many choices and options of food-styles-cuisines ! they have pretty much everything imaginable - from sushi made in front of you to chinese low-main to pizza & chicken fingers . they have salads and dessert buffet bars - literally everything . & the lunch special is super cheap too ! best tip about this place : it 's ginormous , so there is never a wait !	1302
1	get your hoisin sauce here . cheap veggies from questionable sources just like every other asian market . glad they 're nearby as i am into creating a variety of asian cuisine and need these odds and ends . hope they stay .	3269
0	find another low cost solution for tattoo removal . this place just takes your money and does little in order to hook you into buying more treatments . do not be fooled . i had a small homemade tattoo over 15 years old that should have be gone after 3 or 4 treatments . after treatment 6 is has barely faded . and oh btw ... i followed their treatment plan of ice , water , no sun . this place is a rip off . you can go to one of the schools in the valley for better results at a lower cost .	366
1	brought my family here when they visited me from overseas as they were disappointed with the fish from grocery store . we bought a whole lot of fishies from here and they were very fresh and tasted amazing . the store owner told us they get fresh caught fish 4 times a week . the prices were much more reasonable than any other store i have been to . i have been in charlotte for 4 years and dont know how i have never been to this place .	3310
0	horrible place for a burger . the patty looked so rare and undercooked it looked like the cow was still alive . the bun , which the restaurant is known for , was nasty , soggy and looked like someone peed on it . and , the price was outrageous . they only accepted cash , which was fine , but did n't tell us until after we ordered that there was an 8 dollar fee to use us dollars . this restaurant sucks ... never coming back	940
0	i am staying at the oasis rv park in las vegas . their internet is terrible . i would never let lv.net on my property . it 's not that their service is completely slow . it 's that their login process is difficult across multiple devices . you could never get back to the page for agreeing with their terms and you never know if you 're really login or not . overall the customer experience is bad .	3459
0	dirty , hot , rides and games not working or anyone to run it . food is awful . i would n't do another birthday party there .	3791
0	holy sh @ t. no a/c at this store . a lady at the store told me it 's always like that deuces i 'm ran out . never going back ! ! !	128
0	the worst pastries i 've ever had . got a dozen cupcakes for a party and the actual cake part tasted like fish oil . they cookies i got spoiled in less than two hours and turned from double chocolate chip to green . i went back for a refund and they actually charged me again instead of refunding me . i had to go back and have the owner double refund me .	2507
0	aptive in pittsburgh , pa . please avoid these people as it 's a door to door scam . the salesman convinced me to sign up at a $ 69 application price and three more applications in the year . when the service tech sprays the property he said there is a total of five applications at $ 116 each . after the first application i still have bees and their policy of returning is to charge another application fee of $ 116 ... no free return service . i tried to get out of this contract but the local office in pittsburgh wants $ 160 fee to get out of the contract . and yes i still have ground bees ! ! !	2351
0	this place is filthy . there are foot prints on the floors and everything is sticky and covered in old froyo . the froyo is tasty and decent variety of toppings but i think the employees would rather just hang in back than clean during down time : (	885
1	i was there for my interview at case medical center . the lobby was very stylish and the staffs were friendly . the room was spectacular with very nice decoration and walk-in shower . i will definitely come back again ! !	3346
1	the doctors and nurses here were wonderful treating my daughter with kindness during a scary decision to remove both of her big toenails due to chronic ingrowns . we appreciated their expertise and recommend them for treatments . thank you .	974
0	back after walking out without being seen 10 days ago after waiting for 2 hours past my appointment time for a follow up on an mri . waited another 45 minutes past my appointment time today for this same follow up , and i am so frustrated with this place ! ! ! i scheduled for 8:45am hoping they would not already be so far behind - no luck ! think i am looking for a new office ! ! ! ridiculous ! ! !	1562
1	i have been going here for a long time blanca is the best she knows how to color style and cut ma hair beautifully they also have great customer service since yuh walk in the door jesus has also done ma boyfriends hair nd he does an amazing job i really recommend this place..	3873
0	this is the most insensitive business i have encountered . we had a family member pass away that had a loan with this company . i did a courtesy call to them to notify them of the death and got the owner christine . i tried to find out what the options were but she said she did n't had time to discuss this with me and look it up on the web . we got in a little argument and she ended up saying `` have a nice life '' and hung up on me . do n't ever do business with such evil people who prey on people desperate for money . they do n't even deserve one star .	3404
0	this place is n't so good ! just drive past this place and go to another ! it 's not clean and the people are rude . the lady named katie did poor on my nails . i got them done 2 days ago and i already have the little air bubbles under my acrylic nails and she did n't cover the whole nail ! there are spots missing ! not worth the 45 bucks i paid ! this place is a nightmare !	3332
0	food is just ok , my favorite was the hibachi grill , you could pick and choose was want to grill . lot of fried selections if you 're watching your weight stick to hibachi at least . the selection were too over cooked and greasy like the fried shrimp , salmon and ribs . did n't really have my favorite chooses of sushi but they did have that yummy pink shrimp sauce . i did try the hot wings and grilled chicken both were great . nice and clean but of course new in the area . not that excited been to way better chinese restaurants than this . enjoy	1302
0	horrible . we walked in looking for a place to possibly do repetitive business for some marketing that i need to do in the area . received a lukewarm hello from an employee who then stood there and picked his teeth with his fingers . disgusting ! not only did i walked out and will never go back , but this bakery lost what could have been a lucrative client .	868
0	i tried to make an appointment for my son 's first haircut . the lady on the phone was rude ! they are out of certificates , so she told me i would have to come back a 2nd time to complete the package i was going to pay for . i asked if they could just mail it to me . nope . ty but i believe in good customer service and will take my son and money else where !	260
0	do n't come here ! ! ! my daughter got fast braces paid over 2000 but at the end of her treatment , her teeth are not straight at all ! ! ! she has to pay again to get normal braces from another orthodontic ! we are not happy with the results i would not recommend this dentist for braces ! if they had any dignity they would return the money back . extremely dissatisfied customer	1505
1	i ca n't believe that 's have such a great time here . great costumer service and great ambiance great food and good music ryan was on paint on the service . and . i will do recommend this place to all of my best friend @ 809life . follow and where love .	1332
0	good friendly staff . but the food is very salty and just is n't good . i could n't even finish my pad thai . the soup was also too salty for my liking .	1252
0	this place is horrible . they made me sign a bunch of paperwork right off the bat while i was still intoxicated . completely not legal . i plan on suing them asap . please do not go here !	2809
0	this is the first starbucks that i 've been to where everything was just weirdly meh . the milk for my latte was steamed wrong so it was flat . no air in it , no foamy head , just hot . plus the breakfast sandwich came flying out of the bag and onto my car seat b/c the bag was already broken when i got the food . um . meh . not the best or even average starbucks around	2950
1	this is such a fun and up beat bowling alley . if you are looking for a high energy quality lane , this is your place . great staff and good food and drink specials ! i recommend to any one ! ! !	3296
1	they worked on two of my dive watches and tested them . the cost was so reasonable compared to most others , including the company that made my watches . they are friendly and very helpful . they also repair many old clocks and have a great selection of clocks from great grandfather units to mantel . what a really great find and they are reasonable . i will be back for all my watch and clock needs .	2307
0	the miso soup and braised pork are very salty . and the menu does n't say the tataki de thon and the pork are spicy .	1582
0	orders always wrong , fresh donuts but inedible unless you have a bib bc they throw them in a bag all half as*ed and the icing is more on the bag vs on the donut , long wait times . i was excited to have them open in this location but the service is just poor .	1774
0	the pizza tonight was nasty as hell the service was terrible in rude the pizza was n't done and they tried to tell me was double cheese on both sides and it was n't anywho the pizza tasted like total crap when is usually good i guess it 's who makes it	192
0	trying all day to schedule surgery for melanoma . the phone system rings and rings , and finally disconnects . we love dr. rubenzik , but this is not the first time we have been let down by the administrative part of the practice .	2099
1	this embassy suites is like most , but the outside front porch is more like a country home with swings and rockers . great quiet location near the pittsburgh airport . great staff and free breakfast with custom omelets .	2296
0	poor selection and definitely overpriced for used records . better off going to a real record store . for example one of the records had a sticker from when the person before bought it for 2 $ and now they want 8 $ for it . just ridiculous . to make matters even more annoying some person named hammond signed every record and said when they purchased it originally , on every sleeve and every pressing . really makes you mad when you 're a collector . trust me this place is just no bueno .	2294
1	was excited to try this place for a while , and i was pleasantly surprised . i had a taco salad , husband had a burrito and kids had a quesadilla . yes , you have to buy the chips and salsa as someone else stated , but i do not know why this would be a problem ? ? every restaurant i have been to , you have to buy the appetizer ( they are only $ 2.50 ) . our food was excellent and our service was fast ! we were in and out in less than 45 minutes . we will definitely return !	1330
1	i like to shop at belk when i need to do some walking . when this happens , i am more apt to locate special finds that i was not looking for . this is the only way for me to shop at belk . if i am looking for something specific , i wo n't find it . i shop primarily on weekday nights because there is no crowding . in addition , the clothing are on the hooks rather than piled up in the dressing rooms . shop at your leisure to find the best bargains that you ca n't live without !	2910
0	i festival dedicated to ostriches and only two ostriches , really ? this was a typical fair . over crowded with middle and high schooler 's , people bumping into you , long ass lines and breathing in dirt . why anyone would think this would be fun is beyond me .	759
0	update ( 5/15/18 ) - i figured i 'd give the place a second chance so i went on 5/2/18 and it was closed with a sign saying they would reopen on 5/5 ( cinco de mayo ) . so i went by for lunch today and now there 's a sign saying their liquor license was suspended and closed until further notice . now the owner also recently opened another location right up the road ( wild margarita 2 ) which seems odd seeing that the first location has never been fully opened .	651
0	we went to get air specifically because we were told/it was confirmed that there was toddler time on a certain day and time this week . that was the only reason we went because when we went before it was difficult to keep my 2 year old safe due to the bigger kids . when she showed up there were 9-12 year olds everywhere . their explanation was simply that the owner changed his mind . to me that is completely insane and perhaps if you are going to cancel what you are advertising , let people know .	1095
1	as a bar / experience - 4 stars food - 3.5 stars i passed this place for years and never tried it . finally went in and enjoyed my experience . highlights : - good beer selection on tap . i proceed to have 3 pints of hoegarden - service was amazing . they are quick , check to make sure you have what you need - nacho appetizer was really good - great patio - front and back - sporting events on tv - `` local pub '' feel . i just felt comfortable here - good club sandwich - fries are good on the downside : - my friend had the burger - not the greatest i will be back for sure .	1037
0	feeling pretty bummed tonight . came in with friends and family to find that they completely changed the menu again . our house favorites are gone , average entree price went up about $ 10 . we grabbed some drinks and got great service , but went somewhere else for food . this is probably our last visit here .	1529
0	you buy furniture along with a warranty plan and when you call the warranty people they tell you `` too bad so sad ' do yourself a favor buy from somewhere else ! someone from mor reached out said they wanted to call me and discuss our issue that was over a week ago ... . crickets , crickets they just do not care	1640
0	i 'm pretty certain i just paid $ 8 for a hot dog that 's been on the rotisserie since yesterday .	259
1	the most noticeable things in this restaurant are : 1 ) the strange straw roof over the bar/cashier that brushes against your head if you 're tall 2 ) the chefs in the back talking very loudly in cantonese in the kitchen the staff here were very polite when i went . the lunch specials are priced very well at $ 7.95 including rice , soup , spring roll and fortune cookie . the food was good . the wonton soup was satisfying but only had 2 wontons . the rice was fresh and the meat was not soggy with minimal amount of breading . i would come here again . they have no wifi .	649
1	wonderful meal at luckee . the food was delicious . flavours were outstanding . the waiter could have cautioned when he recommended 3-5 dishes for 2 to stagger them . instead we received everything at once which was overwhelming and crowded ! most waiters with experience especially in a plate sharing atmosphere would take the liberty of staggering the dishes ... .	1441
1	we 've been to this office twice now , once to reveal the gender of our little one and another time to see his face and everything in 3d ! the wait times were very manageable , probably about 5-10 minutes past appointment time which is actually great compared to other offices . they lost a star for me due to the unprofessional phone skills their front staff have and how they 're not very friendly when you enter their office . the ultrasound tech was great so complaints there but the front desk could use some training on how to smile !	3313
1	great salon ! the stylists keep up with all the latest trends and can match whatever look you are going for . they give quality service and the salon has a great atmosphere . i would highly recommend sarah . the cost may be more pricey than other salons but it is definitely worth it !	2142
0	i have been calling for three days all i get is answering machine . pathetic service . if they can be bothered to answer , i do n't want their service .	354
0	pros : they have a very good selection of seeds , fertilizers , and supplies . cons : the staff are almost always rude , usually not helpful , and often ca n't be found to ask for help because that are all chatting together around the registers . there are numerous better options in the madison area .	3612
0	texas roadhouse used to be really good , but the quality of meat they use now is not good . go to a different steak place , really . pretty disappointed because i used to love this place growing up as a kid .	1491
1	this place is a must try for anyone that enjoys smoothies period , vegan or not . their products are simply healthy and delicious ! the service was great service , all employees are proud of the product that they sell . it was so good , we ordered another one before leaving . keep up the great work guys ! definitely recommend it , tried the original , chocolate and strawberry one , equally as delicious .	1134
1	nice ambiance . you can tell they take pride in their place . not used to barbershops with interior decorating . no appointment so a slight wait which is expected . we are from out of town and did n't have time to get child 's hair cut before we left . nice even cut and son said it did n't hurt ( he 's always scared of the clippers ) . only weird thing is it smells like eggs ? maybe they use sulfur or something in the hair products ? ?	3469
1	this evening checking in to the sheraton cresant hotel we were assisted by a gentleman named jon . jon was professional , friendly atentative to our personal situation and explained the details of our reservation in a clear and easy dialogue . he went up and beyond the call of duty . highly recommend the location	3166
0	i was taken to this place as a `` surprise '' and we were both excited to try their sushi . we soon realized that their sushi is worse than single-dollar-sign sushi , and this is a 3-dollar-sign place . the salmon and tuna pieces on their rainbow roll were dry on the top and had a couple hard edges ( from being dried up ? ) . the tuna pieces also had a very stinky fish taste . i had to go to the restroom to spit it out . huge regret for not ordering their cooked entres , which might have been better based on the buttered escargot appetizer we had .	487
1	came here from boston for a weekend getaway and really needed a relaxer after a long weekend out and about . they were very professional and gave amazing massages .	2399
1	i 've been looking forward to the vr experience since i heard about this attraction coming to mgm . finally went to the vr experience for a team outing tonight and i must say , although the experience was trippy but it sure did not disappoint . i deducted a star because the arena needs better ventilation inside as it gets super hot and stuffy when you 're running around shooting zombies or whatever game you choose . other than that , this is definitely a good team bonding event . we had such a blast !	2494
1	whoop , whoop ! ! ! ! a place around here for older people with great music ( journey , eagles , just request what you want with a tiand they will play it ) still a lot of collage kids but nothing like the other places around here . i love dueling piano bars so fun reminds me of vegas i will say it is chilly it 's a basement place ware a jacket .	1176
1	$ 4.99 two slice + drink ! ! ! so worth it . this is a very hidden gem , located off highway 73 . well worth the trip . this pizza is reminiscent of my days back in nyc . just terrific pizza .	1521
0	my kids and i were not impressed with the food or drinks at all . the pumpkin waffle was way too sweet a d the thai boba did n't even taste like one . my daughter did n't like the taste of her m & m waffle . i wasted my money but the cashier was friendly .	580
1	ask for your frappes to be twice blended ! eliminates ice chips : ) drive thru ! friendly service here ! love the passion ice tea-which they sell to brew yourself at home . kiddos love green tea fraps and cake pops !	2242
0	we had the restaurant week special ... .beef tenderloin risotto . this was nothing more than risotto with gravy . there were no beef pieces in the meal . ... ..second trip to bonfyre with a real bad experience . we will not be back .	951
0	drew the manager was very rude and short when i was asking for help he did n't even let me finish what i was saying . very unfortunate professional for a management position if that . at least have some respect and customer service mentallity . very unfortunate organized and confused at their own job ! do not waste your time here	1692
0	i found a coupon on groupon because i needed my apartment cleaned . i 've got a bad hip and back and could n't take trash downstairs to the dumpster , and it needed general cleaning . i come home after the `` cleaning '' to find that a lot of the trash that i had bagged up for them to take was still in the apartment and they had broken a ceiling fan and left my freezer door open , with a pool of water on the kitchen floor and over $ 100 of frozen food destroyed . i e-mailed them for a refund and have not heard back . to say i 'm disappointed and livid is a huge understatement .	897
1	i got turned on to jersey mike 's subs on a business trip , so i was pleasantly surprised to see one close to me in phoenix . i love the sandwiches they make and love that i can see them slice the meat and cheese in front of me . but what makes this store great is the staff . they are always friendly , they remember how i like my sub made and they seem to truly like their jobs . i was in the store once when they were training new employees and i was impressed on how much they stressed cleanliness , personal appearance and customer service .	1528
1	i had a great time at express mie studio ! the instructor was excellent and the atmosphere was fun . i ca n't wait to go back and take more classes !	2394
1	i work right in the building next door , so this place is my go-to lunch spot . they have a great outdoor patio , good food with large portions , and reasonable service . i 've tried the following : 1 ) pastrami sandwich - great choice , especially yummy since it is grilled with cheese melted over pastrami ! 2 ) walnut and chicken salad - fresh and tasty , though there was a lot of feta cheese pieces on it . only complaint would be that service can be slow , especially around lunch .	820
0	i do n't think that i 've had a worse experience at a restaurant . the staff was far more interested in gathering around each other to chat than helping any of the guests . the bartender is definitely in the wrong business . texting was more important to her than the patrons . to top it off the place is infested with fruit flys . we definitely will not go back there .	951
1	this place is fantastic , and the best deal in the area . the atmosphere is very cozy , and the shop is very clean . the prices are the best in the area , and both my and my moms nails turned out great ! i definitely recommend sammy , and brittany .	3338
0	marriott should really reconsider letting this hotel be branded under their name . laughable that they consider this a 3 start hotel . dirty , old , and in a bad area . never again .	230
1	love the pure chocolate ice blended drink ! i can finally enjoy a none caffeine drink at a coffee shop . whenever i was invited to a coffee shop i would always get a water but now i can order this drink . they will make pretty much any of the ice blendeds with no caffeine in it called `` pure '' . thanks coffee bean !	2118
0	tried the lavender hot chocolate . it was okay . no overwhelming lavender taste . the ambience is cute . and oh ... ... .they do not do brunch anymore . june 30 , 2017 i had the cappucino and the blueberry bread . both are expensive but the blueberry loaf was really flavourful . i tasted the pistachio as well but found blueberry better .	207
1	good pizza in a hotel full of awful food . ( exceptions to strip house and burgr ) owner ( joe ) great guy and comped me a slice just for being polite . and theyre open late night !	1371
0	this company is a huge joke . the salesman are arrogant and will harass you . specially michael lawler . within several minutes he called sent several text messages and proceeded . i had to block the number . i called to speak with the owner only to find more attitude from other employees . this business is the worst . save your time by going somewhere else .	624
0	had made a last minute appointment to get a hair cut and sadly should 've known better . the salon was empty except for myself and another client which should 've told me something but as i was in need of a quick trim , i figured why not give this place a try . the girl who cut my hair barely acknowledged what i had asked for and gave me uneven ends and layers on only half of my head . the next day , i headed to my usual place that was out of the ways just so she could fix the mess i was left with . very disappointing .	333
1	shamika ! ! ! ! yaaaas ! amazing color correction done right . beautiful results and a client for life gained ! thank you for correcting my bad decision coloring from another salon . go book with her ... you will not be disappointed .	2577
0	horrible , horrible , horrible , horrible , horrible , horrible , horrible , horrible , horrible ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! when picking up the reserved prepaid rental car takes longer than your flight not good . actually horrible . 2 hours to get a cheap car . only good thing was the guy who helped us ( joe ) was nice .	2134
1	im sort of amazed at how many 1 and 2 star reviews this place has . i have been here multiple times and have not had any problems with the service or the food . the wait staff has always been very friendly with us when we go and the ambiance is really laid back . i always order the same thing when i go . the pear and arugula pizza ( i know it sounds weird but its soooo good ) and the salted caramel pudding . every time it has been just as good as the last and the pricing is not bad if you do n't order alcohol . for 2 people ordering a pizza with desert and ice teas cost $ 28 .	1116
0	no clue how this place is rated 4.5 stars . hair in my pho . awkward staff that watch you eat . can i please just enjoy my food in peace please ? colleagues ordered panang curry which was mediocre . definitely wo n't go back and stunned by the reviews .	1203
1	i actually had a great experience with furniture creations . i ordered 3 pieces of furniture on christmas eve for 1/2 the price i could have gotten them here in ny . additionally , the shipping was free . the pieces arrived yesterday in perfect shape and exactly what i expected . i did make sure that i had someone in my building waiting to unload and then put it together for me . however , the driver did offer to do it which i thought was nice . i feel very pleased with the company and i highly recommend it .	3854
1	if you 're looking for a place that 's actually cool in vegas go here ! it 's a small place with a good , diverse crowd . some of the folks are local . the piano player is adorable and the bartenders sing . great times !	3326
1	have been a few times just to grab a sweet tea for under $ 1 . this time i decided i would try the chicken . got the 4 piece tenders with roll and gravy . the line took forever because of being short staffed and someone ordered enough chicken to feed a small army in front of me . the tenders are big , the chicken was juicy and the breading was good and crispy . i think they just came out if the fryer ! the gravy is great for dipping and the little season packs are tasty on the tender . the roll was nice and soft . i will definitely go back to try some sides and actual pieces of chicken .	862
0	i called in for membership information and all the kid kept on saying if `` we can give you information over the phone , management has instructed us to have membership conversation over the phone '' are you *^ & ing kidding ! ! ! . wake up ! ! ! like i really want to spend an hour onsite going over membership . stupid policy . i was a member for 3 yr as i live 3 miles away from the gym , but i did n't review after i saw how unprofessional the staff was . guess the owner should go back to st. louis and refresh on customer service !	2919
1	i 've been a patient at this office for several years now & i 've received nothing but friendly prompt service every time . from the front desk , to the doctors assistant , they have me in & out within 30 mins & on with my day . dr. mancuso always makes sure i 'm aware of all options pertaining to my eye issues but is never pushy . i will continue to be a loyal patient .	2126
1	i 've never had the beer half but the burger half is scrumtrulecent ! the donut burger will probably give me diabetes the next time i have it but i 'm willing to take the risk .	496
1	rc willey is our go to place . i have bought everything here from a sofa to a water heater . the staff is always professional and they have handled every issue i have ever had to my satisfaction .	439
0	i did n't go , for tires , but turn out they told me that my tires were old , even thou , they were only about two years old . i agreed to replace them , because , eventually i would have to . when i checked online about the tires , the same type and brand were about twenty dollars cheaper , per tire , on other places , nearby . of course , i wo n't return there anymore . i should have know better .	599
1	dr. chow and her office team provided excellent customer service during my most recent visit . i appreciate the attention to detail with all aspects of the visit . i definitely recommend for all those in need of eye care that you go to this office .	962
0	will never go back there again ! all they care about is how to suck more money from you . selling vaccines and shots . terrible .	1700
1	every time i 'm in mississauga i stop by oceans . they have a great selection of fruits & vegetables , baked goods , and hot foods . my favourite things to buy is the sushi and breads . i usually pick up a volcano roll , which is really cheap compared to other grocery stores , and their pork floss bun . trust me , it 's much better then it sounds ; ) selection of foods here are great , and lost items such as produce and hot foods are at a fair price . overall this is one of my favourite asian grocery stores in mississauga , and ill definitely be coming here for many years to come !	2069
1	my parent 's love this place and now , so do i . it is new york style pizza ( thinner crust and longer slices ) very much like we got back home in ny . dont let their prices deceive you as it is pretty good !	1399
1	i really like dr shadmany and the staff is all very nice ! was taken on time , which is always a plus	558
1	these guys always treat me with respect and honesty . i 'm not a car guy myself and feel like i could be lied to pretty easily when it comes to car problems . however , i have 100 % confidence that i am treated with respect and treated fairly here . austin , the store manager , knows me by name and is a very customer oriented manager . i recommend this place .	565
1	tucked away from the strip , its very easy to miss . movie theater is old and kind of creepy , but it serves its purpose . went to watch a movie as we wanted to pass time before our evening flight . wish the seats were comfortable though .	2061
0	do n't take your car here . they gave us the run around in terms of time . very unorganized . there are far better local businesses to support .	3185
1	check-in quick & staff very friendly . free wifi , lobby clean and very welcoming . i 'm a bit of a germaphobe , so i asked for sanitizing cleaner & towels to disinfect surfaces in my room , they did n't look @ me in any weird way . got to my room , did my inspection & was impressed . super clean , absolutely no dust anywhere . fantastic view of the pool & jacuzzi . the beds here are incredible ! ! like sleeping on clouds . : ) zero noise and room service was also great . all in all , this place exceeded my expectations in every way possible ! ! will be staying here whenever on business in mesa .	230
1	very delicious food ! very flavorful and plentiful portions ! very close to unlv ! convenient spot for lunch and inexpensive !	1361
1	a great place for all kind of events . cultural , food , cinema , sporting , holidays etc . always a cool place to chill even when nothing is going on . whatchu waiting for ? do n't be square , head to dundas square haha !	1012
0	i got an oil change and they were suppose to detail my car . when i got my car back it still was dirty and they did not do what they said they would . i have pictures they left all the black dirt on the side of my car . i was told by the guy who signed me up they would take care of the marks on the side of my car . i had to clean my car again after i left . i got the marks off myself , as for the oil change which is included in this amount . i was to pay 19.99 and they charged me 39.99 i am disputing this charge with my credit card as well .	988
1	love that scottsdale now has a wine tasting room and the wines are great ! i was a huge fan of the red blend and petite sirah . afterward we went out to dinner just a block away , such a great location for a rating room .	3165
0	got a gel manicure and pedicure . the staff was n't especially polite , did not push my cuticles back at all , left halfway through my manicure to fix someone else 's nails , and charged way more than i have previously paid for the same services . i did it 6 days ago and my gel manicure came off half of my nails .	3213
0	pizza was good and i enjoyed the flavor of the wings however they are tiny . two wings would be considered one whole normal size wing imo . i would order the pizza again if i was in the area but not the wings because i feel like they 're ripping you off	773
1	consistently good , competent , courteous service at this location on multiple visits . like all verizon stores it can get crowded so there can be wait times , but i 've never found it excessive given the number of customers waiting to be served , and sometimes there 's just no line at all . my compliments .	3037
1	great service and very knowledgeable about there craft . always professional , kind and friendly .	1635
1	i have been to this place many times but my last visit my mani pedi was n't good . this was my first time having shellac it stayed on for a few days and then peeled off . they must dilute the shellac cause from what i hear this is n't normal . while i do like the facial and massage i will go else where for the mani pedi if the quality remains the same .	3559
0	food was ok but the staff was rude . i called a day earlier to check if they 'll accept a gift certificate that i had . the person on call checked with someone and confirmed that they will , but they flat-out refused to accept it the next day ! and to top it , they were rude . would never be back there . if you call the restaurant , take down the name of the person you talk to , else they 'll just deny that you called them .	600
0	ordered basic cheeseburger today and added a fried egg . the sunny side up egg arrived on my burger still `` jiggly '' with translucent white areas . it looked very unappetizing so i scrapped it off and ate the rest of the mediocre burger . the fries were only mediocre as well . nothing spectacular at all about my lunch today with the exception of the waitress who was on point . this place should be full at lunch ... i think the food is the reason why there 's no wait : - (	178
0	had new wheels and tires installed and within 3 weeks it fell off while driving ! luckily no one was injured . but they will not take responsibility ! beware beware ! !	2960
0	first stay at this location while traveling on business . areas of the building ( both exterior and interior ) appear rundown and in need of a cosmetic makeover . the area that it is located in is another issue . the nightly rate for a stay here is just too much ! ! they do not include breakfast like most hotels that typically charge this rate . they also do not provide daily housekeeping which would be nice . if this is a cost-cutting thing , then they should not charge the rates that they do . bottom line , i will not be staying here again .	3480
0	i want to recommend this place but ... .twice my food smelled terrible and spoiled . i 've had good food from here in the past but recently there was a hair in my rice . look and smell your food carefully before you eat it . they season it a lot maybe to cover up the spoilage . the owner should buy fresh food and check his food carefully .	1312
1	love this starbucks location ! they 're so incredibly friendly and personable , they even remember our order ! extremely pleased every time we go here . : )	1309
0	this store really lacks selection . we went to the suit department , the selection was really no larger than a closet , when i asked for my size , they did n't even have it or i actually looked for it , there was no salesman around in the department . when asked about another department in another part of the store , a salesperson gave us the wrong directions .	223
0	very bad restaurant , impolite employees , it was a really bad and disgusting experience	1371
0	i called yesterday with an order of 5 dozen donuts and 2 boxes o joe for 5:30 this morning . when i got there at 5:42 it was n't ready yet . i left at 5:57 . good thing i had built in an extra 30 minutes or i would 've been late for the meeting in which the donuts were for .	1761
0	went to him for a broken nose . after seeing me and not looking in my nose , he gave me a $ 500 bottle of flonase nasal spray . i remember him telling me that my nose was `` very impressive . '' then he told me to come back next week to see his partner , because that was the doctor i needed to see . crooks come in all shapes and sizes .	1149
0	worst einsteins ever . i i could give zero stars i would . they never have bagels and the staff is always so rude . it 's amazing to me ... . i always love einsteins , but this one is a different breed . something needs to be done about his store asap .	477
1	absolutely loved this place ! we have been back three times now and every time the food and service have been excellent ! i like that you can pick how much heat you want in each dish and the freshness of the food . the sauces are off the charts good - that garlic non-bread is heavenly and you have to have it ! we have tried chicken and lamb chicken masala the lamb vindaloo and about for other dishes in the samosas which are off the chart good too ! i just recommended marigold to two more of my friends today !	640
1	just signed up for a 10 month vip unlimited tanning package . its only $ 25 a month ! i used to come here all the time and now that i 'm back on this side of town i 'm excited to start tanning here again . raina at the front desk is a total sweetheart and very knowledgeable . this location is always clean and i 've never had to wait for a bed . this location has the hydrating bed and i ca n't wait to try it out ! i used the highest level bed today and i already have a tan line from my ring . i highly recommend this tanning salon for the summerlin area .	2792
0	i 'm only giving two stars because the champagne was great . walking in , my friend and i immediately received attitude from one of the servers ( african american . starts with an s ) . i will not return . 7/27/18	1400
1	spring is always a good time for a sale at jc penney 's and while i was searching for some dress shirts & ties i found they were having a 75 % offsale . everything was $ 4.97 ! ! i found 8 very stylish van huesen dress shirts size 18 1/2 & 19 and 6 very nice van huesen ties . 2 arm loads worth of clothes . when she got done ringing me up the damage was $ 75 ! ! ! my receipt said i had saved $ 350 ! ! ! ! an entirely new work wardrobe for under $ 100 i love this -- -jc penney 's ! !	1536
0	garbage . i am never going to recommend this company to anyone . i got swindled for $ 800 during the middle of summer with a 2 year old and my wife sweating our asses off they took the opportunity to suggest work that would work but would financially obligate us to work with them . which i did n't . i overheard one of the techs at my house on the phone with his supervisor commenting on how we have n't payed all we owed and that he needs to stop working till be commit to a new unit . i 'm done . save yourself some time and money and hire someone else .	2203
1	great service with the new ownership . definitely a family-run establishments . nothing fancy here , just some good basic meals at a fair price . the burgers & minced bbq sandwiches are large and tasty . it gets crowded around lunch time with sheriff & police officers along with ems and firefighters coming for lunch . a recommendation .	1212
1	one of the best burgers i 've ever had and very well priced . i got the tortilla burger and is was delicious especially with there tortilla soup !	1367
1	the home depot where i bought my carpet contracted this company to install . the installer did a great job . it 's been 6months and my carpets have not needed restreaching . the carpet is tucked really nice & tight and i can never see the any seams . the installer also cleaned up all the fibers as well . great job !	1379
0	leslie zak is pure evil . i understand not sugar coating things , no . this woman is evil . she says rude remarks throughout your entire visit and is rough ! a rough gyno is a no go lol . she got mad at me for not answering her questions quickly enough ! terrible bedside manners and their office is dirty as fuck . not to mention , she does n't listen to a single thing you say & treats you like an idiot when you ask questions . i have never left a doctors office crying in my life but i left crying and pissed off .	1925
0	took 30 minutes to get food . my chimichanga was supposed to be lightly fried but was more of a burrito - i do n't think it came anywhere close to a fryer ! !	1137
1	got a hot stone massage and it was nicely done . probably one of the better massages i have ever gotten . they have a lovely steam room .	2317
0	planet hollywood zappos theater show was to start at 9pm . jennifer lopez came out at 9:50 . everyone stands the entire venue with their phones up recording . saw jennifer maybe a total of 5 minutes . very disappointed . will not go to another concert venue at planet hollywood zappos theater . my view ...	2879
1	my 16-year-old daughter just started working there . the place is clean , safe and the kids were having a blast . my daughter also was having a blast with the kids . such a fun job and her boss and the owner were both attentive and professional . my daughter could n't wait to work the following weekend .	1958
0	finally tried this place and i ordered the black ramen- the broth was over seasoned with what tasted like white pepper- could not have much of the broth due to this- perhaps i had my hopes too high - a bit disappointed	131
0	i was excited for there to be a pho place near my house . i grabbed a to-go order of meatball pho on my home one day . i was sorely disappointed with my purchase . in the 5 min drive home the noodles turned into one congealed mess . the only flavor of the broth was coriander . the bean sprouts i was given were brown and the meat tasted cheap . overall one of the worst bowels of pho i have ever had . i hope they get better with time and i will consider trying them again .	907
0	was a good experience but , i would n't pay to eat there . if you are planning on getting the discounted meal coupon from travelzoo save your money . it really was n't worth it and the eve nightclub is closed . they tried to compensate us with vouchers to another club where they tried to attempt to make us pay an extra $ 50.00 ! ! ! ! terrible i tell you ! nope not again ! ty but not unless it 's free !	971
0	if you are going to devote an entire store to cupcakes , should n't the cupcakes be good ? i 've tried this place three times and each time the cakes were dry . once i would describe the taste as `` oily . ''	3749
1	the most professional hardware place in the valley ! neil is very knowledgeable in all aspects of hardware he makes it real easy to work with on all of our projects . he keeps my wife at bay so she does n't spend to much money ! ! haha i highly recommend this place for all of your custom hardware needs for your projects .	249

1	this address is wrong ! ! ! it is 7800 fairview road charlotte , nc 28226 .otherwise i absolutely love ben and jerrys ; i recommend cookie dough , the tonight dough and milk and cookies : ) the location is good , just search on the ben and jerrys website for nearby scoop shops , and you 'll find one close to this address . this address takes you to a neighborhood 15 minutes away ; )	157
0	worst service ever from arnie and the manager do n't remember his name ! never got a piece of furniture i was promised . i called the store couple times they wold keep me waiting for a long time and tell me they could n't do anything for me , that i needed to go to the store personally i came twice and they ended up saying that i miss understood ! worst place ever to get furniture ! ! ! i will never comeback ! ! ! ! !	1640
0	worst customer service ever . got referred to them and they said they ca n't take my son because it is his foot not his ankle .	2176
1	prices are very reasonable , the staff are very nice , and kids can get their toes polished with a design for only $ 5 ! they also play really good movies ! haha ... you never know what will be on when you pop in : )	1661
1	cookie was awesome . helped me order my `` perfect '' 2013 lr4 of which i took delivery last week . no upselling , no trying to sell me something i did n't want , and no unneeded pestering at any time . very awesome saleswoman , and everyone i dealt with at the dealership was great as well .	2659
1	fun time with my gf there we had a great time . everyone was friendly and there 's great games and go kart was freaking awesome	3707
1	food is good portion , quiet and comfort make it a four star . downside is i find the bubble tea is not as good as other places . other than that , it 's a five star . good place to hang around with your friends and chat with your friends while enjoying the food and drinks .	176
1	i 'm so glad this location opened in centennial ! ! great store and the staff is so friendly and helpful . sandy at the tasting counter is outstanding ! she went above and beyond to help me find a bottle of wine this evening , and made some excellent recommendations . this store has a great layout too , and nice spacious aisles , favorite in the valley !	3199
1	van was ready for us when we got there and check in was quick . they had the best price of many enterprise rental places in the area we checked . only complaint we have is with the enterprise rewards program ... couldnt use our points for a one way rental . and phoenix airport will not let enterprise outside of airport pick us up so we took a cab to the rental office , but it was very close to the airport . rental office , price and van were great !	269
0	my wife and i had a much more negative experience last night . the overall atmosphere of a mostly empty area and almost empty establishment on a friday evening added to that . to begin , we were served warm water from a cutsy wine bottle that had no room for ice ! had to ask for a separate glass with cubes . another basic item missing is a pepper shaker on the table . also lacking is a basic bread offering . we found the wine list did not offer less expensive wines by the glass . two glasses cost more then many entrees . we will not be back .	967
1	voted vegas best pizza multiple years in a row . i can see why ! amazing pizza ... fantastic service ... will definitely be back ! wow ! !	192
1	this review will be short and sweet because the store and service speaks for itself . after years of dealing with `` other '' craft stores it was nice to come to jo-ann 's . it is clean , organized , staffed with helpful associates and best of all the selection is great . fabric and craft ! ! ! no wasted space with home decor or knick knacks . just great jewelry supplies and ribbon selections . now my go to craft store - even if i have to pass other stores to get there !	835
1	this was my first visit at di luxe polish lounge . i was delighted at their attention to cleanliness and sanitation . the people were friendly and welcoming . they did an excellent job . i will definitely visit again ! !	1370
1	these guys are amazing ! ! ! i usually work with rebecca and she is just awesome ! we have about 10 commercial roadside plans with them and rebecca is always wonderful when assisting us !	727
0	this review based on my experience in their gas station , this one only got like four or five gas dispenser . that is like half compare what i used to in other location . this reason is probably why there is very long line when we came here . the other problem , there were only one gas dispenser in the line . seriously , they need to add more dispenser . this is one of the cheapest gas station near the strip is probably another factor why is so crowded , having less dispenser is not helping at all .	2172
0	gave them a 1 because i could n't give them a 0this place is absolutely the worst car wash. a 5 year old could do a better job . i asked the outside be washed , inside vacuumed and just wipe the dash down . the outside was ok because a machine does it . the inside was n't vacuumed or wiped down as requested - it looked the same as when i got out for them to do their job . do not waste your money go to the $ 3 car wash and do the inside yourself if you have time . if you are in a rush find another car wash. again ... do not waste your money here ! ! !	1502
1	love me - santan . andrew is kind and listens to your needs and the desk staff is patient and works with our schedules . recommended	3733
1	tried a few cleaners in the area until settling here . good service and good work . they do what they say they are going to do at a reasonable price .	2704
0	pretty mediocre . $ 50 pedicure , and they did n't even remove my ingrown toe nails . nail salons are pretty thick on the ground in vegas- i 'll go elsewhere .	2390
0	my normal barber was not there , so i wait for a barber who is finishing up 1 and 1 other in front of me ... ... it takes 2 hours . i then leave with a crooked hairline , bad fade and one of the worst edge ups i 've seen .	2467
0	i am so glad i got a groupon for this place . not worth $ 9.95 to go through a 2 minute maze . do n't get me wrong the first time we did the maze took us about 10 minutes to get out . after that it was 2 min or less . there is a laser maze but you will have to pay for that individually . we probably wo n't go back again until they get more stuff or if we are going to the butterfly wonderland next door .	3060
1	came here to test drive few chevy 's after getting positive feedback from a friend . salesman ( daniel ) was very knowledgeable , helpful , honest , and friendly . i ended up test driving 3 cars : cruze , malibu , and cadillac . smooth , quiet rides . overall great dealership , great cars , and great salesman . free wifi !	787
1	great park for spring training . short walk to the metrorail and other public transportation . employees were fast and friendly . park was clean and quiet . next time i come to the valley of the sun i will stay here again .	2289
1	my first time here . nice ambiance and deco . we ordered veggie samosa , which was good . our waiter abel who was very friendly recommended hyderabadi biryani with chicken . it had a nice presentation in a clay pot . the lamb nihani was excellent in flavor and the tender lamb . the garlic nan bread was buttery and soft . it turned out to be a great experience ! !	600
1	nice hotel , friendly staff . the room and bathroom are very clean . towels are fresh and as white as new . bed is comfortable . worth the price . they 've got outdoor pool and spa tub . hotel was clean all around . they got gym inside as well .	230
1	so far so good . great price great work ! always able to get me in quick . i always feel better after leaving . dr roach does a really good job .	2941
0	it 's not a bad place to find books , cd 's or dvd 's , however they could be friendlier . employees are a little snooty and lack any sense of humor . merchandise buyback is on the cheap side , i understand they are a business and want to make money but sheesh ! i would rather go to a public library ... the store in everett , wa was much better .	836
0	went back for our 3rd visit and so disappointed that happy hour has changed : now must sit at the bar for the happy hour menu . the couple coming in after us returned for the same thing and were disappointed with the change .	967
1	stayed here on my husband 's 30th birthday after taking uber out for dinner and drinks . clean , quiet , good price , and nice decor .	2540
1	best car wash in town ! everyone is kind and personable and works hard ! in . cleaning your car at the end they do n't skim they truly want you to be very happy with their service ! i actually and will continue to , go out of my way to have my car washed only by them . thank you ! ! !	1502
1	my family and have have been coming here for years now . the staff and dr. are great and very welcoming , very helpful with our needs . i have recommend this office to many people . thank you dr. mancuso .	2126
0	i 've used them before with good reviews but we used them last night i had to call twice before i actually had a bus pick us up we had every one of the parking companies come by us at least three times before we seen one of these drivers i do n't think i 'll use them again	2531
1	johnnie is great with my 5 yr old son alekei ! i took him in yesterday for last minute back to school haircut . he did a fade and lined him up real nice ! especially since u can imagine how still a 5 yr old is while getting their hair cut . i 'd recommend him to anybody that wants a fresh cut , he does awesome work ! ask for johnnie left side , all the way in the back .	761
0	decent food . if i could give 0 stars for quality of service , i would . it took 30 minutes for one order and 45 minutes for another . when we spoke to the waiter and mentioned that , he walked away . did n't even acknowledge it . a simple `` sorry it took so long '' goes a long way . do not recommend , lots of other good taiwanese cafes around markham .	176
1	i went in to this urgent care this morning because i 've had a cough for several days . i signed up on-line and was called back within about 10 minutes . when i arrived i had to fill out some paperwork ( standard paperwork which took me about 3 minutes ) . i was called back immediately . the exam was very thorough . i was out the door within 25 minutes . everyone was very nice . i will definitely use this facility again if i ever have the need .	2580
0	armadillo grill is usually a place my coworkers and i like to out out together after work . the spinach dip is great and the servers are nice . recently , i tried joining them at the bar and had the worst experience , i will not be going back . the bartender was very rude to me and after six times of asking for a menu i had to flag down a server to get any help . it took 2 hours to get an order of wings and i was very unhappy with the service . armadillo is great if you go during happy our and sit at a table , but i would never recommend going to the bar .	717
0	nice furniture & reasonable prices but sales rep person @ mlk location suck . wating 3 months for delivery of furniture	1794
1	i believe i had danny , but he did an amazing job and took his time . he made sure he knew what i preferred and did n't mind adjusting my nails when i asked . i asked him questions before starting and he was very knowledgable and gave me different options and answers . the only thing i did n't like was the beginning . i walked in without being greeted and after 30 minutes of sitting down i was wondering if they even knew i was there . then a lady asked if anyone was waiting to get their nails done and i was helped out .	2288
0	if i could give zero stars i would . my daughter and i were not treated well yesterday when the cashier rang in our items incorrectly . they had an attitude as though it was our fault . we returned our whole purchase after my credit card was charged numerous times . i will be on phone today trying to rectify what the store manager kami could have done so easily . i have been a a customer of this store for quite some time , but i will now either visit the boca park location or choose another company to buy my candles and lotions from . crappy day	162
0	bad business when finance manager was talking loudly about my trade-in and what we were looking to do . highly unprofessional ! ! ! ! insulting to my wife and i. i got up and left . would not recommend ! ! ! plenty of other dealerships in the charlotte area .	2717
1	if you liked bombay spice , you 'll love this place . if you like indian food , you 'll love this place . if you 're not sure about , or never had , indian food , but you like healthy , delicious food , you 'll love this place . dinners are great here , and lunches are as well . at lunch they have sampler platters that give you a great value , including two entree servings , a salad , rice , veggies , and mini dessert .	640
1	have to let you know what great food this steakhouse serves ! ! had the largest crabcake i have ever seen . three of us did n't finish this wonderful appitizer . i had a nice beet salad and shared the bone in ribeye , a lovely cut of meat that is too large for one person . i also have to let you know how fabulous our waiter was . right on with his recommendations . ask for ahmed , you wont be sorry . the tortilla soup was the best i have had , which our waiter recommended . very nice dinner at a very nice restraurant .	971
1	very good ! nice atmosphere ( we sat outside on a saturday night ... .music inside was too loud ) , good food , good service . i thought that their selection of beers was good , and their food was definitely a couple notches above most bar food offerings . my steak , which i 'm usually picky about , was cooked very well . disappointed i could n't substitute mashed potatoes for baked , but the baked potato was good nonetheless . we will keep this place in mind in the future .	211
0	this is the worst post office , employees are not helpful , no customer service at all . they simply tell you no without offering any other option , even if the usps system has lost your mail that you paid extra to track . they take absolutely no accountability for something they are responsible for . despite spending hours returning and speaking with the recommended management staff , no resolution is offered . they just give you the runaround until you decide your time is worth more than pursuing an issue they are not willing to resolve . very frustrating experience and i recommend avoiding this specific post office location .	1913
1	looking to golf ? this place has 27 holes that will entertain and frustrate the hell out of you . lakes # 3 is beautiful , but beware . do n't hit your shot true and you 'll be taking a drip by the ladies tee box . but this is definitely a spot to hit if you 're a member or know one .	3869
0	i waited for a long time to see the doctor . once the doctor came in , i felt like he was rushed to examine me and did n't pay close to attention to why i went there in the first place . i wo n't be coming back again . worst experience ever .	3598
0	worst pho place ! ! ! ! came in and requested for a booth after the waiter said they were cleaning and could not , 1 minute later an older couple walk in and they ask for the same thing and are immediately moved to the booth . the food was tasteless . no service at all . not once did anyone ask us anything . when it was time to pay no-one brough a bill we walked to the counter ourselves . rude people , bad service , tasteless food ! would not recommend !	577
0	customer service is abysmal . i visited the store on a quiet thursday evening ; there were more sales people than customers . no one greeted me or offered assistance . after asking for help , the sales associate was not familiar with the products and did not offer to find the information . avoid road runner . there are several local running shoe stores staffed by runners who know their products .	2557
1	well all walgreens are essentially the same . pharmacy team is great and fast !	1730
0	i simply called to get some info about t-moble . and curious about the data plan and the process . and the mister i was talking over the phone was an asshole very rude , and does n't give a shit about new costumers .	1772
0	i bought $ 6000 worth of furniture . that was fine . then they i was told 2 weeks i would get all my stuff . not true . it took them 1 1/2 months to get my stuff and when they finally showed up , they only had half of what i order . unbelievable . i had a house warming party without furniture thanks to ashley lack of integrity and honesty . a five year old kid has more word than a big company like that . i would give ashley furniture minus 500 stars . they are the worst . by the way i returned all the stuff back . it did not even make it off the truck	1442
1	i really like this place . i 've gotten both hair cuts and hair color here . only downside is you can spend hours here ... . 4 - 5 hours sometimes , but i accept it because i know they are just students and i appreciate their hard effort and cautious approach to hair styling . the floor instructors are right there by their side and sometimes take over to teach the students . i 've been satisfied every time and do n't think i would have gotten a better result if i had gone to a real salon and spent twice as much ! my favorite girl there is lisette - she 's going to be really good when she graduates !	354
1	lovely and friendly waitress . food was ready really quickly and was hot . she came by to check on me and refill my water glass . i have no complaints , especially considering this is an airport restaurant , and as a rule they can be awful and still have people flock to it due to limited options-not the case here .	604
1	amanda has been my pet 's groomer for over a year , i think . she is so sweet and nice , and really makes my pet feel comfortable . she also does a super cute face trim . i definitely recommend this grooming salon . its very clean in here as well , and they are very efficient . wouldnt take my pet anywhere else .	2108
0	do n't go here they broke my oil pan & told me it was a gasket ! but after they drained my oil ! my side rail was hanging off , they never topped off the fluid s a total sham went to dealership to be fixed then i got a reply from someone who wanted to talk with me still waiting	3379
0	i 've been to whole foods all over the country . i love whole foods . this location however is probably their worst . their hot food bar is always under legal temperatures . they constantly run out of basic items ( plates ! ) and their stockers are too lazy to bring items to the shelves that are out . they just fill in the gaps with other stuff already on the shelf ... even though they have had the item in stock in back for days . avoid this location if possible .	433
0	ordered a half dozen , entire order was wrong . when we called to let them know this was an issue , the last on the phone was extremely rude and said `` i do n't want to explain it to you '' . such a shame that a potentially good place is ruined by awful customer service .	3137
1	my friend and i decided it was time to try this place out after we have gotten a recommendation from one of our friends . we came here on a friday night at around 1115pm . the place had about 3 people online . i asked for recommendations to the employee and she was very attentive and gave me a variety of options . will definitely be coming back here soon ! the pizza was perfect .	282
0	walmart no longer price matches other competitor prices . good riddance walmart . hello target . target prices on items i regularly purchase are priced equal to or less than walmart and i do n't have to put up with dirty parking lots , horrible customer service , scary clientele , shopping carts that always have damaged wheels . walmart is just a substandard retailer . no wonder neighborhoods protest when one wants to locate in their area .	3810
1	friendly staff , clean establishment , line goes by fast during rush hour . lots of desk space for working ( patio seating as well ) .	2950
1	this place works . we had no idea what to expect , but we promised our son we 'd let him play in the play area at a mall somewhere in phoenix . this place came up first . we got here , and got super lucky that randomly they had a kids play place store/shop/area ? . it was epic . they played hard . cars , ball pit , jumpy , party room.. the mall itself is dated though . i 'm giving it a 4 star because this kids play place was awesome and it worked for us .	2815
0	i lived in the claybourne for a year . the apartments and area are really nice . that being said , like the other reviews , the problem is the management . a woman named gina is the property manager of the claybourne . she is a criminal and will do anything to steal your money . i 've never seen such greed and stupidity at a professional level . she 's a complete imbecile and will do anything to claw every penny from you . her alone is not worth living here . stay away from this apartment until she is hopefully fired .	3852
0	i am only giving them one star because i can not give them zero . i was heading to a wedding and wanted to get my chin and upper lip waxed or threaded before hand . i stopped by and they refused to work on me . the only reason was because i was male . nowhere in any of their advertising did they say that they wo n't work on men . if they showed me something like that written on their pricing sheet or their website i would have said okay i made a mistake . they will do eyebrows for men but nothing else . that is discriminatory and false advertising .	2062
1	first time there for dinner last night . got the 24 '' pizza . i thought it was excellent . one of my top favorite places now . also , excellent service . will definitely be back soon . btw , i ordered directly instead of an app . spoke with katie ... very nice . i do n't like using apps for food .	459
0	it was not good at all . the rice was hard..the food had no flavor . the fruit was not fresh it had been sitting out too long . they do n't have a lunch special on sundays and they are over priced . however the sushi was ok. we wo n't be back . totally a waste of money .	1302
0	i hate giving bad reviews but this place was terrible . i brought 2 groupons and my boyfriend and i went and had a couples massage and both of our therapists did not do a good job . my had a guy do my massage and he barely touched me . when you first go in they have you fill out a form and i specifically wrote 'frim/hard touch '' and it was softer than soft ! my boyfriend had the same experience . the massage was less than swedish . we left feeling frustrated and more tense then when we came in . would not go back or recommend .	3079
1	lets be honest , things change and you ca n't ways get it right the first time , but i have to say the cave creek tap haus is a great place to go . i 've been here several times over the last 10 months and every time the service was great ( ask for sandy ) . i just had a burger-fantastic ! also , they have this tequila ( not your typical tequila ) ... called 'dirty tequila ' ... and its really good . moreover , the atmosphere is relaxed , cool , and memorable . step outside of the everyday routine and make this place your new normal . cave creek tap haus is great .	211
0	rude . stuck up people ! the office is so uncomfortable and they scam you into getting a bunch of tests done that are not covered by insurance ! ! they have been harassing me for months ! horrible people . never would recommend to anyone !	3349
1	i just had ryan from penguin air come out and do a very thorough inspection and clean on my air condition unit . he was polite , professional and prompt also right on time . i was informed as he was doing each of the processes and found it enlightening . i would have to say that i do have allergies as i am a cancer survivor and what every spray he used was not a pleasant experience . i think the next time please make a note not to use the same spray . i gave ryan a 10* rating . thank you penguin you guys are on the ball . elizabeth b .	2203
0	yelp actually hid my previous review . this site is no longer reliable . please do yourself a favour and avoid this store at all costs . pretentious , rude , and insulting service . there are many other options in toronto for purchasing high end timepieces , where the staff will actually be helpful and friendly - what a concept ! i will never return to hj .	1632
0	i worked here for fifteen years and i can tell you if i did n't give all students very good grades ( the grades they wanted ) no matter their credentials they 'd fire me . so if you need an over priced education and you do n't want to earn it go to devry or now it 's adtlan global education . also you can submit the teacher solutions straight from the teachers manual for full homework credit . honest . this school is all about pushing you through and promising you jobs that do n't exist .	1081
0	disgusting ! this place smells moldy and worn . we were seated in a booth that had ripped up holes in the seats . i 'm allergic to mold , and started having trouble breathing . we left , and the staff ( who were very nice and apologetic ) asked if i could talk to the manager . hmm . that tells me they hate it too . seriously this place needs to get renovated or torn down .	1262
0	they are terrible with customer service . i bought a groupon for them and was really looking forward to finding a new salon after moving to the area . i set up my appointment last night and no one told me any `` rules '' that pertained to the groupon . i needed to cancel because of the bad road conditions and she said there was a 24 hour cancellation with the groupons and if you cancel less then that - they take the groupon . will definitely not be going here !	841
1	i loved this place ! i went at night and got dessert to go - the elvis cake is unbelievably good ! my friend 's giant cupcake was also great . since we liked the dessert so much we decided to go back and get brunch the next morning , which was also great . my friend loved her eggs with fresh salsa and home fries and the caramelized onion macaroni and cheese i had was a thing of beauty . i will definitely return !	975
1	great meds always ! best staff and best prices . this is my favorite dispensary . lots of selection to choice from and best flower in valley !	3491
1	crossroads is always our to-go place for wings in indian trail ! every wing sauce is great , but we especially like the carolina wings . every time we order take out , it 's ready and hot within 20 minutes . the sandwiches are good too !	1248
0	awful experience . the whole time i felt uncomfortable . they barely spoke english and afterwards demanded a tip . she even followed me outside to see if i would head to the atm or not . i guess next time when i 'm desperate for a massage , i need to stay clear of shady looking parlors like this where the only thing covering myself and people coming in is a curtain .	2399
0	i 'm not a huge fan of jj 's . i work nearby , and it seems like my order is almost always wrong . if the food was good , i 'd suffer through the incorrect orders , but it 's just not worth it . i 'd rather have subway . at this point , i 'll only order jj 's if there i 'm starving and i have no other option . i would have given the review one star , but they have some of the nicest delivery people i 've ever met . they are always friendly and patient .	141
1	this one is hidden . so the lines tend to be small . in and out , works for me . some of the other locations can be crazy . always homeless people hanging around this place . the one guy i have been seeing for 12 years + living on the streets . what a shame . he might need some meds .	1913
0	my wife had an appointment with dr. mcnulty in may 2016 to look into the possibility that she might have spinal stenosis and could he resolve it . mcnulty is a rude sob , said he would n't do anything for my wife ( yes , we have great insurance ) , and i had to get in his face after that surprising outburst to find out if she even had a spinal problem . mcnulty has about the same bedside manner as a garbage can . i will spell it out - do not go here expecting competence or professionalism .	2176
1	this is a very large and busy office but there is adequate staff and my appointments were always on time , never waited over . i had cataract surgery and it took about 10 minutes with no complications and i have my sight back . the staff are very professional .	1635
1	we are very pleased with the dog stop ! our dogs seem to enjoy their stay and i believe they are very reasonably priced . we have used them several times in the last few years !	3130
1	this hotel was $ 67 with tax -- two beds and a pullout couch . great price . large room , breakfast , pool ( we did n't get to check it out though ) . very nice lady at the front desk . good value .	681
0	i love otb . we get take out often . i am getting frustrated though because when you order a quart of salsa , it 's often half full . tonight we ordered and they told us they were out of quart containers and gave a two smaller containers , but they were half full . they claimed it was more than a quart . i got home and put it in a quart container , and it was far less . if you sell it as a quart , it should be a quart .	1558
1	i 've been here twice with years between . both times there was great service by all staff . i was seen promptly and the doctors were great .	962
1	great service & location ! i 've followed coleman from several me locations , excellent , listens & very talented ! & matt is also excellent !	3862
1	this review is for the body combat class . i have taken the body combat class at the mount pleasant and at this location . i love this location 's body combat class ! it is energizing , a great cardio butt-kicking workout ! i was out of breathe and loved it ! although the actual room is a bit small , i will be coming back for more !	2370
0	absolutely one of the worst haircut i have in years . for 30 dollars everyone haircut take less than 10 mins . now i have to wear caps for the next two weeks	3413
0	went here to get an estimate on repairing my front bumper cover . guy comes out says nothing then gives me attitude when i ask how much to fix . not hello sir how can i help you- nothing . he acted like he was doing me a favor by taking my car there . never ever go here ! ! ! rude , rude staff .	2537
1	love this pizza , always great staff who are friendly and helpful . i bring my family here whenever we want pizza !	192
1	this is the best nofrills in toronto . its so clean & the prices are fantastic ! ross who is the owner is always working with his staff to keep it flowing just right . he always has a smile & his staff are always knowledgable about what food they sell & what isle to find it as they take you there to make sure you got what you needed . instead of just pointing to were to find your item like some stores do . the customer service is fantastic ! ! ! they treat you & everyone who walks through their doors like family .	2514
1	i strongly recommend giving this place a try . when my friend and i came here it just happened to be during the lunch buffet . really good price for all the food options you get ... $ 14 . we upgraded the naan bread for $ 2 and that was such a good choice ! the garlic and chili garlic naan was awesome . great service and authentic tasting indian food .	1497
0	i 'm just waited 30 minutes for a hawaiian pizza and a grilled chicken sandwich . and the place is empty . as soon as i walked up and asked for refund the pizza and chicken sandwich was ready . the person that ordered after me got their food before me and ordered a lot more . ridiculous . order at 11:04 am was brought out at 11:32 am	580
1	been staying here for over 20 years . located in a quiet area and close to everything . the bed was awesome ; got a great night of sleep !	1195
1	great and honest service . our ac stopped working & upon assessing the situation it was observed that the drainage pan had filled too much so it shut off the ac . the rest of the system was checked out to be ok. several other companies were called and messages left with no return calls at all . these are the big name guys who claim to have 24hr availability . the only thing they have is answering service but no return calls . nascair is local , reliable and can be trusted to honestly tell you what 's wrong . glad to have found such a good company . no need to look any further .	730
0	small show room nothing like it is on tv no music nothing was so dull fun to see some of the vehicles and it 's free entrance saw one of the cast members from the tv show he did n't look to enthused to take photos with his fans more annoyed .	2978
0	i went there once a while back and it was dirty and never went back ... but if stevey is right about the drink specials i might have to re-visit	717
1	ordered the oxtail and rice and the jerk chicken as well as one beef patty . food was very tasty . the meat was flavoured nicely and was very tender . service was very fast . we visited for takeout - the dining area was decent and clean , just a bit dated looking . we already are looking forward to returning !	874
1	great music , great vibe , good drinks , great snack , but do not eat a whole meal here . the food is super salty and saucy . it goes great with drinking but is bad to eat too much of .	688
1	expert staff with a wealth of knowledge with vets from around the globe that love their practice . i had my dog here after a horrendous experience at another vet and they were amazing . i was there every week for close to 4 months and it was always a pleasure to see the staff and for them to see russia . this place is as about as good as it gets in toronto	345
0	listen , the gelato is amazing , but the customer service is terrible . the guy helping us hates his job and stated it freely . it 's a shame because this place has so much potential . remember you have to hire for character , you can teach skills . in this case you ca n't teach personality .	3735
0	this place is n't very nice definitely overpriced hooker central and the birds in the trees outside of my second-floor room wo n't shut the heck up . i asked to speak to a manager and the guy behind the desk and did n't even know who i need to talk to	2599
0	placed an order to-go . they forgot one of our sandwiches , the other sandwich we ordered ended up being so salty that nobody would eat it , and they did n't have one of our soups we ordered so they replaced it with a salad . the whole order was completely jacked up . do n't recommend this location .	1002
1	came here cause i heard they have a plant based protein shake..so before heading to the gym i thought i 'd try one ( i also have a few gift cards sitting around ) . this place was sooo packed , literally a full house ... thank goodness my order was to go ! the one guy they had on staff was super super friendly . he was handling all the orders like a pro..but while i was waiting for my drink i went to use the bathroom and they were fairly gross ( one stall did n't even have toilet paper ) . if you 're going to be here awhile make sure you use the bathrooms before you come !	2438
1	a friend of mine raved about arpita , so i decided to see for myself . i could n't have been more pleased with the outcome . my eyebrows always look great after seeing arpita . i am now a loyal customer . thank you for the excellent service !	2630
0	beware of renting with avis . they will put earlier damages to the car on you . i rented a car from them and on returning was told that the car had scratches which was definitely not by me since my car was mostly parked in the hotel covered parking . now on reading other reviews , it looks like they do this to squeeze more money from customers . there are many similar instances reported by others here too . i was sent a bill for $ 1200 for no fault of me . the billing company vikings billings is not helpful and refuse to answer any questions .	3129

0	awful awful awful . the coffee is awful . ohhhh buuut they have a fire place , and some glass ceiling ... it 's so cozy ! fuck . it 's awful . the `` barista '' said that she had `` no clue '' what type of beans they use as she `` made '' my espresso ( with pre-grounded beans no less ) through an automatic espresso machine . i 'm not going to waste any more time going through this watery instant coffee tasting crap . if you want comparable coffee , go to timothy 's where you will save money as well.. for proper coffee in k town , hit up house . maybe in grand prairie this place would pass ...	2163
1	very impressed with the quality of gear this small outfit carries . i almost felt as if i was n't in ohio and back in co for a moment . located close to the cvnp and right night door to an indoor climbing gym . they carry quality brands and niche gear for any outdoor enthusiast	3339
1	the garlic knots are the best . my family and i love them . the pizza is really good . it 's ultra thin . get the garlic knots ! ! ! ! !	1399
0	took my boy there for a hair cut . the girl we got seem like a rookie . hair cut was extremely bad and uneven . charged 30 $ for that . i could have gotten a cheap or bad haircut for 8 $ at great clips . if i go to a high end shop the service and skill set should at least be better than `` pathetic ''	335
0	disappointed wait staff not friendly - just there poke - ok quality - pricey special plate - expensive - ok 4 meats bulgogi sweet meat jun - egg fell off - messy kalbi and chicken little taste need more marinating bunchon tasted old - not fresh - as is it was sitting out for hours nothing great will probably not be back	435
1	the guys here are always so helpful and kind . they give helpful recommendations but are n't super pushy like other service stations . jiffy lube keeps all my records for me , so i can visit any one across the country and they can tell me what 's recommended for my car and when . plus they even clean your dash and windshield for you while you wait . great job guys !	2852
0	not enough food for a chipmunk ... and what did come was ... meh . breakfast of last resorts .	580
1	went to a few other places before i found this one . finally found a spot that i 'll stick with . location is very nice . haircut was great . they always make sure your cut is exactly what you want . the hot towel is fantastic as well .	1768
0	i took my rolex to be serviced and repaired . three months later they said the repaired my watch but that was a lie . it would not keep time ! $ 610 wasted . decided to take it to quick repair jewelry on buffalo and westcliff . $ 210 and it was done right ! alberto did the best job . too bad m & i could n't do this type of service . i was also annoyed by the constant talking of the owner at m & i . not interested in his stories .	2307
0	locale is lovely , restaurant is well appointed , sadly lots of issues - got beer order wrong - service was spotty ( at best ) , server literally disappeared for a half hour - booked a group and they did n't tell us they added an automatic gratuity so we all tipped ( congrats ! made a few extra bucks and lost 10 customers forever ! ) and then felt like idiots when somebody looked at the bill when getting home . none of us will return .	918
1	i love coming here ! i have done 3 of the rooms so far and i 'm excited to see the new rooms coming . the staff is always super friendly and helpful and the puzzles are intriguing . i love most that the rooms are private , so my group has never been paired with random strangers . definitely worth going .	2964
0	bartender named taylor is a rude $ % & % @ ! another server told her i was trying to get her attention and she said `` he can wait ! '' just wanted to get my wife a glass for her smirnoff . had never been here before . no reason for her to be so rude . never again !	319
1	great spicy chicken sandwich and fries . nice and fresh . crispy lettuce . yum ! well made food served with a smile . definitely coming back .	509
1	great customer service . it was packed but understandable since it was a saturday . next time i 'll rent one during the weekday . truck was clean and ran good enough , the guy who gave me the truck fixed some mileage issues .	1877
1	if you are looking for furniture i would ask for raplh russo to show you what you are looking to buy . look for the managers specials , great savings	1442
1	the entire store has been recently renovated and they added a sushi counter and lots of specialty cheeses as well as spice jellies .	3009
1	this has got to be the best roast beef sandwich in the valley fantastic horseradish dressing and good value	1160
1	excellent lamb korma for lunch today . my colleague was happy with his vegetarian dish . i ordered medium spice and the heat was exactly the way i like it ! service was quick and friendly . a good find in scottsdale !	1497
1	had a wonderful foot and body massage . very professional and price is within the top 10 spa 's in vegas .	2399
1	tl ; dr reliable . professional . clean cars . good drivers . punctual . quick . you get what you pay for . it 's hard to add anything that has n't already been said before . this is my go-to guy when driving to the airport . the good thing is , he 's good . the sad thing is , there 's no similar competing service in pittsburgh .	2356
0	zero stars . after waiting in the ridiculously long line , i was then informed that they were out of gluten free crust ( that they charge almost $ 2 extra for ) . we are attending a convention and had limited time to eat , so we were forced to find something else and barely had time to a scarf it down . was anxious to try it but wo n't be back .	282
0	i normally order from the junction location , mostly bc i did n't know this one existed . kale caesar is definitely better from the junction . my 9 $ side salad was off . really off .	1063
0	i have never disliked a hair cut / color because i am not picky and say do what you would like ( maybe that 's my fault ) but i paid over $ 200 for one bowl and a half of color and a cut ( my friends in california do hair so the pricing is a little much for that little color ) that is leaving my hair turning orange now . i do not recommend and will not be back	2113
1	i come here for all my friend 's kids birthday presents . they have a wide selection of fun kids clothes and games ! i even bought my daughter 's first swimsuit here- it is the cutest , with little mermaids on it . prices are pretty affordable and the selection is great ! they are also helpful at helping you find the right purchase .	3747
1	after been lied to by a local garage door company & calling the maker of the door i was steered to north shore . they asked me to email a picture of the old bottom weather seal which i did . in the same day i received an email from north shore instructing me on the seal that would fit my garage door . i placed my order , received the seal in a timely manner & my son & i installed the seal . i do n't know how this company could have given me any better service . good customer service is a rare thing to find anymore . thank you north shore .	3470
0	kinda feel like i got ripped off . got my nails done here a week ago and they have either broke and i had to file them to make them look normal or the paint is chipping . i 've had my nails done plenty of times at other nail salons and the paint has never chipped.. wonder if they use actual gel or regular nail polish to pretend its gels . either way , they said their gel wont chop for 14 days . was only going to give this place one star but the girl who did them seemed nice so i 'll give them another star - but i 'm not going back to get my nails done .	3047
1	rooms was nice and clean , and the bed was very comfy . we found out as we were checking out that you can stay parked in the garage until midnight , so no need to worry about finding more parking later .	3381
1	they forgot my sweet and sour , but i also got a free caramel sundae bc they made an extra on accident for a different patron . the spiritual value of a caramel sundae is probably bigger than the spiritual value of sweet and sour sauce . aka ya boy ca n't be mad . four stars four stars four stars	1162
0	farm to raised sushi made the sushi flavorless , the sweet-and-sour and general sows straight out of the bag was chewy and flavorless.the only decent thing was the beef lo mein .	1196
1	my absolute favorite coffee place ! so superior to starbucks . their drinks never disappoint and their staff is friendly and helpful ! i love the atmosphere here and most of all that their drinks are consistent .	261
1	very impressed with this holiday inn . beautiful lobby , courteous front desk staff , good restaurant and waitstaff , nicely appointed rooms . has flatscreen lcd , but like most hotels ... .does n't offer hd stations . biggest disappointment is the internet speed ... absolutely horrendous ! only about 0.25 mbps download and 0.10 mbps upload . my 4g iphone gets over 7.0+ mbps download ! unfortunately , will have to try the hilton garden inn down the street next time .	2401
1	so , i guess i ca n't really hold grudges against places i go to all the time . we 're in scottsdale quite a bit because my guy 's father lives over there . this louis vuitton is also well stocked and the sales associate are really friendly . we like dealing with jocelyn when she 's in . i have n't bumped into that rude manager since last fall . and they give out water that have regular screw on caps now instead of the pierre with the metal cap so hopefully , no one will ever get water leaked onto their brand new purses ever again !	1493
0	penguin air was recommended to me be a landlord i trust . they responded fairly fast in the beginning , sold me a unit too large for my house that makes lots of noise ( day & night ) it wakes me up at night . the installers had to cut a large hole in my garage ceiling to install the blower motor but promised me that someone would come and repair the hole in 2-3 days . after many phone calls and empty promises i still have a gaping hole in my ceiling and a very noisy unit . it 's been three months now and still no return call . i would n't recommend penguin air to my worst enemy : (	2203
1	my favvvvvvvvv hair salon ! ! ! ! i always go to dominique watkins for my beautiful copper red colour and he never fails me . i love the environment here , everyone is very professionally skilled and friendly , and accommodating ! the shop is always clean and smells nice . you will not be let down here if you nervous about trying any crazy colors/cuts . this is your place ! ! !	2274
0	i purchased last minute tickets through unbeknown prior to purchasing to me that my return flight was with spirit ( another story for another day ) . i had to cancel within 8 hours of purchasing my flight and despite my best efforts hoping they would honor their written 'free cancelation policy '' i was told nothing they could do . i would rather pay the extra fees associated with a respected travel company than waste time nickel and diming with a company such as this . worst customer service , worst purchasing experience , worst `` solution '' given by a company that boast on their website free cancellation	1574
0	they went out of business without a sale ! closed their doors for good . i 'm not sure how long they been around for but sad to see a brand like this go on fremon	2231
1	i am very happy with my pedicure and gel nail service . the reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is that i was told to choose my color upon arrival , bu5 not given any other directions . i had to ask if i should come to the back . my normal nail tech was out of town and i was badly in need of service . i will always ask for holly or joy when i am in need of nail work .	3462
1	i live in the inland empire in california . i wish there was a store like terri 's consigment here . we shopped in mesa , from the late 1980s through 2010 . we found very nice items and prices were negotiable .	2924
0	my friend and i decided to try out this nail place and we 're both horribly disappointed ! ! it was horribly over priced , very unprofessional , dirty and my gel manicure peeled off my nails with in 48 hours	1440
1	bel endroit ! assez petit mais bien pour assister à des concerts de jazz . bon cocktails !	3295
1	after a lengthy conversation with cox customer service , the in branch agent jorge handled things gracefully an professionally . two thumbs up	664
0	i am very disappointed i went for my ultrasound the screen was too small the video and picture quality was terrible the room was small . i am saying this because i went somewhere else and it uncompareable . at this other place the screen was huge the pictures were so clear and the room was huge with like 15 chairs , i thought the henderson wellness was better but ooh ! ! surprise ! ! you can even hear your baby 's heartbeat , do n't do your ultrasound here there 's a lot better places do n't waste your time and money !	3313
0	lexi at the leasing office was incredibly rude . its a shame that the leasing staff does not live up to the quality of the property .	2904
0	waited in line for 2 hours , was charged $ 100 more than on line booking stated , car had empty beer cans under front seat and what appeared to be a possible used condom in back seat . sky harbors state of the art rental car center is a crap show , here is my tip , take a taxi to a downtown rental car site , probably get a better rate and less jackassery .	2134
0	i came in to ask a simple question about the prices for jewelry . it would have been a quick visit of the girl at the counter gave me the time of day ! she was very rude and short with me . probably the same girl the review below was talking about . do n't even waste your time talking to her .	2895
0	poor communication and unprofessional . i hired the company to manage my property . for 2 weeks , people came and saw the house and left comments . conrad klein never once called me with feedback . received one email out of 7 feedback on there portal . they definitely do n't care once they have you onboard .	2848
0	the worst pedicure i 've ever had ! 15 minutes and my spa pedicure was done . they have no clue on what they are doing ... usually i prefer to keep silent if i do n't like something . i only praise and if i have nothing to praise ... oh well ... i hope next time i will have a better experience . .. but this time it exceeded all the limits ! beware ! ! ! if you are planning to waist your time and money that is the place to go .	3516
1	one of the most fun and delicious places in las vegas for snacks , desserts , ice cream and amazing chocolates ! they give free chocolate taste tours . they sport their own chocolates and lots of other competitors chocolates ! they serve specialty milkshakes with alcohol ! i do n't drink but many say they are so delicious ! it 's a great place to buy unique souvenirs too !	3722
1	i was helped by three different people for three different items and each one of them was awesome . they communicated with each other as well as me to help me get exactly what i was looking for . a bedroom , mattress , nightstand , lamp and high wing back chair for my master bedroom . everything from the sale to delivery and set up was perfect . they called and came when they said they would and things could n't have run any smoother . i will definitely be back when i 'm ready for the next room .	2071
0	i give this place a 2.5 tops ! how is this establishment rated so high ? i had mongolian beef that was about as good as sweet rubber and the cream cheese wonton ... ... . sad sad sad excuse for a cream cheese wonton . try somewhere else first .	474
0	i was super excited to see another chinese noodle soup place in dt core . but man was this disappointing . the soup had no depth , except for a strong presence of msg and super salty . the worst part was the noodle . it was not even cooked all the way through . waitress was trying to clear my friend 's bowl while she was still eating . the side dishes cost around $ 4 and the size is the same as the side dishes in korean restaurants that they give for free .	790
0	recently visited this shop to have a battery replaced in my watch . ( old tag heuer ) in the past this was $ 10- $ 20 . i was very surprised that they quoted me $ 79 . they mentioned that this would include new seals , but would not guarantee the watch would still be waterproof . they also mentioned that for $ 49 they would simply replace the battery . i wanted to get the watch running again , and did not want to chase around town , so i had them install a battery . however i believe this is too expensive & will need to find a new watch shop .	3533
1	one of the best memberships i 've have . i love the service staff . i noticed its always clean around the clock which is a bonus .	2762
1	took my children ages 1 , 8 , and 10 to jambo this weekend . they all had fun . they have everything you can ask for ; video games , indoor play area , laser tag , bowling , rides , food , and fun ! best of all the attendants are the nicest bunch of people i have ever ran into . most teenagers hate their jobs and do n't really care if they do them well or not , but that is not the case at jambo . the attendants are friendly , caring , and overall in great moods . i would definitely take my kids back here . it was well worth the price : )	3791
0	unfortunately a slow , unenjoyable experience . waited a long time for our food , watched the cashier smack talk the chef who complained about having to cook orders . back and forth with profanity . extremely unprofessional .	669
1	went for a friends birthday . the service was great despite what other yelp reviewers have said . restaurant was full . we sat upstairs - also packed . i had the arugula salad which was huge and really enough for a meal or to share . pizza of the day which was good and i really liked the crust . everyone in the party really enjoyed the food and the restaurant being packed during a snowstorm is a good sign i think . very reasonably priced .	240
1	like others , we used western states because they were contracted with home depot . they were excellent . they called ahead to let us know they would be there in 20 mins . the office called me to make sure the workers arrived , and afterward to see if i had any questions or concerns . i can not see the seams , and the work went quickly . the installers vacuumed afterward to get the stray fibers and so i could see the direction of the nap . it looks great !	1379
1	after i had the worst customer service at sally 's today , we googled a little more and made some phone calls . my daughter needed a fake ponytail drawstring and they carry some . so i drove to the other side of town and i was positive surprised , how helpful they were in this store . thank you for saving my day , and showing me a way better customer service then sally 's today .	1659
0	purchased a car from jason ( ? ) july of 2017 and was shown a clean and clear carfax on the vehicle before i signed to purchase it . today i took my car into a horne kia for a strange noise , only to find my engine needs to be replaced on my 2016 vehicle . they showed me the records from earnhardt kia dealership when they stated to the previous owner that the engine needed to be replaced in november 2016 . the warranty denied covering the cost of the new engine because the previous owner never changed the oil . now the phone number is inactive ? ? ?	3305
0	epic fail ! ! ! ordered from them , 2 hours later i get a call saying it was sent to a different restaurant when they only have 1 and it will be 45 minutes more . then i wait and get nothing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they sure as hell took my money and delivered no product !	459
1	my fiancée and i got the tom yum , pad thai , spring rolls , satay beef and macaroons for dessert . everything was amazing and very authentic . i ordered 3 macaroons and the staff member gave me one for no cost ! this is the second time we have ordered from here and will continue to do so . thai fusion delight also called us after to see how we enjoyed the food which is such impeccable service ! i would for sure recommend this restaurant !	352
0	told us they could n't seat us for 20 minutes bc they only have 3 5-tops . we have 3 children . they had tons of seating available . they were rude when we asked about it and i would just say they are anti-kids . avoid this place .	1105
0	if i could give zero stars , i would . i brought my little 15 lbs pup in because i wanted to put a basket on the front or back of my bike . immediately i was yelled at `` do n't bring that dog in here '' i even attempted to say , `` even if i hold her ? '' and this guy yelled , `` no , get it out of here . '' i was planning to buy lights , new brakes , a front and back basket and new tires . needless to say , never going back and i do n't know how they 're still open with how `` busy '' they are . total shit hole .	3156
0	i came in here for a quick wash. 8 minute wait to pay , 10 minute wait for them to actually start washing my car . this place is packed for a business that charges so much and does so little . i prefer the car washes that have an express lane for those that just need to rinse the bugs off after a roadtrip .	3899
0	over priced sushi , bad quality , and taste horrible . sorry but this place ai n't worth going to . the ginger that they served was bland . i never had bland ginger in my life !	1196
1	this place was not busy but the food was great . waffles made perfect and the breakfast bowl was very good . will eat here again and recommend it .	580
1	why what 's wrong with you people im been there numerous times always five star service very friendly people the only thing is when people cope with a business account there was a preference but that 's all the bank i 've been there a couple times with really picky a transaction always courteous and patient	1697
1	clean , brightly lit and busy for being in a low-visibility location . mindy was really friendly , quick and neat . got a single-color mani/pedi plus sugar for around $ 30 incl tip . oh , and the massage chairs actually work really well . kudos on something which seems to challenge a lot of other nail places .	3040
0	horrible ! ! ! the guy at the front was so rude and no one wanted to help us . dont shop here ! and i see why no one was in the store in the first place .	2826
1	quite a little fine and if your looking for a quick burger and fries , not half bad . i would stay clear of the onion soup since i have had better but the potato skins were quite nice . the staff is super nice as well and they have food specials all the time . /a nice local hang out . the popo always are around the corner though , so do n't drink and drive	696
1	this place was a good hotel . the check in took way too long , but he was very friendly . the shuttle drivers were n't the friendliest , but they were decent to us . it 's a big hotel , lots of walking to get to some rooms . i loved that it 's pet friendly . i would stay more often if they had more frequent and friendly shuttle service .	2872
0	this place is strictly a business for the people that work here . they are just rushing people in and out . when i called to make arrangements i was told we could buy a disk of photos and there would be 150 pictures on the disk . the photographer rushed us through was only going to take about 20 pictures and i had to ask her to take more . we ended up with 50 pictures on the disk . the staff was not very friendly , other than the limo driver . there are other inexpensive places to get married in vegas , i would n't recommend this one .	3867
0	booked an appointment for a prenatal massage . i was called the next day , & was told they had no available appts there was a scheduling issue . i would n't even given them a star but i had no choice . well bad customer service & business ethics . i 'll never go or call this place ever again .	3744
1	they keep the store clean , it 's organized and they have a large selection . it 's target , so you know what to expect .	583
0	false advertising . this place is a hipster coffee shop , not a farmers market by any stretch . i thought it 'd be nice to support a local business , but some of these folks just do n't try . dim lighting , crap selection , price gouging , bugs . you 'd be better off going to circle k .	2488
0	my exam was not thorough . they seem to be mostly driven by money . i am a self pay patient , received a bill for 167 dollars to be told i do n't have strep . it would be much cheaper to pay the self pay rate at a doctors office . i would n't recommended minute clinic .	70
0	this location scheduled me for an oil change a few days ago for 5pm today and then had the audacity to call with less than 50 minutes before my appointment to say the scheduler screwed up and should never have made an appointment after 430p . instead of providing good customer service and agreeing to do the service they scheduled he was calling to tell me tough shit and ask that i pick another day . i fucking think not . and you , reader , should go elsewhere too .	1895
1	great place to bring the kids and burn some energy . kassie is very friendly and good at what she does .	1664
1	i am giving 5 stars for the excellent and efficient service from natasha ! she is friendly , fast paced and on top of it ! i would not recommend the nachos as they use 'fake ' cheese . i would have given less stars because of that , but the service in general from all of the staff outweighs that . it looks like their other food options would have been a better choice for me .	1400
1	pan-asian food is asian food prepared in a pan . just kidding . ok , i am rarely accused of being original . but , i was not familiar with the term . basiclaly , a well rounded menu . i met this hot chick hitchhiking who had a coupon and so we had dinner together . we tried the tiger shrimp salad with mango and thai linguinewith shrimp -mild- . very delish . the owner is very nice and i swear he needs to be a bit actor on hawaii five-o . finished up some fried ice cream and we were content . nice vibe to the place even though i would prefer an upgrade to the seating furniture . i would recommend .	1203
0	i like the vibe here . the windows are great . its your typical cozy pub . i loved that . but the food is n't really worth it . and one of the times i went there i was completely ignored . this is a place that is really only good if you 're stopping in for a beer .	3344
0	3 times i 've visited this dump of a shop to see about getting left sleeve . they are never open even when the posted times say m-s 12am-9pm . it 's 1pm and the place is closed . i 've called multiple times and nobody answers the phone , voicemail is always full . every time i drive by the place , no cars are in the parking lot , ever . the place is closed for business	443
1	i love this little place ! i have been going here for 5 years now and i have never been disappointed . i typically go for their lunch specials , ordering the pad thai with beef ... .delicious ! the soup they bring out is very good and varies on the day . my favorite is the egg drop but they are all yummy . the staff is friendly , they do n't talk much but are attentive . if you are in the mood for something sweet i recommend the thai tea ... ..soooooo gooood !	1361
1	no manicure has been as good as the one tri gave me ! seriously . i walked in , sat right down , and he was there ready to go . i told him exactly what i wanted done , and executed it beautifully ! tri is exceptional at his trade and i will never go back to vegas without paying him a visit first ! you will not be let down .	2686
0	they told me to come at 430 for an oil change . take 15 minutes to talk to me and say they ca n't give me an oil change cause their guys leave in 15 minutes and an oil change takes 45 min ... do the math , how were you going to give me an oil change in the first place ?	565
0	not the best stay ever . shower took 10 min to heat up . internet was moving at a snails pace and then stopped working completely . i 'm writing this review on my phone now ... also room service is expensive . i 'm talking 12.5 for a wedge salad . i 've had a long trip and did n't want to go out but those prices are crazy . would like to add that the front desk is very accommodating and very nice .	1786
0	i may not know much about noodle buy these are definitely not what i expect . i ordered the wide size thinking it 'd be thinner but it 's thick and chewy .	790
1	baylee burrows is awesome at quicken loans . she provided superior customer service and stayed on top of my loan account from start to finish . checked in weekly and made sure all my questions were answered . never made me feel bad about asking too many questions maybe even repetitive questions . i 've mortgaged 3 times with them and each time is better than the last . fair costs and good rates , always some credit for being a returning client . thank you ! !	1792
0	must be new.. service was terrible , did n't even know , i had to tell the girl the way the special was run ! ! ! then had to still ask for dressing for my salad ! ! ! hope thye get better because most paneras are wonderful !	867
0	do not fly allegiant . supposed to fly punta gorda to cedar rapids 1/17/2014 . clear weather both airports . flight cancelled 2 hours before take-off and rescheduled for 18 hours later . no reason for the delay . likely no crew and/or equipment . looks like i will miss my aunt 's funeral . looks like my last flight on allegiant . cost of ticket with extras 130 dollars water provided none cost of missing my aunt 's funeral and never flying allegiant again ... .priceless .	3127
1	what a great place . this is a wonderful service to our community . a much needed service with a great friendly staff .	2094
0	lame is all i have to say . went on a friday night and only 5 dancers . the lap dances suck the men are more about showing you tricks and dance moves than grinding against you . do n't waste your cash here at all . there is a reason why after all these years this place does n't have many reviews . the only plus about this place is the guys are nice to talk too . as for looks , most are skinny , not many are muscular , and a few seemed possibly gay .	5
0	really not good pho . it 's overpriced and the broth has way too much star anise . it 's really a counter service place so prices should be much lower . only good thing is it 's near sprouts haha . go to pho thanh instead .	907
1	i have been to numerous lv stores around the country and overseas this store was by far the most attentive and helpful that i have visited in awhile ! risha is a fabulous associate who helped me purchase a wallet to fit a smaller bag . she also knew exactly what other items i was interested in based on my descriptions . ( i am terrible at the names of these products , but she was able to bring me bags that matched my comments ) .	1493
1	thank goodness i was craving pho today ! i stopped by here with a couple of friends after two classes and enjoyed the pho and service very much ! the cashier even gave us more discount on top of the unlv student discount because we said we would be returning ! he was funny and nice !	673
0	this place has bad service from day one , that 's why i stopped going there for a while now . there 're plenty of places with much better desserts , and most important of all , appreciate your business !	1217
1	great new location ! neighborhood bar feel and expanded menu from other city locations . friendly , fun atmosphere , and great food . we were there on a non-sports night , but would be a good place to watch a game , lots of tvs , good appetizers , and great drinks ! love the tots - nice and crispy .	674
0	do n't get sushi if you 're visiting and you live by the water . not fresh and they use way too much rice ! ! it 's all rice ! i was traveling for work and craved sushi . was hesitant at first considering its pittsburgh but then the raging reviews convinced me to go . i regretted my decision . i ate it cause i was starving . lesson learned ! only order sushi when you 're by the coast .	24
0	sam 's club is by far the worst store i have ever been to . the employees were incredibly disrespectful threatening to take my membership away claiming i was committing illegal actions . never been more disappointed and i encourage others to not go to the sam 's club especially in champaign since they promote such disrespectful tendencies .	2810
0	be careful and ask for your receipt at dinner have been eating here once each week the past month and has been good . on tuesday night ordered exact same meal as other times when fare is $ 6.47 taco with rice and pico = $ 11.00 ouch ! on july 8 , 2014 know traffic was slow just a bit surprised staff is good and food is good	189
1	dr. rio and his staff that examined my eyes , we 're professional and most meticulous during their respective examinations . the high standard of care provided here repeats itself year after year after year .	663
0	horrible , horrible . i had bought a book of coupons for washes and they refused to honor . the manager was rude rude rude . i got totally ripped off and was treated rudely .	2198
0	so , i just read the post that a barber called me about . damn shame when a stoner barber steals your customers by lying about you retiring cause he thinks getting high is more important than giving good cuts to keep his own customers . hope you come to lake mead and tenaya to canyon falls spa and get a great cut by me .	3600
1	our dog lily loves it here . she ca n't say bye to us quick enough before jumping into their welcoming arms . she always comes back to us well taken care of and well exercised .	103
0	it is tuesday . the sign says they close at 9:30pm . we walked in at 9pm and were stopped by the door saying that they were closed . how sad ! so many years going there . i actually had a friend that just moved from california with me .	198
1	: d *5 stars* great check in staff and flights out of here has always been on time for me . nuff said ! ; )	1623
0	completely overpriced 1st and 2nd courses and it was the winterlicious menu . totally ordinary food . desserts were surprisingly good as was the service which is the reason i give it 2 stars . unfortunately the desserts and staff can not make up for the absurd price charged .	1441
0	i was living at 3828 n 32nd apt 132 steve at the biltmore would n't return my security deposit in amount of 1150.00 do to fact he said it was n't up to standard mine you l move in this property with it looking like this . so l contact news channel 3 on my side to report steve taken and control people deposit no return back to them .	3723
1	located inside the hard rock hotel , so it is conveniently located when hanging out here . they always have new flalvor donutsto try . their coffee rocks , but not a fan of their espresso . i go here all the time . worth it !	579
1	i came here to get my nissan rogue cleaned for my birthday . they did a good job on my car and the butt load of dog car i had in the back . though i do wish that i would have taken the time to look around my entire car because they did miss a giant milk stain that was on the side of my car that i had to end up cleaning myself . the rainbow location is what i meant to go to today and they do stellar jobs . cody h. saw some chips in my windshield and repaired them while they cleaned my car . submitted my claim fast and easy . thanks ! !	2359
1	great service very nice went to location great had keys i needed	1531
1	i have lived all over the country , and have frequented all the whole foods stores . i would rank this store average overall . there is one person that sets this whole foods apart from the rest , however- debbie at the cheese/deli counter . she is warm , friendly , and professional . she always has great suggestions for a lunchmeat or cheese ( when i ask her opinion ) , and has never done me wrong . thank you , thank you , thank you , debbie ! i know i can always count on you to brighten my day with your great service and your smile !	433
0	aggressive people , non responsive when you need them . foster i dealt with was on 3rd hair of the dog saturday morning at 11am ! they will lie to suit themselves . buyer beware with this so called organization !	524
1	have n't had a bad experience with getting my car cleaned here . i get my car washed about 5 times a month with the unlimited plan so that it is always smelling fresh . they have great discounts once you 're in that plan for some time .	127
1	terrific chinese food and very popular . king wah does a huge take-out business , but the eating-in experience is very nice as well . the regular menu is standard chinese fare , tasty and well-done , but very familiar . there are some more interesting items on the chef 's special menu , of a chinese-american variety . this is not a place to go to have your palate challenged ; it 's comfort food chinese , and well done for that .	1490
0	i wish there was something less than 1 star . absolutely unbelievably horrible experience . all these people want to do is give you the run around . very unprofessional , trying to screw people over with interest rates over 10 % , very rude . the finance manager himself shook my father 's hand and at the same time said , `` thanks for wasting our time ! '' that was right after my father offered 14k cash for a 15k car . these people are assholes . steer clear .	2851
0	oh , no thank you ! i do n't know what is wrong about this place but their drinks are way too different from other places . i mean it 's not too bad , but they do not add that much fruit as other places and their sago seemed to be old . ca n't put my finger on it , but something is wrong here . a note to myself - do not come here again .	3080
1	i hate u because i love u too much amados.. i 've ruined me.. literally . my jeans no longer fit..	763
1	this gamestop has the best customer service in the city . they give the children special attention .	2687
0	every single time i 've been here i 've had great service , seated pretty quickly . servers and waitresses are very nice . the food taste i would give a two out of five . it 's ok but nothing special , i would never go here out of my way . the prices are pretty ridiculous . be prepared to drop some though if you go here . i mean it 's not even in manhattan ? biggest complaint that i 've had is every single time i 've been here i 've had something fatally ruin my dish . i 've had hair in my dishes literally 100 % of time . mind blowing	1380
1	i had the best experience here . dylan helped me immensely with the most amazing avenger and ironman balloon arrangement . he was the best ! i will go back just based on his customer service ! ! !	1882
0	dirty . 1/2 the stuff works , and if it works you have to hunt someone down to use it . website makes it look better than it actually is .	3439
1	yeah not sure where to start i love people watching here the oxygen tanks roll . this is old school hendertucky in it finest . the food is good and the service is great .	1939
0	these guys kicked me out after last call on halloween and i froze to death and had to be resuscitated ! ! ! ! ! !	1693
1	i had come earlier in the day and they were very busy , half hour wait so i left . but i came back later in the day and the employee ( kara ) checking people in was great , remembered me and luckily got me help pretty quick this time . omar then assisted me with my new upgrade , explained my options of extra things to get with it but at the end of it i just decided to get the phone , all in all he was very helpful , good customer service .	3037
0	i should be just drove to hollywood eyebrows in mesa because i grew them out for over a month and now i have to start all over . f**king garbage . i did not want to even pay that 's how ugly i feel they look now .	3806
1	we moved in i to a new house and there was a problem with the existing washer . we had insurance but would not cover , since the issue was before we purchased our home . we call the appliance company from the web , and they fixed it and gave as a discount , it was very thoughtful . works great now .	3885
0	this is solely based on the experience of first 5min . where upon entering the resto , being forced to a bar + having been denied of seats at the dining area . ca n't speak for the foods bc we did n't even get to try them ... service kinda blew for the first 5 min to make us wan na get the f**k outta there .	688
1	i love rc willey and the selections they have . i 've been a loyal customer to mike hart for a long time now and all of my family use him too . they always stand behind there service and warranty . also , they offer in house financing and always give great interest free financing . i 've done three houses with them and referred many friends to them . my sales associate mike hart is so patient and is helpful when trying to make educated selections . hard to find good people like this and i felt so compelled to write this review , because most reviews only focus on the bad things that happen . overall , highly recommend !	439
1	cashiers office was very helpful . just go straight there for transcripts . also this place is really looking nice since i went here back in the day . i guess they got rid of the rif raff ( me haha )	2787
1	so i 've been coming here for months now . i always try to check a place out many times before making it my regular place and writing a review . this place is amazing . mimi does my nails each time and it 's on point . i always bring in a picture of a design and she pretty much does it exactly as i ask for . the place is clean , everyone is friendly , and my gel nails last weeks with no chips ( as long as i do n't pick on them ) . they are busy , so i recommend making an appointment before coming . but i love it here !	686
0	the food was so-so . the place was clean and the service was decent . ordered the carne asada fries and actually think the meat , sour cream and guacamole would 've been better on fresh tortilla chips than on fries . also would 've preferred real shredded cheese vs. liquid cheese . overall , i 'd only give it 2 stars . was more fast food mexican than what we 'd prefer .	857
1	the best place for mexican food is this . i 've never had great mexican food like casa flores , and i do n't even eat mexican ! if you 're craving mexican food stop on by to casa flores ! best damn mexican food ever !	340
0	i liked my therapist , and i enjoyed the therapy process . however , they screwed up my billing . i have spoken with them over a dozen times and received ( no exxageration ) over 75 phone calls from their third party billing vendor since first going in november last year . their office is entirely clueless , and despite receiving payment from the insurance company ( which i had to handle and arrange because of physiotherapy associates incompetence ) , i still receive two to three phone calls a week . do not go here . there are a lot of great therapist whose offices will not treat you like garbage .	2423
0	run-of-the-mill food . astonishingly poor service . like , comically inept . you will eat , you will drink . just do n't expect anything interesting , professional , or noteworthy .	3344
0	do n't be fooled by the glossy exterior : this is an older hotel with many cosmetic overhauls , but with aging bones beneath . shower had next to no pressure . rooms have been hastily but sloppily renovated to resemble apartment suites . breakfast options are weak at beat , including the powdered `` just add water '' coffee they serve . moderately disappointed , especially for what they charge for a single night . take the time and look elsewhere .	1244
1	excellent service . i took my mercedes there to have my windows tinted . the gentlemen that waited on me was really nice . he took his time with me and showed me all the percentages of tint . i did n't think my permit parking tag would show thru the darker tint , so he took the tag off of my car and placed it inside his car ( his windows were tinted the same percentage that i wanted mine ) to show me that it was visible . the other guy took only 2 hrs to tint the windows while i waited at the shop . thank you so much .	199
0	i should 've went with my gut and seeing the bad reviews on yelp.. this salon is down the street wanted to give it a shot . my nail lady could 've done a much better job but she hurt me quite a few times with the nail grinder and kept shaking her head every time she did.. i got acrylic with polish and wow my nails are very uneven once i stepped outside and got a better look.. sadly i wo n't be coming back since there 's just so many other places.. on to the next	2372
0	this is the worst property management company i have ever dealt with . most of the employees do not speak english . they are also known very well for trying to keep security deposits after property has been left in good condition .	1578
0	stopped in with coworkers for a girl' s night out . not enough space for everything they have going on . i do n't want to be on top of the table next to me . plus , we could hear the woman in charge talking about the guests . she so needs a copy of customer service for dummies ! ! reminded us of the asian nail place seinfeld episode . did not make a good impression on us .	935
1	had been hunting around for a good stylist since i moved to canada . finally found thomas at donato spa . very skilled , precise , open to your ideas but will use his expertise to guide you . have gone twice so far and very happy with each result !	2509
1	this is my go-to for pedicures cuz it 's super close to my office and my feet can go from rough as sandpaper to silky smooth in the span of a lunch hour ! they 're cheap ( $ 25ish ) , clean & do a super job !	3463
0	i do n't get it , man . this restaurant gets tons of hype and people love it . i think a lot of people love it because it 's the cool thing to do , but this food is seriously mediocre . i go here occasionally and only because other people want to , and every time the food has been bland and boring . i mean , the presentation of the food and the atmosphere are very nice , and people wan na go somewhere trendy in tremont , so this place does fine , but in terms of food ... just nah .	487
1	so much fun for little kids . impressed with how clean . i will be back . has plenty of areas for parents to sit and watch . keeps kids entertained	2969
1	delicious afghan food , and quick service ! i had the salad + chicken tandoori kabob and it was delicious .	1347
1	an excellent bookstore and a community resource . of special note is the collection of harvey goldberg lectures-these are a must have for history buffs . the staff is knowledgeable and accessible . some of them have even made history in madison , written books , or both .	3314
0	i 'm not sure what to rate it ... everything was so sweet . i love pad thai and there pad thai was just not doing it . for the price i paid for it was decent i guess i just thought it would be better because of all the good reviews i heard about it . i feel like i just had a sugar rush . and the waitress which i ca n't blame , was the only one there left our glass empty and did not even refill it . i could n't drink the thai tea anymore ! it was sweet as well the atmosphere and ambience was nice and relaxing .	1361
1	cool place , but they need a system to seat people . my hubby n i went and the girls were nice and cute . we had to find our own seats out front though . drinks were ok , nothing special . did n't notice where the club part was ... out by 5am	1754
1	this is a perfect place for a date or an appetizer and wine , but it is n't my favorite pizza or italian place in town . next time i 'll try the pasta , because it looked divine . they have great specials ! they are very kind to wine drinkers as well . when i first went i did not know my wines very well ( i still do n't ) and they brought me several samples without me even asking . fantastic service !	368
1	one of the most honest and quality individuals i have crossed paths with ... his son as well ... .and they are mechanics ... go figure ! been going to frank for over 9 years ... my whole family ... .not fancy ... but 5 star quality !	2318
1	i got the special , which was a smoked brisket sandwich . i thought it was very flavorful , and i enjoyed it . the sides i chose were the fries , and caesar salad . both of them were satisfying . my favorite thing is the southern style sweet tea they have , and i recommend the sweet barbecue sauce , it 's one of the best i 've tasted in quite some time . the ambiance could be a little better , but it 's not bad . enjoy !	1547
1	i give this store 5 stars ! the customer service i received from manager kenneth was outstanding ! ! ! i was in desperate need of an air mattress and he took me to the home department where they were located . he filled me in on the return policy and helped me with my questions . at first i could n't find the mattress i wanted and he kindly took me to the sporting goods department and there it was ... the mattress i wanted . thank you kenneth for your excellent customer service ! you are the reason i shop at that walmart !	3810
0	this mall is the equivalent of metro center now-a-days . honestly i do n't recommend leaving your vehicle unattended . this is the type of mall that the people with money avoid unless it 's a restaurant on the outer mall areas , or in n out . the starbucks here even sucks . probably the best thing is the shoe department in dillard 's downstairs at the north entrance .	2815
0	horrible ! this is the most terrible club i 've ever been in my entire life . security man is mean , and the place is empty but the people who in charged made u standing in line , in freezing temperature . do not come to this place because u will be unhappy and depressed for 7days afterwards .	2200
0	this place really sucks . we have been there several times with our grandkids because they like it . food has been terrible several times had to return to get the hamburger corrected . usually burnt . just a bad place to eat . maybe other steak and shakes are better . do n't know how this place stays open .	151
0	i wish no stars was an option . went to look at a used vehicle , gave them notice i was coming and they did n't even decide to vacuum out the vehicle or wash off the spilt milk from the seat . they do n't think it is worth even doing a basic cleaning on the vehicle until you commit to buying it . this is the second time visiting this dealership , there wo n't be a third .	2210
0	i have been to a lot of events in many cities across the united states and this venue is one of the poorer facilities i have been too , almost exclusively because of experience . the entry into the venue left hundreds waiting out in the cold until after the show started due to excessive security scanning , an understaffed crew and slow ticket processing . once inside the poor stair lighting and aisle marking made it very difficult to find our seats . we missed 50 % of the show we came to see despite arriving 30 minutes prior to show time . will not go back here for anything .	2187
1	bunkhouse i feel is a bar where anyone can go and have a great time ! the bartenders provide premier customer service . they make quality drinks and provide excellent recommendations . they have a pool table , karoke and all sorts of activities going on . i had a great time learning salsa . lol . quite the experience ! the crowd at bunkhouse is very welcoming . the bar is extremely clean and just a pleasant environment . i will be stopping by again ! highly recommend bunkhouse !	3252
0	this park is a little sad for a number reasons . it has so much potential with it 's large play area , beautiful pond , paths and fields . i have never seen so much animal poop in a park and it does smell pretty bad . there are so much better parks , maybe all of them do n't have ponds but maybe we do n't need a man made pond in the middle of the desert , especially if you 're not gon na clean it and let the evil duck monsters take over .	367
1	the best iced capp i 've ever had the salty carmel flavour is awesome the best i ever had after a 1 km walk in the summer afternoon heat with a cheese croissant toasted with butter love this treat ! !	3675
0	the place was horrid ! do n't go off the strip to go here , unless you want to hear the same 5 songs all night long ! the night i went it was she pratt 's birthday and thats all we heard about , even after she was gone ! no one cares about her . the only plus to the night was we did n't have to wait in line ... woo !	3596
0	my 2 and 4 year old had fun here . there is a lot to do ... bounce house , trampoline , play area for 5 and under . the only downside is the price much more expensive than jumpstreet . cost over 20 an hour for the first hour for my kids to play . cheaper for each additional hour , but ended up being nearly 40 for 2 hours . jumpstreet is way better .	1664
0	customers do n't always come first here . beware ! it seems the owner only looks out for his bottom line . save your money .	3417
1	at first i was hesitant on trying the phone number on the website . my wife came down with an illness the day of our arrival . i called and spoke to dr. logan who prescribed her medication . we picked it up at a local cvs . my credit card information was stolen so i only had cash . dr. logan trusted me enough to meet with me the following day to check up on my wife and receive payment after the fact . thank you dr. logan !	2837
0	this was once a great place , but they have kicked out most of their regulars . there is a zero cussing policy in a bar . now all their old customers hang out at the dorf haus . with out any customers the freshness of the food has suffered greatly . they have began cutting corners like not change fryer grease and serving food that is past its prime . it is sad that a second grade teacher as bartender can destroy a business ... .	353
1	love ihop they are over priced but i do enjoy the $ 5.99 breakfast which btw is not on the menu ok make sure you ask for it ok it 's a pretty hefty breakfast too guys . you get 2 pieces of bacon or sausage 2 eggs any style , hash browns or grits and toast or two buttermilk pancakes . it 's a great deal so why is n't it on the menu i do n't know any who get it it 's great !	520
1	poke was quite popular among instagram users , and i had never really tried any until i bumped into this little bar . conclusion : the poke bowl that i got was good as the fish was fresh , toppings were nicely prepared veggies , with delicious sauce and a base of sushi rice . worth trying : )	309
0	horrible . missed the first appointment due to forgetting since having booked it 4 months in advance ... . would n't even consider seeing my husband as a patient . what a joke	405
0	they do have really yummy treats here but the staff is always so unfriendly and unwelcoming . seems like it 's a bother for us to be there . this is the second time at this location and we were treated the same both times . we 're done here .	3556
1	this is a terrific establishment ! they are very professional and prompt getting you in and out for your procedures .	582
0	they double charged me for portion of my treatment . once the insurance paid & i took proof to them that they owed me back 1/2 my money , they agreed -- but never gave it back ! many phone calls , emails -- to no avail . they tell me they are issuing the refund , but never do . they never return phone calls or emails . they just lost two patients -- myself & my husband . we will not be going back .	2054
1	friendly people . you get to put your own button on your popcorn . which is good for me as i 'm a butter ( flavoring ) fan . best deal in town for movies . great deals monday thru thursday and before noon for the other days . clean . if you join their stubs reward program you get free movies for money spend and upgrades at the concession stand . a medium for the price of a small ! which lets face it is still a rip off but for me , part of the movie experience .	2406
1	my husband and i came in for couches and the entire team was amazing , especially paula she was our main sales woman she is such a sweetheart and she went above and beyond to help get the best deal we possibly could and with that we where also able to afford a bedroom set . so we highly recommend you visit paula and the rest of the ashley furniture team .	1794
0	complete hell ! maybe if parents were n't so busy getting massages , they could keep an eye on their bratty kids . 2 hours of watching kids fight , cry , scream & steal toys from each other . my kids enjoyed it-but my 1 year old twins could n't play in the `` toddler '' section due to no toys being available with alot of older kids using the area . we wo n't go back again & my kids do n't seem too dissapointed in that decision .	1631
1	i 've always liked this place for a quick burrito or quesadilla . the shredded pork is my go to meat here and the tortillas are delicious and fluffy not like the typical tortillas . service is great but can be slow so i usually place an online order which is quick and convenient .	1365
1	this store was cute ! i really liked the layout of the store and the staff was quite friendly . i was the only one in the store on monday afternoon , which was nice . unfortunately , they did n't have the jacket i wanted in my size .	746
1	i know you are n't expecting much from your taco bell however , i did call them with a concern ( i 'm vegetarian ) the gentleman on the phone went over all the ingredients with me on the phone . something i did n't ask for but he was willing to go the `` xtra '' step . thank you ! people are so quick to leave negative feedback ! i challenge you to express the good as well ! thank you !	1341
0	they did n't have the room i reserved . it 's did n't have the two beds . i have three kids , so it was a little rough . my son had to sleep on the couch and the roll away did n't fit . the breakfast was n't bad . check out the view from my room .	3802
0	rent a car from any other place . they refuse to give me my deposit on the car back . they will not work with me and now i have to get my insurance agency involved . absolutely miserable and frustrating experience .	2067
1	this is an amazing nail salon . it is extremely clean and has hundreds of gel choices . the staff is friendly and accommodating which is so refreshing in a nail salon ! tammy is great at doing freehand nail designs . i highly recommend this place and will definitely be a regular !	3333
1	this is a good pawnshop with great people ! the employees make all the difference here , i 've been to many pawnshops in the area and the employees here are by far the nicest that i have encountered . they give you respect and will always take the time out of their day to talk with you or look at an item or show you an item .	3773
0	wow ! ! ! first really bad experience at a target- asked an employee where something was he told me - no it was n't there went and asked again he said he did n't know that was n't his section i would have to check with someone else and walked away went up to the front desk woman behind the counter said i will be right back went in back came out with another employee they were trying to solve an issue i was the only one standing there - they completely ignored me i walked away - going somewhere else	3259
0	customer service is awful here ! ! ! ! groups of women that work in women 's clothing on the 2nd floor standing around talking about their personal lives instead of greeting and assisting a customer . nordstrom management do something about your customer service ! ! ! !	1907
0	they cancelled my appointment without phoning me and i had to drive there to find out . all they said is yes they could have called me .	2520
1	inexpensive , quick service . great deal for an oil change and glen the guy at the counter was friendly and helpful . mike the manager checked in to make sure everything was going smoothly , he was awesome ! i 'll definitely be back and will certainly recommend this place to friends and family for service .	1619
0	three words ... wtf ! i paid 8 dollars for some broth w barely any noodles in it ! you know what i can buy w 8 dollars ? ? ? two lipsticks ! 8 dollars should mean a big bowl of food . and i got a ham sandwich and it was nast-ay . go too lee 's sandwich instead for reals	673
0	where to start ? with the fact that there is no seating in the lobby ? with the fact that all the kennel buildings lack air conditioning and all the dogs are suffering in evaporative `` cooling '' ? how about the issue that they never answer the phone ? or maybe the issue that they euthanize perfectly healthy dogs even when people are on their way to come and get them ? or maybe its the snotty way the counter folks treat customers ? the only reason to go here is to adopt an animal to save it from this disorganized , underfunded crap hole .	3626
0	the place was kind of cool and the food was good . fish tacos as good as any i have had . however the staff is/was terrible . not sure they cared if i was here or not . too bad , could have been a very fun night . instead it was just a missed opportunity ! ! ! !	427
0	in the middle of my appointment they had to reschedule because they had to go to lunch ? what a unprofessional experience this was ! the front desk is great 1 star to the dentist ! !	3053
0	worse service ever ! ! ! ! ! ! do n't bother with this village inn . the management is awful . there are too many other village inn 's in the area to deal with the poor service . the one on power & ray is a better option .	1029
0	beautiful studio inside and a lot of people . i stopped by to check it out and find out about enrollment . however , there was no one at the front desk to answer questions , and the only person who could do that was busy with their clients in the lobby and a little overwhelmed . she suggested i come back later . unfortunately , that was n't possible for me today . i used to work out at orange theory studio in ca and loved the workouts . wanted to give them a try ... the first impression : understaffed , poor customer service .	310
0	this place is a joke ... not only is it a shitty over priced venue i saw some one getting tasered by police and recorded it i got kicked out and was threaten to be arrested.. they will kick you out for nothing . so if you want to waste your money this is the best spot to go !	17
0	i do n't like that rush of air/smoke/steam that they blow on you when you 're dancing on the dance floor . i thought i was going to have a heart attack/die because i was right underneath it . i felt like i was being hosed down .	3596
0	this was not a pleasant experience . the lady working there barely spoke english . there was the weird 'give me your cash and i 'll start your washer ' thing going on . rowdy crowd of customers .	2194
0	bought as a `` gift '' for myself and what a joke ! the housekeeper never rinsed her cleaning sponge until she was done cleaning all of my counters , moped my bathroom floors and kitchen floors with the same dirty water , never once using rinse water , and to top it off she used the scrubber side of her sponge to `` clean '' the outside of my black microwave leaving permanent scratch marks across the finish . there were many other unsettling problems i do n't have time to mention . i had my service on 8/20 and reported this the same day . it has been 2 months and there is still to be resolution .	2854
1	i have been to this sam 's club twice since moving to the las vegas area and have gotten gas here once . there was a little wait for the gas but hey , the prices are cheaper than the competition so everybody and their momma are here filling up their tanks . the sam 's was average . nothing stood out so 4 starz for not being dirty or the people being unusually impolite . ca n't ask for too much more than that .	2172
0	this place is awful i tried several time s hair in the cold soup then went back to the bar side 2 years later they said sorry we are slow so you need to leave . went to totos the other mexican restaurant had great service drinks laughter this place is is joke . try totos way better	340
0	the food was cold and portions were small for the price . i also ordered a tres leches dessert and it tasted like it had been in the refrigerator for weeks .	210
1	so if you 're going to a waffle house , you are expecting waffle house food and they are amazing at consistency . waffle perfection according to teenagers ... and the over easy eggs are as oerfect as you remember 20 years ago . i rate it 4 stars because they deliver exactly what you 're looking for from them . do i prefer different fun awesome brunch and breakfasts ? ? of course ! but.. if you need waffle house you know it 's going to be exactly what you want .	241
0	honestly , the only reason i ever come in here is to use their bathroom . so , the only reason the shops is even getting 2 stars is because they are kept relatively clean . i can not even tell you what shops are in this place .	3152
1	diagnosing and treatment is excellent and very efficient . all the staff are just great . everyone cares a lot about your pet . they greet them by name if they are returning..	1603
1	the spa at green valley ranch is a dream . even with a local 's discount it 's a little pricey , but worth it . i got a swedish 60 minute massage and it was glorious . essential oils , talented masseurs and calming atmosphere took the most ticklish person and brought her into a world of relaxation ( that would be me ) . besides the massage services , the spa pool , gym and locker rooms are well equipped , clean and beautiful . poolside food and drink service does n't suck either . also the endless supply of pretzels and tea is a plus .	2651
0	if you have a choice , pass . old and dated . not to the standard of a marriott . it will do in a pinch but definitely not a place to stay if other options are available .	230
0	they screwed one of my friends over , by further damaging the car . cut off the throttle cable , and offered to fix it on the side !	2086
0	this was probably one of the worst pad see ews that i 've ever had . it was a very small portion and it was also super dry . all of the noodles were stuck together so there was no color on most of them . the chicken was also so tough that it was chewy and rubbery .	973
0	this place is horrible ! ! ! i had an appointment to get my four kids in amd they canceled bc they did n't have a doctor in , then why make the appointments in the first place ? ? ? ? and even then they could n't give me another date that would work with me . i do n't recommend this place to anyone . they are unreliable ! ! !	663
0	i have always been to the oasis location on greenway and 32nd st and the experience there is amazing but this location on camelback and 67th ave different story ... the employees are rude . no hello no smile nothing also they talk to customers with a very offensive tone ... . product is good but done recommend their churros locos ... im paying for churros locos not cueros locos nasty !	1065
1	great nail salon ! family owned . i really enjoyed their attention to details when doing my gel nails . clean shop . great prices .	1767
1	great food and atmosphere ! try the shrimp and grits and grape salad . great place to watch the game and play pool .	201
0	2nd worst massage my husband & i have ever experienced . amie & another man are friendly . facility is clean . but i highly doubt if they even went to massage school . there are no techniques at all . after i paid a she just took the money , counted & distributed the tips without any `` thank you '' . i gave 2 stars for cleanliness but could 've been just one . we will not go back there again : (	463
1	i 've been buying flowers from you for a few years . very impressed with quality and customer service . getting married in 3 days and will come to you .	38
0	all sports authorities in the valley are closing if they have n't already .	3109
0	walked in wanting to start a monthly membership the staff changed my mind on that one , they were far from helpful . so i decided to pay for my one visit , i jumped in the big apple for a few minutes first . then the versaspa for a quick spray tan . i had an event and needed color fast . i think if the staff took the time to be more informative & friendly i would of signed up that day for a membership . but the person seemed like i was inconveniencing them .	1343
1	these guys are amazing ! they replaced the whole furnace and are also taking care of the filter changes . if you have a loved one who can not take care of these things themselves choose temprite ! they came right away when they said they would and the guys that do the work are exceptional . they take the needed time and answer all of your questions . i would call them anytime . thank you justin and all of your employees for the superb service .	2339
0	caution ! ! ! shop at your own risk : they wo n't refund their postage ( or yours ) even when the product they recommended does n't work ! they are also very slow to reply to e-mails and do not return phone calls .	3470
0	unsanitary . the guy with spiked hair did my manicure . he kept sniffling , then leaned his head over and wiped his nose on his shirt . after that he began sneezing , big , hefty sneezes . then i got this look from him , like `` so , what 's your problem , `` and he asked , `` is everything okay ? '' that was on thursday . today is sunday . i feel achy . i 'm hoping that maybe i 'm just stiff from sleeping in one spot all night . this guy creeped me out . i had hoped for a pleasant and relaxing treat for myself . i got a haloween treat .	2297
0	the quality has been day and night . the chicken filet used to be huge and the quality of the meat was amazing . after the original owner left , i have tried 3 times and it 's been very disappointed .	566
0	i was disappointed how hot it was inside the stadium , the roof was closed and a/c was on however , myself and everybody around us were incredibly hot and sweaty the entire game . we decided to order a beer and a water to cool off from the small beer kiosk just outside our section and both the beer and water were warm , awful . we were in section 302 .	2005
0	sooo ... . the last two times i 've come here , the service and attention to detail has just disappeared . it 's so disappointing because i just paid $ 35 for a car was that included pet hair removal and they never even opened the trunk . i just left there , went to the grocery store and this is what i find when i go to put my groceries in . i could go back but , it 's such a waste of my time and i have groceries now to deal with . i 'll be looking for a new place to have my car detailed .	2359
0	horrible return policy . bought a sleeping bag as gift for daughter with cash . on wanting to return it , they would only give store credit . great looking store at entrance to park but that shadiness stopped me cold . all my spending on four active kids goes anywhere but this shifty retailer .	3339
0	i did not receive my drink . the driver said it was n't put out , the person on the phone said the driver forgot it . my yellow curry was only 1/2 full . do n't order here . the restaurant did refund my drink . thank you .	1203
1	i love dr. agniezka chrostowski , she really cares for her patients , she is professional and kind at the same time .	1598
0	we ate here the other night with three other friends . the patio was very nice . you have no idea you are right by a busy street . the food was good , but portions were very small . also , my wife ordered a pepperoni pizza that was the worst pizza i 've ever tasted . everyone at te table tried it and the consensus was it was a grocery store frozen pizza that was microwaved . our server was very pleasant , but between portion size and quality i 'd have to say this restaurant struggled in our opinion .	979
0	we ordered a large pizza which was about $ 13 , and were surprised at how small it was when we picked it up . it was a 10 cut , although it was more like an 8 cut with two tiny extra pieces . way overpriced and service was n't great . i only gave them 2 stars because the pizza itself was pretty good .	425
1	chances are we 'll all need some legal representation at some point in our busy lives . when my need arose i was referred to mayes telles . what an excellent choice . i had the pleasure of working with attorneys david lish , mark mendoza and their wonderful paralegal lupita lopez . all are as professional as you 'd expect from a successful law firm . from the moment i walked through their doors to the time i left they were courteous and addressed all of my concerns . they also validated my parking ( always a plus ) . any time one of my friends or colleagues have legal issues , i do n't hesitate to refer them to mayes telles .	2391
0	female skinny bartender is a complete bitch . totally inattentive and just hangs out with her boyfriend instead of serving . have experienced this about 3 times in the last week . time to find a different hangout downtown .	3562
1	there were six cops here when we came in . i 'm not exaggerating . it was a complete cliche . coffee was good , donuts were fresh even though it was the afternoon .	2347
0	you only come here for one reason ... .the $ 5 large cheese pizza . it 's carry out only and anyone who lives within a 4 block radius of this place knows all about this . the pizza is n't that great but if it 's midnight , you 're piss drunk and need some food ... .this is where you come .	662
1	i just purchased my second car with san tan hyundai . my first experience was so smooth , that when it came time to get a new car i went back . every single person there was so amazing ! i truly believe they care so much about the customers . jim my sales rep was so awesome . he treated me like family ! all the managers were so caring and really went to bat for me . the customer service is amazing ! ! ! i will tell everyone i know to buy a car from san tan hyundai . i 'm a loyal customer for life !	3041
1	we go every year . this is what a fair should be ( not like the smelly , dirty county fair that occurs in the slums of phoenix every year ) . rides , carnival games , food ( funnel cake ! ) , ostrich races ... and the weather is almost always perfect . parking is inexpensive and you can always get advance-purchase reduced rates at fry 's grocery store .	759
1	hidden restaurant in an industrial area , close to the airport . only came here because of yelp - there 's absolutely no chance of randomly ending up in this plaza . lots of food choices at very good prices . we tried the beef samosa , lentil soup w fresh pita and a chicken wrap . all very tasty , and it seemed to be very popular with big families on a tuesday evening . service was a bit slow , about 25minutes wait , so come prepared . i do n't think we could 've found better value and taste in the yyz vicinity .	808
0	avoid this company . we bought a groupon . they just showed up and and refused to honor it ! it was a stunning lack of professional courtesy . we had three rooms that were to be cleaned and they refused to do any . the guy actually just left and said his boss told him to leave , as we would n't be happy . we are going to contact groupon , the bbb , and google to let as many people know about this company . we 've already done the message boards in tega cay to let our neighbors know .	1983
0	this place has the rudest waitstaff i 've ever met . no one is friendly . food was mediocre . we wo n't be back and we do n't recommend to anyone .	480
1	wow this was amazing ice cream ! we will be coming back . lots of flavors and so creamy . the young lady was so helpful at the counter and helped us with samples of flavors to try . the only bad thing is no inside seating in very hot arizona .	16
1	i was against eye lash extensions because i thought they would ruin my natural lashes until i went to see nela at ilash lab . she educated me on how to take care of them and now i religiously go see her every 3 weeks for my fill . so many ways to save money and she does an outstanding job ! definitely recommend her and ilash lab !	3685
1	this review is for the new york new york casino level starbucks : the casino level starbuck 's adds excitement to the starbuck 's experience . hanging out here , in the faux greenwich village streetscape is like hanging out in a faux new york city . the atmosphere is fun ! fun ! fun ! just like the new york new york casino . hang out here in the evening and you 'll overhear the dueling piano show . above you you 'll hear the manhattan express whirling above . this is a great starbuck 's for people watching . if you want excitement with your coffee in a faux big apple , i recommend this starbuck 's .	3558
0	i 'm shocked this location has anything higher than a 1 star rating . the staff is the rudest i have ever encountered in the food service industry by far . i 've tried on a few occasions to `` give them one more chance `` and i just ca n't get past the blatant attitudes and sub par food . if you want decent chinese food , go some place else because you 're not getting it here sadly .	1075
1	i was only on the plane for one hour but i wished the flight was longer . in 2013 , i flew from las vegas to lax for less than $ 100 . i wished the flight was longer . what 's so awesome about this airline ? -neon pink cabin lights -prices are similar to jetblue and delta -sometimes awesome full sized headphones are provided . -you can order food and drinks through the in-flight entertainment system . verdict : if you got a choice and are flying within the us , then being with a virgin ai n't so bad .	1623
0	pure incompetency . was kept waiting all day for a tax return and they charge a fortune and no one called to tell me that other forms were required even though i was told that someone would call ! horrific ! ! !	1377
1	unique and delicious desserts . quite pricey but nice to try at least once . had the oreo waffle , and it was delicious without feeling too dense or sugary .	1821
0	dirty dirty dirty . if you do n't mind filthy ( and many times broken ) equipment , this place is ok . it 's cheap and has most of the equipment needed for a decent workout .	2063
0	after seeing high reviews of this place i figured i would give it a shot . yea never again ! ! the ice cream tasted like it was in the freezer for months ! ! ! and the service the girl gave me there was horrible ! helped the other people that just walked in behind me before helping us and saw that since they tipped her was the reason she was so fast to help them ! never again waist of money	2559
0	the only reason why i am giving this store 2 stars because it 's very nicely decorated . i came in due to a last minute cake pop run for a 3 year olds birthday party . in desperate need , we tried to get the price lowered just a tad bit like a dollar or two , but no budge . we proceeded to by a dozen expensive cake pops only to be disgustingly disappointed by the taste . the appearance was lovely , but the taste was the opposite . very bland cake , no flavor ! even the coating was plain tasting . way too expensive and not good enough .	981
0	guys here are rude , place is jammed , dark and dingy . everything is overpriced and they do n't negotiate prices . i would never buy anything from here .	3067
0	everything was great and would have given it 5 stars except for the food trucks . we waited an hour and half for 2 hot dogs and then the milkshake machine broke and we had to go to the dessert truck ... . this guy gave us one out of 2 milkshakes and when we asked for the second he threw paper towels and slammed the freezer door shut and muttered something i could n't hear under his breath .	3707
1	kind staff and great pool . i was very pleased with the location and everything it offered . though i have other places that i favor and were booked out , id definitely come back .	2865
0	do not sign up for the vip club . they will automatically renew it by charging your credit card every year .	2557
0	yet another gas station where the air station is broken . fix the darn air and have a little service at the service station !	3797
1	visited the crepe cafe on 5/26/17 in the arizona biltmore area . the crepe was delicious , staff was friendly and professional and restaurant was clean . i ordered food at the counter and was served in 10 minutes . this would be a great location if you were in a hurry . love the whole crepe cafe concept . i would definitely return and recommend to others . i will also try the other locations . general manager and owner both spoke to me . they genuinely acted like they cared about their customers . great customer experience at this location .	1011
1	my experience with this company was wonderful . we went in to see about laptops and came out with a great laptop . the price was just right . i highly recommend this company to do business with . tell them elias sent you .	893
1	really cheap and really fast internet . they 've made a lot of improvements and they 're really getting better .	3319
1	as you are reading this , you are probably an overweight $ hithead and have a higher standard with your eyes than your c0ck can tolerate . so get over yourself , lose that ego and get on down here . after a few cheap pitchers of modello , you wont gaf about a fupa . while our uber said the girls would be orangutans , only half of them were , and while not the prettiest or slimmest , they will kick back with u and bring your third leg to life .	3751
1	finished a 5 day cleanse and i loved it . so easy was never hungry always satisfied . will definitely do again especially when need to drop 5+ pounds . thanks karma juice ! ! !	1808
0	had issue with office staff , they decided it was acceptable to be rude to me . when i asked dr for suggestions for a new doctor , he knew exactly why and never asked me what happened . very disappointed and short sighted . i could tell by the look on his face his opinion of me had changed and given the nature of my last visit which was extremely personal , he should have made the recommendation for me to see another doctor prior to seeing me medically .	2991
0	crappy driving school , all fake reviews written by their instructors . never learnt anything there . waste of money and time	2705
1	love this place ! helpful staff and good classes too . friday 's are ladies nights , and right off the free way ,	1128
1	we were their aug. 1 . the chicken tenders the french fried roll and creamy gravy was the best we ever tasted . even though its a little further away , well be back for more . tasty , tasty food .	862
1	the staff is always friendly and ready to deal . if your buying or selling you will leave with a smile . the wide variety of items they sell , keeps me coming back for more . if you go , ask for travis . he is a good guy to deal with . but , there are other sales people there , that can help you . they always have plenty help their .	893
1	came here with a friend one weekend just for a stroll . did n't know there was such a nice big park close to me . it has a lake , a number of places to have a nice picnic , a train that goes around part of the park for the kiddies , playgrounds , tennis courts , a splash pad . only thing that i found unpleasant was the smell of the lake and that there were dead fish floating . eeeww . will probably be back in the cooler months . park is kinda hidden in the block between rural and mcclintock and between ray and chandler . plenty of parking all around the park .	680
1	awesome qt swisher a are two two packs for $ 3 so i 'm happy . they finally recognize me so i do n't get id 'd any more haha . warning : when leaving the qt be aware that it make take up to 10 minutes to get out during rush hour . thank you .	3797
0	place is terrible . came in to just get my retainer checked out , had an apportionment at 9:30 did n't get looked at til 13:30 ! ridiculous ! waited 3 hours for something that took 5 minutes . staff is so slow and they get distracted by the littlest things . unprofessional . go somewhere else	2079
0	this place has rude people . burnt meat and dirty restrooms . stay away . come for that tacos stay get roped in for the garbage .	593
1	stopped in for a late afternoon lunch and was pleasantly surprised . we had wraps and waffle fries ( add cheese ) and everything tasted fresh and delicious . beer selection is good and ice cold .	1510
0	while i 'm a fan of jlo , and admire her range of talent do n't spend your hard earned $ $ $ $ to see this show . it 's loud , much to sexual and is targeted to the morons . if you really want to enjoy her watch her on shades of blue . your already paying for tv so it will be basically free . do n't get me wrong she is multi talented , but this is not her genre . sorry jlo , i 'm a nuyorican to , but i understand it 's about the $ $ $ !	1771
1	if you guys like me-va-me , then you 'll also love this place because it is exactly like me-va-me , but a different name and location , but it does n't have much choice in their menu , but the service is great .	89
1	place hits everything i looks for in a nail spa . clean . friendly . clean ! really appreciate that they remember me . always asking how my mom and sister are . ( i often bring them here to get nails done when they are in town ) hannah 's offers all nail spa services and waxing and some other skin care as well .	2886
0	every single time i call for an appointment i have to wait at least 15-30 mins on the phone , and if i leave a voicemail message for a call back . usually not until rt b4 they close or the next day . one time it took me a whole week of phone tags b4 i finally got someone to schedule an appointment for my baby . it so frustrating ! ! ! ! !	1964
0	shady business . damaged my brand new truck bumper and failed to tell me , even hid it . picked it up in the dark with the tailgate down and by the time i noticed there was no way to prove it . karma will bite someone in the a $ $ later .	203
0	the facilities are beautiful but this place is poorly run . we stayed here for a wedding and they lost the bride and groom 's reservation not once , but twice ! the father of the bride was also given keys to a room that was already occupied . he discovered this little mistake when he walked into a room with undergarments thrown all over the place . the most irritating aspect is they did nothing make up for all the mistakes .	230
0	manager refused to return item that my wife and i bought . it is a dual camera system for my two vehicles , they have more wires than the salesperson didnt inform us of the amount of wires required to hook them up . i was informed that they are now discontinued and unabled to be resold . how are the customer to know if an item is being discontinued . i will now shop at other locations other then this store ... ... .other companys will get my business .	494
0	wow the call operator was insanely rude . terrible on the customer service front . this needs to be resolved by atlas if they want my service again . seriously , this is why uber is taking over .	3011
0	if i could give this restaurant 1 star i would . terrible service , i 'm pretty sure our waiter was high . he was very awkward and kept coming over to our table and muttering under gis breath . food is disappointing . how can you screw up basic breakfast is beyond me.the bacon and potatoes were cold and tasted like they had been out for a day ... very stale . the whole experience was very weird and disappointing . there are much better restaurant options on mass on street that i would have rather gone to .	628
1	this audio express is the bomb ! honest , friendly , and fast ! i would n't go anywhere else to buy and get systems installed . i was very impressed with the wide variety of options and the knowledge of the employees . nothing but 5 stars here , definitely recommend stopping in this place if your looking to get a system !	2427
1	excellent prices here . they really do take care of all your needs here . for $ 35 you can get an hour pedicure with a neck and shoulder massage . you even get 2 free designs on your toes for that price . i would highly recommend this place to everyone	2297
1	i have been wanting to come here forever , it 's bigger than i expected and was a busy sunday . i got an everything bagel with cheese and tomato toasted to go . super fast ! i did n't wait that long at all , surprised for how busy it was . the employees that waited on me were helpful and really nice , i believe it 's a family owned place . i looked at the menu ( it 's gigantic ! ) and thought the prices were a bit too high . my bagel sandwich was perfect , fast and hot . i would come back again for breakfast . everything looked delicious and pretty large portions .	325
1	i 've been going to this convenient store for over three years and i can not say enough good things about it . the employees are just amazing all the way from morgan the manager down to blake and several other who work the registers . just awesome people .	3057
1	made an appointment . did n't have to wait . private room for my friend and i. jay was great . hot stones and oil are a must . thank you !	2399
1	highly recommend ! i 've been coming year for years , even with my mom as a minor . my first visit i came here and got a double nose piercing . my piercer was extremely knowledgeable and quick . later on nicola did my septum and let me tell you it was my least painful piercing . my septum healed so well and the placement is perfect . my daith piercing was perfectly placed and pierced too . the last time i came in was on my 18th birthday to get my nipples pierced . jd made the process really comfortable and it hurt way less than expected . really on top of of their store and who they hire . clean too .	2790
0	can someone please point out the reasons why anyone would frequent this place ? definitely not planning to come back . maybe it was the indifferent yet holier-than-thou barista . maybe it was the shitty coffee and food . maybe it was the 3 millimeter thick film of filth covering every surface in the place . in summary : kiva han is a dirty hipster dive .	596
1	i enjoy going in here mainly for the wednesday $ 5.99/lb salad bar and cooked food bar because overall , this store is relatively pricey . i guess that 's what to expect with grocery stores that specialize in providing organic , high quality food . but on wednesdays , the price and quality of that salad bar is an amazing value to anyone .	433
0	this must be the worse service centre in usa . firstly they do n't have the part and ca n't even offer u are courtesy car . they are so slow they should move this place to china . totally terrible service , you should drive your car off a cliff instead of letting these guys touch it . a bunch of idiots who do n't know what they are doing . regret buying anything from honda .	2210
1	this place is the best place to get dim sum ! the food is delicious and the staff is always welcoming and attentive to our needs , the only thing im not crazy about it the washrooms , and anyone who knows me knows i like to see how clean a place is based on the cleanliness of their bathrooms	0
1	when i first started a membership with this location the girls were all very knowledgeable and were consistently giving me tips on how to better my tan ! they are all so friendly and welcoming ! bri is always checking in to see how my last visit was and making sure i am comfortable with the amount of time and the lotions i had previously used ! she definitely cares about her customers and insures a relaxing environment for everyone ! i look forward to each of my sessions !	3104
1	went on a friday night and it was great . waitress was very attentive even though we had a large group that was at 4 different tables . tried 5 of the appetizers and loved them all . the margaritas were a little watery but it was happy hour so they were cheap .	704
1	thank you to anthony and jacob for quality work on cleaning my carpets and offering solutions for the tough issues . they were helpful , informative and efficient .	3777
1	the general manager scott really took care of me during my last visit . there were actually two separate issues but i faced and i wo n't going to detail here , but he did a great job handling the situation . he literally found me in the store at the checkout line to make it right . if only every customer service issue could be handled in the manner that scott did . i 've never had such excellent customer service from a manager . thanks scott ! this is my favorite sam 's club to go to now ! thank you for code 3-ing my last purchase , and the ravioli are delicious !	2172
0	the ambiance of the place is good and the staff are friendly . the food however was very horrible . went for the pasta special of the day . the salad that was brought was drowned in olive oil . i understand that it is an italian restaurant but it was a little too much . the pasta had so much oil in it , i was afraid of foreign invasion ( iykwim ) ! the sauce had so much salt in it , i had to drink a whole jug of water that they gave me just to get the taste in my mouth neutralized .	728
1	i bought some bar stools from them ... it took a long time to get them because of the fabric ... now that we have them they look great	1784
0	sales agents do not listen and therefore can not solve your problems . and yelp said my review was n't long enough so i would suggest driving to the verizon store in surprise on bell .	3037
0	i received a referral to dr. thomas for my daughter from our pcp after he examined the x-ray of her knee . the doctor was so rude to my 14 year old . he just lectured her about wearing protective gear and insinuated she was n't sensible . this guy should not be allowed to work with children . my daughter left so upset . i did n't say anything and i feel terrible for not having done so . if this is the only pediatric ortho doctor on my insurance , i 'd rather pay out of pocket ! !	2176
1	the best salsa and the pollo asada nachos were amazing . not greasy or soggy at all . seasoned to perfection . defiantly coming back . our server was very nice and attentive . great atmosphere .	882
0	buyer beware ! ! this dealership advertises vehicles with features that they do not have . we drove over 60 miles to potentially purchase a vehicle that was advertised with gps navigation , only to find out that it did n't . when i brought this up , they simply blamed the inaccuracies on a 3rd party . even the sales guy said you can not trust the window stickers on their vehicles when it comes to features . the sales manager was a complete joke when this was escalated to him . we were ready to drive away with a vehicle , had the advertised nissan been real . avoid this dealership at all costs ! !	394
0	they wanted to rip me off $ 1800 for an arm change , because the car was shaking . i checked with another mechanic and it was the wheel balance which cost me $ 10 . i paid $ 90 for `` engine check '' and they thought i 'm stupid because i 'm a woman . do n't trust this people !	2392
1	my favorite adult store in phoenix ... .just the right amount of sleeze appeal unlike the over bright , over supermarkety chain stores . always helpful staff !	2914
0	a bunch of incompetent crew . i called to make an appointment 4 days prior to getting the oil change . however , the guy on the phone told me to `` just walk in . '' so i did , and of course they told me that it would be 2 hours wait . what a stupid a $ $ . i 've decided to contact the other location and they took the appointment right away . i will never go back to this location on 10127 w charleston . and if you do n't have to , i would suggest you go somewhere else .	3379
1	went to meet a friend there for lunch since she worked nearby and i had the freedom to be able to just spend the day downtown . hush is yummy , love the rooftop patio . i would definitely go back again = )	621

1	i was desperate for a cut and my usual spot is too far and i the wait would make me way late for my ride to palm springs . i called gc just after 9am and there was zero wait time . i lucked out because as soon as i got there the online check ins were adding in the queue . eddie took care of me . super nice , great cut and perfect timing . i even had time to get home to trim and dye my beard . i 'll definitely be back . i really look sharp .	2169
0	i know you ca n't expect much from jcpenny on black friday but the staff was horrible . i did n't get his name he was arrogant black hair male slightly built . i came to buy over 100 in clothes and 3000 in appliances but now i 'm going to rc instead for my appliances there loss i guess..	1536
0	i 'm back . cashier charges $ 5.99 for product deceptively advertised for $ 3.50 . see pics . why do people shop here ?	2111
0	scheduled an oil change . came in 10 minutes early . two hours later they still had not touched my car so i left and went to jiffy lube .	3020
1	oh this pizza is so so awesome . as you can see from my picture , i got spinach and mushroom with gluten-free crust . the cheese was rich , the spinach fresh , and the crust was nice and crispy . and the service was fast and portion size just right . love pure pizza !	809
0	do n't waist your money . my wife and i went there to check the place out when they were first opening . we talked to the sales lady , she walked us through . place looked great . went back to sit down and talk about the memberships . i told her i would take a day to think about it . she said verbatim as she through my paperwork in the trash.. `` does n't make a difference to me , ill make my quota regardless . '' sweet.. i hope she did .	3268
1	shanghai steamed buns is my favourite dish from my hometown . i want to find a place in toronto/gta that 's as close as it gets , and surprising , this place makes amazing steamed buns . food first , must try their crab and pork steamed buns . then there 's the braised lamb in casserole . no chinese restaurants has topped this lamb dish yet ! ! it 's heavenly . their hand pulled chicken is delicious as well . elegant decor , and surprising pleasing service from the servers . you can also call for takeout , which i 've done many times for their steamed buns ; although they taste a billion times better fresh at the restaurant .	943
0	wish i would have looked on yelp before visiting . i was just charged 97¢ for a half cup of ice . needless to say , i am forgoing the purchase of 17 gallons of gas here . first and last time i visit here .	2563
1	have visited this location 5 or 6 times and made purchases each time . selection and customer service outstanding . we have been to numerous rock yards and mdi phoenix has really beautiful rocks , gravel and boulders . we are `` doing it ourselves '' so we are making numerous smaller purchases as we go and are treated with the same patience and respect as the big landscapers that do business there .	3824
1	food was fresh and hot . customer service was pretty good . drive thru line went very quickly . loved my grilled chicken torta .	1511
0	food is really good but delivery and customer service is horrible waited for my delivery for over 48 minutes when im just 2 blocks down	1581
1	the coffee is fantastic here . generally the customer service is very good . wether you buy a single donut or coffee they do n't try to upsell you . there is a drive thru which is convenient if you do n't want to exit your car . located in a strip mall it 's my second favorite place to go besides 7 11 for coffee .	618
0	as far as merchandise i have always loved this target located in bocca park . when you think target you think product quality , cleanliness , and availability of product . most importantly the level or service . the gal who i was speaking with was rude , short , and abrasive . asked for her name and she hung up on me/ i called and spoke with the manager brett and addressed the service provided an he was very apologetic . he said he is not sure if anyone will admit to it . still do n't know who the gal was . she was obviously not in a good mood or woke up on the wrong side of the bed !	583
0	bad service ok sushi expensive price for not that great of an experience or meal will not return and urge others to go to other restaurants and avoid this one	408
1	love the old school games with old school prices . plus the full bar and big beer selection is great too . did n't try the food but the menu looked decent .	2954
0	this gas station is so poorly put together.. the people are nice and the inside is fine enough . the pumps are the worst though ! they pop out of your car and they 're touchy and cheap . it 's too bad that it 's so convenient or i would try to go elsewhere all the time . it 's always crowded and awkward to drive through as well . as an update i lowered my star rating just because their pumps are that frustrating .	507
1	i had to come here because my insurance was longer accepted at my old dentist.i came to absolute dental in the beginning with i had tooth pain in the back.i had a crown put in.it does n't take a lot to please me , just be nice , professional and honest.and i got all of that coming to this location.i plan on making this my primary dentist , and i enjoy that i can laugh and have a good time while caring for my teeth ! thanks guys !	3053
0	the cupcakes are gross . extremely dry ... .. cheese cake ... ... .horrible . no plain ... ..it was choice between 5 different chocolate cheescakes . not worth the price . menu looks good ... ..but if you ca n't make a cupcake , no way .	2451
1	master spa rocks . got the head and reflexology combo and the ion detox . i absolutely loved both services . for two hours , i was pampered beyond belief . i felt like i was in a state of bliss . this beats those burke williams any day .	2399
0	the last time i went here ( a few years ago ) a group of friends and i were eating and a cockroach fell from the ceiling onto the middle of the table . ( not kidding ) . fresh fish should not be $ 10 ayce at all . avoid .	745
1	great sushi ! very small restaurant only 11 seats in the whole place . not a fan of their miso soup .	24
1	cash only . atm on premises . was there to perform as a musician . drink specials for us . cool . sound man and sound was good . easy load in door behind stage . street parking . good beer selection . laid back atmosphere .	98
1	it was my first time coming to this location and i will definitely be returning back ! my friend referred me to this place and it was definitely worth it ! !	3508
0	i had a california bowl with mahi mahi on august 17 around 7 pm . some of the rice in the bowl were soft , some were very hard . probably they were sitting out for too long and dried up . or some of the rice remained uncooked . it hurts the teeth . i had to sort out the dried hard rice . also , after eating i started to feel uncomfortable about half an hour later . i felt i was getting sick . fortunately , i was able to overcome and got better . not going back again .	1245
1	the best chinese food on the north side of town ! they deliver here and it 's a smooth transaction . my personal favorites are lomein , egg foo young , and fried rice . i 've been here many time and plan to return !	1249
1	they are honest and also affordable . .not like other mechanics these days that try to charge for things u dont need ! ask for tony..he will explain what is necessary and give you the best options !	1215
1	authentic and delicious noodles for a good price . they have a bouncy texture , and the cold jellyfish side dish was fresh . owner and the head noodle cook were friendly and service was fast without rushing us .	790
0	worst customer service ! ! waited to get nail fixed and front fesk asshole came up to me saying he read my review and doesnt need customers like me ? they 're the ones who messed up my nails twice ! ! very unprofessional in front of everyone to talk to a customer like so ? ! ! stay away from this place ! ! i will be calling the bbb	2683
1	i lived in arizona for over 2 years and never found a nail salon i liked . now i 'm here visiting friends and happened to stop in and loved this place . i got so many compliments on my nails as well . i wish i would 've found mirage when i lived in az . highly recommended ! !	686
0	i generally see fauer and he is amazing , i recently saw torres , she was okay . my issue was getting my ear drops and my blood work being told was normal and was not . when i called about this terry in the billing office wanted to argue with me that it was only 1 point below and not a issue , that makes me feel like they want it to get worse instead of tell me how to make my cholesterol better . she called back and left a voicemail today and i hear her talking to another employee calling me stupid and rambling on about things we discussed earlier . this is so wrong and cruel . stay far away from this office	938
0	i love escape rooms and have done 3 in the past year -- this was easily my least favorite , by far . compared to others , this escape room offered little entertainment value and the staff seemed bored and uninterested in providing an enjoyable experience . i 'm sure cleveland has something better to offer -- i 'll keep looking .	1165
0	my friend 's dog is having complications from dental surgery- that this clinic performed . she went in for help and was told they were too busy to help her dog . shame on them .	2545
1	i love this place i 've been coming here for 8 years . christina is a very wonderful person as well as kenny and his wife joann . sometimes you have to wait a little bit but it is well worth the wait trust me i know . i recommend all my friends and family to aloha nails . i would never go anywhere else 's . thank you christina you are the best ! ! ! ! ! ! !	544
0	do n't go here . seriously , do n't . the management is god awful . the food is n't that good and is overpriced . everything they serve is frozen . i 'd give them zero stars if i could .	383
0	the food is overpriced the line ups are too long . the ticket is not worth the price . i liked the star observation dome .	2868
0	brought a manufacturers coupon . the manager was rude and slammed her clip board on the station because she had to help me . she handed me the coupon back and told me there was nothing she could do . the check out lady was sweet and whispered to me to go to customer service and get help with my coupon because what the manager said did n't make sense to her either . the employees other than the checkout lady were not friendly and did nothing to help me . ended up not using my coupon . took my business else where . p.s . no problem with the coupon at other stores .	3066
0	there cafe is under remodel so they put u in the buffet area , the only problem is everything is paper and plastic . plastic utensils and paper places and cups . the feel is like u are at a bbq or a high school dance . very tacky , the price is cheap but i expected more from boyd gaming . this is a major casino and company and it 's like this remodel was decided last minute and they just put all the guest in one room .	3580
0	very slow drive thru and for the last 6+ months they continue to get my order wrong a good solid 75 % of the time ( and my drink could not be more simple ! ! ! ) . i will now drive the extra few miles just to go to another starbucks down the road to not deal with nonsense ! ! ! ! !	2778
0	i was looking for my new go-to place for pedicures , & unfortunately solar nails will not be it . the nail tech was sweet , but i have never , ever had a more painful pedi . she cut all of my cuticles on every single toe way too short , until they were bleeding . then she proceeded to use nail polish remover and some other alcohol-based substance so that all of the cuts along my cuticles burned like crazy . miserable experience . i will not be back .	3603
1	this place is so neat ! it has amazing comics & collectibles , a room to rent/play video games , and an amazing italian ice & coffee shop . also , the employees are always so helpful & polite .	1630
1	working with their service department i found everyone very helpful . the customer service rep , kristin , was exteemely kind and understanding , helping me know exactly what was going on , prices of everything , and was extremely patient . the mechanic , collin , was extremely knowledgable and was excellent at explaining everything to me . they even took me to my car to show me everything while it was on the lift . thank you collin !	1890
0	i have been coming to this place on a regular basis for years . the last time i was there i was disappointed by the lack of service . i was there with my family on the weekend and asked for extra plates . the owner actually came out and said i did not have a big enough order for extra plates . i was shocked and amazed . then i asked for waiter for water and that came out with stuff floating in it . at this point i was ready to leave . customer service and cleanliness is so critical in today 's world and because of my very poor experience , i wo n't be returning .	577
1	we came here to order our rock after deciding to do desert landscaping on our front yard . having never done a project like this before , we were very intimidated . but after talking to kevin in the decorative rock department we felt more confident . he answered all our questions and was very patient with us . it set our mind at ease .	99
1	the first couple months have been great ! amenities are awesome and luxurious . apartment layouts are very modern and open . the leasing office staff is very helpful , and the maintenance crew is very attentive to your needs . would definitely recommend if you 're into this modern , city style type of living .	589
1	what a great , knowledgeable , accommodating and friendly wedding store . i can not say enough about the staff and owner . they have made this experience a hoot . where else can you go to get wedding invites , flower girl dresses , alterations and watch the cardinals game in the men 's section .	1298
0	we got there about an hour before they closed . the service was ok , but the food could 've been better . probably wo n't be making this my next thai favorite !	1450
0	first gave me an unclean room , then morning of checkout i noticed my medication was n't there anymore - i absolutely do not move this medication ever for any purposes and it was nowhere to be found around my bathroom . i am 100 % positive i did not lose this myself . staff said that no cleaning staff threw it out , but they did not conduct a thorough investigation , only briefly asked the cleaning staff from yesterday . i left without an expensive prescription from a specialized doctor that i needed . do not stay here if you do not want your belongings to go missing without any explanation . i will never stay here again .	3289
0	worst moving company of all time damaged just about everything never use them !	2353
0	walked into this store with my wife today . walked around the entire main floor , and then the upper floor . not one salesperson acknowledged us or even made eye contact . the salesperson upstairs was busy helping other customers , but on the main floor , 3 salespeople were leaning on the counter talking to each other and drinking coffee . business must be good ! nice store though . we were there at approx 1:30pm on jan 04 , 2016 .	613
0	owner is extremely uncessecarily rude and bar is a dump and a half . spend your money elsewhere so someplace that is n't a waste of space can move into the space .	3840
1	this place was great ! i usually feel very frustrated after leaving consignment stores , but they took a fair amount of clothes and offered me a very agreeable amount of money for them . she even explained that some of the clothes were only turned away because they were off season . i will definitely be returning .	2002
0	came by last minute knowing what we wanted , some person not in uniform of any kind stopped us that the door waving his arms saying `` closed '' when they clearly had enough time lol . nice to	715
0	decided to try something new tonight so we ordered takeout here . the girl who took the order over the phone was very helpful and nice . but unfortunately the food was so bland , chicken teriyaki was pretty much grilled chicken tossed in the sauce , vegetable chow mein was decent , cheese puffs tasted like plain cream chz in a soft puff . felt like it was over priced .	474
1	fantastic place with amazing drinks ! ! ! $ 5 martinis on tuesday are a fabulous deal . our bartender was great . fast , friendly and able to hold intelligent conversation changed my mind . hangover from martinis is dreadful . might die .	2641
0	aweful . we waited for an hour only to be given a cold bibimbap . had to walk out cause we did n't want to eat other people 's leftovers .	298
0	i had a turkey sandwich and fries here the other day . the place was clean and the waitress was nice , but i could tell it was cheap turkey by the texture and taste . for $ 6.25 i feel like i deserve better turkey than i could get at aldi 's .	990
1	this place can appear disorganize when seated to capacity , but all your food will come eventually . the fried rice dishes are must-tries . if you plan to go there after 6:30 pm on a holiday or weekend evening , call ahead and reserve a table , or you will be there waiting long .	1362
0	do n't you hate it when you crave a certain food only to have that food taste horrible when you finally get to eat it ? i had the general chicken and my wife ate the beef & broccoli . the general was perhaps the worst i 've ever eaten ( i have been to countless chinese restaurants across the country and only eat general ) and my wife said she would rather have eaten subway because her beef tasted nasty and even the broccoli was no good . this place gets 2 stars because the staff was all very attentive and friendly . because of the disappointing food though , we wo n't be going back to this place again .	237
0	this place has zero available surface and underground parking ... went on a tuesday night and had to park across the street where the construction for condos is taking place . will not be returning since i do n't live within walking distance from this place .	884
0	was in a hurry was looking for a couple of small items . i asked `` davina/davita '' who was working @ cutting table ( she had no customers ) where items are located , pointed in general direction for one of the items ... told me the she did n't know where other item was that `` it was somewhere over there '' . no offer to help to find it . rude , bad customer service.. and she was a manager ! ! should n't a manager know where simple needles and thread are ? she obviously needs re-training on what customer service means ! so mad !	3943
1	my nephew attends this preschool and i could n't be more happy to see him attend little einsteins . i 've seen so much growth in his interaction with other children and even his learning abilities . the times i 've picked him up he 's come out smiling eager to tell me what he did in preschool . the first time i came i even got a tour of the facility and was happily greeted by kari the director . i definitely recommend this preschool .	3582
1	these guys did a phenomenal job on repairing my htc one . the glass was cracked after a single drop , and they recommended it would take a few days after the part had been ordered . i followed-up with them the next week after leaving my phone with them and they took care of it within a day . admire the craftsmanship and care that they took into fitting the glass back in and running tests after the replacement has been made . my htc is back and running like it was brand new- and i did n't have to deal with a more expensive upgrade in order to get my service working again ! thanks to the team at ubreakifix !	3817
0	i went in and the owner seemed rude . she was on the phone and did not acknowledge me . there was another customer that came in and noticed this and left . i took the cupcakes home to my family and they noticed that was oily and made from shortening . the red velvet cupcake was also quite dry . do not go here !	3539
1	i really like this place . the gal who worked on my pedicure and gel manicure was very professional , kind and thorough . the place was clean . they were all very friendly . they have a lot of color options and a big , easy to browse color `` book '' ( it opens like a menu and has a ton of options rather than having all the colors on a `` wheel '' key-ring ) . price was right . i spent less than i normally did at my old place which was pleasantly surprising .	863
0	i love korean bbq and this place has great food . but their customer service needs some help the place is clean and small loud too . they give u only a small amount of veggies which sucks . if they were friendlier and gave more veggies i would give it more stars but the food was good and the price was ok .	435
0	the service was okay not very attentive . i ended up going to nearby today 's patio and buying a nice outdoor dining set and firepit with sofa seating for half the price and got alot more for my money .	217
1	david and his family run this business and are super friendly , knowledgeable , and helpful . i dropped off my truck to have it repaired and was having trouble finding a ride to get my truck picked up and they offered to pick me up from where i was . super helpful and i really appreciated it .	3762
0	i will never buy from louis vuitton after visiting this store . their manager , nancy , and all their sales associates are the rudest people i 've ever encountered . they incorrectly charged my boyfriend 's card $ 1,200 and would n't refund it ; acting like we are the criminals when they were committing a class 5 felony . i ca n't believe they can sell so many purses while treating their customers like garbage . i do n't want to go into too much detail because it 's a long story , but trust me it has been terrible . do n't ever buy from here .	1493
1	my wife and i thought the services provided by tony baez and al holowell for the lease on a new accord were outstanding . both either knew what the answer was to any question or found someone in the dealership who knew the answer . also felt that the business person did a fine job in explaining all of the paperwork that needed to be signed .	3074
0	i can not believe how much i just spent here to have my green cheek conure examined for slight labored breathing . the normal vet i take her to which is an actual exotic animal hospital specialist charges $ 60 for a visit , we were recommended to this place by a friend because the other place we used to go to seemed like they just wanted money and to run random tests . i did n't even think to ask how much this place charged because who would think that a normal vet that takes exotic animals would charge $ 110 just for the visit alone . and then 220 $ for a bird blood panel i 'm just floored .	1603
1	i eat here alot because i work close , and over 5 years their food has stayed consistently good . they give you large portions , the pricing is pretty standard , and the few things that are my favorits are the best between the 3 vietnamese restaurants that are all in a row . i can personally vouch for their crispy spring rolls and chicken cabbage salad ... everyone in my office agrees they get our vote for those two dishes , plus many more that i ca n't pronounce or spell . : )	784
1	my spouse found a deal on groupon and planned a great evening out for us the atmosphere is simply delightful , the food was beyond delicious the pear salad and pork belly was my favorite dishes of the evening , but we also had some of the best service from our waiter and other servers that worker there . the kicker is on saturday night they have a live band which just made it that much more romantic and set the tone for one night i will not forget our date night ! this is definitely a must , must check out place for great food and of course the wine !	49
1	i love this farmer 's market because they carry crow 's dairy goat cheese . you seriously need to try this cheese . the pepper goat cheese is amazing ! the store is small , but has a decent selection . i 'm really just there for the cheese . : - )	2488
0	i got a dermal piercing in my right wrist , the piercer told me to come back when the piercing gets infected , not if it gets infected but en . idk ... ..about you piercers here but ive have my dermal for 5 years now ! ! ! ! ! !	2790
1	absolutely love this gym . i came as a guest of my aunts and signed up for my own membership with planet fitness the next day . i love the circuit workout section and i ca n't forget to mention the unlimited massages . you get so much for so cheap . and everyone is so nice . canceled la fitness just to come here	2285
0	what you do n't see is that they raised their prices to `` regular '' movie prices as of 9/28/18 . so , there 's no longer an affordable option for families .	3927
1	strictly a beer review ... ..had a couple of copper ales while waiting to fly back to boston ... .they are very good . a great beer that is n't too sweet or hoppy ... a nice clean finish with just the right amount of carbonation . i wanted to try some other beers but it was hard to stray from this great ale .	219
0	i 'm giving this store 2 stars for bad customer service at checkout . i saw three customers put their merchandise down and walk out of the store because the one female cashier in the whole store was just too slow and inefficient . experiences like this are why people prefer shopping online ... no consideration for people 's time .	1059
0	the food here today was so-so . the egg drop soup was ok . the wings were overcooked as were the sad crab ragoons , which were hard eniugh to nearly break a tooth . the teryaki chicken was tough and there was so much rice . even the chinese donuts tasted of old oil and lacked real flavor . disappointing . glad i had used a half off deal .	829
1	i 've been coming here for a few years now and finally got around to post my review . the barbers here are all trained well and have great attitudes . kevin is one of the newest barbers and he did not disappoint . thanks for the great haircut and beard trim kevin !	2591
1	this is not a montreal-style bagel , so do n't come here expecting that . having said that , nu bügel makes the best everything bagel i have had in canada so far . i would even go as far as to say it is in the top three on my list of everything bagels that i have ever had ! most places seem to forget that little bit of salt , which helps bring together all the flavours of an everything bagel . not nu bügel ! they get it right here . i have only ever gotten a large amount of bagels to go , but they also have plenty of different bagel sandwich combinations to try .	995
0	my husband noticed that from our recent visit we were overcharged . a simple fix , really , and he decided to call in . apparently the manager he spoke to was incredibly rude and did n't believe we were overcharged . maybe it would n't be an issue had we gotten a receipt ... which we did n't get for the bar or bay . not planning on returning if this is how it is going to be .	1483
0	i 'm so disappointed : - ( . i really wanted to love this place and have been dying to try it based on the reviews . the carne asada was dry , the al pastor had nice spice to it but not much more flavor , the barbacoa had no flavor ( i did n't even finish it ) , and the rice was really dry ... so many fails i 'm so sad . the horchata is very heavy on the cinnamon , but it was still ok . i can make better tacos at home with the marinated steak and al pastor at the ranch market.. bummer .	562
0	terry is skilled , but the last time i went he passed me off to a lady who gave me the worst haircut of my life . when i made the appointment i asked for terry specifically . this is not how haircutting works . there is trust . you should know who exactly is going to cut your hair .	1597
0	the review is merely about bike repairs . took child 's bike ( worth $ 20 ) to get a replacement tire . i expected to pay a reasonable price , after all a kids bike tire costs no more than $ 15 . when i went to pick up the bike i was charged $ 67 . seriously ? will never go back to this place . they did n't even leave it in top notch condition . the chain cover is loose , did n't adjust to kids size , etc . i do n't recommend .	3726
0	cook arranged sweet and sour pork on plate with bare hands . | discarded . cook touched hands and face while cooking . | hands washed before returning to cooking area . failed state inspection	237
1	# 1 pizza place in town.i have been at all three locations and it is faboulous.i am closer to this location and surprise , wings are unbeatable and super tasty.the cheapest on the area too considering that are fresh.these guys are always busy and i dont wonder why.they have the most friendly owners too.love tham all.it always smells good and is clean.love watching their fresh dough on the table.i have been telling everybody.the special 2 xl & 25 wings for 33 is the best .	773
0	i also hasve been a client for several years and attend the clinic in peoria . they have certainly gone down hill . everyone tells you something different , they fill your meds wrong , there is no product . what else can i say . and i can see from reading other revues that this appears to be the norm . i hope the docs read these revues and try to change things or i will also go elsewhere . ss	2588
0	wow , unless you want to play arcade games from the 1980s and you have a high tolerance for dirt , stay away from this place . we were looking for an indoor attraction to beat the heat one day with our almost 2 1/2 year old daughter and unfortunately ended up going here . the bathrooms were disgusting , the place had a foul smell to it overall and the play area was pretty filthy . yes , it was inexpensive and she had fun but we almost wanted to burn the clothing she was wearing after we left . walk around the mall for 2 hours instead .	3791
0	all their ramen is pork based . for someone who does n't eat pork , this will suck for you as it did for me . i 'm sure i 'm an idiot for not liking pork but hey , more soup for you ! have a great day '	131
0	third time visiting and while i like the interior and the service ( sometimes ) , the food is overpriced and not very good . i do n't know why i keep coming back . i want to like this place , but after today i wo n't be back . just went for brunch and they only have coffee , no espresso-based drinks . we had one veggie salad , one coffee , and one plate of veggie fritters and a few pieces of soggy bacon = $ 45 . no thanks .	273
0	had them paint our master bedroom . told them the walls needed to be prepped . we had removed wallpaper and they were very rough . they brushed at one spot and i 'm sure that 's all they did . where the walls meet the ceiling is a mess . could have hired a couple of high school kids to get that quality of work !	3221
1	this guy , mr antonio hernandez from furniture-is super helpful and knowledgeable ! ! ! it 's a pleasure to come to a store and be assured that you not only get the best deal , but also will be helped and taken care of even if it 's last minute before closing !	439
1	amazing , perfect , dream come treue , wonderful ... just a few words to describe this venue . we just got married here and it was the best night of our lives . patrick , his family and staff made it possible . ceremony and reception was absolutely gorgeous . thank you ! ! !	238
0	clean , new , shiny new spot in south end . food was just okay , not the most flavorful ( ordered lasagna and a salad ) . maybe this concept is lost on me because i 'm not a big wine drinker , but i 'd rather cook italian at home or go somewhere more authentic if i 'm craving pasta .	712
0	i called ahead and asked when i was visiting in vegas if they could do an oil change and brake inspection . they said they were slow and could have me out in 2 hours tops . i drive there which was 20 minutes from my hotel and all the sudden they are 4 to 5 hour wait time . i hate service shops that say whatever to get you in and then they totally waist your time . the guy apologized which is why they get 2 stars instead of 1 .	2123
1	i love this property ! the amenities are so nice , sometimes i do n't feel like going anywhere but stay at home and enjoy what this high rise apartment complex had to offer . plus , all the staff and security team are always friendly and there for anything you need .	3264
1	my first time trying a bahn mi from anywhere and it was delicious ! this place is amazing , great customer service , and really good variety of tea options . i ordered the lemon grass chicken bahn mi and lychee tea with passion fruit jellies and both tasted great . just be aware that there are fresh jalapeños on the sandwiches so if you do n't like spicy i advise to ask for it without the peppers .	1301
0	overpriced meals and drinks ( $ 8 for a beer ? ) plus service staff was too talkative and too slow in their actions . we also noticed the mixed drinks were watered down ( twice , ) and the tobacco had burned out within 20 minutes . our friends that regularly go do n't notice the high prices because they said the staff usually gives them hookups . but not tonight . my friends tobacco also burned or quickly we are not returning to this place with these prices and the quality of the tobacco . another gripe i had was the seating , it 's like a fire hazard waiting to happen .	1229
1	danny c. was out at our house today and we were really impressed . he literally spent the entire day making sure that everything was operational with our air conditioning units ... even the random one we have in the garage . we have a large house with multiple zones of heating and cooling and he combed through all of them very carefully . i feel confident that we 'll be in good shape going into the heat of the summer . he made the necessary repairs and the price was incredibly fair . we will definitely be calling on them again come fall to get a check up on our heating units and we 'll be asking for danny again : )	730
1	i must say fast , friendly and caring . i never used a tow company in the past because of pricing but the tow was only $ 75.00 bucks and they towed me all the way home . i would use them again . thank you so much .	3717
1	these guys are great i have now purchased two vehicles from this dealership and they are always very courteous , honest , and speedy ! i ca n't stress the honest part of that enough . most large dealerships you go to will try to swindle every penny you 've got by tacking on this warranty and that warranty and eventually the price that was originally talked about ends up being an enormous amount . these guys will be straight up with you and let you know what your final price will be . i 'll definitely be back and refer as many people as possible .	307
0	i got my hepatitis a and b vaccines here and they told me my medicare and supplemental insurance would cover it like it does for a flu shot . i received a bill for $ 108.99 liars and thieves .	1207
0	absolute con . they bribe with one month 's rent for a good review and then take it back with rent increases . stay away ! there are better and cheaper facilities if you look on line	2065
1	i rented school buses for my september 2015 wedding from badger bus . donna helped me more than a year before the big day . she was so laid back even when we added a third bus at the last minute . we did have an issue with one of the buses getting lost and cutting it close to the ceremony . i was bummed that they were n't provided directions .	3132
1	i like that the workouts are different every day . the trainers are awesome and push me to reach new goals . i also like the group dynamic . i 'm very competitive and get motivated by the people around me . long story short , i love orangetheoryfitness !	3367
1	i randomly swung by this spot before work just trying to grab something to bite with some coffee before running into work . best choice i 've made all week . not only did they have blueberry donuts ( something i have n't seen since leaving california ) but they also had thai tea ! very nice folks in there too , they can expect to see me more often .	3137
1	there is beer . ca n't complain .	670
1	if you want to immerse yourself in the mill scene this is a good start . always packed and good deals on their long islands and their long list of variants this is the greatest place to start off before venturing elsewhere down mill ave in my opinion . i 've only played a game of pool once here so i ca n't really describe that ordeal other than needing patience for a spot to shoot but everyone seemed aware of their surrounding so it was n't awful .	1966
0	me and my boyfriend went for dinner on a friday night . we sat at the bar . worst service in town . bar was n't even half full and the bartender said she was too busy to get us drinks . we waited for a solid 30 mins to get a drink . would not recommend this place solely based on the terrible service .	1331
1	this is a great place to hang out in the southwest . right off 215 and jones , it 's convenient and they have an extensive menu of good food . they also have pretty good specials for happy hour and a good crowd . seems to be a place people like to hang out on the way home from work . i 've been coming here for years and it 's one of my favorite places to stop in vegas . they have gaming as well and private rooms to watch games , etc .	1520
1	had a great experience with all desert appliances . ryan was very professional and very knowledgeable . he answered every question i had and fixed both washer and dryer . i 'm very pleased with his service . thank you ! ! !	3885
0	i have been here a few times , always a quick experience and not overpriced for the effort put into a pani/medi . last visit i was blown away by the amount i was charged for a mani/pedi ( even being given a gift card ) . their lack of effort and energy is not reflected in their over average prices and quality of work . do yourself a favor and treat yourself to one service at the ritz and stay for a relaxing spa day . you wo n't leave angry and speechless . i will not be back .	3213
1	i really like the moist towels that they now provide free of charge . hopefully no one steals them . i would be interested in buying one . can they be purchased in the vending machine there ? they wipe down the windows without streaks/residue . very handy . the wash operators still forget to reset the top roller to come down after they disable it for certain high vehicles . they need to remember to reset that to resume use again afterwards . otherwise , consumers are getting less of a car wash then they paid for .	2939
1	was looking for a nail salon place saw this one and decided to stop by . i was seen right away asked to pick color . very professional , fast and friendly . they did a good job . i had a manicure and pedicure done for $ 30 .	1829
1	the two times i have been here i have been very pleased . i have the upgraded pedicure which is the whole leg . i think the 2 girls i had did very good job and i am ready to go back a third time .	3338
0	i was hoping i would make this my regular nail place but left totally disappointed . the staff are unprofessional , making calls while doing your nails . when i showed the technician two different nail designs she said they did n't do either one of them . you would think for a newly just opened place they would be more up to date on the trends . i finally settled for a more simple design with some chrome powder . my nails were not fully coated with the powder and i was left with streaks which are more noticeable in the sun . overall horrible experience . it should not take close to two hours to get a full set only .	2121
1	i went here to get my hair cut by a professional for the first time 20 years , as my daughter , heather vaughan is attending school here i thought i would give it try . she not only did an awesome job but the learning leaders who assist the students really walk them through thoroughly every step and make sure you 're comfortable with the whole experience .	354
1	* giggle * nick lachey look-a-like . * swoon * cpr certified `` resuscitation from the mouth to south '' * hot *	2149
1	really nice place for buffet and large selection if food ! you will be full before trying all dishes even once ! visit this place if ur not counting calories : )	1302
0	this place is horrible ! be aware . i waited over 40 minutes for a manicure and was told 10 minutes every 10 minutes . at 40 minutes the manager told me no time for me because i did n't have an appointment . management has no respect for people 's time . i 'd rather spend my $ $ somewhere else .	3757
1	these guys are great ! ! ! had a stoppage in my house and called charlotte plumbing and repair . they came out an hour after i called . fixed my stoppage and even gave me advice on a future project and told what to do to save a thousand bucks . the price was just right too . they actually fixed a botched job that roto-rooter did . if you have a plumbing job and you want the job done right at a reasonable price , call charlotte plumbing . you wo n't be disappointed .	2130
1	this place is really good ! they have a good selection of drinks , and treats ! i usually get the americano which i find to be very pleasing . it does n't have the burnt taste that some do , and its strong enough to not taste weak either . the servers are very friendly and helpful ( like they will explain a drink if you are unsure ) . the baked goods range from muffins , to zucchini bread ( my personal favorite ! ) to chorizo empanadas . the location is on the smaller side , but if you make it in early or at a less crowded time you have the intimacy of the place for yourself .	268
0	i have too high expectation in the traditional pork bun , but it only have the taste of soy sauce . any other places like shanghai dimsum or ala kitchen have much better taste of the juicy steamed pork bun than here ! service unorganized at all , 2 sections of upstairs and downstairs ... on a saturday night , it 's not even crazy busy ! but u can see 3 servers running around for nothing . do n't recommend at all !	943
0	i called several times and no one can seem to pick up the phone . it needs to be resolved . when in the store no one seems to want to help you especially on the weekend . it is the worst customer service i have ever had would rather order parts online . they need help with customer satisfaction and i would rather spend my day at the dmv . i would suggest going else where if possible .	3086
0	had a 2:15 appoint so i arrived at 2:00pm and had to wait 50 min before i got checked in . the procedure took all of 2 minutes . ca n't believe that people are not more aware of their surrounding and did n't realize my check in sticker was misplaced .	2768
1	i like this spot when i 'm around sunset and running some errands , it 's nice to stop in and grab a sandwich . the place is rather tiny but the times i have been there it was n't crowded . the staff was prompt in their service and the shop was clean . the folks behind the counter were nice and even checked to see how i was enjoying my order and if everything was to my liking . i am quite pleased with this spot and will frequent it more often .	870
0	erm ... jules has just landed itself a conditional pass from toronto health inspectors dinesafe program . not cool ! ! now that i check out the toronto dinesafe website seems like this place does n't have a good track record .	397
1	been coming to this location for the past 6 years , the clerks have always been very courteous and helpful , food is always up to par . nothing to complain in all my time	870
1	david , the customer service rep , was very helpful . would have given full stars but i think the deposit is excessive and the fee structure is not clear ( booked on hotwire )	3595
0	do n't waste your time/money going here ! this place is super overpriced and overrated . the pizza is super soggy and has no flavor whatsoever . they 're very stingy on the toppings ( which they charge an additional amount for a pinch of each topping ) . save your money and walk to mcdonalds across the street !	282
0	good products and location but bad management . the crew lack of knowledge utilizing their time in between customers during fairly busy time . i was a bit disappointed during my first visit .	2715
0	food is ok , but service is terrible . i keep giving this place another chance in hopes that it gets better , but it never does . first experience the lady that helped me was extremely rude and flustered . the past two times in the drive thru i have been on the run and they have forgotten items from my order , and i had to go back . they never compensate for anything . terrible service ! i recommend just going to paradise bakery .	148
1	really great selection of clothing , joe fresh is a trendy new fashion shop that has really nice clothes . you will not be disappointed after visiting this store .	3517
0	yuck ! went in for dinner one night and ordered the pot roast . the meat was so severely overcooked that it could n't be swallowed and the veggies were as hard as a rock . tasted like they were n't cooked at all . the mozzarella sticks tasted like they used old dirty oil and my husband 's steak was over seasoned and disgusting . when we asked for a manager , he refused to come out . worst dining experience ever .	1319
0	talk about the ole bait and switch ... ... .. they advertise $ 22 ohv registration , but then charge you 40 per ohv to notarize your application . really $ 18 for a notary . it is normally $ 5 .	195
0	the facility is completely empty , but the wait is long . also , no flu tests , but i 'm swabbed for the flu just to be told sorry ... so i 'm prescribed tamiflu , but do i even have the flu ? waste of time and money .	2580
1	ok , i just recently discovered this place ! what a find ! it 's the perfect mix of modern and eclectic . the prices are a bit high but at least you 're getting some unique , and potentially one-of-a-kind stuff . it 's a huge store so totally worth the drive to the junction even if it 's the only reason you 're coming out this way . also , great reasonably priced home accents throughout .	1674
1	service is always good . been here twice already . tom yum soup is so good . i substitute udon noodles and i always get it with beef . you get a huge bowl . beef is so tender and soft . it seriously melts in your mouth . hubby got the curry chicken and the chicken was also tender . large portion . very flavorful . this place has a big parking area and you get seated right away .	961
1	the quoted for 30mins and they got it done less than 20mins . well it costs me $ 140 , but i 'm tired of looking at my crazy screen , so whatever , lol ! great job for whoever fixed it , sorry i did n't get your name . : ) . anyway , you guys made my day . but i really really hope i do n't see you guys again .	339
0	i called this guy from my work line to setup a job . i left a voicemail asking him to call my cell phone to schedule a visit for a pool remodel . this stellar human being then calls my cell twice in a row and then my office line . when i answer he begins harrassing me about why i have a ca number but live in az and then proceeds to ask me a bunch of questions about what i do for a living . this guy is very paranoid and i suggest anyone looking for pool work stay far away from him . disgusting .	3341
0	asked waitress for hot minestrone soup , was clear it must be served hot . it was served barely warm . big disappointment .	192
1	nice course , great service , excellent conditions , not crowded , second time here , will be back	3869
1	had my car window shield replaced while at work . safelite was on-time , fast and super efficient . they call before the appointment , and review all the charges before beginning . i would use them again in a heartbeat .	2444
0	terrible ! they left my baby in a hot car for over and hour and a half while i waited for a tow . this business should be shut down ! ! ! !	2010
1	what can i say ? whole foods is love/hate relationship . love the food , hate the prices ! however , i will always continue to shop here because i know i 'm getting quality food and they always keep their stores nice and tidy . they have a great smoothie/juice bar and plenty of vegetarian/vegan options . in addition , their bakery is the best !	433
1	i really like the cleanliness of this indoor and outdoor starbucks location . i like the early morning staff because they relate to the early morning commuters . the early morning staff is very pleasant compared to the afternoon team . this location appreciates military personnel . every one drink gets me a free 2nd drink . i think this is so awesome .	3396
0	i will not use this company ever . they left me stranded at the airport at 1am . had to pay a cab to get home	2901
1	i 've been going here a year and a half and would n't go anywhere else ! michelle is the best and can do any design . this salon is very clean and everyone is friendly .	2297
0	i 've had dinner here a few times and it seems that food quality gets worse with each visit . yesterday was definitely my last . the sangria i ordered was made from wine made out of someone 's garage . poor garbage . should be ashamed of yourself for serving this crap . the pizza was not cooked . the crust was raw . the calamari were recooked and nuked in the microwave . the service was slow . no bread was served or water . with service like this , it wo n't take long for people to stop dining here . if i could give no stars , i would .	240
0	food is terrible , complete lack of flavor . did n't even get cherries in my cherry limeade !	844
1	what a gem ! ! i love the selection ( even has takoyaki ) and taste . also love that the combo hot dishes such as salmon teriyaki ( one of my fav 's ) comes with red bean rice instead of just plain white rice . really fresh fish , that even my very picky sister complimented on the freshness and loved her meal .	734
1	big menu , first time here , went with kung pao chicken ... ..extra spicy ... ... ..nailed it . great little asian place , right down the street from my place of work ... ... ..totts , you have a new friend , i 'll be back soon ! ! ! cant wait to try more !	474
1	i 've been taking my xterra to full circle in avondale since they opened . i had been going to another car wash in the west valley , however a friend recommended this one and i have n't been anywhere since . friendly people , reasonable prices , and they do an outstanding job ! i normally get either the works or the vip . twice a year i have my xterra detailed . every time i go there they make my vehicle pretty again . : - ) plus ... .they give a military discount ! kudos to full circle autowash for supporting the military . just show them your id and you 'll get the discount .	3250
0	chicken knuckles aka chicken fingers are always burnt or cold . the first week advertised was the only time the order was right . the food always taste like it 's sitting underneath a hot lamp . their buffalo chicken tenders are never prepared the same way whenever you order . no continuity of service . piss-poor ! ! !	532
1	love the tomford glasses i bought . the service was great , quick service , got my glasses within an hour . amazing doctor and prices . will go back .	2536
1	i will definitely be back to the spa i have lived in phoenix for 8 years and this was my first time going i truly enjoyed my time here roumba was one of the massage therapist and was absolutely the best the.. staff was courteous and kind and i felt like i was well taken care of we did the prefix selection so we spent a good five plus hours there and loved every moment of it will definitely be back	2225
1	super fast service friendly lori jones was a great agent changed out everything so it was just right ! i 'm a loyal avis customer !	3129
0	went on 15 jan 2013 with wife , about 7:30 pm . only two other customers in store . when we entered we both noticed that the temp had to be at least 85 degrees . could not take it . left . have been to this place numerous times since they reopened . service is good sometimes and bad other times . different waitresses every time we go . they are always learning ... . service is spotty ! food is good .	1212
0	called to get a quote on brakes and was quoted a reasonable price however ; when asked which brakes were having issues i advised johnny that i was almost certain that it was the front brakes but i wanted him to check before i purchased them . he had a attitude like i was bothering him & said he cnt do any work on my car but he could n't give me a reason as to why . he is very unprofessional and is in the wrong field if he does not like to answer questions . i would ratherpay more $ and be treated like a human being than pay less to be talked down too . i will not recommend his services to others .	1143
0	the point of this review is that i brought a used car in what seemed to be great condition at that time and in four months of having the car i 've been in for service 3 times . i realize that a used car is exactly what it is , used , but as a large dealership that prides itself on great customer service and car sales , the experience that i 've had so far with this car is making me regret buying from cochran . i 'm considering putting this car up for sale privately and paying off my loan so	2820
0	i purchased the `` vip '' wash for $ 20 . they wanted me to drive my own vehicle through the car wash. wtf . secondly when i picked up my car it had no fresh scent put in it and they forgot to wash several parts of the interior including the dash , the part of the vehicle i will be looking at all the time . what a joke this car wash is . never going back .	3899
0	the perogies have always been good but their customer service is horrible . almost every year we place a larger order for holidays and every year they make some mistake on the order . this year was enough . they lost my phoned in order for the 2nd time in a row and were rude about it telling me there was nothing they could do . i willl never order from them again .	540
0	sandwiche à poulet avec frite . j'ai actuellement la bouche en feu , il y a un incendie dans ma bouche . les frites sont beaucoup trop poivrer et salé que j'en ai perdu la saveur de mon repas . je ne sens plus mon palais que je n'ai même pas pu savourer le poulet . je déconseille de commander des frites .	1109
1	you know the feeling you get after you finish getting a good massage and it 's time for you to put your on shirt and leave ? getting some good bbq gives me the same feeling except i 'm only slightly ashamed afterwards . hah ! dickey 's is a decent bbq place . i got the wednesday special and it was spectacular . the meat was cooked perfectly . it gave me the fuel i needed to go on a beer run aftewards . # meeatmeat so come here for some reasonably priced eats without all the fancy frills .	966
0	i give this place two stars because paul completely lacks customer service . one of his technicians had just started to work on my pool vacuum and paul made him stop what he was doing to clean up the store . he then told me to come back in two days ! what a jerk ! !	2202
1	my 2 year old is absolutely terrified of haircuts , and the staff here did a great job handling his fear and suggesting things that may help calm him down . they were very understanding , and allowed him the time he needed to play and get comfortable with his surroundings . lauren worked around his needs and was so gentle that he did n't even realize she was cutting his hair .	3087
1	this year is the first time my wife and i have made it to the state fair ... shame on us for taking 7 yrs to get to this . we had a blast ! it was somewhat smaller than i was expecting , really did n't know what to expect i guess . overpriced food and drinks , tons of freaks to look at and a lot of fun things to do ... it was great . there was a llama in the petting zoo that thought my wife was his best friend !	2076
1	amazing service and wonderful care . thank you , especially daniel , fnp. , for caring for me as a person . not as a number .	2580
1	great place to eat after a night of partying ! great food , good prices ! good for hangover .	322
1	i booked this room.thru expedia . i was on a budget , it was extremely affordable , $ 350 for 7 days . my room is spotless , i had a full kitchen..even though i do n't cook , i felt like i was at home . comfy bed , cool a/c , clean linen , bathroom was ok . it was quite , peaceful at all times . pool was clean too and it was close to everything . highly recommended	2185
0	not staffed well . i 'm from fort fisher nc and our aquarium has knowledgeable staff , events , and is much cleaner . this was more expensive and a much less fulfilling .	706
0	two stylists on friday evening . i 've been waiting an hour while chatty kathy has managed to do 1 1/2 haircuts . the other stylist just had four friends walk in and he skipped one of them alllll the way to the head of the line . cute . too late for me to go anywhere else , so i 'm going to keep waiting . smile nicely and let my tip reflect my aggravation .	2169
1	went for dinner with friends last night . the restaurant is decorated absolutely amazing ! the food was excellent . we ordered the mushroom risotto and the filet steak . both were prepared perfect , and the waitress suggested perfect wine pairings for the food . we will definitely be going back here for dinner !	1204
0	this place is ok.what i do n't like about it , is some of the workers have attitudes . it 's a weird vibe when you walk in . you do n't feel welcome and they talk in there language and you just know they are talking about you because they stare at you while they talk . but the reason why i go here is because it 's convenient it 's very close to my house .	655
0	i just moved to this area and this is the closest taco bell to my house . i 've been there six times now and not once has my order been right , its always a surprise what i will receive .	859
1	me and my girl have been coming here for months now . and we love the 2 girls that do our brow . we may not be able to feel our brows afterwards but they look amazing . lol . no comment on the older women that works there ... .	3806
1	this is pretty clean and neat walmart compare with others , storage is pretty new and fresh , shelves are well stocked and organized , problem is that they need more cashiers which feels like is an issue in all the walmart supercenters	2443
0	horrible security process run by disrespectful guards . amazing that this place has limited hours as there was a line out the door prior to the office opening . such a bad experience .	2780
0	incredibly rude employees who should n't be allowed to work in customer service positions . i heard them arguing over which one `` had '' to take my special needs family member . if i knew it would n't absolutely ruin his self esteem i would have called the ignorant workers out on their blatant discrimination . i will be contacting the corporate office about this awful treatment . i 'm absolutely appalled by this behavior .	3232
0	this store is a total waste . whom ever does the buying does n't know their job . how can a store be out of whole milk and eggs . this is n't the first time it has happened . i asked to speak to a manager and was told she was on break . girl at the registered could have cared less . this is why i drive a few extra miles and go to walmart neighborhood market .	3355
0	the slowest service you could ever imagine . i love pho so i gave this place 3 chances and it progressively got worse , it also has a bad smell to it and i once had an egg roll that tasted like dog food not even kidding . never going back , service is very important i can get pho else where	205
0	if there were an option to rate as a zero i would . this is a higher end sports bar located in the aria . we selected a seat and waited for a cocktail waitress that never arrived , although there were several around us working the tables . after about 20 minutes my husband walked to the bar and ordered our drinks . we drank our drinks and spent about an hour there . during our time no one greeted or acknowledged our existed . keep in mind we are very well dressed and are , in vegas , what seems to be monthly , and expect at the least some level of professionalism . we drank our mediocre drinks and left .	456
1	friendly staff , great food and great prices . their egg rolls and wonton soup are some of the best i have had . yes the place is a little out dated and could use some remodeling however food is great . give it a try	1009
1	i really love jo-ann 's . they are great about having specials , accepting coupons , and they even accept competitors coupons . they always have a wide selection of all the products . they put the brand name stuff on sale that is hard to find at other places such as wilton . they usually have lots of lines open to checkout and plenty of staff to help you . there are coupons on their phone app as well . it is my favorite of the craft stores !	3943
0	have yet to hear a good experience with their service . with so many options in charlotte , take your money somewhere else that actually treats guests well !	1147
0	please do n't waste your time or money . there are plenty of veternarian 's around that wo n't try and nickel and dime you as much as prestige does ! it 's a real shame because the doc seems nice but been there 5 times and 4 of them was charged more than what i was told . nothing like changing the price after the care has been given . funny thing is they make you sign paperwork showing the price and still change it after your pet has been seen . just a very unprofessional approach to business . stay away ! ! !	939
0	great pizza but the service was awful.i understand it was busy but a simple '' hi sorry we are busy we will be with as soon as we can '' would have sufficed ! i watched 2 tables get up and leave due to being ignored.had i not promised my little girl metro pizza we would of done the same.being busy does n't excuse poor customer service .	192
0	the coffee is good here , but the cashier/barista was rude as hell . before i could order she made sure to finish her side convo with her friend on the other side of the counter . after giving me an incorrect drink she looked at me like it was my problem . no apology .	1234
0	horrible experience . i stopped in to get a mani pedi ... and the entire time i was there the manager was yelling at her employees and the employees were talking about a client . terrible environment for a `` relaxing '' spa day . i do n't mind spending 130 dollars for a nice relaxing experience but that is definitely not what you get at this salon . needless to say i wo n't go back and do not recommend this place .	1606
0	worst steak shawarma ever . plus they packaged salad with hot dish salad was wilted . not interested in going back .	755
1	i had eco install a security door at my business . the salesman talked me into a more expensive but nice looking door that was brand new to their inventory . i think that the installer struggled with it and after a year the door began to fall apart . i called eco and they were quick to respond . they sent out an installer who fixed all the problems and the door works like new again . i appreciate companies that provide service after the sale . eco was definitely one of them .	3540
0	i love the concept of this place but it just is n't worth the price of a membership . it 's $ 50 a month for 10 classes a month ... for that same price you could get a membership to lifetime and have unlimited fitness classes with access to the pool and the equipment . while i love the ideas for the classes , it 's not a very good work out either . you will barely break a sweat . if you go here i would only sign up for their workshops or their pole-ah-tease courses . the dance fitness classes are a waste of money .	2394
1	a gem at the mouth of the cuyahoga river . neat renovation of an old power plant . lots of fish , sharks , sting rays , and moray eels . learn about the fish habitat of lake erie . our guide has a zoology degree . touch pool and long water tunnel . as the fish grow the displays will get cooler . if you have children , then purchase a season pass . take your time . ask questions . gift shop , snack bar and restaurant . went with a women 's group . $ 3 parking at the door . worth every dollar . recommend .	706
0	this is a big no . i love texas roadhouse ... love it ... i will never eat at this one again . chicken tasted spoiled , service was slow , judging by the stomach ache that 's already here i 'd say this is gon na be a great night . drive to another texas roadhouse , trust me .	1491
1	still wonderful , but just a tip -- you ca n't put tips on a credit card , so be sure to bring cash or a check .	841
0	`` rob '' had the audacity to ask me to throw away a cup that customer that was seated next to me had been spitting his chewing tobacco into . he referred to this customer as my `` buddy '' even though i had not spoke a word to this man at any point . not the level of service i expect from a an mgm property . chris on the other hand was professional and prompt , unfortunately his shift ended at 7 and rob 's shift was just beginning . i guess this is to be expected with disgruntled employees on new year 's eve .	2688
0	this place had the best customer service i 've had in my life . that said , the food is horrible ! i 've been wanting to try this place for a while now . did n't feel like the drive , but finally decided to do it ! for starters , we got chili cheese fries . half of them were over cooked the other half were undercooked . the chili was very underwhelming . my main course was a chili and slaw burger . not sure how it 's possible but the medium well burger was dry . it all had the flavor of a high school cafeteria menu . i wanted to live this place . the staff if awesome .	1046
0	gggrrrrr wal mart ! can i get away with never ever visiting another walmart in my life please ? it 's my own fault - i know , but the damn stores have everything and are always open . i have tried going to winco since they are not so corporate and they take care of their employees but there are n't many around where i live ... . gggrrrrr - that 's it !	2443
0	update : now they send a certified letter saying they do not want my wife as a patient anymore . stay away from this dump ! ! ! i submitted a complaint to the medical boaed for medical facilities and they called me and said there was nothing they could do because it is not a licensed facility ! ! ! ! ! she suggested the attorney general and the bbb ! ! !	356
1	i sold my car to carmax , and i had an awesome experience there . the appraisal process was very quick , and i had a check in hand in about 30 minutes . all of the staff were friendly and accommodating , and most importantly , the appraisal of my car was very fair !	2610
1	i would normally go to the amc at az center . i have had issues there with homeless people going into the theater and asking for some of my food . i would tell my concern but nothing would ever be done it happened three times to me . so now i can do this location even though it 's 20 minute drive i 'm a lot more comfortable a lot more safe and thank you	2406
1	we have leased from this company for the past two years . we have no complaints , they have great customer service . michelle is awesome , and has always quickly resolved any concerns or answered any questions we have had .	1578
0	i ordered carry out last week , and it was extremely disappointing . the two items i ordered , kung pao chicken and chicken lo mein were both bland , lacked chicken , and the chicken was obviously from a can ( it tasted like rubber ) . in both dishes , there were more water chestnuts and sprouts than anything else . also , i was given a quarter cup of steamed white rice to go with the dinner sized kung pao chicken and i sadly found a hair in it . the food is over priced and very poor quality . golden dragon is not worth your time , energy , and money .	1009
0	as of right now ... .1 star and that 's only because i had originally made an appointment for last thursday ( 6/1 ) for 1p , and had to call just to find out that the appointment had been forgotten . called today and left a vm . hopefully this business can rectify the actions from last week and i will be more than happy to change my review . here starts the waiting game . ( got a groupon , too late to cancel and i do n't want the credits . this has to work out ) . *follow up ( 6/6 ) : ramsey just returned my call . rescheduled for tomorrow wed 6/7 for 11-1130a . thank you sir !	2888
0	i liked it the first time i was there.my second visit was not so nice.the store smelled like sewage , and the pastries looked dry and old.i do n't think that i will return any time soon .	93
0	absolutely horrible service . buyer beware ! ! ! ! they charged me for services they did not even complete and then refuse to refund me . oh i forgot they are only licensed in the city of las vegas not clark county . always check who you do business with . this company is definitely disgusting .	2854
1	mike at ace hardware . i was told by my wife he was super helpful . we went to one of the hardware `` giants '' tonight . it was horrible ! ! ! hd . ace always takes care of us , but unfortunately it was closed .	3181
1	food was good and flavorful . the rice was naan was excellent . the price for the food is on the high side for indian food compared to the local area . nice dinning atmosphere .	640
0	the woman here is really not nice at all . it always feels like she trying to just give me my food and get me out . she does n't say anything besides what she had to like taking my order . no word after she takes my card .	614
0	the rooms are nice but my property was stolen from my room . 1 wacom tablet and mouse 1 button down shirt ( yes a shirt ! ) . only noticed the shirt missing then when i returned home noticed that my wacom tablet was missing as i needed to edit some images . i only had one bag for my trip so it was always with me ( it 's a messenger bag ) . waiting to hear back from the hotel ... if it 's not what i want to hear then i 'll file a policy report . i fault myself for not noticing right away but i 've never ever had this happen to me before . not good times .	3503
1	i 've tried the chocolate and carrot cakes . both are incredible . the only reason i 'm giving it 4 stars is due to their hours . they close at 6 on the dot and sometimes i do n't make it there in time . there is nothing worse then craving one of these delicious cakes and not being able to get one	18
1	my ultimate favorite spot for shaved ice . since coming from north carolina , it has been hard to find a good shaved ice place , but bahama buck 's have all your needs for shaved ice . the staff are friendly and always willing to give recommendations .	3939
0	not for me . i ordered the beef noodle soup , but it was more like noodles swimming in chili oil . no soup to be found . no beef either , just a few scraps of fat .	1329
0	scammers ! ! ! ... like the other stories , i got an estimate for $ 1200 and had another licensed plumber do it for $ 200 . i called and asked for a refund of the service fee and they never did and never called back . avoid !	2748
1	the coffee here is exceptionally bleh . the chicken salad is surprisingly exceptional . impressive presentation and portion . the textures are well balanced . it even tastes very good . i added tabasco and caesar dressing . did not even finish eating it yet , just really felt it needed to be honored ! !	3378
1	naturally clean does a great job cleaning my house . i love that they make their own natural cleaning supplies ( mostly vinegar and baking soda ) and the essential oils they add leave my home smelling so wonderful . they really take their time in making sure everything is cleaned thoroughly and rachel , the owner , is a pleasure to work with . i would definitely recommend them for a natural house cleaning service !	2038
1	love the toppings ! the greek honey is my favorite . close to home and they have great staff . also do n't forget to sign up for the loyalty program so you get points for every dollar you spend .	3188
1	good facility with plenty of open space and plenty of equipment . staff is friendly and helpful . i do n't understand why they do n't have wifi as i know they hear this comment all the time and it 's an easy fix . that 's the reason for only 3 stars , i do n't think they are being responsive to the needs of the customer . upgrade to 4 stars because they now have wifi . took forever but they have it now	2328
1	this ramada , formerly dobson ranch inn , provided a nice , clean stay while i was in mesa looking for apartments . the room was clean , the grounds are clean , the staff was friendly , and they had a good , free breakfast . the only negative is that the walls between rooms are quite thin ; i was awoken by my neighbor at 5am on the phone . would stay agaia !	1888
1	provided great service , very knowledgeable with explaining everything to me . very satisfied with the service provided and will recommend for sure .	2130
1	i ordered bikinis for my vacation and paid extra for the 2 day delivery . they were very helpful , i called to make sure they would be on time and they sent them out the same day . i received them and they fit true to size ! they 're also made with quality material & reasonably priced . love definitely would recommend !	2661
0	rude counter dude . asked one simple question and was belittled and felt as if i had no idea . follow up was worse , explaining dollar value of inventory to cover a part . this place needs some basic customer service training . not getting my hard earned cash , big box will work	1339
1	love this place . awesome snacks , wicked drinks . the staff are super friendly , and it 's a really great spot to work out of on occasion .	268
1	great for customer service and food selection . the employees are very accommodating and courteous to customers .	2316
0	was referred to them as one of the dealerships by my credit union . i 'm supposed to get a discount through my credit union . i asked fred flores what that discount would be . the response i got was `` this is a limited fords top of the line . but as far as price i wont miss your business `` he did not offer to see what else he could have helped me with just a big `` i wo n't miss your business '' very disappointing	2210
0	had to stop using them after the 3rd cleaning due to the poor quality . we tried but gave up and went to another company who is doing a fantastic job for 3 months in a row now	2029
1	we visit usually once a week . the food is always good and comes out pretty quickly ! hands down melissa h. is the best server , she is very sweet , attentive , and makes sure you always have what you need . i 'll always wait just to sit in her section and get the best service ! !	672
1	i went to see christina at dr. leverett 's office for juvederm on my lips . everyone was beyond professional and i didnt feel pressured like most places to purchase anything . i am beyond happy with my results and will definitely be going back in the future . i have also referred a few people there who also have had great experiences .	557
1	cops have a reputation for being dicks but i did n't experience any problems in january when i last went . clean , especially downtown , fun and the food is better than san francisco but not as good as nyc . parking is near impossible , better to shuttle around some other way .	315
0	did n't understand the 90 sanitation rating , used to be our go to friday pepper steak and chicken fried rice place . never really tried anything else . quick , close by , reasonably priced . never an issue . until our last visit , and will never go back . had eaten about half my fried rice when i saw something shining in my bowl . it was a staple . gross . so i called them to let them know , maybe be more careful , they could not have cared less . since they did n't care , neither do i . you are the weakest link . goodbye .	829
0	horrible service . my mom and i arrived early and she 's one of 2 people in wait area and we waited 45 mins to see a physician ! ! back in the room i asked how much longer and was told dr would be right in and 15 mins later he 's yet to come in ! we are leaving to go to gilbert hospital ! extremely disappointed	350
0	would be a great park but just like craig ranch they have a man made lake which brings waterfowl and all the poop that comes with it . drain it , smooth it and make it a skate park .	367
0	we came for the pompeii exhibit . it was just ok. to view the pompeii exhibit ( which took all of 30 minutes ) you have to pay $ 12 on top of the $ 18 base admission fee . i would n't have minded the price- except this museum has not been updated in the least bit in 20 or more years . all the same interactive exhibits that existed when i was a kid . also a lot of stuff was broken , and really really dirty . i do n't think i 'll be bringing my future children here .	3891
1	i absolutely love this target ! it is always very clean and organized including the bathrooms ! ! the customer service is excellent and people are always around to help . the food selection is on point as well . i love how this target is big and open and has a new store vibe still even though it 's been there for a while . the only reason i took away a star is because sometimes the cashiers do n't know how to do all the coupons and cartwheel and the parking lot is always so packed !	583
0	i 've been going to this place quite a few times now and the first time i went here was n't too bad . they actually did a good job . my nail guy henry is really good at what he does and the price seemed reasonable . but lately when i 've been going back here their prices went up . i come back for fillings and they charge me $ 25 , i might as well get them taken out and get them re-done for the same amount . i would rather go somewhere else from now on . just because i 'm a loyal customer does n't mean u can change the prices on me !	1420
0	this place is a joke . they are unprofessional , rude , and do n't care about doing a good job . they 're interested only in the almighty dollar . watch your dollars closely because they will overcharge you if you do n't pay attention . if you do n't care how you look and you do n't care if you get ripped off , then this is the place for you .	2899
1	i do n't know why your all complaining over the fact that the couturepops are 25 bucks . first of all their not meant to be cheap . and you do n't throw it away when your done . its something that you keep for life ! plus it is encrusted with rhinestones ! ! ! please , its awesome , fun and trendy . las vegas is full of opulent , extravagant items like this .	2021
0	this place is depressing and dark , straight out of the 80s . the only good stores for an adult are dillards , aveda , victoria secret . they have a macys and express , but they dont have good merchandise . the rest of stores seem to be for teenagers and there are some weird ghetto stores . i do like the chompies restarant . for the location i would have expected a decent mall . oh and watch out for the train that goes through the mall !	2815
1	love this store location ! we have been here multiple times for various items and every interaction we 've had with josh and anjoly has been amazing ! they are so knowledgeable and helpful and are truly passionate about helping you make the best choice possible to have a great night 's sleep for years to come ! we highly recommend purchasing mattresses , box springs , and accessories from them !	312
1	one of the best chili 's we have ate at . great service and nice staff . thank you kailey you were one of the best that we have had at any restaurant .	178
0	rude and arrogant staff . why ! ? tried it twice . both times i left before even finishing my drink . do yourself a favor and never come here .	3562
1	if you are affiliated with the university you get a 63 % discount . i used their moving service for my move to south carolina . they were professional , helpful and punctual . they wrapped all my furniture and packed it carefully . we had only 1 broken item which was a metal shoe rack . great movers and i will use them again	112
1	i was pleasantly surprised to find their prices are only slightly higher than what i 'd find back home . while there are plenty of restaurants to eat in vegas sometimes you just want something that 's cheap and quick .	214
1	i was super excited to try this taco joint since they opened , so finally today i got my chance . i was overwhelmed by all the choices they had . i stuck to the al pastor ( marinated pork ) mon-thurs they have a 3 soft shell tacos ur choice of meat , drink and refrained beans and chips for about $ 6 . which i thought was a great deal . and i love the fact they are open 24 hours , and only a short distance from my house . i will be coming back ... maybe for dinner tonight , or breakfast tmw ... chorizo and huevos yummy ...	857
1	this is why this high school is top notch : http : //youtu.be/kfdlysege60 the video says it all . i may be a bias band parent , but i and all 300+ parents of this band and the band staff wo n't argue with me on the fact of how smart talented and amazing the high school is in our local town . just turn your tv on thanksgiving day 2014 to watch the macy 's day parade and you 'll see & feel the pride of nevadans .	3006
1	i 've only been there once because i needed a unique type of rx . i thought the service was just fine . it was clean and very few other customers to make me feel awkward while i waited . the woman at the front was very friendly and i only waited about 5 min . then i got to speak to a pharmacist in a private room to ask any questions which i really appreciated since my situation is a bit embarrassing . overall , looking forward to their service when i have to get my next refill .	1372
1	i have been here several times this year and recently got a haircut and color . you must meet *nicole* for she cuts hair so professionally with time and care . when it comes to color , she presents the best realistic options for you . for example ~ my color was brassy and i wanted a rosy shade but the color did n't take . i was able to get it redone with color that would work on my stubborn head . it was so great she let me come back so we could get it right ! i 'm very happy overall every time i come , but this time was exceptional !	354
1	i love everyone of these places that does the vehicle registration . if you have every spent half a day at the dmv you would completely understand . you pay a little more money to have these guys do what ever you need but there is never more than 1 person in front of you and the wait is never more than 10 minutes ( usually no wait ) . i have several vehicles for my company and often have to deal with registration , tags , new purchases , selling a car , or whatever the dmv can do for your vehicle . you still have to go to dmv for your drivers license stuff .	2990
0	summer roll not fresh and only sprouts and 1 shrimp . pho , great broth but not enough mystery cow parts .	1312
1	this place belongs in charlotte , but i am so glad to see a cool town like cramerton get something like this . this place is by far completely worth the drive down to eat there . food was absolutely wonderful and there were no complaints to be had . i am the first to critique something , and i got nothing . staff was awesome . on point the entire time , food was hot and delicious . plates cleared and drinks refilled without a cue . no complaints . well done all around .	982
0	i wanted to play in the poker tournament , so i checked out this place with a friend to kill some time before it started . bar was empty except for one other person and two bartenders . the bartenders ignored us , eventually they signaled they would be over but kept talking to each other . after about 15 minutes they finally took our order . two $ 16 beers in a small cup and they instantly dropped the check ( not that we wanted a second drink at that price , but it kind of felt like we were n't wanted there ) . i do n't recommend this place to anyone .	2494
0	very plain tacos , not a lot of a flavor . honestly , it tastes like tacos that your friend 's mom would make ( and not in a nostalgic , good way ) .	760
1	this place is great , moist chicken and tender beef . whole chicken is served with corn tortillas , salsa , marinated onions and two sides ( we choose rice and beans ) . carne is served with grilled onions , marinated onions , cucumber , limes , guac salsa and red salsa . this location is now our go-to , the chicken is more moist than our former spot in tempe , and they accept credit cards .	1581
0	unfortunately they have gone downhill and i no longer go here after three years . they treat you like they 're doing you a favor ! the older pedicurists are rude , especially if you do n't want the hour long $ 44 pedi . they do a terrible job and treat you like crap .	2297
1	been here for 3 1/2 years and ca n't complain much at all . besides bodies of water , you can find almost everything enjoyable . lots of resorts for relaxing and entertaining , millions of wonderful restaurants , shopping galore , spring training and other visiting sports teams/events . truly is the best place to live that i can see ! it 's sort of `` hot '' come late june-early sept but it could be worse ... and rain 300 days a year !	2475
0	we just had awful experience tonight . the name is cash inn country , and in past friday evening has been ( mostly ) country music . the 'guest ' dj was not playing any country , the volume was deafening , fancy too bright light show was not pretty/only blinding , and the smoke machine was absolutely obnoxious . we left after about 15 minutes , eyes burning , and my clothes just reek , worse than any cigarette smoke . this establishment bills itself as a country bar , but it sure was n't tonight . do n't know if will go back another night or not	2860
1	overall : nice clean store with good selection for office supplies and helpful employees . selection & availability : 3 stars . they tend to sell out of the items on promotion . customer service : 4 stars . they were generally helpful , but one guy was more worried about changing price tags than helping .	2022
1	like the service as it is fast and somewhat friendly . it is not authentic vietnamese cuisine ; the servers spoke cantonese . the food is a mixture of malaysian , vietnamese , and chinese cuisine . we got a big bowl of noodle soup between two people , two curry dishes , and another noodle soup . again , fast and tasty . liked the mango slushy .	331
1	the perfect pear was perfect ! the bacon & jalapeno grilled cheese sandwich was unique and delicious . every bite offered an explosion of flavor . the fries were done just right , and did not require any condiments . the soups and salad were of high quality and very tasty . we need non-chain restaurants like the perfect pear in the metro . the service was great , too , and so we will return .	1458
0	honestly the only reason i come to the store is because it 's close to my home . the staff is rude the stores dirty lines are long there 's no sense of customer service . i hate myself for coming back to the store . lord someone build another grocery store downtown .	2316
0	worse food ever . i order a plate which was barely to see the chicken shawrma on top of rice and oily	808
1	i was hosting a baby shower for my cousin and i wanted a blue tiffany & co theme . i ordered cake pops , macaroons , cupcakes for my cupcake tower ... ..and a small cake on top of the tower was decorated like a tiffany gift-wrapped present . all i can say is omgggggggggg ... ..it was absolutely beautiful and delicious ! ! ! ! the staff was so nice and professional . did i mention how good everything tasted ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! i am definitely using them again .	1806
0	i only have a few words to sum up about the food at this place , terrible , terrible & terrible ! we went there on a saturday night and it was empty . the reason for this only could mean one of two things 1. nobody has any money to go out for dinner because of the bad economy or 2 the food is n't good . well , it 's the ladder of the two . my advice is save your money and go to p.f . changs instead !	489
1	heres the thing , katsu has a small ayce sushi menu but its all pretty good . the atmosphere of the place is good , the food is great and the fact that i can get ayce sashimi for less than $ 15 is awesome . while the menu doesnt have as many items as some other ayce sushi joints it still has many stand out items . i have been to half a dozen sushi joints in toronto so far and this is still probably my favourite .	745
0	prefer no attitude with my ice cream . just went tonight and the same girl waited on my family . no hello , no smile , no thank you and a lot of attitude in between . other cheaper options that are a lot friendlier !	3537
1	awesome car wash place . they are very friendly and at reasonable price you get what you paid for . the staff even hand dried my car . if you are in the area def visit them .	3061
1	first time here and went with some of my friends and had a great time . the food was sooo good . i had the tandoori feast for two as i split it with a friend and it was so yummy . the waiter was really nice too .	140
1	our 1st experience here was great ! the green tea ribs was tender and i even liked the cabbage that came with it . the second time we were here , the waiter suggested their new and ` experimental ` hotpot , which were pieces of tofu , meat , veggies with the same brown soy colour and taste . did not enjoy that although i guess it was ` experimental ` . love the concept and decor here , very unique and apparently authentic of what they have in japan . we had the same waiter both times ( think he is the owner ? ) very knowledgeable , and enthusiastic .	1582
0	love this place downtown but the scottsdale location has no manners . sat at bar for 10 min while bartender ignored us . no menu , no water . we walked out and they could have cared less .	602
0	i loved the you get free shipping when you put a credit card on file , then you get the invoice and see handling is $ 15 ... .	2827
1	i love going to this family ran business . the sushi is always on point super fresh fish and great tasting rolls . the staff is super friendly . my new go to sushi place ! the tuna was some of the freshest i 've tasted in vegas . their menu had a large variety of rolls yet tons of other options for people who do n't like sushi . my family was all pleased tonight : )	985
0	an inner grommet replacement on a boot , & i get this botched job back for $ 20 cash only of course . outside all scratched too . ugh .	1648
0	no flavour whatsoever , when the noodles came the soup was completely clear and i thought maybe that 's normal . but nope . the soup was bland and had no flavour to it no matter how much chili oil and vinegar i added it was still really bad . not sure how this place has such high rating . waited over 30 mins for the noodles .	790
0	my opinion is that you should n't go here . there was a racist bald dude that almost mad me bald . after i pay , and went out . as soon as i step 2 yard away i came back . then i said is there a way to fix it . he reply what do you want me to fix in a scared voice . if you see this bald guy in great clip do n't request him if i were you .	739
1	good service , professional attitude , acknowledged me within five minutes , will come back here each time ..thank you	2365
0	never again ! ! staff was completely rude ... charged me for 2 regulars instead of the 2 smalls i ordered . sad thing is i did n't realize till i looked at my receipt when i left . also took over 15 mins just for 2 snos . i understand its a saturday evening and hot as hell but very disappointed in the staff . two blonde white girls who were n't even helping , did more talking than anything . wo n't be coming back .	3939
1	decent but pricy . i had a huge portion of lasagna that was pretty tasty . i bought expensive cannoli that is n't anything like what you 'd find at corbo 's so i 'd probably never get that again . if you go on a tuesday night , be warned : it gets chilly bc they leave the side wall open for the karaoke night .	567
0	very bad customer service . i am never going back again i am better off shopping online .	2477
1	awesome service and everyone is friendly ! definitely handled customer service properly ! thank you !	78
1	i had excellent dental care at red mountain family dental in mesa , az . the front desk was friendly and accommodated my schedule . i had one of the best teeth cleanings that i have ever had . the dentist was friendly and professional . he showed me the xrays and explained the treatment plan in detail . he completed my dental work pain free and i am thrilled with the results . i will be referring friends and family to red mountain family dental .	1938
0	owner is the most complete jerk you will ever encounter . if you want to be disrespected and taken for granted , this is your place .	1183
0	my advice ... stay away . here 's why ... i paid for a class three weeks in advance ( for nov 20 ) . because of healthy reasons , i am unable to make the class . i called , spoke to an employee , who promised an immediate refund . several days later , still no refund . i called again and spoke to paul , who rudely refused to honor the refund , saying `` their terms and conditions prevented refunds . '' never was told this up front . i can not make the class , nor reschedule and they are keeping my $ 50 class fee in full . bad business and bad customer consideration . be forewarned !	1128
1	best . haircut . ever ! ! ! ! five huge stars to barber thom `` slick boy '' oravec and the rest of the guys at hi-rollers for the best time i 've ever had at a barber shop in las vegas . if you visit hi-rollers , you can expect to be in there for a while because thom pays attention to every detail and makes sure you get exactly the cut you want . you can also expect for some lively conversation . along with hookers , blackjack , bad sports bets and beer , hi-rollers is now on my list of `` must-dos '' in las vegas .	3574
1	their key cutter is sharpened every day and my key copies work perfectly . fast , efficient , friendly , knowledgable service . my only issue is that i wish i had asked about the cost of my car key copies . they are the old fashioned non-chip type that both open the door manually and start the ignition . these copies cost $ 10 each -- several dollars more than the house keys i was copying , which i did n't realize . this company offers a 24/7 emergency locksmith service if you lose your keys so their number is in my phone !	3822
0	everyone in vegas ! this place do n't know how to create a customer experience . they spelled my nephew 's name wrong on his cake for his first bday ! the solution they gave to us - a refund ? ? ? we do n't need the money ! ! it was 2 months since we ordered this cake ! get your business right people ! you bake to give a memorable and not a horrible experience !	2196
1	clean , fast , fresh , friendly , understated , and just plain great ! i ordered the big wheeler today and it was awesome . spicy steak/sausage mix , fresh bread , well worth the 1/2 mile stroll on this cold afternoon . just go , you wo n't be disappointed !	347
1	the staff and the doctor were amazing : they were very warm and accommodating , made sure to inform you about all the fees , took care of the hassle of contacting your insurance , and made sure to facilitate a transfer in case you needed a specialist ( like i did since i needed a wisdom tooth removed asap )	3358
0	i think this place is a terrible place for a country concert ( and probably rock , hip hop or any genre where people want to drink or eat ) .. mostly because you have to wait in ridiculously long lines for everything . there 's only two bars , 1 or 2 concession stands which are cash only and only one atm machine . you miss half the concert waiting in line for food/drinks , the money to get the food/drinks and to go to the bathroom .	3868
1	so happy with my service today . i went in with a nail in my tire and a slow leak , in about 15-20 minutes i was back in my car and my wheel was fixed with not a single cent being spent . all of the people who worked there were polite and informative and fast working . i had come from a different location where i was told to wait 60-90 minutes from an extremely rude employee , but this location was the complete opposite . not only was i in and out super quick , the service was done free of charge and they would n't even accept a tip . i will never be going anywhere else for anything tire related !	3860
0	i have been the customer at this place 6 years . there was a reason i came back to this salon over that time and that was great service and the person who did my nails . she always did an amazing job . when new owner showed up , everything changed , all the technicians that had worked there are gone and you do n't see happy faces in the salon anymore . on top of everything the new owner is unprofessional and unapologetic person . the way he treats people who work for him and me , a long-time customer , is terrible .	3842
0	have not had a problem with any department except for the vein surgery dept . the staff there lies to clients in order to get them to agree to surgery . they lied to me and now i have tons of medical bills to prove it that i can not afford .	3731
1	this place is the best . best food , best staff ( hi alixandra ! ) best owner ... we always ( always ) enjoy our meal and the service is amazing . mickey is not just the owner but a friend to all who enter . we look forward to our friday night date at mickeys and highly recommend dining here .	1147
0	was there last saturday at about 11 , sat down for 20 minutes with my girl and no serving staff came up to us at all . a few looked right at us as they walked by to the couple of occupied tables but other than that nothing . we left and went to another place in town but i am pretty concerned as we are a mixed race couple and were completely ignored . as we were leaving i noticed all the staff just hanging out at the bar with the bartender chit chatting . i do n't think it 's fair to say their behaviour was racist but completely without any class is probably accurate .	1546
0	you must be kidding me 30 % service fee without noticing us . worst experience ever . do n't mention that terrible sound .	1835
0	the name lepeep reminds people of eggs benedict . that is a double-edged sword . my bene was the `` crab cake '' one . i would have like real crab in there though . imitation crab meat is nothing more than fish , chopped , formed into strings and dyed on the edges . it resembles vinyl . tasted like it too . especially since one side was burned black as pavement , while the other side never touched the grill . add the uncooked english muffin , overcooked poached egg , and you really do n't have a winner . but hey- they did cover it in hollandaise sauce , so i could n't see it . it 's all good now right ?	364
1	we went to les 3 brasseurs for lunch and our amazing waiter recommended this place when i asked for a shit rowdy sports bar with cheap beer . it did not disappoint ! we were just two but the place was n't super busy so they let us sit at the table with the tap . the beer is stupid cheap , cheaper than anywhere i 've had it in the states , and you ca n't turn in any direction without facing a tv . the menu is huge and we did n't try the food , but everything was cheap too . we are definitely hitting this up next time we come to montreal !	574
0	meh.crab stick in most of sushi says it all . hamachi kama was horrible . the market next door is very good	985
0	note : i visited the garden in july of 2016 . the chinese garden was closed and they where doing major renovation . so we heard chainsaw throughout our visit . as a local , i know how superb this place can be . opulent flowers , gorgeous trees , zen garden everything to feast your eyes on . but i was so disappointed ! only the green houses exhibition where good .	183
0	trash . trash . trash . this bar is a complete waste of time . the only time i will go there now is if a friend is playing there . every time i have gone it is like our generations excuse to be completely uninhibited , disgusting and irresponsible . not to mention if you want a free show of someone blowing someone else , screwing , fighting or snorting things this is the place to be .	2045
0	wait time too long . i went in one day & was informed of a 50 minute wait time , it would n't have been too bad if one of the stylists had n't serviced one of her friends ( who was not on the list ) before me . also , it seems like they do n't have any management since some of the `` ladies '' working there dress as if they were working in a brothel .	3232
1	dr. tafreshi is one of the best doctors i 've ever been to , meadows medical group is such a productive and professional group , always a great experience when i come . plus they do blood work here to , all in one place .	3465
0	i do n't know how or why this place is rated so high . i 've eaten at the other brothers in goodyear and mistakenly ordered from here . cheap cheese and sauce out a can , not mention the ranch dressing resembled peppered milk .	773
0	went today for lunch . sat outside on the patio was seated quickly sat there for twenty minutes while servers passed doing searingly nothing could not get anyone 's attention so we left . poor service	1367
1	i had heard great things from coworkers and found today they were all true . i had the best manicure i 've ever had here today . the owner did my nails and was very professional and friendly . the whole staff smiled and asked if there was anything they could get me . on top of that i 've never received a complimentary shoulder massage while waiting for my nails to dry . i got gel nails , but i am almost hoping i need to go back before two weeks !	2197
1	very authentic chinese food . i felt for noodle soup and found this little spot . the food is very good and tastes like my grandparents cooking ! they just opened two weeks ago . i 'll definitely be back !	1329
0	unsure why my gel fill and pedicure with regular polish ended up being $ 92 ... wtf . did n't look very good either , toes chipped a few days later !	3084
0	totally over priced ! i got chicken fried rice 8 $ and shrimp fried rice so sad ! ! .very little amount.its rice for god sake and bearly any chicken too . same with other 10 $ very little shrimp and the tiny ones too.never seen that.that white square box should of been full ! it wasnt even half ! ! rip off .	408
0	i would suggest you to not go here first i went with a friend of mine to get acrylic full sets and when i was getting my nails done the lady kept on filing my nails and she was so rough and started filing a little bit of my skin and it hurt and i said ouch and pulled my hand back multiple times and she still kept doing it and me and my friend got the same exact thing done but they charged her 5 dollars more but i will not be going back	3607
0	no self-check out at this location . parking is plentiful . wells fargo and starbucks inside this location . the restrooms were pretty gross . i turned around and left .	3938
1	i am a regular here i always come here for during my lunch break . anna the owner is a sweetheart and she is always very welcoming . i 've had both their sushi and their hibachi and i am pleased with both of them . their lunch specials are very good .	890
1	the abandoned room was super fun ! definitely needs a lot of teamwork with 2 teams split between 2 rooms at first . 2 free hints in 45 minutes . they use cool direction locks for this one and lots of clever letter/number clues . creepy music sets the mood pretty well . we had 8 people and it 's definitely a room that needs lots of people to work together at the same time to win . no tech malfunctions which is a plus . will definitely be back for another room ! groupon was $ 50 for 4 people on weekend .	3088
0	rough neighborhood , lock your doors . decent food at decent prices . use side entrance next to the circle k. location signage needs improved . the breakfast is their main dish , so the hours reflect . family owned and ran business .	1455
1	been coming here for years . always good service . low staff turnover which creates great customer service experiences .	2052
1	i really like to thank the phoenix police dept for all their help in helping us with a apartment building that has had many issues . we have made progress and have cut down on vandalism/theft/trespassing/squaters etc . we could of not done it with out you . it seemed like everyday we were calling you for assistance and each time you responded you were courtesy/professional/concern and offered great customer service . we worked as a team to transform this apartment building to a better place to live for our tenants . we will be forever thankful .even when we did not call you u were in the area patroling . once again thank you so much . you are appreciated and respected . joyce m	2322
1	very tight narrow restaurant . probably seats more people than they should . the service is friendly and always pleasant . if you 're looking for a down to earth mexican place to unwind with friends with good food and friendly staff this would be the place . i find the food always consistent , delicious , fresh and relatively affordable . p.s i love the guac and chips ! they come warm and with a generous portion of guacamole ! great way to start a mexican meal !	1305
1	my mom and i have been going here for the last 7 years . win is a talented hair stylist who knows how to cut asian hair and of course , all other types too . i always ask for layers and usually 1-2 inches off and he does the job well . if you want your hair thinned out he does that too . it helps if you can describe what you want in cantonese or chinese , or bring a picture of what you want , but he usually knows how to create what you 're asking for . they also offer facials/massages .	3486
1	took my acura tl to kurt and kyle at dun-rite for back bumper and tail light repair they were sincerely friendly and professional , they did a great job , it looks new . my mechanic recommended them to me so i also remommend them ..	2280
1	one of the best pedicures i have ever had . toni is a delight and the results last for weeks . very fun atmosphere with an interesting clientele ! !	3233
1	been to this place a bunch of times , food is consistently great . best wings in town ! i always order the gold wings , also the burger and steak fries are awesome . service is great they have a professional attitude and the cheesecake is so good . this is the place to go eat and watch sports or horse racing . solid wifi connection too .	717
0	horrible customer service got an oil change and declined tires then was told there was a nail in the tire & ended up buying a new tire and loan behold no nail in the other tire just low tread thanks for having me spend 90 $ that was n't necessary . and when i called to complain i get a guy that puts me on hold and then hangs up and then i call back and he became the manager within seconds . never coming back as i can by the rest of the reviews no will anyone else . definitely do n't recommend to anyone who wants to up there sales	1871
0	really disappointed by this place . we 've tried a lot of good , authentic , flavourful korean places in north york , but this place is not one of them . the ribs for 2 cooked on your table was rough and poorly seasoned . i have done much better ribs myself at home . side dishes were boring particularly the kim chi was a let down . pricey parking nearby as well .	1290
1	went to see arie spears earlier in the year and was impressed with the improv @ harrah 's . club was swank with a nice calm `` old school '' vibe . the openers were funny along with arie rounding out a nice evening inside the club . overall , i was comfortable inside the club and the wateriness was prompt with the drinks .	1270
1	i have used these cleaners for over 10 years . as cleaners go , the service has been very good . things get done in a timely manner and get done well . i really appreciate their free home pickup and delivery service . it makes things convenient . i usually use the delivery service , and drop things off when i need them urgently . would recommend .	2784
1	i 've never had a thai style massage . it 's definitely not what i expected , but a great experience nonetheless . go in with something comfy , as you wo n't be changing out of anything . this massage focuses on stretching as much as massaging . the pricing is very reasonable . the only thing i found odd was the room layout . it has 6 tables , and was more of a community room rather than individual rooms . the staff was very friendly . it would have been 5 stars but it can be distracting hearing another guest come in halfway through your massage . i will be back .	2455
0	this place is a dump -- the gas pump screens are cracked , hard to read , weathered by the sun , the buttons do not work , and it wo n't take a normal credit card without going inside . the station is dingy and unkempt . the one thing that was positive was that the attendant was kind and knew i was frustrated by the situation . i had to use two pumps just to get gas as the one screen was unable to be used because the buttons for my zip code did not work and then it would n't re-set . i will be avoiding this station in the future .	986
1	really enjoyed dinner here with my two older kids . wonderful selection of food , there is something for everyone . my daughter loves sushi and she says it was delicious . i loved the freshly grilled steak , it was wonderfully flavored . my son loved everything . lots of vegetable choices and i liked that almost everything is labeled and says if it is spicy . sauteed green beans , broccoli chicken , pork buns , mushroom chicken , salmon , peanut chicken were some other favorites and the apple pie was good desert . the decor was beautiful and the staff were all very friendly . we will definitely become regular customers .	135
1	la flor de calabaza es un lugar como ningun otro en phoenix . musica en vivo , bebidas y deliciosos aperitivos . excelente servicio , la chica que nos atendio nos ofrecio muy buenas sugerencias en cuanto a bebidas y los aperitivos . la musica es rock en espanol . es un lugar donde te puedes divertir y estar en un ambiente tan padre entre amigos . definitivamente regreseramos .	190
1	good location . dropping off donations can be a pain . it can take forever and you can be in the way since it 's up front . the staff is pretty friendly . this is one of the smaller goodwills in my opinion . i 've had some good finds . one time i found a longchamp purse here for $ 3 . my husband loves their selection of books here .	2117
0	receptionist was extremely vague in available times for a blowout and was unprofessional-gave the impression that the facility did not want to work past a certain time . could be that facility did not have enough stylists which in effect , means it is likely not prepared to provide convenient services for women .	1423
0	service was terrible . waited 20 min for a table the almost an hour for food . then the order was incomplete and inaccurate . then waited too to long just to get the cheque .	643
0	the dropoff used to be at the departures doors and the pickup was at the baggage claim . now the dropoff and pickup place is at a small lot just outside the short term parking lot . it 's a longer walk outside and the walkways are uneven . you also have to navigate two escalators to get into the terminal with all of your luggage . at $ 11 per day , this is not cheap . now it is not convenient , either . i wo n't be back .	248
0	great workouts , but expensive . i 'm a premium member , paying $ 169 a month , and missed one day that i 'd signed up for and they charged me $ 12 for not canceling . i 'm done .	3367
0	made a delivery order through yelp today . i have to say i 'm honestly disappointed . i chose this place because it had 4 stars . definitely a lie ! for one , the delivery took forever . the salad i ordered came soggy . the pizza was cold . the only thing that came out right was the soda pop .	1399
0	dated resort that needs an uplift . some staff were great , some not so great . i 'd recommend a holiday inn over this place . beds are prob 30 years old , air conditioner is crazy loud , and bathrooms are circa 1985 . pool area is not terrible , but not great either . for all the choices in the area , this place needs to step up their game ! just being honest ... ...	2883
0	they are a huge scam . matt will make your life a miserable misery . read some of the other reviews about how this company will steal your deposit . got charged for pre-existing issues even after signed move-in form showing pre-existing problems . sure , you could take them to court but it will cost you even more . stay away . you are warned .	2848
1	real ecuadorian helado de paila or gelato ! ! beautifully fresh and flavorful gelato ! . also wonderful service to boot ! ! my favorite is key lime and twighlight flavored ! the owners are amazingly sweet people come support this business ! ! you wont be disappointed !	499
0	this company continues to send threatening letters to me though we have no written contract with them . do not do business with them ! !	2708
1	i love this store one of the things i like most is the fact that you can get 40 % off of your most expensive item if it ` s not already on sale . just whip out your phone , pull up their website and get the coupon code . downside , they 're closed on sunday : - ( ... . i 've been spoiled , lol	204
1	i was very impressed by the customer service here . i had just gotten a flat across the street , around 5:15 so i drove over to big o to get a new tire . little did i know that they close at 5 ! the guy behind the counter was cool though and still took care of me . they did n't have the tire i needed in stock , but they were nice enough to change my flat to my spare , all for free . if they had the tire i needed , i would have bought a whole set of 4 !	2146
1	our little fur baby gizmo came to pete & macs for his first spa treatment and i could n't be happier . his cut was exactly what i wanted , rachelle was really good and patient with him . i 've read about dogs getting a bad cut so i was a little worried but i was quickly put at ease when he walked out looking like a million bucks . i watched other dogs get groomed and both groomers were very sweet to each pet , doing things at the pace of each pet instead of themselves . pete & macs is our puppy spa .	3108
1	very good and cozy atmosphere . the coffee is awesome . i had `` nut ' n'honey '' . the staff is polite and helpful . do n't forget to tip ! they need fund to finish the death star !	2163
0	went to this location to use our bogo bagel sandwich coupon . at 8am this location was out of everything bagels and they were out of blueberry muffins . our last 4 visits between 7 and 8 am they have not had blueberry muffins . in addition to our visit on 11/18/16 i observed cooked eggs and deli meat sitting on the white cutting board while the staff was waiting for the bagels . we keep going because of the location but after this last visit we will try the location on thunderbird .	3372
0	sold me a $ 40 vape pen that overheats . shop keep gave me the cold shoulder the whole time and never gave me any useful info or warning during the purchase . avoid at all cost .	3119
1	attended devry and received my bachelor 's in accounting . moved from being an admin assistant to a business manager within a month . great education and attended keller graduate school of management for my m.b.a . the job opportunities keep coming . highly recommend the school .	1081
0	if there was a place for no stars that is what we would post ! glad the person below is happy but our home was for sale they messed around for weeks then we contacted this location as it the corp office ... ... ... what a jerk the manager could care less it wasted 810 long weeks finally the buyer pulled the loan and was set up by my realtor in co with a bank the loan will be done in 2 wks i lost the home i wanted it is just a mess i plan on taking this further anyway i can so be very careful there are better mortgage co and banks out there do not get sucked in this place is so unprofessional	968
0	food ok but basically a way to charge high dollar for cheap ingredients and almost no cooking labor required	1127
0	felt like they were unorganized every employee was running everywhere . as a customer felt neglected . recommendation for them is to have assigned areas for employee . also number the tables , this will help when delivering food .	3062
1	staff is friendly i walked in and got an appointment the same day price point is good . lady missed a few spots but i will be back .	1647
1	recently bought a pre-owned 2009 eos . worked with doug marshall . he was quickly able to `` read '' us and introduced us to a model , which i , quite frankly , did not know existed . within 48 hours , with doug 's description of the car and it 's features , i owned one . he was the consummate salesperson , working out the details of the deal , getting the car ready , etc . during the final walk-through , i even commented , `` boy , you guys think of everything . '' doug brought a degree of pleasure back to the car-buying experience . i 'd be happy to work with him again .	3774
1	i guess i 'm at the new location but from what i was told they 're open til 7pm ... . writing my review while going thru the wash awaiting the results ... . keep ya posted ... so far so good they 're giving free washes in exchange for reviews ... update ... car was still wet had to dry bits and pieces manually ... . but the vacuum worked so well it sucked up dirt and my floor mat	3878
1	had a fantastic experience at this barber shop . claude was fantastic and is such a great person to talk to while in the chair . this is an art to him , not just a haircut . he takes his time and has great conversation with his patrons . such a wealth of knowledge on the area , and such a fantastic person to talk to . greatly appreciated his service and his skill . kudos to claude ! ! !	3498
0	the staff is very nice and helpful but there pricing sucks ! ! ! ! ! very over priced . i went with my wife and my sister and brother in law , we all wanted to get tattoos . i have 6 so i am fairly familiar with tattoo pricing . long story short why wife wanted a small piece that should be around $ 75 to vegas price maybe $ 150 . they wanted $ 350 bucks ! they must be joking right my piece that should be maybe $ 150-200 they wanted $ 750 . the point is that they apparently think that the ink is liquid gold or something .	2912
0	the drive thru is so slow . they have messed up my order several times . they gave me iced tea with no ice . the last time i ordered . the burger was smashed into a mess in the wrapper and the fries were raw . it 's a shame because i have been to others where the burger was great . the fries were crispy and the tea had ice.. i hope they teach their workers how to do the job	1068
1	perfect pedicures , every visit . ladies , if you have n't had a real pedicure , you 're missing out !	3233
1	best sushi in henderson . thick slices of sashimi and creative rolls . cucumber passion is my favorite . no ayce . quality of rolls and friendly staff make it our regular go to .	408
1	wonderful atmosphere . i got a cut and color , it was fabulous , staff was very warm and welcoming . i will definitely be coming back . please check out this salon downtown !	2771
0	while this is one step ahead of planet fitness this place is not a place where you are going to go and get strong and built . this is a club , where you go to watch tv on your treadmill , where you can go and watch a movie in the movie theater in the gym , where you can run into a bunch of high school kids starting crap on the basketball floor , or where you can go to watch people try and hit on women . this place is overpriced and pretty ridiculous .	2699
0	i 've been to many italian restaurants and this is one of the worst ones i 've been to . first off , make sure to book a reservation on weekends since it can get very busy . we waited for 45 minutes before we were seated in the crowded dining area . i ordered pasta with shrimp and it was not good . the sauce was very liquidy and the pasta was overcooked . it did n't have much flavour either . i would n't return here . much better restaurants in the area .	440
1	had a great time with both kids here ! plenty to do , i raced the go carts and played mini golf with them . laser tag , batting cages and this weekend we are going back for zombie paintball ! looks like a blast ! ca n't wait	3001
1	love this place ! recently went for a straight razor shave and my barber remembered me from the last time i 'd been in town . these guys are a class act and absolute artists .	3574
1	the food is amazing and fresh ! ! i had the smoked chicken street tacos ! if they offer the smoked dry ribs ( not on the menu ) try them ! ! amazing ! !	562
1	i 'm now a boba addict ! when i came her for the first time i was kind of a deer in headlights with all the options . the place was also very busy . the girl that took our order was very patient and calmly answered all my questions . i played it safe and ordered the thai tea boba slush . it can fairly fast and was super delicious ! i can not wait to be more adventurous and try some other flavors .	490
0	very disappointing ! chicken tenders were fresh out the fryer but i was n't counting on getting mcdonalds like type of `` chicken '' , if you 've been to rasing canes , you will know waffles cafe it 's not selling real chicken . kids meal ? waffle was n't fresh , bacon did n't look good either , scrambled eggs looked and tasted like plastic . no complain about the service but until today i thought service was everything , great service without quality products still is n't gon na bring people again . i think this place still have good reviews because disappointed people do n't write or they 're deleting this type of reviews to bring people instead of fixing the issue .	580
1	visited this store today for bedding . best shopping experience that i 've had in a good long time . vicky delgato waited on us and i am so happy she did . she is the most pleasant , helpful , and knowledgeable salesperson that i have met in 60 odd years . she placed an on-line order for us for the pieces that they did not stock in the store , rang up the sale for us and was so nice . wow , i would strongly recommend visiting this store .	1884
1	they an have amazing list of beers and many are in tap . there 's a short food menu but it 's simple bar classics that are great for sharing such as fries ( they come is a pretty big basket ) . a waitress recommended that i try their garlic doughnuts which were amazing . small space but it 's cozy , casual and relaxed atmosphere . definitely coming back !	3039
1	this rating is for tamara who replied to my review . she is amazing and helped get my membership cancelled .	2959
0	great ambiance , staff is super nice . drinks were horrible . i had a long island , it tasted like sprite , super watered down . i also had a shot of fireball and patrón , they were ok , not even slightly typsy . i believe the hookah and drinks were overpriced .	1229
0	i had a horrible experience this morning . the latina girl working at the window was incredibly rude and condescending . i was going to go to the einstein bagel that is close by , but opted for this mcdonald 's . i wish i had gone with my original choice . i will in the future . it made my whole morning feel very negative . i advise against using this establishment due to the customer service .	1023
1	yes , it 's incredibly touristy and silly , but there 's still something fun about having a drink out of an ice cub glass while wearing gloves and a poncho in the middle of the desert . it 's pricey , but a fun way to do something different in lv and a fairly memorable experience .	2245
1	good selection of specialty pizzas . $ 18 range on large but very tasty for hand tossed pizza .	87
0	detailed conversation with owner regarding ingredients - whole foods , like fruit , peanut butter , a little fruit juice is ok , no yogurt , no fillers . `` yes , this one is just bananas , strawberries and a little apple juice '' . failed to add it was over 2 cups of ice . so , my hubby 's breakfast today , four strawberries , one half ( yes 1/2 ) a banana , bit of apple juice and a whole lotta ice . sorry honey ! ( btw , $ 6 )	3026
0	came here looking for some new vinyl and found out they do n't even have a debit machine yet still charge tax on all the records , the store was dirty and some hip hop records were left on the floor in water from peoples shoes . the guy i spoke too was very friendly , the prices were a little over priced too . with the vinyl record industry rising again i wo n't be wasting my time at this dump , sorry bud but clean up your shop .	2734
0	i tried to give her a chance to fix my hair but there was no time to do it apparently . it had potential to be nice but she was sloppy and then did n't care to fix mistakes until i pointed them out . i will instead show a picture of my hair so that she knows she did a bad job and still took $ 200 from me .	335
1	i 'm so impressed with this nail salon . by far the best experience i 've ever had at any salon . not only is it very clean and they seen to take extra steps to provide a very sanitary experience , the staff is very personable and we had a great time with them ! i would recommend this place to everyone .	1256
1	a mans paradise affordable tools guys need and want at lower than dirt prices . upon entering store was greeted with with a boystering hello made us feel at home . clearance prices on top of discount prices . look out home depo lowes theirs a new kid on the block .	3195
0	this place has had blue tarps and sandbags on their roof for months . have some pride . really tired of looking at it !	297
1	this was my go to morning coffee spot , before my long commute uptown ! staff is super friendly , coffee is always fresh , with a choice of different blends , ( raspberry chocolate is to die for ) i never ordered a crepe , due to time but , my husband has , and says they are just devine ! always an array of baked goods , and a huge smoothie menu . go , if u have n't been ! !	3684
1	there was a hiccup with the airline and my flight reservation but they helped me sort it out in a professional manner . they displayed great customer service , especially shraddha , who was very respectful . they answered all of my calls and emails promptly and was able to reschedule my flight in a timely manner .	1574
1	good experience all around . they were quick to schedule an appointment and called ahead to say they could arrive early . nice ! the plumber , louis , fixed a leaky shower for us and installed a bunch of new faucets throughout the house . it was service with a smile and they got the job done right the first time . the price was good , too .	1473
1	do n't believe everything you read . i just left there and have nothing but good things to say about the service and product availability . sure , it can be a little warm outside , but the staff was great .	1987
0	smoothies are disgusting . you can mix up to 3 flavors but they 're all clearly powdered . they 're not fresh at all . save your money and go elsewhere .	2397
1	they always blend my coffee the best ! the service is fast and efficient . it 's close to my home and my job too !	3143
1	colburn enterprises has been fantastic helping with plumbing jobs both at our home and also our small rental property . always professional , getting the job done well , and very straightforward and honest ; it 's disheartening the price gauging that we 've experienced with other plumbers , but never with colburn enterprises . amber is terrific to deal with on the phone . jeremy handled a couple of jobs for us , and we hope to work with john , the owner , for future jobs which will inevitably come up . highly recommend .	3138
1	this is a fantastic hotel ! guest services were nice . i have to send a big thank you to jensen from valet for really going above and beyond to help us out . thank you young man .	3337
0	update : while rentals used to be good , they do n't seem to answer the phone anymore . i tried literally six times over three days and could not get through . how am i supposed to reserve equipment if i ca n't ask what 's available ? i called photoservice after that and got through on the first call .	1809
0	every bath and body works that i have ever been to has accepted expired coupons . ours was two days old so i do get that it has expired but this lady was snobby about it and would n't let us use it . i told her every one we have been to has accepted them . she did n't care . well looks like we wo n't be here again .	2600
1	food is always excellent ! ! service can sometimes be not so great . i never see a manager checking on customers and servers seem to forget about customers . if they fixed that problem , i will give them a 5 star .	192
0	we did n't even get to the haircut . i called and left her a message with my name and number . she called me back soon after to book my appointment and verified my contact number at the end of the call . i show up to the salon only for the receptionist to tell me that frances had cancelled all of her appointments for the day and did n't call me because she did n't have my phone number . after she verified my number when she called me back just a couple days prior . bad business . so i had someone else do my hair . probably a blessing in disguise .	1915
1	the best dry cleaners in toronto ! they take amazing care of our clothes and have unbeatable prices . i love the pick up / drop off service , it 's so convenient . 100 % recommend them !	3529
1	came by on my trip to vegas a few months back . its a great club away from the strip very nice waiters must i say the called an uber for us very pleased with their music overall great experience .	849
1	the team at western dental were all excellent and did a great job at handling my annual dental checkup and mouth guard casting . mariely was very helpful in explaining all of the information and procedures that i was having done to me that day . ada made getting my sports mouth guard casting a quick and easy process . hieu took the time to give my teeth a thorough cleaning and ensure that i had a pleasant exeperience . and dr. wong was very professional and answered any and all questuons that i had . i highly recommend this office and their well trained staff .	3292
0	i was taking classes downtown and for $ 15 a month , this was a great deal for keeping my car clean and convenient . the problem is trying to cancel the automatic debit has been a nightmare . the regional manager jeremy and michael have been passing the buck between the two for over three weeks now and my concern is that i 'm going to be charged again for a new month . the services at the location are good , but good luck if you need to get an issue resolved ! !	2093
0	this was my 1st time and am disappointed . my legs were not waxed neatly and left small scars on my knee and eyebrow while using the tweezer . the one who did was v nice and friendly but wat matters most is how the job 's done . i have posed two pics have a look at that	2300
1	fast and great service . they reached out and were able to complete the job the same day . my front yard looks great . seemed a little pricy at first , but the work was done great !	2759
1	very nice and big place to send your pets for daycare . i have a 7 month old pug who is loving to be out there and roam in the dog park . the staff is well trained . they love to talk about your pet whenever asked . my pug was also on medication in between . they took good care of him . they gave me first hand knowledge of the products before feeding it to my pet . really happy to have my pet safe and secured here while i am on work .	2988
1	thank you to hillary at the parma panda express for saving my birthday ! ! ! my fiance was on his way and got stuck in traffic and knowing the store was about to close i called ahead . hillary went out of her way to made sure we got our order and was sooooo sweet ! ! ! i know the last thing she wanted to do was stay late , but she did for us ! ! amazing customer service ! ! ! ! thank you so much ! ! ! ! !	1075
0	dr webber is the worst ... . like everyone says she is cold and does n't explain herself well and can make you feel like a horrible parent . we love dr.mendoza ! wonderful and compassionate i just wish dr webber could learn from him : / only saw her because we had to ... never again i will take my son elsewhere if it comes down to it . please dr webber learn bedside manner !	2223
1	great office . i 've never had any issues . i got a surgery done with dr. torres and he was very nice and knowledgeable . he can be cold at times but i do n't mind that . front office ladies are usually nice and wait times are n't bad !	3059
0	lost 2 of 3 pairs of jean 's . guy was very rude , will never do business again ! guy who helped me just shrugged his shoulder , as if he didnt care , rude , no compassion	3055
1	i 'm very happy that i went and saw `` i am legend '' at this theater and that it was an imax movie . the seats reclined and were totally comfortable . the arm rests moved , so there was more room . i did n't check out the concession stand . i was full from dinner and snuck my drink in . i 'd go back !	491
1	went to this location for the first time . i had nicole , who was wonderful . she really listened to my requests for pressure and where my problem areas were . an hour and a half later and i was ready to melt into the floor . tipped her extra for being so good !	1950
1	was on vacation in vegas for 7 days . needed a break from the strip , and found this nice place off the strip for a night out . actually went to this place twice while away . both times had drag queens on the stage . tuesday was drag bingo , that was fun and drinks were 2 for 1 which made it even better . good atmosphere , nice people , bartender was friendly and accommodating . would definitely come back when back in vegas .	3661
0	i am a huge fan of the food fight restaurant group , but was n't a fan of monty 's blue plate diner . the host was friendly and despite being busy , they sat us quickly . the waiter was nice , but not attentive - our drinks sat empty most of our visit . i ordered chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes . both of which were really dry . the overall cleanliness of the store is also something that needs some attention ...	975
0	who ever wrote these reviews were fakes . this was the roughest message ever . nothing soothing about this at all ! ! i am in severe pain today .	735
0	went for winterliscious dinner ; seen lee numerous times on various cooking shows/competitions , so you would think the food would be outstanding . overall , was not impressed , especially considering the price point . food is decent enough , but nothing special . not much different than what you would find in a restaurant in china town , for probably a quarter of the price . would not go back	1441
0	i was excited to try this new ice cream shop since it 's walking distance from my house . they mix cereals into their ice cream . i was n't too interested in trying that but did have cookies and cream mixed in with a little chocolate syrup as a topping . the ice cream is sickening sweet - i could n't finish it . worst ice cream i 've ever eaten . they are expensive also . they were n't busy on a friday night - now i know why .	3051
1	wine and pastries and coffee and more galore ! this little grocery has everything you need for a good picnic . they have refrigerated cases filled with wine , champagne and beer along with non-alcoholic beverages . behind the counter lies freshly made croissants , macaroons and other delicious sweet treats . they also serve up some delicious sandwiches on baguettes or croissant , along with a fresh roasted coffee that packs a punch . with several tables for seating , this is a good place to either grab a quick bite on the go or stay and hang for awhile .	1160
0	used to come here faithfully when i lived here and could n't wait to return while visiting ... . all to drive 41 minutes and they be closed for the holiday weekend . # sodisappointed	762
1	my offspring is quite active , and i have some back issues which sometimes makes it difficult keeping up with him . this place is a wonderful change of scenery for him to let out his absurd excess of energy . it 's always clean , while the staff remain friendly , kind , and enthusiastic . most notably sam , whose exceptional demeanor spurred me to write this review ... an activity i rarely engage in .	1664
0	not the best costumer service to say the least . the person at the register did n't have much knowledge about ethernet splitters and was n't able to leave the register ( even though no one was in line to check out ) to help me find what i 'm looking for .	1782
1	we have been here a couple of times for resent bouts of breast cancer . the staff here has treated my wife very well . after each mri the doctors have sat there and showed us what he sees and explains based on his experience and knowledge what is going on .	3093
0	this specific location is absolutely terrible . worst customer service , very slow and unorganized .	1770
0	keep on driving by ... ... ... i do n't understand the high reviews . i 've been here twice just to check myself . both coffee and espresso have no taste . to boot , wireless does not work well . i had to use a neighboring business . move on to the next place ... ... .	1140
1	such a cute little coffee shop . try a snow dragon ; yummiest hot beverage of my life ! summertime i find myself going to starbucks for refreshing beverages , but fall and winter higher ground is where it 's at !	2163
0	overpriced crooks ; being charged for unauthorized work .	877
1	very friendly and down to earth . love the lemon , chickpea and quinoa salad . love the blueberry caprese salad with pom vinaigrette . i sampled several juices , they were all very good . reasonable prices . i appreciate the rewards program and bottle return credit . parking lot sucks , i just postmates it .	3897
1	minus one star for the poor quality plastic bag , which you have to pay for them . compare with longo 's high quality free plastic bag , which is more convenient and is easy to reuse . you just can not reuse sobeys bags , so fragile . but the store got almost all things i needed . so four stars .	2429
1	excellent food and service ! our waiter abel was able to recommend dishes they fit our tastes . great recommendations on beer . new biryani dishes that are very tasty !	600
1	dr. bracken is an amazing vet . his love for animals is very apparent and he has a wealth of knowledge . i highly recommend going here .	2009
0	they need to give up cooking and stick to beer . i ordered crab cakes and the meal was greasy . also they need irish music not a dj giving away junk . and can you ban little kids after 7 pm ?	454
1	i love this place . i keep coming back . steaks are fabulous and their ribs truly do fall off the bone . they are really good . i especially love their rolls..	1491
0	all of the delicious entrees i had tried are now taken off the menu . very disappointing . i doubt i 'll be coming back anytime soon .	781
0	had the fish and chips . was n't worth $ 15 . beer was n't that cold . would i go there again ? maybe . just thinking the prices do n't match up to the quality , nor quantity of the food . usually one or the other justifies the higher price , unless it 's the location , which would n't be the case here . granted i was aware of the price of what i ordered , and sometimes it 's worth paying more for getting more . not so much this time . perhaps my expectations were too high .	211
0	this place is medicore at best . garbage food , garbage service and exspensive beer . you are better off getting a frozen pizza and a six pack of pbr , at least you will be satisfied at the end .	1253
0	meh . just ok for me . i received a gel mani that took well over an hour . my nail tech cut my cuticle so bad it started to bleed then proceeded to giggle in between saying sorry . with that being said , i did get in right away and also , they have a great selection of polishes .	3603
1	we had been looking for a new dining room table for a couple of weeks , we were disappointed in the selections that other furniture stores around henderson and vegas had to offer . we were about to give up when we found rc willey . their selection is fantastic and they have an amazing show room ! there are plenty of sales reps on the floor to answer all questions . we found the perfect table and will be getting it delivered soon . they also offer a 20 % discount if you pick up your merchandise instead of having it delivered . overall a great experience , we were in and out in 20 min . i definitely recommend this place .	439
0	i decided to buy some groceries during my lunch break , i was never greeted . i walked to the fridge isle trying to grab some items in the very back and the employee doesnt offer to help . another employee gets in front of my cart as i 'm trying to walk back doesnt say anything just stares at me . then the cashier did n't look at me , smile or greet me , bitch did n't even say `` thank you , have a great day . '' very disappointing , it is not my fault you have a shitty job . why not find a job that does n't involve customer service ever think of that .	3066
1	third dinner at aqua e vino last night and it was amazing , as always . it is my favorite restaurant in charlotte ! the chef came out and talked with us and we decide to let him pick our menu , which was out of this world delicious . the chicken with greens on top is my favorite , but the fresh pasta ca n't be beat . the service is second to none . it is fantastic night out with friends or date night . go !	546
0	worst pizza ever ... . soggy and people working there have no personality . excited to have pizza but not when the toppings dall off and its soggy	282
1	we had this delivered tonight for a party , various pizza and boneless hot wings . spectacular . if you do n't know new york pizza you may not appreciate it , it 's not `` soggy '' , but has that delicious glow of oil from the pepperoni . delivery was spot on time too . we are fans !	1399
0	while i still think the 7th floor at the bay ( eaton centre ) is the nuts , the same ca n't be said for the main floor ( jewellery , cosmetics , hosiery ) . i defy you to find an employee to cash you out . everyone on the main floor suffers from `` it 's not my job '' -itis and will go out of their way to ignore you . earlier tonight one of the `` sales '' people shushed me when i asked her if she could help me , because she was on the phone with her s.o . eff you very much ?	2979
0	not a fan . we stayed here for one night . we arrived to be told the computer system was down . it took 30 minutes to check in with no one else in front of us . we booked a king but the room they gave us had two queens . very dated decor . cold rooms with no carpeting just faux wood floors and a very cold antiseptic feeling bathroom . bathtub had foreign stain on the tub floor and did not drain well . for a cost of almost $ 200 a night , i would never stay here again .	1680
1	the alley have an old but have genuine feel to it . it was clean and the staff was extremely polite . my company of five appreciated the comfort and had a really good time . with five players for three games it only costed 51 with change . really recommend this place just to take the edge away from the strip .	451
0	wings are usually good , service is okay . had hair in our food and only took one dollar off of bill . was wondering why this place was so empty from the outside , went inside and the clientele was abysmal . on a tuesday afternoon there were a few guys sitting at the bar being loud and obnoxious , playing awful metal music with offensive lyrics . we ran out of this place as fast as we could ... stay away	2733
1	this is my new go to spot for beer . they have soo many different types and not just your standard bid 3 . they have a great choice of packaged beer craft selection is awesome ! many different ipa 's and lagers . who ever does there purchasing gets and a++ . the staff is always friendly . the store is clean and well organized and they have just added a post office that is able to accept packages 24 hours a day . yeah that 's right 24 hours .	507
0	the pharmacy is the worst . my prescription is never ready when they say it will be . terrible service ! never going back ! !	2316
1	first of all , i would like to suggest the name liquid nitrogen dreams if there is ever a rebranding . with that said , i really enjoyed this ice cream ! i got the strawberry cheese flavor , which did use real cream cheese in the base mix . it was topped with some strawberry sauce ( which was just ok -- very fake strawberry tasting ) . like others have said , it 's a bit pricey for 2 scoops , but you 're definitely paying for the novelty factor . i 'd go again , but not too often . p.s . to instagrammers : they have a floral wall inside !	3900
0	shady thieves that treat you like you are bothering them when you bring something in for repair . they try to upsell you into buying things you do not need and lie to you about what is wrong with your phone . their goal is to pull as much cash out of your wallet as they can . if you go there , be prepared to get ripped off .	2342
0	came by for a martini after work could not get a club soda . they do n't sell it by the glass . this is my 3 time here . strike 3 .	1331
1	friendly people ... great place to grocery shop ! ! !	2785
1	hours on yelp & website has been updated . after a year of banking at this location i found the tellers to be very accommodating and courteous .	1533
0	i used to love this place and i had a bad experience once but gave it another shot today and ordered the `` fantastic roll '' lunch special - and all it had was crab stick , avocado and some kind of minced crab ? on top - this was not how it was advertised - was supposed to have more fish . and just a ton of rice again like the last time - it used to be so reliably good -not sure what happened . not sure i can go back anymore which is a shame since the people there are all nice , service is good and they are quick and it is very convenient .	24
0	i went inside for my first time ever because my friend introduce it to me and omg this place has so much fabrics and it 's amazing . being a new person to the store you end up walking around a lot to check things out . one cashier ask me if i was gon na buy something , i said not really cause i did n't plan on buying anything . so they kicked me out . which makes no sense i have the right to look around because i was honestly interested in most of the fabrics . how disrespectful !	3943
1	excellent care , very quick in and out . i do n't understand the negative ratings . the was the best urgent care experience i have ever had !	2517
1	i just realized after using yelp to find everything after moving here that i have n't reviewed anyone to help the next person . i 'm here to said i love heather grider at euphoria . i came to her with severely damaged hair and she within months got it to beautiful . i 'm moving and my heart breaks because she is the best , the best ! ! highly recommend her to everyone ( my husband loves her too ) ! ! !	2113
0	they do n't respect your time at all .. that all i can say for now and especially dr. williams vaughn very poor time management . no customer service and humanity at all . save you time and money and find someone more helpful and care . ..	609
1	i love the bulk stuff , and the fresh sandwiches . 2.50 good deal	1686
1	so relaxing ! with a great staff and an awesome variety of tanning and relaxation stations leaves you feeling great . i highly recommend the hydration station and the red light therapy ! i 'm excited to add this stress relief into my weekly routine	2672
1	this is a very large and relateively new canadian tire ; one of the better ones in the city . it 's upstairs and has it 's own cart escalator . eventhough we showed up 20 mins to closing time , the paint counter was kind enough to mix some paint for us . it 's conveniently located in the portlands just off the gardiner and the plaza also has a td , boston pizza and other useful shops .	2520
0	$ 21 to print and 30 min to print 7 page buisness report , no good . they do not know how to format broshure printing . better do it on your own .	2279
1	excelent place ! the staff is very friendly the food delicious , the best chilaquiles ! i 'm mexican and i can tell this really tastes like méxico	332
0	management needs to work on their employee-customer ratio when staffing . i have never been in and out of this store and unfortunately this is the only grocery store conveniently located in my area other than bashas ... ) . please open more than two or three checkout lines during the evening rush !	2316
0	christ why didnt i look at yelp before purchasing flowers from this god awful nightmare ... they couldnt organise a piss up in a guinness factory ...	1652
1	wow , delicious desserts here ! i stopped by today to take some cakes and gelato home with me , and everything was so good ! these desserts are sweeter than most other japanese desserts i 've tried , and i do n't mind that at all ! the strawberry shortie cheesecake was unique - light but very creamy ! then we had the matcha and chocolate gelato , and both flavours were rich and the texture and hardness was spot on ! we have n't tried our tiramisu millie cake yet , but can not wait ! ! we will definitely be back there ! the person helping me was also very nice and professional ! thumbs up , millie ! ! !	3180
1	the store recently got upgraded which is nice . they have good selection , nothing to exotic but more then their local competitor . at first i was against self checkout but now i like it . regular lines are usually slow , i do n't like to chit chat and no one sees what i 'm buying and i can be in and out in no time . they also have a chase bank in their which i 've used on a few instances . all in all not bad . i wish they would carry more organic stuff .	3935
1	i wish i lived here , because i would come for the bruschetta at least once a week ! their wine list was very eclectic and jason the bartender was beyond knowledgable . so glad we stumbled upon this gem , ca n't wait to come back some day ! !	49
1	they are great here ! not only do you get a really filling meal here for a good price , the space is roomy but not huge and the people are great ! my boyfriend and i tried for our first time and had to go back the next day and they remembered us and were really nice . those fried pickles though ! drool ! we both tried a few dogs and i have n't decided on what 's my favorite but i was disappointed in the angry kimchi fries . their dipping sauces are addictive though ! overall , awesome dogs !	1566
1	i am a frequent customer and very appreciative of the service i receive particularly from jonathon . it is a busy place but i have better service there vs other tempe car washed . thanks jonathon !	127
0	service was professional and the check up on my jeep was fast . i was told i needed a hose replaced , water pump replaced , and possibly the thermostat replaced . these parts alone would n't cost more than $ 100 with maybe 2 hours of work ... i was quoted $ 600 for the job to be done ... . make sure to get a second opinion before you accept the work to be done here ! update : ended up taking it to another mechanic and found out the water pump was not even the problem ... ended up costing me $ 150 to fix vs $ 600	856
0	one was too much messed up order before us and didnt do mine right lady making coffee ignored me when i asked if she could fix never never use this kiosk theres one down by d6 that redid it for me so thank you to those ladies at d6 !	1265
0	called yesterday to make an appointment at 3pm . arrived at 255 pm and asked about price for lyft driver special . gabe manager told me i do n't qualify for lyft special . when i told him i do he corrected himself then goes on to say my car wo n't be worked on for another hour and a half . is n't that why i made an appointment ? i think he was upset i corrected him on my price for service . this is not the first time i had a horrible experience with pep boys . stay away from here . i will also let lyft las vegas know how great your service is . ( horrendous )	1778
1	on a recent trip to montreal for a bachelorette party we came to bird bar on a friday night with 14 people . this was on of the highlights of the trip ! the staff were incredible , jonathan our server was a total professional and made the night ! not only did jonathan kill it while serving 14 people but he made it a great time . the live dj was a really fun touch as well and played great music . the food was amazing ! we tried a little bit of everything and i can honestly say there was not a bad dish in the bunch ! this will be a go to spot on my next trip to montreal !	1043
0	i really have no comment . i have hired brad two times now .	795
0	if i could give it zero stars i would . horrible customer service . they bend over backwards to charge you excessively . the gym is always densely packed so you can forget getting a workout in ... also disgustingly dirty ! stay far away !	342
0	factoring in what i originally stated about the tea that expired a year ago , all the teas i bought also tasted old ! : ( i am thinking they do n't have good turnover . the golden moon tea does n't taste like anything i bought from golden moon . i am thinking some of those teas have been on the shelf a long time . if you are in a pinch for some teas , this place will do . but if you love quality and freshness , avoid ! also , you are n't suppose to keep tea in clear containers , tea is light sensitive . the teas i bought from the jar taste stale and bad .	1462
1	traveled from ca to id . this was a good hotel in our travels . the water pressure in their showers is great ! it was clean and quiet and safe . we stayed at this hotel with dogs . it was a good choice . the area for the dogs is in the back right corner of the property . i would stay here again .	2872
0	undercooked burgers , poor service , and overall bland food would prevent me from ever considering this restaurant as an option .	1269
1	can not believe your closed on sunday ! drove all the way from east mesa ! grrrrrrr ... . does not say that anywhere on your on-line menu i printed . i 'm giving you this rating based on your pictures on here and average . i was looking so forward to trying you for the first time ! i have a large event in january that needs a venue . i wanted to test your place out to see if i should bring 55 people back . ok , well i 'll try another time . you really should add your hours of operation to your menu . thank you	1482
1	i 've been going to edgeworxx for just over a year now and feel lucky to have found it . i was booked in with karen when i called for an appointment ( more like a leap of faith after having the worst experience at another place ) and she was amazing ! she does n't do anything you do n't want . will make suggestions based on what you want and she is n't scissor happy . definitely recommend edgeworxx ! or at least i recommend karen at edgeworxx !	2
0	worst customer service experience i have ever had . salesman standing around and when asked for help said they were busy with other customers . watched them for over 10 minutes and the same two stood in same place and guess what ? they were still not helping anyone . they lost a $ 5,600 sale , we walked out . i will take my business elsewhere .	439
1	i 've had the pleasure of working with roadrunner pharmacy since early 2015 . my hedgehog , petunia , was diagnosed with low-functioning thyroid and needed medication . the customer service is wonderful . they are so kind and helpful . my baby girl gets her medication , i get to keep her healthy , and they even include a dog toy ! i give that to a friend , so two pets and two pet parents are happy . thank you for all that you do . i would highly recommend roadrunner pharmacy .	2827
0	made an appointment to redo our kitchen for today at 3:30 pm . left work early and they did n't even bother to show up . when i called after waiting a half an hour someone there realized who i was and said oh i 'll be there in 20 minutes . so now they wanted me to wait 1 hour . a courtesy call would have been nice . glad this happened now . i called only imagine if i went with them , they probably would n't even bother to bring the right cabinets on time and thought nothing of it . terrible .	639
0	the worst place ever ! ! ! ! ! total rip off ! do not have a birthday party there . people are even coming in off the streets asking parents for money . the employees are doing nothing about it . way understaffed ! the pizza was so gross , even the kids did n't want to eat it ! what kid wo n't eat pizza ! no stars ! so not worth 15.99per kid ! ! ! i am writing a letter to the jambo management !	3791
0	so let me get this straight - i buy a membership online , meaning you will take my money , but to be able to play i need a paper card . welcome back to the 90 's top golf !	1483
0	a h*** no will i ever go there again we had an appointment both me and my husband walked in there was no one to wait on us and then they get 1 and only 1 ' spa already for our pedicure and totally forgot about my husband and then the water was ice cold and no 1 was even paying attention to us and when i asked the lady what her name was she said the happiest woman on earth she do n't look very happy hill no never ever going there again ! ! ! ! ! !	3509
0	this is the hipster heaven in queen west . my friend and i came here hoping to get some food after an evening of chilling at his place near by . we shared the ribs . they where not bad but not great , a lot of the connective tissue was still intact and they where difficult to break apart . the selection of drinks was not bad . the service was reasonable . i would not come here unless craving intense hipster contact .	688
0	i stopped in yesterday morning for a fruit cup . the cashier was slow , not friendly and not helpful . oh did i say slow ? he seemingly was lacking in wanting a customer . i was on my way to the light rail and he was taking his time ( he is at work i guess ) and seemingly was hesitant and wanted to say something to me when i asked if i could get the other cup -- - it had more grapes . not impressed ! his customer service was awful ! it is such a cute eatery ... i will not go back if i can help it . this should have been a quick and simple transaction .	799
0	worst customer services . bought 2 bottles of wine but the cork pushes up a little . went back to return and they said that due to state regulations they ca n't take it back . i got stuck with a piece a shit product . lesson learned , never buy from sams club . go to cosco 's instead . they have better customer service . sams club u failed ! ! ! ! !	2469
1	this was my first time ever in the side of a hobby lobby . i had to pick up a few things and thought this place might have them . it did . very large store they have everything here . the store was clean and the staff was friendly . i 'll definitely keep this place in mind for next time i need something they might carry .	204
1	helpful nice people but ungodly lines . strongly recommend getting the plus card and going early morning if you plan to use this sams .	2469
1	in las vegas hot weather can be a serious problem for people at home with kids , elderly or pets . it 's great to know that there 's a company that can come out and address your air conditioning problems quickly and efficiently like mojave air conditioning . i called other company 's and nobody was as helpful . mojave ac came to my home in less than 24 hours and by the time they left my house the unit was fixed and the temperature inside the house had improved . if you need help with you ac units call mojave ac first .	2031
1	this place rocks ! ! i came in for just a wash and was told by the manager dane that my car needed to be buffed and waxed in order to remove the white spots from my hood , after they finished the job my car looked as good as new ! $ 120.00 and i could not be happier ! great service ! i will definitely be back !	3250
1	little known fact by people who pass by the restaurant in the morning : fusaro 's serves breakfast ! i 've been here for lunch once or twice , but love coming back for their breakfast even more . they have a few basic classics , like bacon and eggs , usually served with home fries and fresh fruit , but also have some more out-of-the-ordinary stuff : spicy sausage covered in bread , tomato sauce and melted cheese . their breakfast menu is limited to 5 or 6 items , but they 're all solid , and eating on the patio at 9:00am is unbeatable . service is a bit iffy at times , but amazing , highly recommended place otherwise .	728
0	i observed this truck dump a load of landscaping debris in the middle of the road in my neighborhood . i contacted the number on the side of the truck and spoke with the owner about what i observed . then i texted the owner and sent him pictures of the truck , what they dumped , and the employee in the passenger seat . i told the owner that i was reporting this action to the police & illegal dumping hotline . this is when the owner became irate with me , using racial slurs . beware who you do business with !	2387
0	great service but you will get more for your money at pho hoa . out of all the vietnamese places we 've been to , this had the least amount of food , ( meat wise ) for wayyy higher price . the manager made up for it by taking it off the check but we were spending almost $ 200 anyway , so it did n't really matter . i usually do n't complain unless it is really ridiculous and as you can see in our other post , we know what a real combination plate looks like . this place is only good for vegetarians and do n't come for dinner because you are paying a higher price for lunch portions .	947
1	the development is about 16 acres and hidden right behind the strip by the link . guard gated with two pools two spas tennis fitness club club house racket ball i just put a deal through financing which is a game changer . they are four story with elevators .	3718
0	after the 3rd time , they had to reschedule my kids appointment , i returned the phone call and the lady put me on hold after 5 minutes , i hung up .	1304
0	this was my first time eating at tijuana flats and it will probably be my last . i asked for a burrito bowl and the waiter said they do not have that , but they have nurrito bowls . that 's fine , i get building your brand , but maybe without an attitude . i got my order to go . i asked for no beans since i 'm allergic and i still got beans . i gave my food to my roommate when i got home.. at least she approved !	1137
0	we ordered masala dosa and vegetable thali both were not good . 1.dosa was not crispy and potato curry inside dosa was too dry . coconut chutney was not fresh and not tasty at all and sambar was ok. 2.vegetable thali - naan was not fresh and chole dint taste like indian curry , dal was bad .	640
0	one star for the band . tiny place . tiny dance floor . worst thing is the crowd is the ancient of days .	3668
1	finally found my go to nail spot when i 'm visiting my family in north las vegas ! the owner was awesome - she saw that i was frustrated with my last nail job and i was ready to have them taken off but she coaxed me into one more fill - so glad she was n't pushy about it . i also went for a pedicure which was also excellent . the shop is really nicely decorated and super clean .	2929
1	disappointed at the tiny automotive section here , but appreciate that the checkout lines are typically reasonable and cashiers usually friendly .	2411
0	i asked for my kids records because after getting a second opinion , the things they had previously done didnt make sense . instead of providing me with complete records , the dentist instead emailed stating his attorney would be contacting mine ! ! ! sounds like he has something to hide .	3766
1	i 've been ordering from this place for the past couple of month now . their pizza is pretty tasty , but what always keeps me coming back is their burgers and fries . very juicy burger , with a good size helping of some tasty fries . also , the delivery person that they usually send is a very nice guy , very polite , too . the only downside i have come across is their wings . they do not add any sauces or seasonings , which is n't that big of a deal to me , but might be to other customers . love this place !	987
0	wow not impressed wit the mens clothing prices . there a whole bunch of higher end store with this price range . the store crew was amazing and helpful ! really nice people .	3650
1	taylor lyda is the best ! she was so professional , quick and efficient with my full set . very talented , and a beautiful person inside and out ! she kept me comfortable and entertained the whole time so the appointment flew by ! she chose the perfect length and fullness to achieve the desired look . a seasoned pro in her craft . very affordable rate , especially given the superior quality of the lashes and service . this satisfied customer ca n't wait to return ! - lacey f .	3716
1	today we stopped by to get some touch up paint . the problem was we did not know the type of paint we needed . we brought in a small sample and they were able to match it up perfectly . they were super friendly and helpful ! now it 's painting time !	23
1	we just finished dinner and we are now 3 for 3 with this place . the pizzas we ordered were great . pep and mushroom and hawaiian . we also got the garlic knotts and these are worth going here just for the them . this place is a great little joint that is doing it right and we will be back .	1399
1	the staff , & management were great , especially janie ! she was so helpful , friendly & was wonderful ! i would highly recommend this location !	3232
1	wow - arcane bolts and nuts , pulleys , and piano hinges that would make a lowes cringe - yeah we got those . man store is correct , this place has whatever you can think over crammed in ceiling to floor aisle after aisle . little bit confusing on pricing - not marked on a lot of items . while quite a distance drive for me , i make it a point to swing by here often ( plus the breakfast/lunch restaurant next door is good ) .	3086
1	great customer service really care about getting your car fixed the right way i 've been there twice and both times i had a great person that cared jeremy and jon both awesome guys i will be returning i have the same place close to home but traveled from henderson to this location because of the customer service was great	2981
0	incredibly lame . not even worth the groupon cost . their `` wall of candy '' is a joke too . save your moola and go some where else .	3060
0	i just spoke with a co-worker who had a similar experience . his truck broke down , he got charged for not putting gas in it . what a ridiculous scam .	1877
1	great trade in values for a car i was looking to get rid of . this is the quick and painless route	2610
0	usually other cobblestone locations are pretty solid , but this one consistently sucks . they are lazy and never wipe down the seats and i always have to ask them to do more , which isnt the case at other locations . also , letting people smoke in the waiting area outside is bad business practice . i hate second hand smoke . it 's so selfish and any business that allows this sucks . not coming back .	127
1	i do not live close to the store by any means . i am only a few blocks from albertson 's but i would never go there , not for only one item needed in desperation . smiths on the other hand is worth the trip . a friendly clean store that is easy to navigate . they always have what i need and their prices are very reasonable .	1223
0	the guy sitting in the first tattoo station , treated us like shit ! i have never been to any business that was so unprofessional . my husband and i walked in , and my husband asked if he could use the bathroom while i picked out a tattoo . the tattoo artist told him , he could not use the bathroom until he received cash from us . i was in disbelief , so we told him we would go somewhere else and get a tattoo . and he said , go ahead they wo n't let you use there bathroom either .	3464
1	i spent hours picking my furniture , the staff was always friendly and willing offer as much detail about each product as i wanted and with seamless knowledge . they moved things around so i could see them together or in different light . monica helped me choose the right fabric for my chair and find the perfect match sofa . i could n't be more pleased with the experience or service ( and i 'm picky ) a special shout out to monica and thomas you go above and beyond and for that i have a new living room and then some . thank you thank you from me , mom and the dogs now hoping to get my buffet there too .	2071
0	horrible wait times . i was being seen at this office for my pregnancy only made it three apts before i decided to never go back never once saw my doctor always someone else .	3059
0	they want u here 30 min early for an appt.. then u wait an hour and a half because they are behind and thats ok without anyone telling u until u ask horrible service	3941
1	the technician showed up sooner than expected , was knowledgeable and helpful . he also was proud of his experience with troubled drains , and `` never saw a drain he could n't fix '' . i was a happy camper to deal with someone who 's friendly and knowledgeable	2748
0	this place is far away from professionalism . my appointment got cancelled twice due to the error of their staff , which reflects they manage customer information pretty poorly . i could n't imagine they can do any better job with your teeth .	2576
1	we are book shoppers - so surprisingly this is a good place to go . we found 15 books today many of which were on our hunt list . join their membership program and thursday is discount day !	3679
1	we stayed at the springhills over the weekend . overall the rooms were nice and pool is a rooftop pool which was really cool . you are like few blocks away from the worlds largest sportbook . every employee i ran into was very nice and represented the hotel , city and marriott very nicely . if you do n't want to stay on the strip i would recommend staying here . room tip : good view of the strip if you room is like odd number.. ect 1821	3253
0	i very rarely have a negative experience at starbucks . this review is solely based on the staff present on the particular day i met my friend here . the drink was good , pretty standard . however the staff running the place were all under ten or so it seemed : loud noises constantly coming from behind the bar , loud conversations and laughter . i really do n't mind the staff talking and laughing . it 's a good thing since it means they get along but i could really do without thd loud banging noises on a relaxing sunday morning when i 'm trying to enjoy a conversation with my friend .	906
0	someone from their customer service department ( alice w ) . said they would personally send me a message through yelp to discuss the problem and she never did ...	2235
1	coulter nissan far exceeded my expectations . they are very good people . i recommend them highly .	394
1	very good service and friendly people ! unit is also close to everything in that area !	2065
0	food was good ... waitress sucked ... '' ellery '' was ours ... to be honest the entire waitress staff was awful . the guy in front of me while paying had a completely different waitress and refused to leave a tip . and the customer behind me was complaining as well about the horrible service . crazy thing is it was not even busy in the slightest and half a dozen waitresses standing around doing nothing . for me it does n't matter how good the food is if the overall experience sucks .	346
0	if i can give it a negative i would . took the time to drive here today to order a birthday cake for our daughters birthday and we were told that we need to email them ? ? ? ? ? hello ? ? ? ? ? the fact that we took the time to drive to your place to place an order would have been a solid sell . but you chose to refer us to send you an email ? bad business . you just lost a client .	981
1	we loved the three bedroom penthouse suite . the whole staff there was extremely helpful , pleasant , and always smiling ! the shuttle bus drivers were lots of fun and all said they loved their jobs . nice sing alongs and great music on the bus to the strip . great pools , spas , and gift shops . if we needed anything , they brought it up to us ! highly recommend .	1057
0	our room smelled like cigarette smoke . we asked for a different room , and got one , but it also smelled like cigarette smoke . i was really looking forward to a comfortable night after 10 hours of extremely stressful driving , but that was not to be . to be clear , this is supposedly a 100 % no smoking hotel . also , as another reviewer noted , the lobby and hallways were just as hot as it was outside . it was gross .	3480
0	the restaurant is quaint . however , the pizza was extremely salty . an ordinary cheese 16 inch and could barely taste the tomato sauce .	768
1	easy to book an appointment on short notice , and my two dogs look great when finished . very helpful , friendly staff .	2108
0	not a good selection . only bobby boss hair . the employees follow you around the whole store . so disturbing	1659
1	it is a pretty standard starbucks and happens to be in the downstairs area of my building so it is always a reliable caffeine fix . they always get my order right and despite the high volume , never keep you waiting long .	438
1	what is great in life ? being with friends , close in at the table , great conversation , wine and food . without a doubt , our night at parallax was one of the best dining experiences i have had in my life . the service was perfect- not too much , not too little - just right . our apps were great but the star of the show besides the company ; ) was the skate wing . i have never had a better meal in my life . when in cleveland you must go to parallax . it 's all great .	487
0	just awful . i ordered a dirty martni because their logo has a martini glass on it . i figured that 's what they specialize in . i asked for it to be chilled with 2 olives . well my order must have been too complicated because they served it in a beer glass . nice and warm . no olives . i chalked it up to maybe a miscommunication . some how ... so instead of seeing the signs and leaving i ordered some food . do not get their lump crab mac and cheese . they are really just serving tuna . i do not recommend this place for food or drinks .	839
1	it 's quite lovely in here ! definitely clean and good service . my manicure was alright ( polishing was n't fantastic ) but pedi was amazing ! will definitely be coming back .	43
0	i would not pay to hang out at this spa again ... its old & outdated . we got our nails polished and the nail polish job was inconsistent , while i got a great nail polish job , my girlfriend experienced something awful . there is a yoga studio in the spa and while the yoga class was *nice* , it was nothing extraordinary . oh , and the private spa pool was dirty and unkempt ...	2225
1	the location looks really nice and fancy inside.. it looks like they renovated recently . the service is good . prices are decent . they have a large selection of food and desserts however the food has just never tasted amazing for me , just satisfactory lol .	534
1	i do n't think there are words to explain the amazingness that are the cupcakes . by one , wait for it to warm up a bit then eat it slowly , savoring every bite . my mom was a professional cake decorator for 45 years and so i 've tasted many , many amazing things over the years and these are seriously up there . wow .	1125
0	food is tasty and service is good .. men 's restroom is very dirty .. very very .. makes you wonder about their general hygiene in their kitchen .. makes you think twice or 3 before you touch those raw vegetables they serve with your soup .. i 'm thinking of swallowing some of that sanitizing alcohol gel that i always carry with me .. menues are very sticky .. it 's the fourth time i come here within the last year .. hygiene situation has worsened .. it 's sad to see a seemingly healthy operation do so bad in cleanliness and hygiene as though they could n't care less .. too bad .. i shall not return ..	707
1	i love this place . healthy food fast . the staff is always very friendly . clean comfortable patio seating if it 's not too busy . i love the salmon linguini , the chopped salad or caesar salad and the pasta primavera	1387
1	dane and his crew are amazing . they showed up on time with a crew of 6 and three trucks . the made a masterpiece out of a huge neglected mess . we have a few very large pines , olives , palms and even a pomegranate tree . the best part was them not only quoting me 900 less than another company . they came in under budget . i would recommend them to anyone .	2387
0	yep , it 's just a waffle house . this one is a bit below average in cleanliness and service . an average waffle house would get three stars ; this one gets just two .	241
1	excellent customer service ! ! ! on taking the shuttle to the airport i realized i had left my car open . i called crowne plaza and az said she will have a transport driver check and asked me to call back in 20 minutes as brandon had just stepped away . on calling back she confirmed that it was open and brandon had locked it . thank you , thank you thank you for going above and beyond . crowne plaza your employees are amazing !	1786
1	i have been coming here since about 2006 , always wonderful .. i had a mani/pedi today with leah.. she 's ahhhhmazinng !	786
1	great staff and nice office . i do n't have insurance so paying cash for ct scans , mammograms & ultrasounds gets expensive . the nice lady , your cash price for the ct scan of your kidneys today is $ 256 but we can price match that w/another lab & it 's only $ 170 . so nice ! & i need a diagnostic mammogram next week , it 's $ 199 regularly & they 'll do it for $ 95 ! that 's a lot of savings & i 'm extremely grateful ! i highly recommend them !	188
0	i ordered full extension drawers for my kitchen cabinets and they came in incorrect ( their mistake ) , and my choices were to delay the project for 3 weeks and pay full agreed upon price or take the cabinets as is and they 'll knock off 650 $ which is mostly like the upcharge i already paid for to have full extension drawers . when i called , would n't put me through to a manager . told them i was n't happy with my choices and they did n't care . dont buy here ! ! ! not worth the hassle .	1085
1	i really like it here . plenty of toppings to choose from . they have pumpkin right now and its delicious . i like all the flavors . i used my yelp coupon here and he accepted it , no questions asked . everyone has been friendly to me and i 've been here several times now . i recommend !	885
0	allowed me as a walk-in with no problem but then treated me as if i was a hassle for them . then i accidentally stubbed my thumb on the fan blower and messed up the paint , he then had to re-do it but before he did he let out a hard sigh then gave me a stink look and proceeded to fix it . i just came to this location because it was convenient because i was getting my car serviced right next door . at least something was done good ( my car ) . i wo n't be returning .	2364
0	do not place an online order from this location ever . one of two things is guaranteed to happen if you do . they will either tell you that the order did n't come thru even though i received a confirmation email telling me the location and time it will be ready which has happened to me twice at this location or they will forget part of your order so you better double check before you leave .	867
0	if you get the tall , blonde waitress run for the hills ! thankfully the other waitress was there doing her job.food was okay but the service at breakfast by this waitress totally unacceptable . we had to get up twice and go to the counter for creamer and also a box.she was an absolute waste !	213
1	this restaurant is always a must when we come to las vegas . we always get the australian lobster tail and it never , never , fails to disappoint ! but tonight was made extra special with peggy serving us . her upbeat and friendly personality and eagerness to ensure everything surpassed our expectations made one of our last dinners here memorable . we 're sad to hear buzio restaurant is closing , but we hope to see peggy and her smiling face in the near future again at the rio . thank you , peggy ! ! !	603
0	customer service two thumbs down ! i bought a 6 pack of beer and a bottle of baileys . she bagged the items and handed them to me . got home no baileys . i live 20 mins away . return to store all i got was oh sorry ! are you kidding me , check your bags before you leave . i will never go back .	3199
1	i and my friend lulu just been there for shellac manicure and classic pedicure . bella did my nails and cindy did lulu's.. they did very good job and the place is clean . the manager named mary did my eyebrow waxing ! will def be back	819
1	once again ! ! an amazing experience . we came to metro with friends visiting from out of town and they loved it !	192
0	expensive and not worth it . crust is super soggy , and flavoring is bland . if you have to eat and have no other options sure , but i wo n't be coming back if i can help it .	282
1	i have been coming to this chick fil a for over a year now . i have always received great service and the food is always hot and fresh ! me and my friend just rolled through the drive through 2 minutes before closing and they made fresh fries and the gentleman who was helping us at the window had the courtesy to lean out the window and have a nice conversation with us while we waited . it 's hard to get decent service anywhere anymore . for a fast food chain this one tops them all .	572
0	we were frequent sammys customers when they were in centennial hills and loved it . we went to sammys on flamingo we ordered the humus w/flat bread , coconut shrimp and the chopped chicken salad . it took forever to get our small salad we kept asking where is the salad coming from the waiter kept telling us it coming . well it 's coming took almost 20 minutes to 1/2 hr , in the mean time we had our shrimp and humus . we wanted everything together but it never happened . do n't think we will be back .	1116
1	they renovated and it 's lovely . my favourite person is glaze . she does such a great job , is very thorough , skilled , and friendly ! i love her . she is my go-to gal ! also , i will never go back to soft wax . a fair price ( $ 50 ) , which is average for a brazilian .	228
0	really slow and terrible service . food was not good . coffee was mediocre ( note that coffee is really hard to fuck up ) . overall the place is dirty and run like an amateur effort at the whole independant hipster vibe . save yourself , do n't go here .	3684
0	so disappointed . with the various other chicken options in the area , i was expecting more from this place . the chicken tenders were dry and rubbery , the gravy tasted like plastic , and the fries were soggy . could n't finish my meal . the only redeeming part of the experience was the sweet roll and the car side customer service . better off going somewhere else .	862
0	store is very cramped - there 's too many displays sitting in the way . people behind the counter were just talking and not really asking if there 's anything they can recommend or help with - not that i needed a recommendation , but all other locations do this . ultimately i got what i was looking for , but this store needs to train it 's employees on customer engagement / customer service / customer retention .	426
1	cheapest beer around the house & a great variety of selection although they were out of my fav pyramid hef : (	2551
1	i come here every sunday morning to grab breakfast and coffee for my family . i never have any issues . staff is always friendly and food is always good ! i always get my food and drinks in a timely manner and the manager is very friendly . i also think their coffee is way better then starbucks too !	3372
1	shout out to psalm and tiffany who did an amazing job on my hair . i do n't do hair , at all . i needed major help since i was going to a ball where photos would be taken . i had originally planned on going to the blow dry bar but they were fully booked along with several other places i called . my hair ended up more unique and cool so i am glad i ended up coming here any way . the girls did an amazing job , yes it was a project and it took awhile but it was well worth the results . thanks girls you rock !	354
0	small donuts ! go to bosa donuts . or , just circle k or qt ... . do n't waste ya time folks	3137
0	avoid like the plague . this place reeks of poor management and lackluster `` mechanic '' performance . made a reservation and sat ( technically still sitting while writing this ) for 45 min before they pulled my car into the garage . there was a period of ten minutes when i could see or hear no activity , i looked in the back and happened to see all of them eating . the gentleman who works the desk said , `` we will get you in as soon as we get one out '' . save your valuable time and money , help out your community and go to a local mechanic . next time i know i will .	2260
1	fun place . we went on a wednesday . i 've never played golf before , however i quickly caught on . the service was prompt and the food was excellent . i just wish it was longer . price is $ 25 before 6pm and $ 45 per hour after . it did get pricey , we 're competitive and had to play two games . we also ordered two appetizers , two flatbread pizzas and a steak quesadilla . a few beers and cocktails for four people . our total was $ 250 . next time we will eat prior to playing so nothing interrupts our playing time .	1483
1	great atmosphere as the sun devils ' fan are very passionate . solid food and drink choices at the concession stands . only thing i do n't like is the bleacher seating . that 's minor though because i have a great time when i come here .	1431
0	this hotel is currently undergoing renovation . dirty rooms.. bath tub gets clogged.. no light . when we reported this to the front desk , they did not seem to be very helpful . horrible hotel ! !	2976
1	man weekends suck when its off day for me and i have to wait for the dispensary to open but it 's okay i 'll be there shortly to see my tenders thanks guys you guys do great job !	3823
0	since i have to put a star , i will , but they do n't even deserve that . their customer service is the worst . not only because of the product they are pushing is worthless , but because of their terrible unhelpful , rude behavior . if they were the last resource for travel , i 'd stay home . do not deal with this company if you want to avoid frustration !	1777
1	lots of great gluten-free options for your liking , all homemade . great service , ca n't ask for anything else . i will be back ! thanks !	278
1	excellent service ! ! ! . we called them the day before for a ride to the airport at 8:30am . our driver , larry , texted us the night before to introduce himself and assured us he would be there at 8:20am . today he texted to let us know he was on his way . got here right on time . we were hesitant to call taxis for rides to the airport because of several major issues from other companies . we will definitely use again ! !	52
0	showed up at 940 for a 945 show . mgr greets me at box office and says , sorry , we are done for the night , you are like the tenth person to come in but , moviefone and flickster are wrong , we close early every night except sat and sun . me : ok , can you give us a couple of passes for a future movie for our trouble ? we planned our whole night around this info . him ; no , sry not our policy . me : ( a litlle aggravated ) its ok , this theatre wont be open in 4 months anyway . you guys are horrible . him ; i could n't care less	2486
0	i went here for an updo . i specifically said i wanted something casual and messy and brought pictures . i also said i did not want to look like i was going to a wedding . i got the exact opposite . and the only product she used was hairspray . i have dark , coarse hair , and if you know anything about non-white hair , you know that product is necessary . no product prior to heat . big no-no . my hair was stiff and crispy after that . thank god for home hot oil treatments .	1617
1	visited twice this week . tried two different chicken dishes . the egg rolls were crisp and good well . both dishes were spiced well , with fresh ingredients . only spent $ 8.00 with a drink on both days from the much menu . considered it a very good value . will go back for sure .	829
1	great place to stop in for a late night-cap and cigar . staff very attentive especially nick ! ask for an update on the history of the building , they will gladly tell you . nice place for good conversation , smoke and cocktail . thank you for bring this to glendale !	1683
0	went here in the attempt to have lunch the other day . i had read good reviews on yelp and was really looking forward to a good meal as we were very hungry . the minute i opened the door i smelled something funny . my husband smelled it too and we looked at each other , turned around and left . it smelled like a toilet had backed up . i will try to go back another day and hope they have the problem resolved .	779
1	neighborhood wal-mart is a staple in my grocery chain that i frequent . this location just off the 215 and stephanie was a convenient stop last night to grab a few quick items before heading home . service was great as it being my first time at this location i needed a little help finding a few products . all the great value and quantity that we 've come to know and love with neighborhood wal-mart .	3656
0	omgeee the server was a bi tch wow talk about rude ... .dam ... .if you are having a bad day please stay home and away from customers ! ! ! ugh serious ly who gave her a job came inside and it was our first time here we werent sure about what we wanted ... .and she looked pissed off and irritated from tge beginning and i asked her dor change and she just put it on the table ... and i noticed the next customer she acted just acted the same	3634
0	be very careful ... read the contract . i thought i was signing up for 6 massages ( 6 months ) . come to find out there is `` autorenew '' spot they make you initial . i had no idea i was being charged until 5 more months had acrued . when i found out to cancel ... they will only allow you 30 days to use all 5 of those massages . the therapists are good but i would never go here again , because of the poor management and policies . i felt like they tricked me with the contract . i found a much better place , for $ 39.00 anytime , no contract next to the sprouts on southern and higley .	3733
1	great cut , friendly service , and for a walk in at $ 30 with a juice box upon arrival - yes , this must be as good as it gets : - ) better than many $ 70 cuts i 've had . great job maya hair salon . do n't be afraid to try it	2181
0	the only positive experience i had was my initial visit . the doctor i met with , jillian webb , was nice and made me feel very comfortable when speaking to her . since then , it 's been a nightmare . i have to call this office every month to get them to respond to my pharmacy . every time i call they are extremely rude , and it is baffling how unprofessional they are . i would never recommend anyone going here .	965
0	wife wanted to try something different than the standard marcos or pizza hut . delivery was quick but pizza was terrible . not often id prefer red baron over a delivered pizza . special was for 20 wings which also were overcooked and had little to no sauce at all on them . had to put my own franks on them to be edible . will not return .	1399
0	amending my review to one star after finding out that the capacitor that they installed was the wrong size , which caused the unit to fail 10 months later . i would n't trust this company with my business or anyone else 's for that matter .	2031
1	i absolutely love nexcare urgent care . i always get in fast and get treated so well . their diagnosis is always spot on and the prescribed treatment works every time ! so far my previous primary care doctor misdiagnosed me and my son , prescribing unnecessary medications and treatments . i am so grateful for every single doctor i 've seen so far ( and we 've been there a lot ! ) as well as the front office staff and nurses , etc . i recommend nexcare every chance i get !	3193
0	one of the nicer crown plazas these days . breakfast buffet i could have skipped . fake scrambled eggs , hockey puck sausage , muffins , cereal , sugary yoghurt , i think biscuits and gravy . very sparse workout room . a few light dumbbells . a few weighted bars . some sort of universal type . a mat and ball . no weight bench , but some weird dice shaped boxes you can push together . nice enough room . stained carpet .	1786
1	the costco food court is simply amazing . i ordered a slice of cheese pizza entree which was cooked to perfection and an açaí bowl for desert ( which is top 5 ever ) . costco 's food court is delicious and nutritious . the options are limitless . i 'll be back soon for the beef brisket sandwich	1102
1	the mayfield location is both convenient and friendly . the staff always has a smile and their services are fantastic . the use of the laundry bags makes drop off a breeze . there have been several times they have double checked with me before cleaning , i find that very comforting . i feel very confident recommending their services	2784
1	this is my go to place for eyebrow threading . i usually walk in and the wait time is n't bad at all.. 5-10 mins at the max . you can get your full face threaded or just eyebrows . eyebrow threading without forehead costs $ 10 . look for their holiday specials , 11 eyebrow threading for $ 72 ! ! it 's a steal .	460
0	quickly delivered for an extra delivery fee . pizzas are hot and tasty but there is way too much dough and there is no need for a 2 inch crust . over priced and so many restrictions on using coupons that you wonder why any are produced ? second pizza half price but first one over priced . reduce the amount of your dough balls apply your topping to the edge leaving only 1/4 inch for the crust and you will have a wining product . they charge you a fee for paying debit which happens to be ilegal and did i mention reduce your prices ?	400
1	takes about 5 minutes to get a smog check , and you can renew your registration for an additional $ 10 . they offer a coupon online for $ 3 off but you must print it out ! smog check is $ 27 . not bad for quick service , just because to print out your coupon . quick and convenient .	2208
1	we started going to sands right after we moved here from texas 2 years ago . they are outstanding in the service department , always quick and accommodating . i will never take my soul anywhere else.. i recently upgraded to a newer kia soul and r.j. was the absolute best . we told him what we were willing to pay and he kept going back until he got us the price we wanted . absolutely the best dealer in town ! !	624
1	i had a botox appointment there and was a little concerned about getting it done for the first time , but it turned out to be a great experience ! janet made me feel right at home and answered all my questions . she made me feel at ease and the rest of the staff was really friendly ! a few days after the botox my forehead looked amazing ! ! i would easily recommend this office , you can tell they care about their patients .	590
0	the security was awful . my friend was kicked in the back by a group of girls and we were asked to leave . do not go here . it is all trash .	677
0	bought two cars 2014 f250 and 2010 accord , and a 6000 service plan for 2014 f250 failed to honor , then after there corporate and attorneys got involced refunded just beware	1650

1	this place was great . our server was delightful . he was very helpful on menu selections and did a great job mixing up a variety of drinks for us . we started off with the oysters which were delicious , and shared a salad with an egg in it which was great . i ordered the steak for my meal and my friend ordered the boar , both were delightful . definitely will be going back again !	429
0	great food , friendly servers , but plan a bunch of time to go here . s-l-o-w. and they got 2 of our 4 orders wrong . amazing food and good prices , but ... c '' mon guys .	839
1	this is one of my favorite restaurants . the food is always great and the service is awesome , i also like playing the board games they have available , all around a great experience here	964
0	as a bakery , it is nothing special . the bread , cakes , etc are satisfactory . the lattes are pricey and served in small compared portions to other similar bakeries in the area , also i find the individual deserts they serve with the coffee are often either stale or hard ( you order a chocolate mousse , and get a chocolate cement piece instead because it has been in their fridge for several days ) . the sandwiches and soups are also good , but again , nothing spectacular .	3184
1	i have used this homeowners plumbing supply store many times . the owner is exceptional . i have come in with parts that people at big chain stores have never seen and ca n't replace . this guy knew in 2 seconds what it was , who manufactured it , how long ago it was being used in the valley and he gave me the correct parts . i was in and out in a couple minutes . this is not just a one time experience ... i have had similar experiences on multiple occasions . i highly recommend this store and the personnel in the store .	1339
1	i have been going to sweet nails for over a year . kayla is amazing . she can do anything .	655
0	this use to be a favorite and the pictures posted are what pitas used to look like . management changed recently and staff , go to get pit in middle guy tells me if i want more tomatoes it will cost $ 2.00 new thing they have ... hugh ? i wanted to leave and so did my friend i never heard such a thing before ! my pita was size of a mcdonald 's dollar menu burrito ate it we went to el polo loco to finish eating . i 'll never go back $ 20 spent on a tease snack ! this is the last location open in town no wonder/ do n't see this one going far either .	84
0	dropped 1k here - overrated horrible message therapist , rented terrace suite - gross bathroom shower- wo n't ever come back ! !	2305
0	they need to have better security . too many carts all over the parking lot . my car got scratched while i was inside shopping for kimbap .	715
1	i have been coming here for three years now and i still like this place . my doctor is very good with my health care . i wo n't go anywhere else . it took me a while to find a good doctor .	2645
1	i stop here frequently ... they 're helpful and courteous and having the post office depot is super convenient thanks for being there daily !	507
0	scheduled a tattoo removal , i was re scheduled the first time and when i finally came for my treatment they told me they could n't remove my kind of tattoo ( permanent makeup for eyebrows ) that 's fine , but the receptionist knew what i was coming in for . is it really so hard to just call me and let me know before i drive 45 minutes out of my way ?	582
1	bought a new stove , refrigerator , dishwasher and washer from this location after being snubbed by associates at a different location . but rich , brian and jim really know how to treat people . it was all about us and what they could do to make our experience perfect . good service is hard to find which why i would like to recognize this team for outstanding customer service . thank you and keep up the good work !	3812
0	i went with girlfriends for a bachelorette party . i felt totally ripped off . definitely do n't spring for the vip-it 's expensive and you miss half of the show because you 're too close to the stage when they run around . drink service is terrible . given the opportunity to go again , i 'd skip this show and go straight to one of the actual strip clubs . cheaper and way better dancing .	2149
0	not friendly service and out of iced coffee on the day i went . consistently a not so good experience .	477
0	the service here is not great the waiting time is more and my service for car given wrong estimation more than $ 1000 bucks went to local auto service got repair with in $ 300 bucks . they give wrong estimation to exploit the amt .	1297
1	the number one destination here in cleveland to satisfy your candy fix . they got all kinds of candy from a to z , even the sugar free kind . they even have a huge collection of sodas/pops as well , especially the old-school name brands . did i even mention that the employees who work there are friendly as well ?	2418
0	i had dinner at the savoy restaurant on 8/12/2011 ... . the place is beautiful but the food leaves something to be desired if u are going to charge those prices get the kitchen up to par ... my meal was shrimp and cheese grits ... ugh ! ! maybe if the chef did less socializing in the dining room and put more focus on the food ! ! ! to bad because the place is nice ... i give it 6 months ! !	714
0	had dinner here the other evening . none of our party were impressed . it was n't horrible , it was edible for sure , but good ? no . i had the squid salad ( yum pla muk ) and it had a really strange flavour , and the calamari ( squid ) was very very rubbery . i also had the coconut chicken soup and it was very watery and a very thin consistency ( although the flavour was ok ) . really would n't go here again - too many other dining options at yonge & eg , and if i want thai , i 'd go elsewhere .	412
1	i 've had good experience with the advisors thats have helped me and the services that were provided . best oil service specials .	2210
1	tom and his crew always do an amazing job accommodating myself and my clients , even in the latest of late notices . they are professional , timely , and the value is unmatched . their adaptability and consistency in customer service is astonishing and i am so thankful for having them as a business partner and friend . highly recommend !	3801
1	my friend and i are visiting from ga and staying at the grand view resort- and visited catalina island bar & upon touring , realized good customer service was scarce . as we sat down at the bar we were promptly greeted with smiles from romeo & joshua ! ! their great service definitely wants me to return to this bar just for their attentive service & hospitality ! ! i highly recommend this bar & these bartenders ! !	832
0	went yesterday , most likely will not return . our theatre was not just dirty , but trashed . broken eyeglasses under my feet , water bottles , popcorn strewn throughout the entire room , garbage cans overflowing . this was at 12:50 in the afternoon ; obviously the place had n't been cleaned the night before . i brought this to the attention of an employee who stated they have an overnight cleaning crew ... obviously someone did n't show up . absolutely disgusting ... and in an upscale , very expensive shopping center .	3680
0	we decided to go here for lunch as it 's close to my work . the food itself was n't anything special . i ordered a chicken roll . the roll took a very long time for them to make & arrive at the table ... was n't worth the wait . it had a few pieces of chicken , bell peppers & onions and some really tart sauce in it . i would n't order it again .	202
0	quick quack is a quick crock . higher prices for a fancy light show inside the wash . this fancy equipment did n't remove bugs , left my wheels dirty , did n't dry my suv , and left water and soap spots everywhere . i came for a car wash , not a light show . waste of money .	78
1	awesome team go watch them play its always a good time in phoenix !	2005
1	the agents are extremely knowledgeable , experienced and diligent . i would highly recommend this office and its staff to anyone looking to buy or sell a home in the greater las vegas area .	3315
1	very clean and relaxing atmosphere . family run and oriented . would recommend and plan on visting again .	2049
1	great food , great customer service and just so friendly ! always offers my dog a doggie biscuit which she loves ! pancakes taste just like homemade and biscuits and muffins are yummy too !	1239
0	worst hotel experience . the so-called `` non-smoking '' room ( 164 ) reaked of cigarettes ... ! there was even an ashtray in the room on the bedside table . i complained to the front desk and she was no help . we left the room for 4 hours , with the window wide open and after spraying the room with fabreeze , the room still stunk ! ! the sink was also leaking and the shower head was spraying at every direction . this place is a dump . the only 2 positives about staying here is the breakfast is okay and the ladies that work in the dining area were really friendly and accommodating . i would never stay here again ! !	1335
1	incredible food ! the gnocchi were little pillows of heaven in a tasty butter sauce . accompanying shrimp were a bit tough but the gnocchi made up for it ten-fold . onglet de boeuf was amazing as well . beautifully seasoned , perfectly cooked ! cocktails were well made . the ambience is great and was accentuated by the wait staff . they were loving life and it is contagious .	709
1	a. ma . zing.. every time i go here it 's amazing and fresh . i always get the crispy turkey sandwich with the blueberry coleslaw . top 5 best things i 've ever eaten .	998
1	voodoo beach is now open daily at 10am . the pools here feel more like a decorative piece for a tanning salon than anything else . everyone was getting their tan on but not their dip on . tg4sb , at least the small kiddies took advantage of the waters . hey , maybe everyone was just digging on the dj 's jamz ... maybe . you can hear the music all the way up from any poolside/strip view rooms . my ears are still pulsating ... thank goodness for the adults only pool . too many kiddies around for spring break ...	2193
1	went through the drive thru for a panda bowl with fried rice & teriyaki chicken and a panda passion tea . it was yummy !	958
1	called yellow cab for a ride from my home in scottsdale to pick up my car being serviced . they promised a 10 - 20 minute pickup , texted me with a 10 minute eta and arrived exactly as promised . the cab was new , clean and fresh , the driver was pleasant and polite . i could not have been more satisfied with the experience . this is my new best cab company for sure . job well done !	3142
0	my heels are still hurting from the scrubbing . poor manicure . they were trying to handle too many people . no wonder they offer wine . you need to be buzzed . they 're too expensive even if they were good .	265
0	i ordered bulgogi bibimbap that came with no rice ! ! ! ! ! ! not worth $ 14 when you do n't get the complete meal .	1028
0	the staff is terrible . since i am rarely able to see dr. grade , it will be easy to leave to find another gynecologist with a friendly , inviting staff .	3406

0	friendly staff ? yes clean ? yes knowledgeable staff ? they did n't know how deep the pool was ( 4 or 6ft ) they could n't tell me why i do n't have access to the sauna . they could n't tell me what is included in my basic membership plan . machines ? seated leg press back rest was broken ( gyms opened 4 days ago ! ) second machine broken in just 1 week ! ! they just lost two stars . employee said he 'd take care of it . 45min later , nothing . hazard ! ! ! does n't anyone read these reviews ? !	1695
0	great cookies but everything else is n't so good . the service is also incredibly slow . do n't recommend it unless you want to wait forever .	390
0	large breed puppies are all stuck in small cages . a saint bernard was in a cage that he could not even stretch out in . it was n't until people started posting on facebook about it that they actually made the cage bigger . all the puppies come from puppy mills . there is now a new law in effect that will make it so these stores have to get puppies from rescues and shelters , but it will take 2 years until they have to comply . wish it would be sooner , until then make sure you rescue a dog or puppy or go to a reputable breeder who will let you come visit your puppies mother and father on their property .	1894
0	stopped in to have a nail removed from my tire for `` free '' first one tire had separation and needed replace , $ 70 . then 15 min later another tire allegedly had separation , another $ 70 the two original tires with the alleged separation were decent quality goodyears with approx . 35,000 miles final bill , $ 230 after the plus , plus , plus extras . reminds me of an airport rental car bill . tim y	3231
1	had a brain fart and did n't pack dress shoes or necklace for a dress i was going to wear ! oh no , what a girl to do ? driving back to hotel from work , had 5 min to spare . saw this ross and immediately made an illegal u-turn . got a stranded pearl necklace for $ 20 and a pair of sexy pumps for $ 7.5 ! score !	3778
0	would give 0 stars if allowed . be careful when dealing with arizona collision specialists off raintree . the price doubled what we were originally quoted and the body shop did not even communicate the increased expense until after all of the work was completed and we were asked to come pick up our car . this place is very unprofessional and when asked to explain the increased expense they stated it was not their problem . stay away from here unless you want to get tricked and taken advantage of .	1605
0	do n't nothing from here . they refuse to honor their furniture warranty ! 7 month old table finish is bubbling and they state excessive wear . bs ! ! ! ! ! 7 months their furniture finish should n't bubble . especially if it is quality workmanship . do n't buy furniture here ! ! !	1794
0	this place is a scam ! i went into return a battery i bought two days ago ( my 3rd one from this place ) and it did n't work on my vape pen and they would n't return it or give me my money back . absolutely worst customer service i 've ever experienced . they owner is so rude and was yelling obscenities to me on the phone . will be contacting the better business bureau on them . they are so rude and do n't know what customer service means .	1556
0	i would never take my pets here again . i had a dog a few years back and after few visits of trying to find out why my dog was n't gaining weight and if something was wrong . i had to put him down for he was really sick and the er vet said he was suffering . i wish i trusted my instincts and went for 2nd opinion somewhere else . years later i have a new , rescue dog that i want to find a vet for and new user on yelp found that this place got good reviews is shocking ! that is why i 'm just now leaving my review of this place from my past experiences years later .	939
1	i manage an it department and bring all of our damaged phones here for repair . other than not always being on time to open the store , the repairs are done at a fair price . only had a couple of issues with the repair , which they took care of upon return . best cell phone repair place that i have dealt with ( and i 've tried several )	1586
1	had a blast doing the chocolate tasting . the guy who did the class was very informative & lots of fun . if you want to try some real chocolate this is the place !	3722
1	very nice place with extremely friendly staff . the food was similar quality to other mexican food places in the nw valley ... .good but not spectacular . very good portions for the price . i do n't live close by but will certainly go back when i am in the area .	548
0	the worst rental agency ever . they expect you to fix any problems that come up in the rental or they want the neighbors to do it so they can save some money . i was out of town one weekend with my parents and because we drove my car and my parents left theirs at the house we had call after call as to why their car was parked at the house . the homeowner to the house makes unannounced visits . this has by far been the worst ever renting experience .	3932
0	my primary care referred me to this place for my injured wrist . it was one of worst experience i have ever had with any care provider . the receptionist ( kaitleen ) completely ignored the fact that my primary sent my x-ray report and almost made me do another x-ray there . she was very impatient and kept complaining about her working hours with her colleague in front of the patients . i had a 3:10pm appointment and did not see a doctor ( frank raia ) until 4:30pm . the doctor spent probably less than 5 minutes with me .	2896
0	our waitress , leah , was fantastic . she was attentive and accommodating . the food on the other hand was less than desirable . i ordered the balsamic chicken which came on a bed of vegetables and orzo.. i could n't eat anything except for the chicken . it was so salty . salted to the point where it burned my tongue . we ordered broccoli as well - same thing , salt .	873
0	i worked with amanda young to rent a property from one of her clients and i have had nothing but trouble . it makes me feel uneasy that a realtor who can ignore a water heater leakage into a unit below unti the water damage is so severe it is coming through the electrical sockets still sells houses . between her and her client that i rent from nothing is ever accomplished . i wouldnt work with a company that employs such people . she is very unprofessional and does not follow through on anything !	2217
0	this motel sucks ! ! never going to stay in thsi arizona dumpe ever again .	2599
0	the workers were cordial , and they work fast . however , you wo n't get the advertised price . for example , my leaving room is 270sqft , and i have a game room that 's about 60ft and a hallway that 's about 10ft . the advertised price was $ 89.00 , when the reps arrived . i could not get this price , no matter what , the rep was trying to get me to the 100 mark . the reps stated the hallway is an additional $ 15.00.any way , this was my first time trying this company , and i would not recommend it based on the false advertisement on the price .	3777
0	i have eaten at this place a few years ago . the food was fine . went with a co-worker a few days go it was terrible . even the salad was disguisting . ordered the ziti it was watery and tasteless . gave me a bad stomachache immediately afterwards . save your money and stomach .	768
0	the ambiance was nice . but the bartenders were rude . we were handed our drinks and never heard from our bartender , herbie , again . what 's the point of looking at something nice if the service is poor . pretty on the outside , ugly on the inside .	3343
1	very good people . they released my back pain . i can walk upright again . very clean . i will go back my next trip .	2399
0	what a disappointment . i am still upset at the service and attention to customer service . after trying to explain the frustration with punctuality and timing , still no improvement . i am still trying to contact them because my granite shine is not consistent . i am also calling the the company that recommends them and explain they need to give their customers a more reliable company . bad news	1861
0	i like to give restaurants 2 chances before righting them off . this has to be the worst breakfast experience ever ! ! the home fries were saturated in oil and were an off putting dark brown . it 's obvious the the oil needed to changed . i got the eggs benedict with pemeal bacon . the bacon was off and even after letting our waitress know our bill did not reflect the complaint . the hollandaise was a translucent yellow , nothing close to the rich creaminess that it should be . have to say i would never ever return to sofra for breakfast . the taste , and presentation were a disappointment . save your money and go to sunset grill .	89
1	the gentleman that work at this location were very helpful and polite . they were able to assist my husband and i with all the upgrade eligibility , directv bundling and claim questions that we had . thanks guys !	3380
0	. wish l could rate o.do n't go here , had spine surgery 3 years ago nothing but worse chronic pain after can barely get out of bed a lot.went back they said ca n't do anything else its just going to get worse .went to there pain center just as bad .wish l could sue them.any lawyers out there , yes right . butchers do n't go there .	2896
0	do n't bother . your 's truly puts this place to shame . bad coffee and bland food ... tastes prepackaged not fresh . service was fast ... but ca n't make up for bad food . trifecta was mediocre and eggs benedict was horrible ... not even close to inn on coventry 's eggs mondo	1258
1	a dinosaur trail next to a library next to mushroom picnic tables shaded by giant butterflies , next to a water feature , next to two playgrounds , next to the fire station , next to an amphi-theater , with grass fields on one end and a dog park on the other end by the sand volley ball park , away from the other trail . yeah , it 's okay , if your into taking your kids to the park .	3808
1	a must to purchase the standing only rows , excellent concert , starts on time ! flew all the way from nyc , and it was well worth it ; best concert i 've been to this far	1771
1	i met alex because he was giving me bang trims while i was attempting to grow out my hair . when i wanted a change i let alex give me a total makeover . he cut my hair like the girl from the new tron -- asymmetrical bob . it was amazing . people are always asking me who cuts my hair . i have been all over the valley looking for someone that can give a perfect hair cut for my hair type and face shape and i have finally found him . on top of his talent and skill - it is a reasonable price ! i can not say enough great things about alex . try him out for sure .	2274
0	this is a very bad and dangerous service . i was promised a doctor would come to my place within 4 hours to treat my sick 4-week old . i even called back to confirm twice . a doctor never came . we never got a phone call either . meanwhile my son has gotten much worse . these people are very misleading which is very dangerous when dealing with health issues .	723
0	service très tes long . assiette peu garnie . et facture salée . je ne recommande pas pour y manger .	1167
0	vibe dirty . dilapidated . i get here after midnight and i have to pay a $ 10 cover `` for charity . '' there was some arm wrestling event here and i think proceeds were going to `` some '' charity but to charge $ 10 after the event is over ? not cool . in fact , it 's just sneaky . the goods the music was good . ( a friend 's dj was playing ) . but the crowd was about 23 . yikes . in this dark abyss , the floors were sticky with stale beer . at least they had heineken . obligatory catchy remark never trust a place that 's just numbers .	2237
0	they can cut hair here but clearly are learning when it comes to coloring . also the owner stated my appointment for a hombre would be 2 hours , it took 8 hours . my hair is mostly yellow . i gave the stylist a photo to go buy which you can clearly see has lowlights and highlights . instead she just bleached out my hair . the blending is awful . tasha also claimed as color being her specialty . highly disappointed .	636
1	always delicious ! orange chicken is a must have , they use real orange peels in their sauce .	1264
0	could have been a good place to go but they closed 20 minutes early and we were instructed to `` get out . '' despite the fact that they left the door unlocked . they then shut off the lights and machines and we left . there are other stores with far better customer service .	1986
1	a little pricey but nothing like it in the city . for a small bowl it 's very filling and i love the wasabi peas ! everything they add compliments and creates a very flavourful experience : )	309
0	meh ... just really meh , my sandwich was greasy and my girlfriend did n't think her sandwich was very good either . the staff is the only reason this place gets two stars . over the top nice , however we ordered two sandwiches and a side salad , to go , and it took 25 min to get our food . the when we got home we enjoyed finding out instead of a salad they gave us over salted chips . i see them trying to be hip and different , but you need the food to be tasty as well . disappointing first try , hope they figure it out .	277
0	i 've been going to the 20 lounge on scottsdale road and indian bend for a couple years now , and have never had a problem . this weekend i went to the scottsdale quarter location with a friend and did n't have a very good experience . the woman doing my nails completely messed up and was laughing about it . when i asked for someone to redo it , since i was paying for the service , they acted like i was a huge inconvenience . i 've never been the kind of person to complain about something like this but i was so disappointed with how i was treated .	3450
1	we have been using them for a while now to fill our husky 's prescription . they have always been very helpful and timely . they also add a little toy to her box each time that she always loves . when i opened our most recent box , she grabbed the toy and ran - she knew there would be a present in there for her .	2827
0	i hate how they put their toppings in corners of the cup rather than sprikled all around on the yogurt . a bit pricey too .	3335

0	coffee maker , fridge , tub , shower , and ice maker were all dirty . there was actually food still in the fridge from previous guest ( s ) . service is good , but it 's a boutique hotel with no gaming and one bar . kil @ wat restaurant was terrible food and worse service . we got tired of chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne so stopped complaining . rooms were nice ; just wish we could 've gotten in . keys were deactivated 3 times during our stay , once during bridal party preparations .	2973
1	# 44/2016 it 's an airline . the planes are newer and the staff is slightly nicer than other airlines . yeah , it 's got some funky purple and pink lighting- woohoo- and you can text people seat to seat ( tinder or grindr-like ? ) legroom is a little more generous but nonetheless i do n't get the fuss .	1623
0	very rude . i ordered the wrong tea and they were very rude giving me another drink . they did n't even give me my money back . not going again .	1301
0	this place is a rip off ! took daughter there for a bad flu she had and was in there only about 30-45 mins . we have now been billed over $ 2800 . all they did was take 2 x-rays and gave her gatorade and told us to take her home . will never go back to this place and i 'm telling everyone to stay away ! ! now we have been billed another $ 330 . i have left a message and sent an email to customer service and have received no response .	350
1	great prices on refill for soda ( under $ 1 ) and they have both pepsi and coke products , so thats a good thing , and took some extra lids as the lids here for the fountain cups are very good ! not the cheap crap you get at a lot of places . the gas prices seem on par with other places around here , and the customer service is real good . this will be my place to go to while im at the worldmark resort here !	3797

0	tammy the supervisor did not say a word to me besides `` come on up '' when i was ready to check . i was making a return plus a big purchase at 9:30pm , two hours before the scheduled closing time , yet i was getting attitude left and right -- -banging the scanner , slamming hangers , and periodical scoffing during the entire transaction . i work in retail , matter	3778
1	great food sushi was great also with the stir fry the service was fast and great . all you can eat ? ! and boy i can eat..	1362
0	... i guess they could just let the vagrants move into this post office . seriously filthy facilities , many questionable sorts hanging around even at 4:30pm , and rude customer service . i admittedly do n't expect much from the usps at this point , aside from overpriced and low quality service , but this place is seriously in need of an overhaul and at least a security guard .	1913
1	short tour is the least amount of information available for a civilization changing achievement and charge still money for a tour . the guide was tom on aug 1st , 2013 . tom has a job as a tour guide . tom likes getting paid for his job but apparently hates doing his job . it was a speed walk with no information . i asked him a question and received more than a grunt and less that reasonable explanation . very disappointed . i give it 4 stars because it is the hoover dam and that alone is amazing .	83
1	really liked this place . staff was great about changing my room when the elevator noise was waking me up . even gave me a room with 180 degree view of the water . breakfast buffet is good , just very expensive . nice deck overlooking the water that can be used by anyone .	1859
0	this place is a joke , would n't cash a legit paycheck on a sunday because my place of employment is closed on sundays . the employees seem lost and confused .	1726
0	you could n't really enjoy yourself with the awful smell of body odor . it smelled so bad that my husband and i have a new term for when we smell body odor . we just look at each other and say `` upstairs jazz '' .	3295
1	great service , tasty rolls and fair pricing . we 've added o sushi as a dinner to our neighborhood favourites .	734
0	after spending close to $ 20,000.00 with this company i would have assumed they would have stood behind the products they sell . i have found out that they do n't ! they will blame you the customer for faulty merchandise . for example : they blamed my wife and i ( 60 's ) for touching refaced kitchen cabinets with wet hands and making the lamination peel off . they replaced several cabinet doors within the first 3 years with the wrong style of door and wrong interior color ... .my 85 yr old father who lived with us at the time did not catch it ! their replacement windows leak and the frames mold ... .buyer beware of this organization !	3881
0	we always drive this place and it always has a line , so we decided to stop by one day and see what all the fuss was about . after waiting for a good 15-20 minutes , we ordered 2 different ices planning to share them . after my fiance and i took a bite , we both looked at each other and thought there was way too much syrup and tasted like pure sugar . i 've had great snow cones all over and these were the worst i 've ever had . do n't waste your time driving here and waiting ...	2112
0	use caution with this location -- -- they sold me a clearly used product as new -- i did n't detect this until i got home -- -they agreed to replace -- -however in my opinion this is a deceptive and innapropriate business practice . i usually shop at the tatum store -- where i have never had a problem before -- -so for me i am only going to tatum from now on .	3911
0	save your time and $ $ . they make promises and produce nothing for you . go throw your money into a bottomless pit , you 'll have more luck . they play on peoples aspirations and play them for suckers .	64
0	i really like pete and macs but every time i call for an appointment , the front desk cant find my account ... recently i referred a couple of friends , each credit is 25 bucks , but of course they cant find my account ... no one on the phone really cares or bothers to try . its disappointing ...	3108
1	decent bagels but if like cream cheese , you may want to ask for extra . i noticed they were light on the spread .	3372
1	09/2016 : : just read this company went bankrupt . sad , they were great , on time and experts at troubleshooting issues with my brand new fridge .	2903
1	went here for lunch today - i was planning for a moe 's burrito , but just kept walking - sign said burger parmesan $ 6 so i went in - great burger prepared really fast . got a side of tater tots and a diet coke for $ 9 - great vibe - good food - nice people - i 'm going back on tuesday for lunch - any burger with a side $ 6 .	68
1	there 's usually a line but they do good work with how busy they are . granted sometimes they miss a few spots but will fix it if you say something . over all solid car wash. plus the gas station right next door has everything you could ever want or need	3123
0	i must start off by saying the parking absolutely sucks . it 's very limited and a hassle when you have to carry stuff . they charge 8.00 a person and everything is over priced . it 's hot and muggy .	3837
1	store is very clean and organized . the food court is so delicious and cheap . getting a membership here was the best thing ever . staff is always extremely happy and they help out whenever needed	2469
1	always a good time here the staff is super friendly and quick . food is good and at a great price i ca n't complain .	178
1	nice friendly staff , maintenance is friendly and always available . will recommend . the leasing office agents is friendly . the property stays clean . ive been a resident going on 3 years . things have been perfect .	617
0	be aware this dealership 's service team should not be trusted . mis-information , saying work was completed when it was n't , are just the beginning of the issues we have experienced . we were told one day the brake pads were fine - and then the next day the needed to be replaced . i am sure we did n't drive enough miles overnight . find another service place before they take you for thousands !	2432
0	this place sucks ... .the food sucks and it smells weird . a pretty sorry excuse for a sports bar . ... but what do i know .	2694
1	we have never had a bad meal at mickey & mooch . we like to try different restaurants , but always migrate back . the she crab soup is the absolute best . i could just eat a huge bowl of that with bread and make it a meal . : - ) mickey himself has stopped by our table and is a genuine perfectionist . no corners cut here . fresh and delicious and huge portions !	1147
0	prices are way too high compared to other beauty supplies . the first thing they say to you even before a hello is `` no purses '' . you cant come in with more than one other person so be prepared to leave your friends , family or kids in the car cuz god forbid you , your mom and sister want to all come in and buy stuff . owner must be extremely paranoid . overall , terrible beauty supply . i rather drive all the way to maryland parkway than go to this place .	1659
0	pretty bummed on the experience especially knowing this chain is coming to arroyo grande , ca . there was no chocolate or vanilla . flavors were just ok. pistachio , banana , coconut , tart , and some other lame flavors . i know selection varies . we did come late , but so what ! ! there was still 25 mins before closing . fix it up menchies -- no bueno .	738
1	cindy is the best ! been going here for years ! you will love the attention and caring way she does nails .	1783
0	this i would almost refer to as a borderline scam . they get you there you have to buy drinks appetizers food etc while you 're waiting for the crew to show up . the crew was 40 minutes late in getting there . and then they sell you pictures you can have autographed for $ 10 . and after waiting for that long amount of time you get up there just to realize danny is n't even there . very disappointed . they shake your hand sign your purchase photo . snap a quick picture with your cell phone . and then send you on your way what a joke .	2978
0	the portions of meat or chicken to the tacos and nachos are so small and also the additional charge for the guacamole is also small . i do n't recommend this restaurant .	1474
0	they did an alignment and did not mention a broken and missing cam tab and used a standard nut on a metric ( or vice versa ) cam tab bolt . work was being done by them for new look collision for an accident repair . new look collision fixed the problems and did their own alignment after .	203
1	everything was installed properly , james was great , but anthony never came back and fixed the minor issues i brought up to him . if he did this review would have been 5/5 . the only other thing i did n't like was that you had to pay the price up front . everything else was great !	3407
1	we love aiko and we especially love our home ! we have had zero issues and any time we email about something needing repair they immediately send someone one out . the fees are a little higher than others but if you stay within your agreement you have nothing to worry about .	3375
0	restrooms are disgusting ... . ! ! ! ! treadmills are worn out some are missing parts . overall equipment is dirty - old	392
1	hotel was beautiful , the lobby has stone slab floor . stayed on the third floor with a king bed , fridge , microwave , desk and lounge chair . the room was huge , no complaints . we found it through a deal on expedia . it reminded us of the hotel room we stayed in on our honeymoon which was at a resort in santa barbara called fess parker . we will definitely be staying again .	2866
1	i have gone here several times and had ashley do my cut . she did a great job and i will be back for her . a barber in the back of the shop had some violent trap music playing and i did n't like that at all . you should only play inoffensive music at a business because some people do n't like cursing and violence in their music . ashley gets 5 stars but that crap music loses a star .	2366
0	this is by far the worst obgyn you can go to in vegas ! the staff is so rude i called asked for an appt and she was rude so by default i was back i asked for an appt and she said for what i told her for what issue and she was still bringing up the fact that i sounded mean and i said that we were over that and i needed an appt she said 'no goodbye ' and hung up on me . i called back twice got hung up on twice then spoke to a manager and they were also rude ... please do not go here..	1925
1	they 're so great . i called ahead of time to see if they had any of the bread i loved and they were able to set aside two loaves for me . i show up and sure enough they had them set aside and now they can even slice it up for you ! great customer service at the bakery !	433
1	awesome - super fun place to go . very clean , and very new everything . staff is usually pretty friendly and helpful . menu always has good food . very pricey - bring a group to split up your hourly cost ! very fun .	1483
0	horrible experience . for a $ 60 dollar pedicure , i left with sugar scrub still all over my ankles and lower leg . no water or champagne offered at that price . i have had better service and experience at other spas for half the cost . will not return .	2305
1	great service ! moved from boston to san diego , the guy 's were right on time ! assembling everything quickly and properly . thanks for making our move easy and fast !	3114
0	as a frequent traveler and elite spg member i was extremely disappointed with the sheraton centre . while the lobby is very well decorated and the location is more or less convenient and central , i found the room to be terrible . for starters it was extremely small - i was shocked that they market this as `` club level '' . my rooms at other starwood hotels on the club level have been much larger . i also found the decor to be depressing and the overall build quality to feel cheap ( i.e . plastic bathtub , peeling wallpaper ) . i definitely will not be staying here on my next visit to toronto !	1690
0	.	2297
0	this nail spa is one of the worst in the country . after making a reservation , once we got there we had to wait for 30 minutes to even sit down on the chairs . after waiting for another 2 hours , the people there finally started on our pedicures . we were all going to get manicures as well , but we could n't because we had to go .	1834
0	inaccurate operating hours ... substantars service at the delay anal natziz at the door . in general there are better options	2172
0	i have called this place i want to say like 10 times and they wo n't answer the phone ! ! they need a phone person or something cuz this is ridiculous !	1999
0	this is a sad excuse for a business . the fact that they have been around for so long is because there is n't any other place in vegas and people just got over the bad customer service . everyone in there is so rude and condescending like their better than you or something . i will never step foot inside because i do n't want to be talked down to . bad business and horrible customer service is n't ok and everyone in there should just do us all a favor and quit .	2307
1	staff was extremely helpful , and rooms were clean and nicely decorated . very positive experience !	2401
1	as a pediatrician and a mom , i have interacted with this practice both professionally and personally . the child psychiatry care is the best in the valley- clinician judgement incorporating the unique needs of your children . they really listen to what has worked or not and partner with you to find a solution . highly reccomend .	1541
1	had the best time with guido torpedo and danielle , they did an amazing job in hosting . i have tried plenty hosts but these two are truly rock stars ! even more , for the price of the package it was worth the fun . i highly recommend vegas rockstar vip and i would request to have guido and danielle host your events !	2122
0	took them 4 times to get my car painted correctly and someone there stole a brand new bottle of cologne out of my car and they said they would replace it and only gave me part of the money . this place really sucks . make sure you have nothing in your car that you want there when you pick your car up because it will be missing and check there painters work because he is very sloppy . wesley is great , sorry you have to work there wesley	1926
1	spectacular service . moved down here from portland and left a great dealer up there , was extremely impressed with every aspect of their service . gave me a great courtesy vehicle and treated me with respect and honesty . would recommend then to any and all volvo owners or perspective buyers . just exceptional .	525
1	been coming here for years . miss a couple of the girls that used to work here . still , ftmp , we get good service . i drop off bags full of men 's shirts to be laundered along with womens suits for dry cleaning in addition to the few assorted things that need to get done . occasionally things have happened but they fix the issue and tend to get things worked out . overall i 've been pleased with the service , staff , and work done .	2374
1	the only thing we did at this store was to pick up an item we bought at another store because this store had it . there were no issues and it was very easy to get the item with our receipt and photo id .	3192
1	we love this place but every time we come here they always seem to be hiring a taquero or cashier which makes me question how they treat their employees .	857
0	this place is alright . we 're from california and we were visiting phoenix . so were trying to find a cool place to eat something cold and cool off . and we found snoh and it was okay . the acai is definite no for me . the flavors they have are just not that great that everyone is saying .	3556
0	we 'll be using oreilly from now on . came in for batteries for the truck and the employee was very surly-1 word answers , no smile , no thank you . had you been friendly , mr. autozone employee , we would have changed our own batteries and might still be autozone customers . one bad apple spoils the whole store .	506
1	love someone else 's bar ! mexican mondays ! ! also the sweet potato fries are great !	1150
1	i had a wonderful time last night during the champagne tasting , the pairings were on awesome ! i am looking forward to the next tasting ! thank you !	1193
0	just left here from getting an oil change . not only were they too lazy to rotate my tires ( asked me to take my business somewhere else ) but they claimed to have put air in my tires and did n't . if your business practice is to say you did something and did n't , and also to encourage people to get their tires rotated elsewhere because you do n't want to do them , then you should be out of business . i called to complain and was told to mention kevin and someone else , shane ? either way , if you plan to do business here then expect to waste your time making follow up appointments after .	3092
0	very very poor food . ordered postmates with this one . i was less than impressed . tonight i ordered chicken fingers hot with bleu cheese on the side , as well as an italian sub with extra vinegar on the side . fingers were decent . pretty straight forward with these . italian sub was mediocre at the very best . soggy bread , quality of the ingredients were lacking and overall flavor of the sub was poorly executed . i will not be ordering from them nor would i give the shot of going there to dine.. blah	459
0	what a huge boondoggle working with colonial as everything was going good when their dictator trish demanded heather our colonial manager dump our association . out of nowhere and would not give a reason . heather was a very good manager and she and i had the complex on an easy roll due to good communication and consistant maintenance . the departure was sudden and trish would not allow any further communication with heather . trish nor heather would attend the last meeting the were still obligated and paid to attend etc..this behavior has left us with great concerns over financial management and thus an audit has been ordered . run do n't walk from colonial cuz walks like a duck quacks like a duck ... ...	3608
1	it was my first trip here and i 'm a fan ! i had the arancini as an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious . for dinner i had the crab cakes . while they were tasty , they were the smallest crab cakes i 've ever seen and there were only two . as the entree i was very disappointed in the size . it was more appropriate as an appetizer i 'd say . the service was attentive but the private room our party was in was pretty chilly . i would definitely like to go back sometime !	979
0	i 've been here before and the coffee is good , but the last time i went i ordered a cookie and it was so hard that there were crumbs everywhere . i 'm surprised they even had it in the cabinet for sale and that the clerk did n't notice it was hard when she put it on my plate . not many outlets for laptops .	2516
1	my son has a kind of `` if it 's not a burger it 's not a meal '' '' attitude . this evening we went to top gone burgers for a birthday burger and we were not disappointed . i 'm not a meat eater myself but the burger eaters amongst us were very pleased , indeed . fries were decent plus plus and all the food came in a timely manner , hot , and delicious . we will definitely re-attend . thank you top gun burger !	1337
1	i have been visiting family doctors of green valley for 6 months now with phenomenal results ! my pa-c josh smith takes the time to explain and also answers the questions that i have . sometimes the people that make it all happen are never given any kudos . deb in patient services always greets you with a smile ! daisy ( medical assistant ) who takes my vitals is friendly and professional ! and all the girls in accounts receivable just as professional as well !	297
1	oil change , tire rotation and rad flush . done quickly , price was right , but could have given me a package deal . friendly service as well . i shall return .	3648
0	horrible horrible horrible customer service and their credit department ! i have spent more than $ 10,000 there and last two years paid every payment on time and my final payment was 11 days late and they charged me all the interest from the non-interest loan !	439
0	food is good , but service was slow . being able to walk in on a friday and not have a wait , you would assume that the service would be quick and on point . we waited about 45- an hour before our food came out.and by that time both my kids had been finished and ready to go home . the kitchen was way to slow for how `` busy '' they were ... . tip the kids menu pizza is enough for dinner for 2 it 's a 10 '' pizza and worth the $ 5.50 . order your kids meal first !	192
1	excellent tacos ! the veggie burrito is also delish ! if you are in the neighborhood check it out .	562
0	worst customer service ever . attempted to get a piercing twice and they basically turned me away . first time they had closed doors before it even hit 8pm . second time i showed up at 7 and they said they stop piercing at 7 , made absolutely no sense . avoid this shop and hit up htc piercing instead , youre welcome !	2895
1	this is my 2nd time here , it 's clear across town from my house but i love it ! the service is friendly , it 's always been clean and the food is delish ! i 've only tried the breakfast menu .	1319
0	absolutely terrible customer service ! the one asian lady who is always working the front desk is unbelievably rude to customers . i 've personally watched her engage in multiple arguments with customers , call them liars in front of everyone else , and send valid customers out the door ( i am sure to never return again ) . fire her and you 'll be a lot better off ! customer service is easy . smile and do your job ; )	3918
0	this place is racist . my best friend was getting married and we were here for her bachelorette . we kept cheering for her and all the guys ignored her . we just wanted her to have a good time because it was her bachelorette . this place is racist for sure , you should only come here if youre full white ( my friend is half white and she still was discriminated against ) .	2149
1	great experience with the store . helped me combine orders to reduce shipping costs . genna did a great job ! thanks very happy would recommend to all .	3662
0	i went to this place last saturday after reading all the great reviews . however , after eating the carne asada burrito , which was mediocre at best and the salsa was n't even hot . i was greatly disappointed by this place . i do n't know if they changed chefs from all the other reviews , but this place is n't worth stopping by .	791
1	great place to catch a movie . the mall makes this a really fun movie going experience .	1240
0	i love ross . i 've been shopping at these stores for over 15 years and much of my wardrobe comes from here . i went into this location today to pick up a tie and belt for my dad and brother as gifts and my cashier , valerie , was super rude . i do n't expect awesome customer service walking through these doors , but i thought i 'd at least get a smile and some friendly small talk while checking out . oh well . maybe she was having a bad day .	1678
1	really good . the steak burritos here are delicious . i get it medium rare it turns out great every time . i have also tried the pulled pork and chicken burritos those are also done really well too . they take orders by phone . do it to avoid waiting 5 minutes in line . service is great , ingredients are always fresh . i visit once a month on a regular . a++	1474
1	i came in to get fitted into a suit for a wedding in michigan . the entire staff was very friendly and made it a pretty simple process . they confirmed i would pick up the suit back in detroit and gave me a 20 % off coupon for a future purchase was nice . hopefully everything is delivered well in a few weeks so i do n't have to update my review : )	1972
0	shaun sater , the owner of this business , randomly sent , me , a stranger , a racist , threatening facebook message . i think that the good people of avondale , az should know the type of nonsense that the owner of this business engages in during his spare time : threatening women via facebook . i have a feeling that this might not be something many of you want to support . i will be contacting my local authorities to discuss my legal options , however , i just wanted to let all my fellow yelpers know also .	3442
0	called and made a reservation for mother 's day , was met at the front by an older women who was in a bad mood . she told us that it was n't there and then shoved a ticket at us to wait in line ! she did n't even apologize and then expected us to wait an hour for their mistake . we were good customers but will never return to this place again ! they need to fix their attitudes and learn how to provide good customer service !	1166
0	i have lived here for years and can tell management has changed , i 'm so disappointed ! ! there lack of care has me convinced any other apartment complex would be better . the leasing agent knew my issues with my a/c on june 30th at 9 am . she authorized less than satifatory work which has caused me to be without cooling air now on a holiday weekend ( 6/2/2016 ) spent my entire day trying to keep in contact with galleria palms because the staff did n't care about my situation . ca n't wait to move !	1642
1	love tf . extensive hot sauce bar , fresh food , huge portions . and kids eat free weekends ! we recommend the flautas , nachos , and chimis , but everything is delicious . they are also a good company -- even way back when i first encountered them in their native florida , they do fundraising events and other community building activities . large selection of beers , too ! excellent food , quickly served , with a fun and quirky decor .	1137
1	lang van is some of the best vietnamese food i 've ever had ( next to my friend 's mom 's house ) . get the pho and ask for them to make it spicy ... and make sure to specify vietnamese spicy , not white people spicy .	947
1	the food here is so great . my family can not get enough . even my 8 year old loves the food and she is super picky . the sweet pork is the best . the size of the food is so big sometimes i ca n't finish it .	1365
0	really was a great place to get glasses . seems like the 2 guys in st petersburg location have a attitude . also they just changed companies that do the lenses . my new glasses not as good quality lens to me . something is off . not as clear .	2172
0	the service is ok but they tried to get me to replace a battery and other parts that were unnecessary . the battery in my car was completely fine . they try to get you to buy just about anything , i do n't like that about jiffy lube . do not go here	2881
0	first costco raised membership fees , and than they do away with the package of car wash passes and raise the price . car wash does n't even have vacuums . do n't mind paying more members fees but do n't like when costco charges more for a product they do n't improve .	1102
0	i will give zero if i can , horrible food , just another tex mex restaurant but cheaper , they made a lot of mistakes and they just say : i will make another one , so you have to go back to the restaurant , lose time and unfair for their mistakes , horrible service and rude .	322
0	the hours of operation is deceiving . the bar is open late but the restaurant closes early . fell short of expectations after the long drive to check it out .	1147
1	songbird is a charming host to a vibrant quarter . located in the roosevelt row ( roro ) arts district , the coffee and tea house playfully reflects accents of its creative community in its earthy and urban décor . a scrabble-worded menu boasts roasts from brazil , costa rica , and india and loose-leaf tea varieties . vintage treasures in the lounge hint at recurrent themes of the songbird and all together compose a sort of time capsule of downtown phoenix and the different cultures present within the city .	816
1	clean store in with stocked shelves . great deals on halloween items . our cashier was friendly and kept the line moving fast . we were in and out .	1881
0	terrible pizza , the cheese was like chewing gum and the sauce had a flat taste to it , would never order pizza here again . cant judge their other food as i 've only ordered pizza here on two occasions figuring the second time might be better .	1404
0	soo ive never been to this place ... but just by the phone call was bad.. yeah this malinda lady nail picture designs look nice . u would think that a person that is comming from out of town would be able to get there nails done with someone professional and maybe i could have made her famous but no instead she is giveing me attutude threw the phone and trying to milk me cuz im from l.a. and cuz im not a local.. never will i recomend this place ... and fyi im out there more than u think..	3111
0	gon na keep this really simple because i 'm tired . bad food . end of story !	368
1	best facialist in town ! i have very sensitive skin and am always apprehensive when `` trying out '' a new service provider , and i must say that michelle superseded all of my expectations . she is extremely knowledgeable and attentive , and i feel safe/confident in her capable hands . i look forward and feel fortunate to having her as part of my routine . i highly recommend her to everyone ! great gift idea for the hard-to-shop-for people in your life !	750
1	got a bedroom set and i was extremely satisfied with every step of the process . the sales person was very knowledgeable and his suggestions were greatly appreciated .	1794
1	nice quality wholefoods here , pleasant and helpful staff , one of the bigger stores i have used , certainly a lot more elbow room than the one i use in nyc .	3874
0	came here for a haircut and while i was waiting to put my name on the list , the woman in the front completely ignored me as someone she new walked in and let them go before me . she then looked at me and asked me what i wanted and i told her i needed a haircut and she told me to sign and because there 's people ahead of me ... . like okay ... i understand but why 'd you let someone you know cut in front of everyone else ? rude .	3482
0	i will share - you can make your own judgement ... con : my appointment was somehow `` lost '' pro : they did not charge my session to make up for the inconvenience con : it was very , very loud - the walls were paper thin and i could hear everything going on in the rooms around me , including a very rowdy staff meeting . pro : massage therapist , joe , gave a very nice massage . con : sales pressure to sign up going in and coming out	528
0	terrible place , i will never go back.they up selling in the middle of examination table that are not needed.really bad .	1384
1	cool bar great puppy scene on the back when i went ! ! ! ( thursday night ) seams like everyone know each other . was n't easy to get inside groups pre made but great ambiance . they showed drag race and i had a nice moment . i ll have to see on week end !	1827
1	i got ice cream for my friends and myself last night . so amazing ! we got chocolate chip cookie bars with cookies and cream ice cream . line went pretty fast and they brought our to go order right to the table ! ca n't wait to go back again !	3604
0	i called four days in advance to have an apt on sunday to get my son 's haircut and when i arrived the gentleman running the place did n't have my apt . he was direct , borderline rude and could n't accommodate me till hours later . i will never go here again . if you ca n't handle your appointments then do n't accept them ...	2366
0	note : review placed by my husband : place is a joke . work ethic is atrocious . i called to see if they could fit me in for a simple beard trim . they said `` sure come by . '' i showed up at 6:15 and their doors were locked when they advertise on their door they are open until 7:00 . there were people in there and the barber just looked at me . they are obviously doing so well they do n't need my business .	3469
0	pit bull owners : they will claim your dog is aggressive even when their own videos show no proof of it . they will blame your dog for any sort of incident even when their own videos show your dog is not the aggressor .	3745
1	big portions for the price and they do give military discount and they have locations everywhere except southern california	1365
0	i 've been a client for several years and had great service when in the office- but they have terrible communication ! i have called ( spoken with a receptionist ) , then went into the office with the same unanswered question , and finally emailed and still no one has gotten back to me ! very disappointing ! i will take my business elsewhere .	2107
0	i really like this place and have been there to many times to count but quite frankly last night me and a person i 've been telling about this placed stepped in to have a drink and a bite to eat but left after the first drink . the customer service/unfriendlyness was very off putting being that i always get nothing but positive vibes from this place not sure if ill be back but hey we just headed over to joes midnight run and the experience was more enjoyable !	3562
1	nice room . updated . clean . i think i have an elephant staying above me but i 'm not sure anything can be done about that . dinner at the restaurant was good . would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again .	880
0	how can an ice cream shop be out of ice cream ? i went through the drive through , ordered two cones in two flavors ; pulled around as instructed , waited ... only to be be informed that they were `` out '' . as in out of ice cream . maybe they could have posted a sign or maybe told us at the ordering post ? we waited for fifteen minutes . this place is derpy .	3226
1	after all these years i still love pv mall . i 'm shocked the mcdonalds closed after all these years . clearly i have n't been here in a while . it brings back tons of memories from childhood . the remodel they did years back is nice and i like the furniture throughout the mall . the crowd looks clean cut and even the kids look like upstanding citizens . i 'd come back a lot if i lived closer to it .	2815
1	okay , so me and my fellow alcoholic friends were roaming mill ave on a satuday night looking for a place to have a great time . so we hiked up the stairs , were let in for no cover ( surprise , surprise ) and we found only about 6 other people where in there . the bartender was awesome and extremely skilled . the drinks were two for one , hooray . it has a cool view of mill ave as well . great music , packed with people , and cheap drinks . can not go wrong with that ! fun .	2765
0	their food is not good because it 's salty . they also do n't give free refills . i do not like it here .	571
0	i download the seat boost app & it 's `` unavailable '' literally such a joke ! ! ! i 'll spend the amount of upgrade on food & alcohol easily , so thought it 'd be great for me ... . even after making the flight team aware , they offered no solution and replied with , `` oh , really wow . that 's horrible '' i just ca n't even deal ! ! ! i do n't like the new virgin . delayed flights , mediocre customer service and non-working apps ! ! !	1623
1	wished i would have remembered the gentlemen name who checked us in on wednesday night about 7:45 3/16 he was amazing and helped us get into our vehicle quickly and with ease avis is a great car rental company and has a great team and a large selection of vehicles to choose from . you can not go wrong here	3129
0	i drive a tow truck so parking is not easy here in the city , that being said i parked out of the way to come in to this best buy location to buy a dash mount phone holder shortly after my purches i get a call from my dispatcher saying that she got a call from this best buy location abjecting to my parking , again i apologize to being a tow truck but do you really treat your customers in such fashion ? would you treat some one with a r.v . or motor home this way as well ? help me under stand . no thank you i wont be returning to this location any further .	3192
1	this review is for abbie in the salon . she did a great job on my blonde highlights and gave me a perfect cut , she was quick and precise and a true expert . after a few recent not so great experiences elsewhere , i 'm happy to have found her !	2479
1	i went back and tried again . all the food in the freezer was fresh with 6+ month expiration dates . bought a big bag and my doggy loves it . what my doggy loves , i also love .	2174
1	cool place to hang out if you want to get away from the crazy & loud party scene . very relaxing	2513
0	when you dine in , and order something that 's typically served hot , well , you know , you expect it to be hot when it 's set in front of you . i ordered the beef ravioli with marinara . part of the entree was luke-warm . the rest was cold . the sauce was more than a little watery . why bother going back with food this mediocre ?	1519
0	steve is a crook . he took my entire $ 1200 deposit for 4 stains on the carpet . he had the place rented before the inspection even happened . do n't trust him with a big deposit . avoid renting from biltmore property management . check steve out online , he 's got a history of some really shady stuff . you have been warned	3723
0	worst service in town . bought certificate at restaurant.com and was told that we could n't use it since they do n't honor the certificate anymore . i have to get my $ back from them . have n't tried their food and i will not come here again	1497
1	get the rendang beef and definitely the pandan crepe for dessert	1425
1	stumbled here because i was in the area originally but find myself going there regularly because of the quality and the service . i 've had different nail techs each time for both manicures and pedicures and have had a really great experience each time . i find them taking their time and being very thorough which i really appreciate . while they are pricey , i go back for the quality . a lot of color options and it 's nicely furnished .	2127
0	dh & i have eaten at marigold several times before and we normally order the same thing matter paneer and butter chicken . this time we ordered our usual and the butter chicken was yellow , whereas in the past it has been orange . the flavors were not the same as it has been in past , the chicken was also over cooked and very dry . we will not be eating at marigold again .	640
0	expensive and they do n't give you much . none of the food taste as good as they price themselves on . i guess it used to be the best in toronto but then they just rode that to long	1172
0	beautiful restaurant set in a beautiful backdrop , but unfortunately the service was pretty bad tonight . not sure if the server was overwhelmed or what , but it took him over 15 minutes to come take our initial drink orders , and then they were wrong . it just went downhill from there . the food was delicious , it 's just a shame that they did n't have more staff on for one of the busiest nights of the week .	751
1	love dr. alber ! we have been coming here for many years and always appreciate how thorough he is and how he spends a lot of time answering all of our questions and is so caring ! ! benny loves him : )	939
1	this place is dangerous . it 's very good and in no way healthy . chicken strips , fries , mac and cheese , and jalapeño poppers were amazing . the sweet tea was perfect as well . my absolute favorite was the ghost sauce and jalapeño ranch . some of the best sauce i have ever had . we will be back , but only on cheat days .	862
1	great ! clean , spacious rooms , comfy beds , nice bathrooms , upgraded features , friendly staff , decent ( pay ) breakfast ! we scored this place via a mystery hotel through expedia or travelocity or something - so the price was right . only downside - location was n't really ideal for us . overall , nice place and a place we 'd consider again in the future .	952
1	when i enter a 99 cent store , i usually have one or two items i 'm specifically looking for and i almost leave with a cart full of stuff . luckily , since it 's only a dollar each i do n't hurt the pocketbook too much . this location is pretty well-maintained and organized . they are also well-stocked for a browser like myself . the parking lot is usually pretty awful , so i tend to avoid this location for that reason alone , but otherwise it 's a great store to peruse inexpensive items for sale .	3423
1	best airline ever ! period . no one can touch them . flying will never be the same . their customer service is above and beyond what one would expect from an airline not to mention it does n't feel like you 're flying when you are on board . the seats are comfy , plenty of legroom , individual entertainment systems and if you are lucky you can score a free upgrade to main cabin select or first class . i highly recommend main cabin select to take advantage of more legroom and free food/drinks !	1623
1	great service and great pedicure . would recommend over other pedicure spas at cocker .	3652
0	ok so my problem is not with the dentist . no my issue is with the idiot nurses who have no clue how to work with children . the attitude and the negative vibes these two douches put off made my kids uncomfortable and made them cry . then these two douches look at me like it 's the children 's fault . avoid this place it may be new and flashy but terrible service	1304
1	good 'ole b dubs . this place will be kicking over spring training . built right across from and old hooters , the location , food , and service are better . i recommend the spicy garlic bone in with blue cheese , but that 's just me . great place to watch any sporting event . plenty of beers on tap for the beer snob in you life . service can be flawed at times but the staff is empowered to correct any issues . i 'll be back ... again and again and again ...	383
0	worst service ever ! we waited forever to get somebody to take orders from us . and that 's right after we told them that we are ready to order ! wrong drinks served as well . the waitress is just not in the mood of working !	341
0	worst return policy i 've ever seen . i was aware when i purchased that they only do store credit for returns ( no refund ever ) , but was not aware the time period is only 14 days . i 've never seen a return policy less than 30 days . kind of am indication of how they feel about their own merchandise in my opinion . i have shopped there for special occasions but will never return .	3205
0	this location is not the greatest to go , as the parking lot is very small , and waiting time can be up to half hour as the parking attendant is busy helping patrons reverse or exit the lot . the sales associates were not helpful and knowledgable , basically teenager or students as the staff . i found the jacket myself and bought the canada goose jacket . the jacket came up to $ 956 with taxes . my dad liked the jacket so much , that he bought one also but from the sherway gardens mall , the sportjng life inside . staff were very great and knowledgable and explained all other brands including the pros and con of each brand .	2743
0	horrible ! ! ! the location is very strange , tucked away in the corner of a shopping mall that nothing is near . half ass sign , the only reason i knew i had the correct location was all the cars outside . i have never seen more security at any other show ! these people search you top to bottom and even have a metal detector wand ! the only thing that was nice was the sound . the mixed drinks were nasty and i have never sweated so much ! they have no air conditioning ! i hate this place !	17
1	awesome guys here at bmw motorcycle lv . 1st time getting my bike serviced by them and i got to enjoy an r1200rt during this time . it 's a very comfortable and sporty tourer . the auto windshield is magic on the freeway .	94
0	i love this place , the rooftop beergarden has a great atmosphere . but the last time i was here , our server gave herself her own tip and refused to split our bills because her shift was finishing . that 's greedy and lazy and just not good service .	1583
0	this place is supposed to be open 24 hours correcct ? well i barely can get in the door good and i was told that they were closed ! what do you mean closed ? so did n't get me any breakfast this morning and allotted for that time to stop and get some there and did n't have time to go another place . i went to another one by my house yesterday and they told me they were closed also ! what gives ? what kind of 24 hour place closes in the morning for whatever reason ? very extremely disappointed ! ! ! !	322
0	lots of ice and little coffee . their prices keep going up but you get less and less coffee .	1131
0	sales process was easy but after the sale is where things went bad for me . we had an agreement for some repairs as part of the sale but the salesperson would not respond to my calls for three months ! fortunately , the sales manager did respond to me and we finally had the issues resolved . the service department is very friendly , efficient , great hours , comfortable waiting area which is nice . if you are going to buy , i strongly recommend that you do not work with steven `` coach '' .	525
1	this is the best shopping experience i 've had for anything . does joe have a brother ? who sells shoes ?	2125
1	laseraway is amazing ! as a woman with permanently tanned skin , i was ecstatic to find a laser place that knows what they are doing ! i have had amazing results ! ! ! the only reason this is not a 5 star review is that at times the technicians rush through the treatments without marking the area and spots are missed . other than that , they are great !	582
0	the building was hot and uncomfortable and the staff was less than hospitable . i would suggest you skip this place .	1072
1	this place is always great..great service , best pizza bartender behind the bar always a happy guy , tons of sports talk..n good times..i would call this the best pizza place in town ... .	192
1	stayed on the 31st floor here , the elevator went up and down quite quick . was much quicker than the elevator at excalibur . the room was perfectly fine , no complaints . very easy to get out of the casino and onto fremont street , quite convenient to catch the double decker to the strip . there 's nothing i can really fault them on . it 's not the strip , but if you are n't looking for that experience , this hotel is great .	2500
0	if you 're somebody who 's working on their anger and you are a violent person do not use them you will want to strangle everybody involved they are pos	2010
1	today i had two very nice women come to clean . my house was in need of some deep cleaning . they worked hard the entire time they were here . we turned on music and i could hear them singing to their favorite songs . it was cheerful . it was a nice feeling to have my house getting a thorough scrubbing while i could focus on other things . i will use them again . i hope to request the two same ladies . i would recommend their services .	3647
1	overall very good . was given vw passat as full size which was nice surprise . front desk and attendants friendly and helpful . only complaint missed damage on vehicle that i had to point out . ( not sure if i would have been charged for if i was n't vigilant about checking and vehicle ) only had 3/4 tank fuel and contract said it was full . i returned full just to avoid any hassle . i would recommend but check car and fuel .	1660
1	first time eating here . was really pleased . first place i 've eaten where the food actually looks better than the picture	1365
1	it 's a older facility but the machines are clean and a very fair price . the alterations are done very nicely and i 'm doing some zipper replacing for $ 8 which has been the best price around the area . it 's conveniently located next to a hair cut place and a mini mart .	2722
0	i called on 11/2 and made 3 appointments for massage as we were traveling into town . we showed up at 220 realizing we were early and expecting to wait . the owner said they did n't have my reservation . so disappointed and frustrating .	2692
0	the owner has since this review sent an email with an apology and asking me to return and try the restaurant again . i will , at a future time , re-review this restaurant under my usual caveats - they will not know when i am coming , i do not identify myself , and good or bad it gets reviewed so that it is honest .	1419
1	just placed an order through the jamba app ... i love the convenience of the app & ordering pick up !	1804
1	i 've been taking my vehicles to scott repman since 1994 , so when i heard he had moved here , i had to bring my 2016 tacoma in for weird delay issues and clunking in the transmission . scott let me know that this was normal behavior for this new model of transmission , and rotated my tires for free ! same great service i 've been given for the last 23 years now !	2605
1	at my favorite nail salon getting pampered by miss kim and sipping wine . the owner is always welcoming and his staff is always friendly and very helpful . i have a never had a bad experience .	786
0	typical mall pizza the pizza was lacking flavor boring . garlic knots rock hard very disappointing .	1371
1	the workers here were super friendly . the food is on par with any other jamba juice . the place was clean , employees were super nice , kept me company during an incredibly short wait ( could have been because it was midday friday and raining ) and even gave me a sweet coupon for next time .	2095
0	small simple train station . no red caps to help customers is a big downer . traffic getting out is horrendous also .	3601
0	the bingsu was good , but we had to wait for 30 minutes to get it after we paid . avoid this place for now , they seem to be working out the glitches to their ordering system .	1182
0	placed a togo order and still waited 45 mins to get one sub . absolute waste of time and money . i hope they replace the people who do n't know what they are doing . until then i 'd rather have subway . a complete let down . so disappointed with this experience and i frequent here at least once a week . so long firehouse .	517
1	come here quite often . great prices on food , drinks and amazing service . wing wednesdays are my personal favorite !	2505
1	this place is the best mexican fast food there is . move over filibertos , amados is the place to go . staff is so nice , the food is outstanding !	763
1	i just discovered this place and i 'm honestly embarrassed to say it took 4.5 years for me to find this place ! this place has $ 18 4l pitchers ( of keith 's ! ! ! ) and some tables with a tap built right into allowing you to serve yourself beer at a cheap $ 0.20/ounce ( that 's $ 2.40/pint ! ! ! ) . i ca n't really talk about the food at all here , but it 's definitely the cheapest place to drink in montreal that i 've found yet ... the savings in beer more than make up the cost of the taxi at the end of the night : )	574
0	food was okay , service was really slow , and selection was very poor . they were out of many things which i would think would be standard items . overall , it was okay for the area , but i will not personally eat here again .	1385
1	service and atmosphere is good . prices are a bit steep but the food is good .	1094
0	if you like waiting 10 minutes to order , never being able to get what you wanted , and getting inconsistent portions this is the place for you . the food it good but the service is just awful . i just walked out because they did not have rice of any kind . will not return to this location	1075
1	let me start off by saying that my favorite sushi place in henderson is osaka 's but since this place is closer i go there often . i really enjoy the rolls and their service has always been perfect . the food is always super fresh & delicious .	408
0	tried sakana for the first time and was not impressed . service , food and menu was average at best . rolls were nothing special and something you can get virtually anywhere . if you live near this location , i suppose it 's a valid sushi option , but if you do n't , it 's not worth an extended drive to eat there . will not be back .	198
1	shopped there yesterday and ca n't say enough wonderful things about them . they are there to answer all questions but do n't hover over you like some stores , that 's why i 'm a repeat customer !	439
1	maid brigade in gilbert made my life so much easier . they were extremely professional , arrived on time , and worked around my time constrictions . my mother and i arranged for a `` deep clean '' for my sister who just delivered her first child . through out the process they were much better than other experiences i 've had with cleaning services . they even tried to be as quiet as possible so they did n't disturb the newborn . although we 've only used the services once , i would highly recommend the gilbert team . i read reviews on kudzu to find them , but i wanted to give my fellow yelpers a heads-up !	2798
0	get to the front of the line only to be told . by susan that she is now closed and i need to get in the other line . she failed to give the person before me his ticket she was in such a rush to go on break .	2450
0	we came in to relax and enjoy an ice cream and first of all it was sooooo disgustingly hot that we could hardly stand it . we were told that the a/c was broken now for two weeks ! on top of that the employees were loud and using profanity ! we could not even carry on a conversation . they even yelled at times . where are the adults ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! very dissatisfied !	2616
0	the car washing service itself is pretty decent , but just having to deal with the pressure from the salesman to purchase the more expensive options ruins the experience . also , avoid having anything to do with the windshield repair portion of this business . they will say you need a new windshield no matter . and they really hassle you about it the whole time . the whole situation felt very dishonest and i have a hard time trusting that they have my best interests in mind . my advice , go somewhere else .	3899
1	i have been to dr e. hanna to get all my dental needs in the past 10 year . friendly staff , and dr. emad hanna is the only dentist who gives anesthetic in your mouth that you do n't feel pain at all ! i would recommend everyone who 's looking for a good dentist and he 's the one .	3800
0	only one star again i go for a car wash and the windshield vultures come out to try to sell me a windshield when all i have is a small chip . a to the guy that dried my car yes you only got one dollar because you did n't even dry off the mirrors .	3899
1	bagels were awesome ! and they keep extremely well in the freezer , but i use real , heavy duty freezer bags . store smells amazing too ! did n't try their food items , but i imagine that they 'd be great too . their cream cheese is excellent too . however , it certainly does not keep long . i had to throw mine out two thirds full . so be wary of that .	995
1	this is by far my favorite chinese restaurant in the valley . i am not a particular fan of egg rolls , but theirs are certainly the best i have ever had . their lunch specials are great and you can get out of there for under 7 dollars during lunch . the only thing that could be better is the location , but to be quite honest i would rather it be where its at with the current prices .	1264
0	waited too long to get a seat . waited too long before someone would take my order . i requested a specific bowl of ramen from the menu , but they said it was n't available . i told them that i do n't eat seafood , but beef and pork were okay . i requested a suggestion . i ordered what they suggested . when the bowl arrived , it had seafood in it ( shrimp ) . she offered to bring me a new bowl , but i did n't want to wait another hour for another bowl . they were too busy to refill my water . they are understaffed or poorly managed . regardless , i 'm not going back .	930
0	ridiculous lines and ridiculous prices . waiting 30+ minutes for coffee with 4 people on staff is n't what i expected . management should add another barista so that one person does n't do the drinks alone . should 've gone to that chocolate store downstairs for coffee instead .	2841
0	the most uneven museum i 've ever visited . there are some nice pieces , but the determination on layout , grouping . lighting , and flow is not good . every room , aside from the vaguely asian area , and the purple room , are just bright white messes . there no vibe or real comfort in the displays or the inside of the building , as a whole . we did n't sneak over to the natural history half , but the art museum portion did n't do much for us . it 's also a bit pricey in the museum realm , at $ 17.50 a head .	101
0	this is the worst tanning salon in vegas , it 's very dirty , the very young girls at the front desk are rude , unhelpful , and gossip behind your back , as soon as a customer leaves the store if your up front they will talk so badly about that customer its sickening . if you try to contact the owner , you will be given false promises and a very fake uncaring response . there are plenty of places to go , my recommendation is that 5his is the one to stay far away from !	2714
0	if i could give 0 stars i would cuz this place does n't even deserve 1 star . was in today and saw the customer service . absolutely terrible . a customer in front of me got yelled at by a staff member for no reason . never going back . french grocery that 's unprofessional and never the way to treat a customer !	1160
1	great service great tacos ... monica the manager outstanding . ..we love her ... she is a great element thank you very muchas gracias ! ! ! !	857
1	outstanding customer service . whatever you need , they will make it happen . it was so nice to talk to a real person , and the same person while handling my request . thanks to paul grzenia for making me feel like a priority customer the whole time .	978
1	my review is based off of the incredible experience we had at the mooresville location ( same owner for the food ) , ghostface brewery and pizza . the pizza is one of a kind craft pizza , and absolutely delicious . we 've had 3 different pizza so far , and it 's always a hard decision on which one to try next . met the owner and his family too ... great people who really care about making you happy . for anybody in the davidson area , this place is just a few streets off main street , and worth the short detour !	87
0	pathetic dealership . went in to buy a equinox . after 2 weeks of back and forth , they played games with the pricing and kept switching models and configuration , i eventually walked away . the so called sales manager did n't want to deal over the phone and always insisted that i go into the store . they had no respect for my time . i found them unresponsive and dishonest . in the end i got straight forward , simple service from the gm dealer in richmond hill .	787
1	this meal was very good . their garlic fries were the perfect combination garlic and parmesan cheese . nothing was overpowering just good . the calamari was a bit thin , but the breading and dipping sauce was spot on . i had the honolulu pizza which was piled high with pineapple , ham , and green onions . it was the best pizza i have had in a while .	192
0	god i so wish i liked this place . the inside is super clean , it 's right off the light rail and minority owned . we went for breakfast and i had scrambled eggs , sausage , hash browns and pancakes . the pancakes were just okay , the menu said `` maple syrup '' and it totally was n't real ) . the sausage was red and i did n't like it . the hash browns were not pre-soaked , tough and not good in the least bit . even denny 's is better than this . bummer .	158
0	cant leave a 0 star review but its shameful that any schools in clark county allow this scam of an operation to continue fleecing families to rent graduation gowns for $ 70 . have a problem ? good luck . phone calls go to voice mail and emails go unanswered . claimed sons gown was n't paid for , after being shown confirmation email and order # inept employee still refused to provide son with his gown . gave him a stained loaner . tried calling contact # and sent emails , no reply . would advise avoiding altogether but since they have it on lock , enjoy !	3848
0	by far the worse dining experience i 've ever had . slow service with a 45 min wait for our food that was terrible ! ! ! ! if your thinking of saving money by going there to eat before the game do n't !	839
0	unable to get their over the air signal . so why is the fcc allowing them the frequency ? i am in process of ditching the dish and it would be awesome if this stupid channel came in the old fashioned way . i bet their advertisers assume people are getting their old signal . paying dearly for it i bet . hope they read this review .	1870
1	i had rt shoulder surgery from dr tyler collins and could not be happier with how the post op tx/pt is going . i never had a an issue with wait times and or insurance . very professional - everyone from assistants to billing has been helpful ... .	2896
1	i walked right in staff was super friendly . i believe the women who saw me was wy and she was so amazing and made the whole process as painless as possible . she also informed me that they recently had let go of some associates that were n't to friendly to patients . so , if you had a bad experience previously maybe you should give this place another shot . if you need any lab testing keep this place in mind very professional and calm environment .	2587
1	my wife and i found a beautiful couch for 399 $ had it delivered in 2 days . i think we found a steal because they do have a lot of pricey furniture . staff was really nice . we went in yesterday looking for a cheap coffee table and everything there was way out of our price range . didnt want to spend 300 and up on a coffee table . im giving it a 4 because the couch we got really lucky on and their protection plan is like 60 $ and they will replace your couch if you suffer from damage	1640
0	oh well , i did n't even have a chance to taste anything in this store , because when i stepped into the shop ; it seems like i was invisible , no one serve me even though i was standing in front of the cakes for a while . and the prices for the cakes are quite expensive too ( very small size ) and not much choices left . with this kind of service , i just walked away from this shop and i do n't know if i will go again or not .	1217
0	if it were n't for my groupon i 'd give it a 1 star . i 'd rather come here and spend my money on the macaroons and would n't waste it on afternoon tea even if it 's a groupon . lack of customer service . waitress inattentive , most of the pastries or baked goods were dry . i 'd rate the scarborough location higher , 3/5 for the variety of scones and pasties tasted better as well	1217
0	not for me . not really health food , not really organic , not really healthy , really expensive and pretentious . nice paper bags , but that is scant solace . the abercrombie of grocery stores .	3271
0	all i have to say is that this place is a scam at the end of your stay ! i will totally have to agree with the last review ! my bf and i stayed for a short term lease and it was decent , but for what we were paying was not even worth it . we had the same thing happen to us when we left . they charged us $ 120 for clean up fees and when they did the walk thru the woman said everything looked fine . a month later we get a phone call from a collections agency saying that we owe the $ 120 ! ! will never refer this place to anyone !	3458
1	very nice , clean range . i think the staff is friendly and not arrogant as some of the reviews state . the one con i have is the lane rental prices . it cost me over $ 30 this past sunday to shoot my new pistol and i had my own eyes , ears , targets and ammo !	3936
0	lots of tv 's so that 's good . got the fish and chips with slaw and it was so bad . fish was overfried and zero flavor . fries were overfried . slaw was flavorless and browned like it 's been in the fridge for a few days . i tried adding tons of lemon and malt vinegar to save the fish and it did n't work .	717

0	very rude person who works here . i asked for assistance and the lady was helping me , then a woman who was browsing left the store and then she said to me `` see , i lost a sale because of you '' . no one should ever be treated this way .	1621
1	went to get an oil change yesterday and all went well . damien was very helpful , gave me some great recommendations on future services i need on my car nothing stupid and unnecessary . it was n't crowded i was in and out in about 30 minutes . very convenient	1778
1	this is so good i had to stop in the middle of the meal just to write this review . food is awesome !	1566
1	i was referred by a coworker to go to network automotive to get my car serviced on and i have no regrets . i not only bring my personal vehicle there , but i bring my company vehicle there , too .	469
0	only because there is nothing less than one star . only salesperson was on a personal call , ignored me . then when i asked a question she gave me attitude . will not return ever ! what happened to the friendly staff that used to work here .	2547
1	a fast and efficient manicure - every time i went i walked out satisfied . the highlight for me though is the massage that i got - if you pay a bit more ( $ 15 i think ) you get a fantastic neck and shoulder massage on the chair in the back . highly recommend that for a quick relaxation and get away !	2148
0	rather than be catty , i 'll just keep my mouth shut and let the number of stars speak for themselves . and please : josh or christopher or someone that goes here a lot , take a pic of the building and have yelp take down that char 's sign as the business sign .	3252
0	they are trying not to honor our 10 year warranty on our windows . they sent out a postcard saying that all warranties would be honored . wish that was true !	3881
1	popeye is always one of my fav . liked the mild chicken sandwich and some chicken pieces	523
0	do not book with them ! i saw for the last 12 hours that they had up this super deal for flights to europe . i tried to book the same flight about 10 times every time with message that the price had changed , and gone up by $ 900 per ticket ! ! so , i called flight network and they said the original ticket had sold out . this surprises me as there were multiple tickets posted at this discounted fair and they were posted online for more than 12 hours . that 's totally unacceptable and false advertisement . i would never recommend them to anyone .	1574
0	ambiance was neat but drinks were watered down and service was n't great . cool to visit for the novelty but not worth repeat visits .	292
1	my favorite mexican raspado place ! there service is alright could be better but the food is amazing highly recommend going it 's better than any other raspados	1065
0	i been a standing costumer for many yrs .recently it has changed management however this time like i felt i got taken advantage of.never paid 170 $ for a oil change when everyone else charges 120 $ for synthetic up too 15 quarts . royal the management beg to differ when i protested why would i pay that when i can go down the street and pay 120 $ ..very disappointed its the last time i go thier my 2 freinds had the same experience ... so disappointed..	3456
0	i 've been here a few times . staff is always nice and order comes out correctly and quickly . but i went there tonight and it was a car meet or something going on . all the spots were taken and there were even cars parked randomly everywhere . people crowding the whole area . do n't understand why sonic allows that . unprofessional and considered loitering .	994
1	the decor and atmosphere will keep me coming back to maman , but the dry hard blueberry lavender loaf wo n't be see me again .	207
0	my head was chemically burned and treatment was not fully washed out i went to er where i was given meds and hair washed . i went back showed him photos her denied it all and no refund after all that and he did a gabi job on my hair i lost 6 inches more than i wanted . he thought i would n't notice	1117
1	mitch was very nice , signed us up for reward program to save $ 4 on tickets yesterday . also got our parking validated and gave us recommendation to nearby restaurant for dinner . lines were very long , probably need more employees selling tickets or something . ryan was helpful in getting our seats switched so we did n't have to be by noisy guests who stayed on their phones throughout previews . recliners were awesome , but arm rests had pretty bad wear and tear down to the foam padding underneath . probably will come back because tickets are so cheap , just wo n't buy any concessions $ $ $ .	3063
0	i used to come often because i liked the food . it was conveniently located and was the most decent thai food in charlotte . but i came in today for lunch with my husband and we were standing at the front waiting to be greeted . three different staff looked at us and kept walking . i can understand them not being able to seat us if they were busy , but to not even acknowledge our existence is just bad business practice . i will not be back . they just lost a customer .	895
0	absolutely the worst customer service . almost every experience is negative . unhelpful , unfriendly and rude	433
0	i 've been mistreated and even kicked out of some places . i 've never experienced anything just like this . these jerks are rude . not sure what i did to get my check thrown at me but i did . then this cocky barback tender says i ca n't put my purse in the seat next to me . this bar is empty . i do n't think i 'm causing anyone to miss a spot . i mean from the time i walked into this place they have been unbelievable . writing this post to make myself look occupied as i sit here and finish this half azz moscow mule .	1400
1	in pittsburgh for my son 's graduation , i drove over a pot hole and got a flat tire on my rental car . i walked into pep boys the next morning and got great service- they were professional , friendly , helped me figure out the cheapest way to replace the tire and the hub cap . it 's great that they 're open on sundays for emergencies like this one . the price to fix the tire was very reasonable and the mechanics who did the work were excellent ( they figured out how to fix the rim , which was slightly bent ) i 'll go back to pep boys anytime- they really helped me out .	3020
0	blue haired cashier lady needs to be fired . she has a horrible attitude she refused service cuz my dad threw money at her apparently . she was negative the whole time . argued with me about that situation she 's not a good person for customer service . manager was amazing but the blue haired lady was rude and needs to be fired	2291
0	joanna is a great place to come if you enjoy waiting for an hour to get a yard of fabric cut . honestly i was number 28 in line .	1937
1	awesome prices & alex is amazing ! we considered all the major competitors & none of them could compare to the low prices lumber liquidators offers and they have the best selection . check them out , & ask for alex .	2763
0	got my eyebrows waxed here . the lady did a good job with shaping , i was very happy that she listen to my request to keep the brows full - i 've had experiences where i left with super thin ones . however , a day later , i started breaking out a bunch all around one of my eyebrows , probably because of the waxing . i may try the nails here one day , but i wo n't go back for waxing because the pimples lasted a few days .	2148
1	a 14-year-old vehicle needs a lot of tender loving care . and that 's exactly what i get at pep boys . jared , greg and nathan had my new starter installed with in a few hours . and best of all there was no charge . it was covered under a warranty . thanks again guys .	2960
1	i really like this pub . great specials every night . i love the burgers , platters , and most everything on the menu .	2505
0	the last two times i had a gel/shellac manicure done here , i was lucky if it lasted 1 week . the polish was applied above my cuticles , so as my nails grew out the polish was lifting up at the cuticle area . the staff needs to be trained on how to polish nails using the gel/shellac polish so that it lasts at least 2 weeks .	43
1	i got a dress from vera wang a few weeks ago ... had such a wonderful experience . i brought my future sister-in-law to look for a wedding dress for herself and she found one ! ! she was apprehensive at first as she wears plus size , but they had such great selection in bigger sizes . allanna and ronda , the lovely ladies who helped us , made us feel so welcome ... great service ! ! what 's best is that we 're both wearing vera wang on our special days . thanks again vwtoronto !	1155
1	my girlfriend and i went in last week.. we both ended up getting new glasses , they are very nice and helpful , and have the coolest glasses around . i highly recommend checking sassy glasses out .	3501
0	went there during a college football game and the place ran out of wings ... . what bar runs out of wings on college game day ! ! ! ben 3 different bars in 6 years . another shot hole	3336
0	i called 15 minutes after appt . i have record of it on my phone . and like i told you , i understand the policy , you had me sign a paper at first meeting . i gave you a free session by forgoing the second , so how is that right ? i forgo a session so you do n't have to honor your session . this is not good customer service ! perhaps being a small business owner , you could have been a little more lenient ... as those policies are usually enforced by big companies . just my two cents .	749
0	1 hour and 25 minutes for 7 dim sum.. a complete disaster today . can not even enjoy the food when it takes so long	338
0	worst place to get your eyebrows done ! they do n't care about their customers what so ever . my friend and i walked in and signed in and the lady did n't even acknowledge us because she was too busy clipping her nails . we ended up leaving and she could have cared less . do n't waste your time going here .	2986
0	lunch demo was good , however the participants were all over 80 & boring . they must have filled the class with the local old folks home . made for a stiff & uncomfortable setting . maybe suggest age guidines for events . including teens or 8-12 year olds would make for more fun than having the ancients .	2612
1	came here today for national crepe day to receive my free nutella crepe ! it 's in the biltmore fashion square so you 'll have to park and ask for validation at the cafe to circumvent the charges you would otherwise receive for parking . also , the shop is inside of the complex , not along the parking area . the nutella crepe was good and pretty large for their `` small '' , i felt sated after only one ! the employees were very friendly and the cafe is gorgeous , white marble throughout ! right outside of the cafe is a large chess game , the pieces are about 2-3 ft tall , really neat .	1011
0	horrible horrible horrible went 6 times for tattoo removal and it looks horrible went somewhere else and got better results from one treatment then i did with 6 from here .	582
0	i give it cero to this i been visiting this location but today i wait to someone come to my table no one showed up a lot of employees lack of service even the manager pass and not even ask horrible never back again is a lot of other places where i can spend my money	520
0	worst experience ever no clue what products they had or did n't have kid at front counter was rude and condescending . it 's not my fault he had no idea what a pour over was . wo n't see my business again	2950
0	my siblings and i entered the area . it was really crowded and we did not see the 21+ signs . i was fine but a lady came in and grabbed my sibling 's arms and yanked them out of the area so rudely . she threw our chicken wings on them and lectured them for being `` stupid '' while calling me an `` idiot '' for taking them in there . we were kicked out in the middle of our dance dance revolution game .	2494
1	went in for a simple battery purchase and swap . prices were very reasonable . i was quoted 45-60 minutes for them to replace the battery . i drove away from the garage 14 minutes after i walked in the front door . it was a very pleasant experience and i appreciated the fact that they really hustled to take care of the replacement quickly . this was one of the best experiences i 've had getting any kind of service on my car .	959
1	did you know they are more than great coats ? this store had a lot of selection and variety . i found very cute clothes , coats , shoes , and housewares . i bought a coat and a blouse for work . very excited by the variety and ca n't wait to go back and browse .	2731
1	cool place to have a few drinks and dance . nothing too crazy because the dj never change the genre or want to take request . but after a few of their yummy strong drinks , you kind of just go with the flow and forget that the dj really sucks ! just go with a group of friends and you 'll enjoy your night .	3562
1	i honestly have 0 complaints . quiet community a spacious apartment upgraded decent appliances . the customer service in the office was good anytime i called for repairs they came within 24 hours probably one of the best apartments i 've lived , at thank you element .	1897
1	recent az transplant , so i dont know many people . a great casual hang out . joy hands down is one of the best , fun , and most personable bartenders ive encountered , which as a service industry vet , i dont hand out that kinda praise lightly . ..	3562
1	a standard issue game stop - small , nice , clean , good selection . the sales person was knowledgeable an pleasant , and they had both items we came in to buy . they sell most things at suggested retail price , but it 's nice because you can trade in games that you 're tired of . it 's definitely a small , spendy place , but for video game fans ( and their loved ones ) , it 's a haven : - )	426
1	you know that your at a resort when the water costs more than the coffee ; lol . had a business meeting at gvr yesterday and wanted a quick caffeine fix and a bottle of water . service was fast and friendly like all the cb & tl 's and the coffee was good as usual .	2118
1	people of montreal seem to love their rotisserie chicken so of course i made a stop at the most famous place to see what the fuss was all about . while certainly not photogenic at all , i know now why people are so crazy for this place . quite possibly the best rotisserie chicken i have ever had ! incredibly moist and seasoned perfectly with crispy skin , what more can you ask for from chicken ? ! so good that i went twice in my short trip as well . you can cancel getting the portugese tarts . they are nothing like the ones in lisbon , so do n't get excited .	1109
0	this store is turning into a pawn shop ! not happy ! too much clutter ! why ?	3504
1	penhollows always has a neat selection of tempting things . they seem to cater to a variety of budgets and styles , so i find it difficult not to find great gifts here . it 's also not an overwhelmingly large store ; they 're all about quality , not quantity . i ca n't stand sifting through a bunch of crap to find a gift , so in this way penhollows and i are right for each other . i have no experience with their interior design service but i imagine from the items in the store that they have excellent taste and can adapt to a variety of customers !	3224
1	fantastic customer service . smiling happy employees . i called this dunkin location after being told at another dunkin store that i could not purchase 3 dozen bagels . the first store had more than three dozen on display . i call this location , i ordered 4 dozen donuts , three dozen bagels , no problem . i arrived , my order was boxed , bagged and ready for me . i paid and was on my way . thank you to this store for a positive experience . i 'll be back to this store but not the first one .	3226
0	hot or miss food today got my order wrong and barely got any food so that always cool	1342
1	my battery died and had purchased at pep boys and forgot the receipt ! tried looking up but could n't find but gene was so nice he actually believed me ! that is rare ... he put new battery in car and said there you are ... no charge ... he prorated to date i told him purchased and am good for couple years ! thanks gene , you know what customer service is ... when i need tires or brakes pep boys is where i 'm going	959
0	arrived friday march 10 around 8 pm was fairly busy got seated and forgotten . found menu selection not vegan friendly after waiting about 20 minutes no further contact from waitress for drinks although she did look at us but never got drinks served . mark this place for drinks only although happy hour value better across the street .	1546
1	awesome place to take your child for his or her first hair cut . the guy who cut my 1 yr olds hair was great with kids . they have cute seats for the kids to sit in and play disney movies to keep them occupied .	260
1	great service , tasty ice cream , nice place to come by with some friends and order some ice cream rolls and try something new . they also sell fruit smoothies and have a selection of drinks .	1073
0	terrible . every single person in line was pissed and complaining . since this is chipotle style service , why not finish up one order before jumping to the next ? the girl was so rude when another customer told her to remake the quessadilla that had been sitting there cold for 15min already . not to mention , it was burned . our food took forever and she rushed through the order . it too was cold when we actually sat down to eat . the tortilla was already soggy . and damn the steak was nasty . chewy , beef jerk like meat that had more fat and tendons than anything .	1071
0	went in with my friend and her brother . we tried about 3 flavors each and did not like any of them enough to purchase . we said thank you to the lady at the front and proceeded to leave . after leaving the store the owner confronted us and rudely accused us of coming in just to `` steal '' her yogurt . we went next door for ice cream instead . unacceptable customer service . smh .	1976
1	my 5yr old and 9yr old girls have their dentist appointment today for filling , and none of them got scared and did n't feel any pain.. my eldest got a shot of anesthesia but dr.reyes never showed it to her and all she knows is that it was just her long nails ( but not ) .. and my 5 yr old was called boss for doing a good job ... thank you american dental center for taking care of my family ...	3431
0	if you are a legal american citizen you may want to stay away from this home depot . the announcements and music are in spanish . apparently they do n't realize that to be successful and assimilate you need to speak the language . they are just greedy wanting the spanish speaking people 's money enabling them to not need to learn the language .	1398
0	had a good experience the first few times i came here . this time , all the friendly servers i met the first few times were gone . the food is decent but this time i give 1 star for having to listen to the racist despicable owner talking about his political views next to my table while i was trying to enjoy my dinner . when i go out for a nice dinner and i 'm spending a decent amount of money , i do n't need to here this hate filled moron talk about politics . i ca n't support a local business when the owner is a hate filled jerk . i 'll go to basil and garlic bistro up the street !	821
0	have n't done any reviews before but i felt obligated to warn everyone of this unsanitary resturaunt . the food was a bit cold but it was okay . i got home that evening and was extremely sick . i went to urgent care and they told me i had gotten food poising . i should have known not to try such a random little resturaunt . beware !	1402
0	thank you for responding to my previous 1star review pretending like you cared and then not responding to the email sent to you . i hope karma comes back to this business that uses false representation and face saving to rip customers off .	1950
0	this place has a sign that says they know how to do powder dip but they have no clue . i had to tell the lady what to do and she still did n't do it right . she did my nails super thin and one broke within two days , others started to chip but i was back home by then and so i went to my usual place and had them to soak them off and redo them . do n't go here for powder dip .	2121
1	friendly staff lots of merchandise cool shop thats been there 30 plus years . next time youre in vegas folks check it out	2927
0	i would go to any other theatre in town before this place . went last night . the ac was broken , the ice cream machine was broken , the concession stand was disgusting , and the place was just dirty .	3680
0	first of all , i could n't believe how i was treated on this store . i was just trying to return some products that i have from them and the person working there was so rude to me , so i asked the other employee who is the manager here and i could n't believe she was in fact manager on this store ! i will never come back to this store again very rude , very bad customer service .	2491
0	this place is a complete dump ! ! ! the service is terrible ... the place reeks of smoke ... prices are ridiculous ! get over yourself charlie 's .	3661
1	people can say what they want about pep boys , or mechanics in general but this particular pep boys has the most courteous and professional staff that i have ever met . brandon was at the counter and was very helpful , friendly , and proficient . cody was the mechanic that worked on my vehicle . they are both very professional in their mannerisms and the way they work . it 's very difficult to find an honest mechanic in las vegas and whenever i need to have work done on my wife 's or my vehicle , i will be going to this pep boys location . thanks again to brandon and cody .	2263
0	i made a reservation on thursday for a 6pm friday night on the patio , when we arrived they did not have our reservation . the manager came over and acted like i was not telling the truth about my reservation . he stated the patio was full and it would be a thirty minute wait . the managers attitude was very rude and we had out of town guests with us no way to run a business .	368
1	we were seated fast even with a group of 7+ baby . our server eddie was amazing . he took all out orders & accommodated us with out hesitation . he did n't need to write any orders down . everything came fast , correct , hot fresh . we really enjoyed our visit here !	520
1	editing my review after leaving my feedback of what was a frustrating experience . scott from coulter called to see how he could help to make it right . i can say he stuck to his word and helped my son close the deal on his first auto purchase . thanks for making this experience a better one , he was really starting to lose faith in car dealers . i do appreciate your help and putting him into a great car for a great price and giving him the most for his trade . i will send my family and friends your way .	394
1	love the donuts , super friendly staff . right outside the neighborhood , will definitely be returning .	3322
1	i love my facials with michelle . she does a truly amazing job . my face feels and looks amazing when she is done .	750
1	i have been a member since it 's opening and have always been pleased with the facilities , the classes , and the availability of equipment . sure , at times , the place is crowded ( especially the new year resolution people that show up for the first 2 months of each year ) , but never had a problem finding a free piece of equipment . the only negative i have is i would like to see them refresh their equipment more often . with the $ 30 annual maintenance fee , i think they could be doing more .	3262
1	great course ! ! ! ! love the mango comfort towels . played 18 in 4 hours ... . looking forward to playing this course soon.. great time ...	1138
0	poor customer service . we went there to adjust my sons glasses with intentions of becoming patients . while there my 3 year old had to use the restroom and the lady refused to allow my wife to take him . to make matters worse it was a terrible rain storm and she had to go outside in it to get to a restroom . vision works you lost not 1 patient but 3 .	909
1	i had an interaction with phx.police two nights ago .the officers where very kind patient & did every thing possible to help me complete my task . thank you officers .	2322
0	i get it , in las vegas , health care sucks . however , i 've been waiting two hours for my doctor . i was here early , did my paperwork , and have been sitting for two hours . this is unacceptable . why make appointments if you ca n't keep them ? i wo n't be keeping this doctor . when i asked what the hold up was , they said that they have a bunch of providers with few rooms and that 's just how it is .	3059
1	george goes out of his way to make insurance simple and the process easy . best agent i 've had !	727
0	the food was very slow to be served and the portions were so small , as compared to what we paid . it only took one time to understand that this is not a place to return .	1193
1	loved the breakfast options and want to try lunch sometime . classic diner feel with excellent twists , and amazing vegan-friendly options . i also had an old-fashioned cinnamon sugar donut ; almost as good as greenbush 's ( so that 's saying something ) . ca n't wait to come back !	975
1	yaos is good , everyday americanized chinese food . soup is good . mongolian beef , lettuce wraps , house noodles are all favorites . service is attentive & food comes out quickly .	237
1	i 've used these guys for several last minute floral needs , and they 've always come through . they 're really good about making sure that they create what you want and within the budget you give them . they also have a huge selection of gifts and goodies to throw together with the flowers to complete the gift giving extravaganza . my favorite part ? they called the day of my wedding to make sure i had n't chickened out ! and park in the gravel lot across the street , it 's easier to get in and out of .	3085
1	this place is open late and is very popular . there 's always a line up , however the wait time is n't that bad after 7 pm is 10 mins . the quality of food is good , the price is a bit high considering the service is quick bit all that attentive . i recommend this place it is a good alternative to the korean eatery that is practically next door on yonge st .	1290
0	do not stay here ! walls are super thin and you can hear people walking , sounds more like stomping , on the above floors . i am not high maintenance and do n't usually care where i stay . i think hotels or condos should be somewhat quiet .	3091
1	my husband and i stayed here monday for one night . i truly have no complaints . the front desk staff was very helpful . we had a king room which was very clean , spacious , and the bed very comfortable . i did not eat any of the breakfast bar the next morning , but did view it upon leaving , and the selection of scrambled eggs , potatoes , sausage , among other items had a very nice presentation . i would gladly stay at this location again .	3538
0	since the first time i came to get my car washed here , service has really gone down ... do n't know if i 'm just coming on off days , but i came in at about 8:15am on a saturday . it seemed like they were n't open yet ... yelp said they open at 7am ... maybe 3 employees were working ? i got $ 2 off early bird special . at about 8:30am . some guy walk up and they allowed him to help wash the cars ... hmmmm ... just seems like professionalism has taken a hit here at alamo ...	2359
0	this home warranty company has to be the worst around . not only is it a joke every time i call them - they find some way to let me know some actual problem happening is something they do n't cover . and on top of it , i get the same nasty person on the phone who has no customer service at all . i 'm looking for another company immediately to cover my 2 condos . anyone have great recommendations ? avoid this one at all costs . goodbye very soon , national home warranty .	3653
0	i did facial waxing . all hair was removed however i broke out all over my face . i was n't informed about what to do after a waxing , and it could have been prevented . i wish they took time to inform me .	2630
1	i have a good time here . i was kind of upset that my previous dentist left . i walked in one day for a medical visit and the whole office was different . i wish they would have sent an email or something letting me know . i like the new dr . he explains everything and i have not had any issues with him . the staff is really nice . i hate the dentist and they make it easier to be there , so i am thankful for them .	3163
0	the sandwiches were just like almost every other sub shop . the employees , with the exception of the cashier , were beyond obnoxious.i know some people appreciate being yelled `` hello ! '' to be eight or so people all at once , but by the time the third customer after us walked in the door , we were over it . the sandwiches were just ok , the atmosphere was really annoying . two stars .	1475
0	i wanted 10 once wheat grass , they charge d me 5 times 2 onces price instead of 8 extra one once . bad	2095
1	which-wich has a great sandwich selection and a very friendly staff . the ingredients always seem to be very fresh . i love coming for an early lunch to beat the lunch crowd as they open at 10:30am .	724
1	could n't of had a better experience at bistro 19 . the atmosphere was very nice and so was the service . the food was also delicious , filling , and creative . the only downfall is the price . if you choose bistro 19 know that it is higher end dining and therefore the prices will be high .	1171
0	it 's a korean bakery plus cafe where there 's a cute corner for customers to sit and enjoy the various offerings , it looks much nicer than the 2 chinese bakeries in the half mile radius , but the baked goods are not as good . at least not to me . i 'll admit i prefer chinese style bakery over korean style , there are more savory items available and the sweet ones are never too sweet . here at crown , they have at most one savory item . and most of the sweet ones are filled with red bean paste , therefore , overly sweet .	1108
1	it 's a pretty good clinic . they have low wait times and friendly doctors . there is a pharmacy in the grocery store beside it , so you can have your prescriptions filled quickly after seeing the doctor . remember to always have a valid ohip card when you see any doctor , anywhere in ontario . there should n't be poor ratings of the clinic because people forgot their id .	3362
0	my girlfriend and i wanted to have a play date here . we walked it and wanted to bounce but we were told that they did n't have open bounce at all and it was all reserved for birthday parties . i was super surprised but what was more disappointing is she did n't give us a schedule of when the next open bounce would be . not sure i would return with that customer service experience .	3267
0	i think their bbq is alright . definitely would n't come back for chinese bbq when there are so many better restaurants nearby ( within 5 minutes of driving ) . i just wanted to check it out since it opened for some time now . but the meat skewers did not impress . plus , it is also more expensive to eat here . so there is absolutely no reason why i would ever come back . now i 'm not saying it 's horrible . but there 's manyyy chinese bbq nearby . so what 's the incentive to come here ?	1359
1	home of the $ 2 dos ... .equis that is ... since this is the closest to my house ( and i 've been to the others ) i like coming here when i feel like an after work beer and an afternoon breeze . the bartenders here are always good to me ( which unfortunately , is more than i can say for the scottsdale crew , just seems to much of a clique up there ) . love the food , love the crowd here as well.i 'll miss you when i move chandler dos	704
1	my 14 year old daughter and i had a wonderful time here . jennifer was great with my daughter ... mani/pedi with designs . took her time and was very caring and thoughtful . nikki did my new , full set- pink and white . she did a fantastic job- uber impressed with the quality of work . very friendly and talkative . highly recommend !	3508
0	not men friendly . if you 're a guy who likes to take care of your feet this is not the place to come . they actually told me they do n't like to work on men . really ? last time i step foot in this place .	1429
1	always have a great visit , they great me right when i come in . the doc i saw was great and she saw my oldest daughter as well . thank you for always taking care of my family !	2625
0	7 days ago i went to this god-awful place and today my big toe is sore and infected . in all my years of having pedicures i 've been lucky enough to never get an infection . if you go here and you 're happy with your nail technician fine ; stay , but if you 're new and want to try this place ... ..do n't . unless you want horrible service . i 'm reporting this to the health department these people need to be inspected .	2929
0	- the service was awful . - they lost our reservation . +the food was good +the atmosphere was cool .	1091
0	why is 95 % of the used records here all trashed ? i mean , it 's almost like it 's intentional . this is the stuff you see in the $ 1 bins at other record stores .	3504
1	ate here for the first time earlier this weekend and have been craving their pho ever since ! we ordered gyoza , drunken noodles , and filet mignon pho . all of it was delicious ! we could n't finish the pho because the spice level was insane- i ordered a 3 ( 1 to 10 scale , we were warned that the 5 was spicy ) . the beef was good and tender , there were plenty of noodles , and despite clearing out my sinuses , the broth was sooooo good . like i said , i 'm craving it as i type this . we will definitely be back !	1203
1	thank you fil for helping me and my boyfriend with our new phones ! you were so helpful . we are excited to be apart of t-mobile !	1169
1	i had a good time here . it 's totally a young crowd -- you 'll probably get pushed and have a drink spilled on you , but that 's pretty typical at a tiny little club-like establishment . it is very loud , but there is a small outdoor patio to escape the nonsense . drinks = super cheap . like cheaper than water . the bartender was awesome and super entertaining !	2765
1	i had to get my driver side window replaced . my insurance recommended them . steve did a great job ! maybe took 45 minutes if that ! he cleaned all my windows but did n't vacuum like everyone says they do . there were a few pieces of glass left on the floor of the garage so that part im not happy about hence the 4 stars not 5 . overall the replacement window is perfect & i will recommend them to everyone . thank you !	2444
0	had a groupon for a weekend stay . when i tried to use it , the snotty little receptionist with an attitude said all the weekends were booked . `` upgrade or go call groupon . '' great customer service . this is a hospitality business . if i purchase something from a business and they ca n't accomodate , most businesses at least try to do something for you . `` upgrade or get lost . '' nice . i got my money back and i would never set foot on this property . there are other hotels in this location , look them up first .	3916
1	professional , honest and friendly . if you are looking for a place you can trust to get the job done then look no further than brake masters . don was very helpful and honest . i will definitely bring my vehicles back here in the future .	2485
1	recently started coming here to get my hair done by jennifer . she 's friendly and i love my haircut ! ! the atmosphere is friendly and laid back .	3017
0	walk-ins are not welcome , staff is rude . did n't even get a chance to speak with anyone about an appointment . the negative reviews ( few ) were pretty spot on .	2366
1	at 9 on a cold , rainy night , it was standing room only . it must say something about this rolled ice cream phenomenon . i could do without the people , but the whole process is fun from perusing the endless menu of options/add-ins to observing the creation to the best part ... eating ! for $ 7 , choose from a list of house creations , seasonal specials , or build your own . watch closely as the rolls take shape before your very eyes ! it does n't look like it will amount to much , but when all the rolls are transferred to da bowl , be glad that you can share 'em with someone !	3813
1	this place is the best ! ! quick and efficient great patient care . from the front desk to triage to providers ! ! !	2580
0	im seriously disappointed in this complex . i moved into 1 bedroom in december , and have ridiculous issues . maintenance takes days to respond , leaving me with a flooded kitchen , a kitchen sink that wo n't drain , and having to fix my garbage disposal myself . some staff is very friendly while some seems it 's a hassle to deal with you . now it 's memorial day and i have no water in my apartment either . would n't recommend .	2033
1	this is my favorite smoke shop in las vegas . sam does a great job with his customers and always takes care of me . he has great deals and can help you find what you 're looking for . definitely coming back !	3270
0	i have 2 cars that i have on the monthly unlimited plan -- -and for whatever reason their computer system keeps not recognizing the tag on my cars . when i try and speak with them , they are too busy to deal with the situation . i pay for the service in the hopes of being able to wash my car quickly . get in and out , and on with my day , instead i am stuck either paying separately for a car wash , or having to deal with a manager that does n't have the time to figure out why i am paying for something i cant use .	127
0	simply , i booked an appt . and cancelled it within 10 mns due to an error . they charged me $ 23 ! ! ! i did n't rebook after such a treatment . remember , you cant have a successful business with unfair practices , neither new model cars ( assuming , though other reviews tells its smelly ) would achieve that for you ...	2952
0	the only reason id shop here is if i absolutely need something . i remember asking one of the guys at the gun shop '' hey do you guys carry ar15 's ? '' he replies loudly with attitude `` we do not sell tactical firearms ! '' ok first of all its just a question . second , then why is bass pro selling a h & k usp .45 with a threaded barrel for a suppressor ?	2601
0	ordered the blueberry bagel with blueberry cream cheese 3 separate times , lightly toasted . each time the bagel was sooo burnt . twice they gave regular cream cheese with my order ( requested blueberry ) . when i pointed out my issue , i was questioned if i had ordered right . even though receipt showed my correct order . this place is so , so . just make sure you repeat your order at least three times ! also request a light toasting for your bagel .	1259
0	i order a pizza to go , the same person that took my order also was making the pizza . a guy came up and got a drink and handed the man two dollars . the cook never washed his hands and went back to making my pizza . this is n't sanitary and i will not be back .	809
0	rude staff . unhappy , no `` hello '' or `` thank you . '' this location could learn from the arrowhead location . food is great .	1387
0	this always has been my go to thai restaurant in downtown toronto , until recently i found 3 flies flying around us when we were eating ( and it 's november already ! ) it is extremely disturbing and unhygienic when you are eating . please take action immediately . love the food though just a little concerned about the hygiene of the kitchen . staffs are always friendly and helpful as always . please let me know once the situation is improved , i 'd love to raise the rating when it gets better . p.s . be aware that there 's no free wifi .	553
1	breathtaking . the gardens are absolutely beautiful . i was n't able to see much , but it was absolutely stunning . the gardens are well cared for very photogenic . i spent majority of the time in the greenhouses and the chinese garden before closing . the chinese garden felt like looking at china though a looking glass . the buildings were of traditional chinese architecture and it was fun taking photos with it . we also saw a bit of the japanese garden , but were a bit disappointed because it was rather small and did n't feel like taking a glimpse of japan as i felt like when in the chinese garden .	183
0	do not drink the draft beer . we were visiting over pride and went in the monday after for some drinks . i ordered a pitcher of draft beer and drank it . within four hours i was vomiting and not able to leave the bathroom for four days . the draft beer was the only thing that day my partner and i did n't share so it had to have been the draft beer .	1827
1	vy 's is great for a pedicure ! priced at $ 20 for a basic with a leg massage and $ 25 with added hot stone massage , absolutely the best ! ! ! my daughter and i went together , seated next to each other in massage chairs . beautiful toes too ! worth it , will become a regular .	3732
1	would recommend maryann to anyone looking for a hair stylist who knows how to cut , color and style hair ! she is personable , passionate about her work and a perfectionist !	74
0	no stars ! horrible ! i do n't care if it is pet friendly ! i 'm telling you now , this place is the slums it 's broke down and dirty ! ! i do n't care how many `` updates '' they do to the place , , , it 's bad . rooms are tiny ! no accommodations at all . ugh ! never again ! ( prostitutes and drug dealers hang in the parking lot )	3772
0	went there on saturday october 25 to buy some loose tea for home . the staff are very nice and friendly . when we arrived home to make tea , we realized that the tea is very dry and brittle almost like dust . the tea tastes nice however not as fresh as it could be . it was expensive and we feel we did n't get our money 's worth . it was our first time shopping at this place and it will be our last . we 'll stick to the tea chains that have a faster turn over on their teas to ensure we 're getting fresh content .	2627
1	this practice is incredibly efficient and dependable . with other practices i visit , i have to make several reminder calls to acquire routine things i need like lab tests , appointments , questions about prescription side effects , etc . with this practice , i know they will help me quickly . roxie anderson is amazing . thoughtful and knowledgeable . they also have saturday hours which is amazing !	1562
1	after weeks of frustration searching for a perfect ballgown skirt , i came to the store with no expectation at all ! god must have all the stars aligned , stacey greeted me and in 5min , she brought me what ive been looking for ! i could not be happier and i am probably the happiest customer in a long time !	1298
1	hands down this is proabably the busiest mcdonald 's in town . a few times i have come in on the lunch rush , and boy are they fast and accurate . my orders are always correct . the managers work hard and are loud so you can clearly hear when your order us up .	1023
0	i have picked orders from here a few times over the past few years when i was really craving chinese since it is so close to me . food is hit and miss and the last time i ordered from here 2 days ago it was really bad . a few things i should mention . 1 . it is really dirty inside and i would never eat in the restaurant . 2 . the staff/owners are pretty rude and obnoxious . the owners kids were inside the restaurant riding scooters inside the dining area . this will be my last time . i 'll just do china panda next time .	420
1	we had a group go in on the 31st of january . my family really enjoyed themselves and the staff was fantastic ! we would love to go again .	1969
0	ok so this may be partly my fault ... i had never been to a cici 's pizza before and had expected a lot more out of the experience . the only thing i thought was good was the cinnamon roll things . everything else was not great ... or not available . there was no salad or pasta available the entire time we were eating ( we were there for about 25 minutes ) . i guess you get what you pay for here . it 's cheap .	671
0	worst customer service an employee standing around thumb up his butt four people in line and can not get waited on go somewhere else	1479
0	very underwhelming experience on their opening weekend ... even purchasing a vip table . this place has no chance of sustaining in cleveland . the place was crawling with creepy guys who were just openly grabbing girls at will .	2553
1	keya was great - she explained what she was doing and put my nerves at ease . the results are just what i was hoping for . i 'll be back .	2457
0	the guy danny rushed to do my nails . the paint is coming off and the accrylic doesnt even fit my nail and my nails did not get painted all the way . i 'm never coming here again and my finger were burning and jessica said it was the chemical reaction	2288
1	we live in gastonia and travel the 30-45 minutes to get to this carvel location . this is the best ice cream and i miss having one close to home . the manager/owner was very pleasant , made sure the tables were wiped off inside . will definitely be hiking up to charlotte again for the ice cream .	1201
1	this is a great local bar ! ! owners have a great sense of humor ! ! they will help you try any beer and know what you like ! ! ! great times and great music ! !	997
1	this pharmacy is farther away from my home but i continue to come here for my prescriptions because of the excellent customer service . drive through . on the phone . in the store . i always receive friendly , kind , and professional service !	3583
0	excellence nourriture n'égale pas toujours à un bon service à la clientèle . 2h pour la livraison ...	1109
0	just an ok gym ... not a club , but i 'm kinda a club snob . has all your necessities but lacks the more up to date cardio equipment , core machines or accessories , and multipurpose machines . can get a little crowded after work but mornings are ok. clean enough , no towels provided , and staff is nice enough .	2314
0	when you go to a dealership you expect things to be fixed , not broken , but this is the experience i received . went in for a warranty repair because of clear coat wore out on a roof piece ( just 1 year after purchase ) , when we got our car back and drove home , the whole piece of roof plastic flew off while driving on the freeway . second time pickup , piece of plastic connecting the rear view mirror and interior was dangling and there were adhesive on the sunroof that 's unremovable . pending on the third round now . certainly not the expected level of service from mercedes and dealership .	2432
1	i recently sold my vehicle and leased a 2014 rogue select through classic nissan and i could not be more happy . rafi and all of the staff at classic nissan went above and beyond my expectations in every way . i had received quotes from at least 8 other nissan dealerships in this area and found that the best deal was with them regarding not only the lease , but also in their offer on the vehicle i was selling to them . i would and will recommend them to family and friends !	2756
1	i have used sierra air for 3 years for maintenance and a new hvac system on a 12 year old property . they were the company my new home builder used to install the hvac system . i have had them come out a couple of times for maintenance at my new house and the techs have always been very helpful ! recently , i went to lowes for a new hvac system and lowes sent out sierra air . they replaced the ac and heater in my 12 year old rental property . i feel like they are honest , they treat both of my properties with respect , and their pricing is fair .	1718
1	purchased a scotty cameron putter and chris did my fitting ... .excellent . he was straight forward , knowledgeable , and helpful . i have purchased most of my clubs for second swing and i will continue to do so . their prices are extremely competitive . their 30 day play guarantee is great as well . i have bought clubs and played with them and was able to return them for full price store credit . also , snowbirds go home so az can have our golf courses back .	1013
0	one word . disgusting . the room was dirty from top to bottom from the filthy carpet to the cigarette smell that would not go away and to top it off on our second day they cut the water to the room with no explanation as to why . thankfully we had done what we set out to do in phoenix and decided to check out after the water was cut . if you like dirty motels that try to pass themselves off as a `` hotel/ innsuite '' this is the place for you .	1195
0	very limited menu . nothing for vegetarians . social media raves about this place , i do n't t see the magic at all . margaritas are from a mix , salsa was from a jar . not a fan , i hope the step up their game , i like the location in avon lake and i believe supporting local restaurants .	651
1	nicole beauty & wigs is the best hair store we have been to in vegas . their selection is very diverse and they were in stock of everything that we needed . the customer service was great and they were very knowledgeable about the hair and the products . my girl was very pleased and we will definitely be back again . if you 're ever visiting in las vegas area be sure to stop by here they are amazing ! ! !	2826
0	this has to be the smallest dunkin ' i have ever been in . we just stopped to get a couple of iced coffees and we were not impressed . my mocha latte had chocolate clumped in the bottom of it and running all down the inside of the glass , it was as if they did n't mix anything after dumping the coffee in .	1131
0	this no frills is awful . i hate the layout . the produce is 90 % of the time bad , the place just looks dirty . the staff is rather rude , they do n't take visa , i just really hate this place . always a huge waste of time coming here .	3821
1	we love this place been comin here for 15 years but the man server very very rude other than that good close to home hawaii food we can get in vegas	1103
0	rude service from the owners too ! ! ! ! we went there as a family as my husbands side went there all the time when they were kids . we all ordered and my daughter got her ice cream in a cup and she asked if she could get sprinkles . the guy grabbed it did n't say anything and put some on , handed it to us rudely and said 50 cents . she then asked if she could have a cherry . he said no we do n't have any as we saw another customer with one . maybe went on the wrong day but we will not go back since .	2228
0	with approximately 2 hours until close , staff would not let me wash my dog with 2 open stalls . there is no mention of a `` last call '' on the website to allow staff enough time for closing procedures . i will wash my dog at home from now on .	3290
0	poor quality steak and ribs ( the meat was tough and the flavor was blah ) . the service was okay and my drinks were kept filled . the sides were not good at all .	1187
1	3 $ blackjack tables , ca n't go wrong with that ! the gf & i checked out all the other casino 's in the old downtown area , and this place by far had the friendliest and most fun dealers & workers . only not so cool thing is the servers do n't really come around to provide drinks . but at a place with such cheap tables , whatcha expect ? ? usually the younger kids tend to hang out in the strip , but downtown las vegas is a lot of fun because of places like this . we 'll def be back someday !	2500
0	your chocolate is disgusting . sorry , not sorry . i can see why you 're replacing your chocolate area with a bar .	3722
1	a group of us went here for a comedy show with mike epps , eddie griffin , cedric the entertainer , dl hughley , george lopez , & charlie murphy ( black & brown comedy get down ) , which was simply hilarious ! traffic coming into the venue was a crawl so definitely give yourself extra time to park . the venue itself is a nice size that seats a lot but it 's small enough that almost every seat has a good view . seats are comfy , lots of restrooms , and halls are large so clearing out goes quickly . overall , a pretty good venue to see a show .	2187
0	dr. vazquez was so , so rude . i should have walked out when i heard the way he was talking to other patients , i left the office almost in tears . to top it off he told me he could n't help me , he did n't specialize in what i needed , yada yada . i told the front desk explicitly what i needed to be seen for when i was making an appointment , so why would they still schedule me ? wish i could do more than just write a bad review . avoid this place .	297
1	finally a solid pho spot in the richmond hill area . the hills have been missing a good pho spot . i came here today as my friend told me the phone here is as good as pho on ossington . i 'm not saying it 's as good as ossington but i can say it was better than i expected and i can confidently say it 's the best pho north of steeles . the place is nice and clean and the service is solid .	707
1	great store for virtually all of your pet 's needs . the owners and staff are helpful with your shopping and grooming experience and the well being of your furry loved one ( s ) . they are knowledgeable about their products and consistently pursue new and innovative food , toys and goods .	3433
1	chris mozilo and his team at homeowners financial are amazing . they gave as much urgency and priority to my loan as i did and pulled through on time and as promised on my complicated transaction .	2518
1	i still ca n't figure out how they get such good piano players . most people forget everything they learned these people they know every song in every key . must be from juillard school of music . this place is amazing .	1176
1	i loved the hazelnut coolatta , my son loved the doughnut holes . the quality of the product is what will be will be bringing me back to this location , the staff was a little mixed up but the coolatta and the doughnut holes made up for that .	606
1	cobblestone auto spa always does an awesome job of detailing my car . i also signed up for the unlimited monthly car washes , totally recommend it and love it ! it is awesome since it 's located so close to my apartment .	127
0	please do not litter out neighborhood with your old spray-painted nasty sneakers for advertisement its gross ! use social media you will get further then littering neigborhoods !	3367
1	great place for fresh and organic food . everyone is always helpful and the food is always good that they have there for you to eat or take home . can be a little pricey but you should n't put a cost on eating better and taking care of yourself	433
0	if you 're in the mood for a hot dog or sausage sandwich , you 'll like jj 's . but , if you go there hoping for something more , prepare to be disappointed . their chili is good on a dog , but not great on its own . balsamic salad dressing was very blah . both the italian sausage and andouille sandwiches are good . their onion rings are the skinny shoestring kind .	58
1	the most amazing pastries ! the cinnamon rolls are literally the most delicious treat i 've ever consumed ! i wish they were open on sunday morning . oh and the wines ! mon dieu !	1160
1	i have been traveling for 18 hours due to weather delays and cancels . i have been dealing with many clerks , cashiers , and southwest representatives in person and on the phone . my experience at 360 burrito this morning stood out and made my day . gorian asked how i was doing and i felt genuine concern and sympathy for my travel woes . is 360 burrito pricy ? of course , it 's in an airport . everything is overpriced in airports .	623
1	fairly good ! cleanliness is ok could do better i come here every now and then and most people suggest vicky but shes busy with lashes so book appt ahead ! the give u a shoulder massage and are open till 8.30 so its convienient ! def would come back : )	2148
0	i brought my 15 month old son in for his first haircut and i will not be going back . the woman who cut his hair was not the type of kid-friendly personality i would expect for someone working in that kind of place . she was very aggressive about trying to sell me hair products , even argumentative about other products and what is considered organic . and now that i look at his hair cut , it 's uneven . i will just fix it myself instead of going back there . they do have videos for the kids to watch , but overall it does look outdated into there . i wish i had just gone to a regular place .	3087
0	this bank is a joke . every time i come here its an hour plus wait with no other customers waiting and nothing but excuses from the staff that they only have one person working . maybe try having more staff scheduled to work . easy solution to an ever so common problem at bank	2159
1	i loved the red velvet cupcake . it was really good and the service was friendly and personable . however , they do not have seating and on a hot day , it would have been great to enjoy my cupcake in the air conditioning .	2751
0	there 's a reason why supercenter is different from this regular walmart . everything is in short supply including grocery or they do n't carry the product at all compared to a supercenter . while it 's closer to my house , i only go here if it ' s a must .	3066
0	filthy , nasty yuck . every surface is covered in dirt , there 's mold in the bathroom . this is similar quality to a motel 6 .	3166
0	had a severe cold with coughing and went there to get prescription cough syrup ( to help me during the night ) . they said they do n't do that anymore and suggested over the counter meds . gosh , i should have just asked the pharmacist then . very disappointed ( and was still coughing at night ) .	3583
0	guess what ! they have renovated the checkouts ! removed the self-checkouts and switched to the single queue system . that can be so great ... like at winner 's ... you are never stuck in the slow lane . unfortunately they forgot to hire enough staff . i waited 14 minutes , in a line-up that had 18 people in it at one point , to spend $ 400.00 . there were two cashiers ... two slooooow ones . i even called the store from the line , and was told there were no other cashiers . i was so close to walking out , but you are trapped in the stupid line . renewing my amazon prime right now .	2520
1	gene , the pharmacist , really went out of his way for us with an injection consultation . he was so kind and knowledgeable . my husband and i sincerely appreciate everything he did to help us ! ! !	2463
1	stopped in for a drink to check out what this lounge was about . we had great service , no make that exceptional service . the raspberry lime sorbet cocktail was awesome . intended to have one but stayed for two . now i must warn everyone , this place is very expensive . these drinks were $ 18 each . if you are looking for value this is not the place to party . if you want to stop by for a drink while on a first date to impress then you should give this place a shot .	456
0	quick service . everything else is very poor . customer service poor . adding on unnecessary charges not approved by me . explanation of what i actual need and what they say i should get was fuzzy and could n't get a straight answer really . no ... i 'll try and find another place i wo n't feel taken advantage of	2881
1	going here for 3 years . previously i would have given the gym a 1 star review but i have seen an improvement in customer service . mostly i 'm looking for is a pleasant entrance and exit from the gym ( before the front desk would n't even acknowledge people coming or going ) this area has improved immensely the past few months . still needs to work on fixing cardio equipment and upgrading the gym overall .	3912
0	really disappointed in this place . you can do a lot better . been trying to cancel my gym membership for a while now but there 's always an excuse .	1802
1	normally sheraton is the lower brand of starwood . i expected to have a somewhat outdated type of room in a somewhat outdated hotel . the location was great , so that 's what mattered . the reason this is a 4 versus a 3 is that this sheraton was slightly nicer than most in terms of lobby and the room was decent . i had a great view , being upgraded due to my platinum status . this was a good spot , i would stay here again .	1690
0	color is terrible ... i had to go back and she put a toner on it . it still looked yellow and was not highlighted to my roots . front desk has an attitude . they are very unprofessional and the salon is over crowded . i will never go back here !	2828
1	so nice ! ! i seriously lobe love love the dollar store ... so many stupid little things that you just sometimes need ... & it 's just even better when the employees are freaken nice ! ! this location seems like they have some awesome workers . the other locations typically seem like theybhate life & dread being there ... but this one they try to make the best of it which made me wan na just grab another dollar 's worth of stuff ahaaaaha . props to the employees & a specific cheerful young man that worked the day i visited around 3:30 pm on 10.9.15 to the managers.. give him props & recognition ! although i dunno his name ...	1822
0	worst police dept in the state . when you call them for non-emergency , do n't expect them for about 5-6 hours . ridiculous	2322
1	i came here on a whim because i was wandering around on state street . it 's kind of a whole in the wall it appeared to be clean . i was greeted right away and seated . i was given a menu and they had a good selection of sushi , appetizers and other dishes if you were n't in the mood for sushi . i ordered a tempura shrimp roll , edamame and dumplings . the food came out quickly and it was very good . i would definitely come here again if you are in the mood for a quick bite to eat .	1014
0	what can i say , the service was absolutely ruined anything good regarding this place . we came her on thursday 5/25 about 10:30 we had a group of about 6 , however our server , i think his name was eric , completely ignored us up until the other table across the restaurant had left . twice i had to get up and go to the bar to get drinks because the server had not come around for more than 20 minutes or more . i think about it now and that 's probably the worst 60 dollars i have wasted . thanks for ruining our night , appreciate it	717
0	i eaten here all the time for years ... ... we had lunch there today and the food was subpar ... .first we asked to split the salad and they didnt ... ... .the chicken was dry ... .then my mom ordered the lettuce cup and it salty ... .she changed out for there famous kobe beef slider and that wasnt good either ... ..we game up the cook must been bad ..will not be coming back ..so disappointed : - (	1116
0	easily one of the worst food places in all of cave creek , and horribly expensive for what you get . the draft beer is way too warm for phoenix , expecially during the summer time , and bad food with warm beer has chased away most of the local business in the brief time they have been opened . a place with great potential delivers nothing to bring you back , and i have been there several times now since they opened . clearly , a restaurant destined to close if they do n't get it together .	211
0	i could not be more turned off from this place nor have i ever been treated so rudely . 1 . this place needs to have online reservations . i called several times and no one answered then when i finally got through they said we could come in with no reservation . no problem . 2 . we arrived early just in case and were turned away because we were n't `` regulars and there is a priority for people not like you '' . how disgusting . get over yourselves .	1168
0	the supervisor on afternoon duty 9/18/2018 has zero management skills and is incompetent . who follows a dissatisfied customer out of the store while leaving another customer you 're attending to in order to tell them they are not allowed back in the store . grow up.. they should fire your ass .	3860
1	recently been shopping for a new truck . i went to islington chrysler and was helped by rod guerron . he was knowledgeable about the vehicle i was looking at and made time for me despite me dropping in . when i did make an appointment to come in again he was ready with vehicles for me to test drive etc . great service from : rod guerron islington chrysler fiat ram dodge srt	448
0	the staff is un educated in both golf technology and customer service . i read prior reviews thinking this would be a great place to look at used clubs . one person lied right to my face . after this i will be going back to vans golf . the customer service and knowledge is outstanding . 2nd swing is all about moving clubs and not about helping the golfer . pretty much like a used car lot . do n't recommend this business . go to vans golf , they are nearby off flw .	1013
0	80 % of their menu is unavailable . i got matcha in a cup and their portions are extremely small for a $ 6 leaning swirl . my friend got their matcha drink and it tasted like water . very disappointed . incomparable to tsujiri and tendou .	716
0	i am appalled at the coaches decision to have the team remain inside during our country 's national anthem . if i owner that team , we 'd start by firing the coach . then team members who want to lay in another country would be released or they play in their country . pittsburgh i will never root for you again . how embarrassing	3306
1	loved this place . everything made to order . handmade tortillas . had the asada , the pastor and the taco-chiwas . hands down a must eat .	270
0	the car wash is $ 27 , but its not worth the money . owner 's attitude was a big problem . it was my first time car wash instead of talking warmly and explaining out what are the things they do with the car , he was rude and attitude problem . it was all in a hurry . the guys were using the same cloth to dry the other cars . it was all messed up .	2256
1	dina , was the best hair stylist to date . she knew exactly what i was looking for and was able to deal with the specific way i like my hair i would highly recommend going to this solan , especially if you are in a hurry and are not looking to spend a residuals amount of money for the same quality hair cut .	3232
1	very friendly staff , doctors & are great as well ! always easy to schedule an appointment !	3004
0	buying ice cream with the family.. the ice cream guy `` mike '' was so fn rude .. i will never buy ice cream there again.. slamming ice cream doors when someone asked for a sample.. come on.. you have to do better.. i will never be back again ! ! !	2385
0	was going to make a purchase of several items , the check out had 1 register open and about 8 or 9 people in line when we walked in , after finding the items we wanted we went up to check out and there was still only one register open and it had over 10 people in line . we set our items down and left , big lines show poor management , and the lack of concern for the customers .	2108
1	first time calling this company for garage door repair . impressed ! they responded within two hours . took the time to do the job right . i highly recommend this company for your garage door issues .	3931
0	il y a certaines laines qui sont pas mal mais qu'on trouve ailleurs . par contre le service y est exécrable . passez votre chemin et allez ailleurs .	3743
0	i drove up here ( maple grove , mn location ) from chaska to pick up a mirror we had ordered online . when i arrived to pick it up , the associates working ( caitlin and another girl ) told me the keys to the warehouse were in an office that had a meeting going on and they did n't feel comfortable interrupting the meeting , for a paying customer mind you . they have lost our business , which is a shame for them , we just bought a big beautiful home that needs a lot of decorating , we 'll be taking our business elsewhere . i ended up canceling the order and leaving .	1576
1	everyone who dealt with my father after his stroke was kind and professional . he was treated with respect and dignity the whole six days he was there .	3131
0	this place used to be great until i entered and was told they do not allow any purses . i keep my wallet in my purse and do not trust their lockers to safely hold my purse ( which is right next to the door ) while i browse the store for items . you just lost my business , vegas beauty supply .	1659
1	hard to believe that i missed this gem since i drive past it constantly . with nearly a thousand miles of recent road travel , this was a fantastic spot to wash the car . the machinery did a great job on the paintwork and i think they gave me a free upgrade on the tire black stuff . free vacuums got rid of all the crumbs , sand and other nonsense that was littering the inside of my car as well . a great deal for $ 5 .	3365
0	our party just had the worst experience ever in downtown . it is all because of the bad attitude of the restaurant manager . he did a horrible job when we trying to figure out something about the bills . his attitude is simply too rude . i never say this about any person before but for this one , i hope he will get fired soon ! he as one person totally ruin that restaurants reputation ! ! !	785
0	i just tried their sandwiches for the 1st time . a turkey on marbled rye california style with avocado , sprouts , pickles and more . the bread was not toasted and was crumbly , the turkey was kinda lame like carl budding 's in the pkg for $ .40 at the grocery . for $ 9 it was not very impressive . i will stick to the bagels & schmear and the breakfast sandwiches .	1214
1	michelle is the best stylist here . i have typical asian hair and she always gives me a great cut and style . she 's also great with updo and formal style so if there are any brides here , ask for her ! the ambience is relaxing in the spa area . i 've done massage , facial , back facial and body wrap here . they treat you like a queen . it 's a bit pricey , but you get what you pay for . the service is superb . if you want to treat yourself , this is the place .	2509
0	do not come here ladies ! please do n't . this place gives you a long wait time ! they are slow and overprice on everything . i did n't even get a discount when i was supposed to ! i am always nice to workers but the man here is beyond rude . i would definitely not recommend this place to anyone ! ! go anywhere else !	415
1	ca n't relate to arturo a ! the kid was soo nice to me and had exceptional customer service . straight flamas	797
0	the food here is really good but its expensive and portions are small . the first time i picked up from the store and everything was good . the 2nd time i ordered delivery and they never showed up and still charged my credit card . i had to dispute the charge with my credit card company as fraud .	432
1	got the chile con queso offer through yelp , very creamy and yummy . i ordered the classic chicken fajitas which came out sizzling and perfect . they were great with the queso poured on top !	1094
1	fun monthly art walk . holiday parade strolls right next to the park . the annual tumbleweed christmas tree is on the north end of the park thanksgiving through christmas . free photo with santa is set up on a saturday in december . fun activities . people are right , it 's not a park with many activities or a playground for kids , yet it 's a relaxing place to meet someone in the middle of downtown . it 's in the center of the plethora of shops , restaurants , ice cream parlor , bars , improv comedy , pottery shop , etc . i 'm glad it 's a park and not a parking lot - that 'd be depressing .	2483
1	i had the best experience here ! i live literally next door and i 'm so excited to have such a great facility close by . i went in for something fairly small but it was late on a friday night ( and i could n't wait until monday to go to my doctor ) . i walked in , got signed in , taken care of and was in and out in a half hour . every single person that i interacted with was great- friendly , professional and had great senses of humor . i definitely recommend this place ( i wish that they were around when my baby got bit by a scorpion a few months ago ! ) .	350
0	nice park to relax if you can avoid the canadian geese droppings all over the place it is disgusting and the city of north las vegas should do something about it . it 's a shame because it 's a nice park .	367
0	it was just meh . the service was inattentive . the food was salty and the drinks were brought out in thimble sized glasses . just a weird vibe too because the place was empty at prime dinner time .	621
0	woke up to heavy cigarette smoke smell at 4am . i booked a non smoking room on a non smoking floor , right ? now i get to start my day with a big headache . i 'll never be back and want a refund ! yuck !	3091
0	this place sucks butts . there 's no refrigerator in the room , so if you have anything perishable forget it . ordered food ? better eat it all at once . got beer ? better like it warm . there 's no pool so no place to relax and lounge after a long day of driving . no , no hot tub or anything of that sort either . the bathrooms do n't have exhaust fans . took a dump ? get comfortable with the idea of having others smell your residual turds . this hotel masquerades under the guise of a luxury stay , when in fact it is the most basic accommodations with a fancy coat of paint .	2188
0	i really want to know who old is this lettuce ? it 's so hard to eat healthy and this is exactly why.. i 'm soooooo pissed off that i have to throw my lettuce away , the important lettuce that holds my sandwich together i will never go here again .. great customer service though ps i just opened the lettuce and found brown avocado i hate them ..	998
1	this place is a sports bar so there 's not really much to report on here . the wings are excellent and so are the tacos . the quality of service here changes like the seasons . some days it 's hot and some days it 's cold .	839
1	kevin the owner was really nice and told me about their amazing mirror by their interior decorator . vanilla & almonds - very good ! ! cinnamon , birthday cake , & butter pecan mixed with rainbow sprinkles - incredible ! !	3537
1	low limit casino in north las vegas , nv directly on las vegas boulevard , north of downtown . $ 1 bowling is a draw . the dealers and service are both friendly and helpful . casino interior needs a cleaning , and renovation . nice place though . i 'll be back .	3378
0	food was decent but the service was horrible . i had to ask for my drink multiple times before it even showed up . seemed like they only had 1 server working the place . i will only come back if my friends drag me here .	967
1	simple but solid tacos with a great owner / operator . i highly recommend getting the pork taco but all are good .	760
1	great vr game ! my husband did the zombie one and he had a blast ! he came out so sweaty from all the moving around he did . $ 50 for 30 min of game play . the whole time you have a guide watching what you see and helping you with tips on your game play . he said it was quite and experience ! recommended !	2494
1	my wife and i are both patients . the office staff are professional , wait time before appointments is reasonable , dr. and pa 's are thorough , friendly , excellent at clearly explaining suggested treatments . i highly recommend stockton dermatology and have great confidence as treat my son 's melanoma .	2526
1	best spin class i 've ever taken . been going here 3 years now and it just gets better !	3477
1	doc kotoske is a surgeon with the eyes of an artist , he corrected few botched works on me throughout the years.i always trust him completely , he is a wonderful caring person , giovial , humble and skilled as few. ! ! ! ! ! love me my doc kotoske ! ! !	2953
1	we came for breakfast and the food is so good that we wud love to come back again in this short period of time we have during this trip . highly recommend the food . looking forward to another trip here again .	57
1	i did n't get the full experience of attending . i did enjoy the serving of ice creams and i like that they have some very nice hours you do n't feel like your rushing .	919
1	i 've taken my kids here several times , and we 've never had to wait more then 5 minutes . we go right up , sign in , and they usually call us back right as i 'm done signing their paperwork . the doctors have always been super nice . my daughter had stitches done , and she was a nervous wreck . the staff tried so hard to make her comfortable and gave her a stuffed toy when she was done . it was very nice . i wish they would open a bit earlier in the day ... otherwise , they 're great .	888
1	they have a wide selection of products . i bought flooring from them after my installer recommended them over homedepot or floor decor . i went and worked with bob . they are very professional but a bit more pricey then the other places i mentioned . but you get personal service and a quick turnaround . i was working to a deadline and had to have my floors installed before my move date . bob managed to get my order in and even worked to give me a discount . i will go back for my counters .	1918
0	snippy little man in glasses was rude to my 8 year old daughter and then 2 minutes later was rude to my fiance for daring to bring a drink inside with her ! ( it 's 110 degrees outside , genius ... .people are going to have drinks . and if you want them to leave drinks outside , put a friggin sign on the door ! ) will be sure to never spend a dime in there and spread the word to as many as possible . zero manners and zero customer service !	530
0	i ca n't understand how the pharmacist can violate my right to proposition 303 ? arizona does not have a dying with grace law , so 303 gives me the right to anything even if the fda does n't say it will help my terminal condition . my prescription cocktail is prescribed by my doctors and not the pharmacist ! ! ! it is between them and myself how to make the pain less ... .until my last breath .	3411
0	got invited by a friend . worst customer service . they had no record of her reservation even after she showed her confirmation . would n't give extra eye protection for the kids when they wanted a break . wo n't be coming back .	3058
0	these guy on purpose dumped a whole load of landscaping stuff ( tree branches ) in the middle of the road and took off .	2387
1	we had a very pleasant experience ! we love the aloft because of its value and dog friendliness , and this one was no exception . room was clean , accessible , and comfortable . location next to piada was also nice . would definitely recommend .	3522
0	ok food but not worth another try . my daughter and i tried to like this place as we are from long island and it is convenient to our home . daughter heidi ordered a bagel and it came with a small portion of cream cheese so i ordered another side of the cream cheese . they charged a ridiculous amount for the side and when we talked to the manager he was arrogant , aloof and obnoxious telling us that was it he was not going to do anything in our favor . the cost of the side was actually more than the bagel . there are plenty of choices in scottsdale and i do n't recommend this one .	325
0	i was using the bathroom and a cook walks in- used the bathroom- and walked right out- did not wash his hands . no . all i 've got to say is you do n't come here to eat- only the concerts and entertainment at best . the food is just awful . the prices are n't much better either and the people that work here are so miserable .	1129
0	got a bagel with cream cheese , the cream cheese seemed off so i looked at the expiration date and it was 5 months ago . asked for a new packet but the cashier assured me it was a new package . i showed her the expiration date and she still insisted the cheese was fresh . do n't sell expired goods and if you do make a mistake , do n't lie about it to your customers who can clearly demonstrate you are wrong .	2804
1	the restaurant has been offering great sushi and modern japanese platers for several years now . for seafood lovers , i will definitely recommend the maiko scallops and the volcano ( imitation crab / tobiko ) .	174
0	food is very bland and dry . service was hot and cold -- slow out front but super-quick from the kitchen . there was a serious language barrier with our party and our waiter ( who was charming , adorable and maybe still learning his job ) . a couple of items we ordered may have even been wrong . so when our quesadilla app came out and looked just like empanadas , we just ate them . sope cake tasted more like potato than corn . the entrees were forgettable . mole was sour , my pork tacos dry , needed some salt , salsa , sauce .	1330
1	very pleasantly surprised by this place . the office was clean , staff friendly . it was n't a place overflowing with animals in the waiting room ( which would scare my cat ) . they did n't try to encourage additional expenses that were n't necessary . i think we officially are moving our pet services to this business !	1338
1	in and out in 70 minutes . i had a refraction and full eye exam , including having my eyes dilated . my appointment wad at 8 20 and i walked out the door at 9 30 . since i had never had previous service in less tha 2 and a half hours i was very pleasantly surprised . the receptionist , techs and dr t. reddi were all friendly and professional . i will need a follow up visit and because i can be flexible with their locations i got one for three weeks from now , not the usual 2 or 3 month wait .	1635
0	terrible service . i made an appointment 3 times to have my refrigerator looked at , i bought it from them and it 's already been repaired once , all at 7am in different days . the first time they told me their service vehicle broke down and would call me to reschedule , never did . i called back for them to come back out , was told 7am on a thursday , never showed . i called back and spoke to carlos and a lady in the office she scheduled me for 7am this morning . at 730am carlos text me `` on the way '' saying he was 40 min out . terrible service .	1236
1	i had been looking for a simple , elegant bed frame for a long time . finally found one at muji . not only are the products are beautiful , and the customer service , from the floor staff to the delivery men were friendly , professional , and knowledgeable . really the best customer service i 've experienced in a very long time . thank you , muji !	3363
1	excellent sandwiches - fast , hot , and very tasty ! gothic ( ham , turkey , real melted cheese and mushrooms ) was perfect but might want to try substituting spinach for shredded lettuce next time . ca n't wait to try the angel hair pasta and other sandwich types on future visits . great job guys one of the best sandwiches i 've tried in the university/priest/40th street area -- baguette was flavorful , other bread choices sound good too !	326
0	my fiancé and i fell in love with this place with all the pictures posted and great deals they have ! we read some reviews , some good some bad and despite the bad reviews we thought we should give patrick and the venue a chance . however , when we called patrick to ask a few questions and try to book a tour , he was extremely rude to us . it seemed as if he was annoyed that we were trying to give him our business . we hung up right away , the venue is gorgeous and would have been perfect for us but someone like him is not who we want to deal with on top of planning on our wedding !	238
0	if you need a replacement card..save yourself the time and go to the buffalo location . wasted 45 minutes here . put that on your memo board !	2598
1	! !	2033
1	great value for lunch specials ! all the ingredients taste fresh every time ! happy eating	516
1	honest and knowledgeable staff . they earned my business for life . went in thinking i had an issue with a bike . after a few minutes they fixed the actual issue and did n't charge me for the fix . i 'll take honest and knowledgeable any day . i was in the market for a new bike and i wo n't shop anywhere else . fantastic experience .	3775
0	avoid at all costs ! they misdiagnosed my problem and charged me thousands for repairs i did not need . my ac still does n't work . these guys are scammers that take advantage of people . i hope you guys can sleep at night knowing you stole from a schoolteacher !	1564
1	have always had the tastiest food here to a point where you will order more than you want just to be able to try everything . originally did not have the best experience when i went back recently , but management reached out personally to apologize , and to me that attention to customer satisfaction can really emphasize what kind of place this truly is . will definitely be coming back and back again , as well happy to show and suggest to people new to the city . the sope de pollo is out of this world .	1469
1	i 'm out here every saturday for work and always stop by in the afternoons . service is always above average and drinks come out in a timely manner . clean store and restrooms as well . i feel like a lot of starbucks have dipped in quality lately , so it 's good to see that this one still provides good service and a clean store !	2242
1	raymond was out and put 2 lbs in our system now it 's blowing cold air . great company to work with .	601
0	went last weekend and was n't impressed at all . the best part of the experience was the magician who came to the table . the carmel apples were too hard to eat and the prices were too high . the free potato chips were good . the biggest problem for me was keeping the flies off my food . i probably wo n't go back .	144
1	the food is pretty good . decent place to grab traditional indian food . very delicious . great price point too .	1540
0	the chipping of my nails continued and i went to other salons and have n't had any issues since , so i am attributing the nail chipping to the quality of product used or application .	819
0	this review applies strictly to their catering options . proceed with caution , as there are many `` mine fields '' .	1914
0	i really wanted pho but did n't want to drive to the eastside to my regular spots and found pho nam to be closer to me at the time . i probably should have just waited to get to my regular spots because the pho was not that great and the ingredients were ok but not as fresh as i 'm used to and the jalapeno 's were not even hot ... ... ... how does that happen ? i also had a summer roll , the shrimp was not deveined and the peanut sauce looked very strange , but the taste was ok . the owners were very nice but unfortunately the food is just not that good .	1312
1	its chick-a-fila ... auto 5 star ! i mean they made sure we we 're well taken care of . great service , good food and clean and hygienic establishment .	572
1	cork and clever is one of our favorite places . we 've eaten dinner here at least 6 times and the food and experience is always wonderful . we always try something new and had never had a bad dish . all the food has an amazing flavor and is prepared in a unique way from other restaurants . cork and clever is in a league of their own ... definitely a must try for everyone ... .and it 's affordable ... .no braking the bank here . amazing food at a good value and the owner will make a round to every table to make sure everything is on par . staff and owners are friendly and remember their customers .	1463
1	they did a great job . awesome service at a fair price . the website makes scheduling easy .	2036
1	justin and the woman at the front desk were so awesome . i got a cacti tattoo and they were sweet and helpful ! thanks ! !	665
1	just recently had clutch work done on my 2006 triumph rocket 3 . sal , sir you are awesome . got the parts i needed fast . tech did an awesome job . very happy . just cruised 560 miles in 2 days with my wife . bike is running superb ! thanks to the gang at freedom cycle !	94
1	bought my new canada goose jacket here a couple of days ago , employees there are super help full while one was looking for my size downstairs 2 other employees asked if i was ok and needed help , with in 5/6 mins , must of made this guy go up and down 5/6 times looking for the styles and size i was looking at was in stock for me . always with a smile . great selection of brands , styles and service and if they served champagne i 'll would of give them 5 lol but only give 5 stars if the company go 's above and beyond for there customers .	2743
0	i get that patients run late causing everything else to run late but 30 minutes late is excessive . when i ask how much longer will it be for my son to be seen , he is coincidentally getting ready to be called back . we went back , the staff give no apologies just a half assed `` sorry , '' so we 'll be finding a new pediatric dentist .	2596
1	flew to rapid city south dakota , and the flight was great , the attendants were attentive , but it was other wise uneventful , which is great .	3127
1	we looked at 75 armory and was great building and location was near arc in senior land . leasing agent autumn was very friendly and was very helpful in showing the property . she went really out of her way making sure we got all the information we needed and make us feel welcome .	3168
0	quoted me $ 15 for the service call to cut a lock off my storage unit ( key broke inside lock ) shows up and plugs electric saw in and right before he cut the lock he said it will be $ 135 plus $ 15 service call , $ 150 for 10 min worth of time to cut one lock off , rip off ! ! ! then did n't take credit cards and followed me to atm , will never use again , call master lock and key next time .	1919
0	i received a gift card for a 1 hour massage so i decided to book an appointment . afterwards , i signed up for a membership and within 4 months decided to cancel . each visit brought on multiple issues with their staff acting unprofessionally . the actual massages are fine , but the front desk staff take away any relaxation you might have felt due to their car salesman tactics to get you to sign up for their membership . when you want to cancel they will persistently try to convince you that you should n't . they claim to promote relaxation , but in reality it 's more of a hassle than its worth .	2252
1	i 've gotten my nails done biweekly for the last 4 years , never had my shellac actually last 2 weeks , until i found this place . my pretty nails were in perfect condition still . high quality gel polish for a an average price . when i called they said they had time for me in 5 minutes , exactly the time it took to drive there . ( this was wednesday around lunchtime ) . just wish there was a tip line on the credit card slip because i did n't have cash that day . definitely will go back and tip the girl twice ! the spa was also very classy looking , modern and sleek .	3842
1	the best massage i have ever had in my life . my massage therapist , stephanie , did a really fantastic job . the customer service is impeccable . the spa is very cute , lovely ambiance . make sure to take advantage of their student or duo massage promotions on certain days if you can !	1192
1	the salon is amazing ! my stylist , kimber , is just as amazing ! she understood what i wanted for my haircut and executed it perfectly ! she 's an outstanding cosmetologist ! as picky as i am with who cuts my hair , i have complete faith in her . the product the use and sell is top notch and smells great . i recommend kimber and scissors rox paper for everyone .	2056
1	best branch in the state . these guys are all so nice and helpful . even we i move i 'm going to be coming here for all my banking needs	950
1	wonderful food . it was busy so the wait was longer than expected but the food and drinks where completely worth the wait ! ! the service was extremely friendly and had a homey feel . we will definitely come back and highly recommend a visit ! !	190
0	this place is awful . we ( my friends and daughter ) had an appointment and we were separated . check in was chaotic and they tried to seat my 12 year old daughter across the salon from me . my lady was incredibility rude and kept yawning . i had a pedicure and instead of massaging my legs she just ran her hands up and down . my feet were in the same awful condition as before . do n't bother with this establishment . find a different one that will appreciate your business . i will never go back .	2434
0	rip off ! ! after calling three different auto mechanics shops and being quoted hundred and $ 175 to change my spark plugs in my truck . they quoted me $ 290 instead it would take 3 hours of labor to change them out . i 'd rather travel that extra 15 miles across town to get honest quality service then to go just up the road and get raped in the pocket .	3594
1	way way way better than chipotle , i did n't enjoy the salad . i did love the burrito last time and i did n't even finish it which is a surprise . recommend coming with friends .	1365
0	my wife purchased extra washes and was told they would be honored without receipt . she arrived and was told by the attendant that they would be honored without receipt . then at the register was told by the cashier who says she is the manager that they all lied and it is my wife 's own fault for not having the receipt . when the attendant was confronted he shrugged and walked away . when my wife left she learned that they smoked in her van after washing the car to spite her . this place is disgusting !	1502
0	if i could give no stars at all , worst customer service ever ! ! ! ! just because we do n't speak filipino , no assistance at all . i had to raise my voice to get their attention .	1595
0	ordered 4 dim sum dishes and one of them siu mai , har gow , spring rolls and turnip cake . the spring rolls nothing special , the turnip cakes is savoury , nice textures and awesome flavours . the siu mai is where things tanked due to a multiple sandy grains . could not figure if it from the garnish or in the dumpling . it was disgusting and ruined my entire meal .	1441
0	good tater tots and that is it . stopped in for a bite to eat before the pirates game . i had a gyros and my son had cheeseburger sliders . when a 14 year old growing boy tells you the sliders are n't all that great you take notice . the meat was not very tasty and was definitely not quality beef . the gyros i had was not tasty at all , meat was like steak-ums and there it went down hill from there . unless you are just drinking ... go somewhere else for food .	2532
0	lobby bar bartenders are rude . two bartenders ignored us for 5+ minutes . we tried to get they 're attention and when they made eye contact with us , they made no sign that they had seen us . we finally just decided to leave . there is no excuse for rude service .	3457
1	i loved the amount of food you get here ! it tasted great and i got super full ! pretty average korean food with nothing blowing me away , but i 'd definitely go back !	435
1	how have i not reviewed my favorite mexican fusion restaurant ? i 've only eaten at the restaurant once and had a nice time . i 'm a big `` to go '' customer . their salsa verde is sublime . vegetarians , i insist you try the soyrizo and/or poblano and potato burritos ( sometimes i ask for both in one burrito ! ) yes . i am that loco .	1358
1	had a great experience today . paul did my powder manicure and it turned out really nice .	1288
1	excellent staff , procedure and outcome . i could n't be more happier with the results . thank you so much wellish vision lasik , the whole process was definitely a great experience .	2312
0	tow truck driver left me stranded ! ! ! ! roadside assistance sent this tow truck with the wrong destination address . i immediately called and had it changed , but the driver refused to wait a couple of minutes until he got the change . left me stranded in 108 degree weather . when i talked to the owner of the towing company , he did n't understand the issue and before hanging up on me said , `` fuck you , bitch ! ''	1530
1	just got a mani pedi here . was really nice and a good price ( $ 35 for regular nail polish ) . appeared clean , and the people who work there are very nice and professional . shoulder and neck massage made it even better .	2148
0	so both times i came on a saturday before their closing time and they were closed . what about an update on their social media or something to indicate customers that they will be closing early . so frustrating to make all of my way both times ( i live outside of toronto ) and both times they are packing up earlier than usual .	720
0	overpriced , mediocre food . the khao soi can not compare to pai or sukho thai 's khao soi . the meat was tough like leather . we asked for extra cilantro and they were very skimpy with it . the khao pad kra prow barely had any basil in it .	553
1	dr.bradford is a wonderful surgeon ! he 's kind , has a great bedside manner and is very careful not to make any mistakes while revising hips ! i 'm a patient who 's has had a lot of surgeries . he 's made my hip better than ever ! i send many thanks to `` team bradford '' for all your expertise care !	2176
1	i first went to mac where they treated me like a neusance and left with no help or product . i then went to sephora where the nicest girl named maritza helped me with my troubles ! the best service i 've ever had at beauty store . i will be a continuous customer here because of maritza .	223
1	unbelievable pizza and portions ! nothing gets better than the boneless wings with joe 's sauce . highly recommend any one of their locations . ca n't get better for price , quality and service .	417
0	unhappy waiter throws the plates to the customers during lunch . worst service . do n't order spicy egg plant . not even spicy , just weird chinese pickle on top . not edible . waitress did n't explain , nor did she bother to change the order . some dishes were good here , but sorry , i wo n't betray my favourite chinese joint ever again .	1016
0	not happy , to say the least . i paid for a private room for my dog for five days , and grooming ... ... and he came back beaten and with a bruised elbow . funny that they actually said that he could not be in population with any other dogs because he is not fixed , however they also said that he made '' friends very well '' , `` and got along with many other dogs '' . i had to pay $ 294 and had to take him to the vet for another $ 175 worth of antibiotics and rimadyl . do not use this boarding facility under any circumstances .	1830
0	i took my mom as she was having problems going to the bathroom and they said she was too clogged up after the treatment .. they told my mom to come back on monday and pay 65 $ and didnt even really clean her out that was waste of time and $ $ i never heard of colonics doing that i would not recommend this place to anyone	1896
0	was n't told that if i made an online reservation i could n't use groupon . who would n't make a reservation for the busy thanksgiving weekend . the rude clerk scanned the groupon so it shows it as rrdeemed , but i did n't get the price advantage offered by the groupon . called to speak with the customer service dept . what a joke . called the parking lot manager . another joke . i have used this business before , but never again ! ! !	2531
1	today is st. patrick 's day and i was pleased to call and find out they had themed donuts . when i arrived they started packaging 2 dzn assorted and the gal i talked with on the phone must have recognized my voice and took my boxes to the back . she came back with green glazed donuts , explaining she had fun today making them . i really appreciated that she took the time to do that , just to provide a good experience , and of course , they were delicious . i 'm pretty sure the name on her name tag said , dbopp . thanks !	1761
0	not very professional . set up a delivery time online and they did n't call until 8pm that night that they were not coming . so they agreed to come next day instead but never show up nor bothered to call any more . sloppiness .	3529
1	i 'm on my 3rd santa fe and have always gone to south charlotte for service . the people in the service department are always friendly and they take the time to explain everything to me . although the facility is somewhat dated , the waiting room is comfortable . water and coffee are available .	2717
1	i 've shopped at this and other sports authority locations many times and i am usually very happy with what i find . excellent selection of clothing and gear for good prices . this location is not as large as the one at mesa riverview , but it has a good choice of stuff . recently we found my wife a new pair of rollerblades here and i have picked up other items in the past . do n't forget to use the yelp check-in feature as it gives you $ 10 off purchases of $ 50 or more .	1832
1	the gas at sam 's club here is n't bad . i come to this sam 's club gas every sunday to pump gas . also i saved a lot of money just by pumping here .	2469
1	great place to do hot yoga clean , bright , good instructors i enjoyed my experience bilingual - english and french	2472
1	hands down , best new england clam chowder in town ! the only draw back to this place is the fact that it sits in the middle of south point casino .	1255
1	the pet salon is professional , experienced and really cares about my dog . i can call a few days ahead of time and they always seem to be able to fit us in - which is so convenient ! they take the time to get to know your pet and listen to how you want your dog to look like ... not what they think your dog should look like ! the thing that always strikes me every time i go is that the place does n't smell like wet animals . i love the report cards they give too ! everything with this place is personalized to make your experience the best and they succeed every time .	3673
0	total bait and switch . came in for a simple battery replacement . quoted $ 10.79 . waited 5 minutes to get my watch back . then i am told it is $ 15.00 ! huh ? ? ? ? they charge and extra $ 5.00 to remove the watch band to get the the battery case that takes all of 6 seconds to do . i should of read the reviews on yelp first . do yourself a favor and go somewhere else that is more reputable and honest . p.s . the parking in this shopping center is a nightmare .	2307
0	poor quality oysters and crab . zero flavor in the crab legs . the meat was sort of brown ... oysters luke warm . not a fan . overpriced for the poor quality of seafood .	1255
0	this place is ridiculous . i got a groupon so i came here to get my oil changed . every time they take well over an hour ( most recently over 2 hours ! ) then they always give me a long list of things that need to be done before my car is safe to drive . however it 's still going !	2981
0	very good bagels ! i 'm submitting a review on the salads . i ordered an asian salad ( expensive ) and it consisted of a plate of lettuce , dry chicken pieces , and ( good ) crispies , with dressing on the side . nothing else on the salad-expensive . my friend enjoyed her 1/2 bagel sandwich .	325
0	the daytime bartender is great . very attentive and hospitable . once it 's shift change ... .leave . the night person was the complete opposite . the service sucked , we could n't keep her attention long enough to order , she only openly noticed us after we stood to leave ... . the only reason i 'm not giving 1 star is for the initial service when we walked in , before the day shift bartender last .	1959
0	their drive thru intercom is broken . i 'm waiting 15 minutes so far with a car in front and in back blocking me from fixing my mistake . i have n't even put my order in . tell my wife and kid i love them . for the love of god stay away if you want to live life outside this drive thru .	1382
1	i have been back to sakana for i do n't remember how many times since my last review , and i am still a big fan ! it is just so nice to have sakana in my neighborhood to make up my frequent cravings of some fresh water eel nigiri and agedashi tofu ! the service has been consistently friendly and attentive , and more importantly , the food has not disappointed me even once . and i will keep going back for some more ! : )	198
0	if i could give this place zero stars , i would . i had a reservation through orbitz , and when i got to payless , the guy said he had no cars to rent to me . seriously ? ! stuck in phx airport at 930pm with no car . horrible customer service . best to pay a little extra from another company and actually have the car you booked ready to pick up when you get off your flight .	3595
0	ordered two triple decker blt there was two pieces of bacon on the bottom layer and one tomato with the core left in and a piece of brown lettuce . the fries were burnt it was honestly disgusting they were black like they had been in the fryer all day two days even . just for reference in the photo the fries are not seasoned they are just charred	1115
1	great service , and 5 stars for pool and sauna ( steam room ) ! ! i 'm a korean from oc so unsurprisingly i know a thing or two about saunas and spas , and this gym has the core basics of them and its even generally clean ( if people follow the rules of showering before entering the pool/jacuzzi , yes , even after steam room ! ! a man was sweating and he just slid inside the jacuzzi without showering right after the steam room ) please just follow the rules and we can keep the pool and sauna area clean and friendly for all !	392
0	ca n't say that i 've ever really had an excellent experience with this company . they are definitely a three-star company . their prices are a little high . guys behind the counter typically pretty nice though . anytime i 've had to return something or get something under warranty never quite works out as painless as it should . when you 're in a pinch though and you need something quick you have to do what you have to do .	2632
0	terrible . just terrible . terrible customer service . terrible in every way possible . i absolutely hate receiving a package by dhl . both times i was forced to have to pick up my package because they are too incompetent to deliver it properly at my house . wish i could give negative stars .	1755
1	was quick to get in and received a good hair cut place was clean and the lady that cut my hair was nice .	3565
0	while the public comment that kate h. sent was kind and professional , two months later still no follow up despite being informed to expect otherwise after i shared the requested information . sadly , this is in line with the kind of experience i had with dwr that originally prompted my review .	613
1	this is the socially awkward and shy person 's dream come true . self serve yogurt and toppings with limited interaction with people . i am one of those shy folks and i love that i can go get some delicious blueberry tart yogurt , add some vanilla wafer yogurt and pay without having to say anything more than 'no i do n't want the receipt . '	2581
0	do n't order the so-called `` chicken balls with rice '' dish ( 菜遠雞球飯 ) from their afternoon tea menu . it 's a misnomer . there are no chicken balls and instead , it 's cheap chicken strips ( like the kind you get with noodle soups ) in a goop of thick starchy sauce ( 茨汁 ) . when i asked the server about this , he was like , `` yeah , it 's kind of like chicken balls but in strip form '' . ugh . waste of my $ 10.45 . rice was also hard and not fresh .	1173
0	0 stars . ordered food it was ice cold , they were missing the fries . instead of giving me a new meal they offered me 10 % off of my next order . i paid $ 23 for 8 small chicken wings .	393
1	cheryl is always great , it 's been a long time since i been in , but she remembered me , and how i liked my hair cut . she does a great job , and is very friendly ! ! i highly recommend her ! ! love her ! ! ! ! !	3281
1	very pleased with most of the cars and service we received during our recent trip . not a fan of the price range that is displayed when ordering a car , as opposed to a flat quote as in the states . gps/directions could use some work as they were off by a block or more for drop-off points .	2549
1	enterprise inside of dane county airport is easily accessible ( right across from baggage pick-up , with fast and friendly service ; a much better experience than with other enterprise locations . pick up and drop off was breeze .	2345
1	i 'd give a 5 star review if the owner was n't such an ass . but the staff is amazing and hard working . great job guys ! ! and girls .	2359
0	had many family and friends in town for a wedding . rooms were filthy . several rooms were never cleaned and my family went back to unmade beds & no towels . the manager was ignorant , too busy to go up to the room with my dad to see . comforters had other peoples food on them , floors dirty ... not vacuumed . stay away ... this is an embarrassment to the town .	2866
1	purchased a media console that i planned to refinish . at pick up , one of the employees broke one of the legs off somehow . hyrum , the manager , was a pleasure to work with ; fully refunded my money with no questions asked and repeatedly apologized for what happened .	2117
0	well all i can say is they came out to educate us on fixing our running toilet after 30 minutes of education and a quote of $ 1200 to replace our krohler toilet with some sub standard toilet they had on their truck we had a handyman fix it for $ 60 was just a bad customer experience all around	1015
1	first had emerson fry bread at the 2016 taco festival and it was the best taco i have ever had . i follow them on ig and facebook but i always seem to miss them by only a few hours . so when i heard they were going to be at the 2017 taco festival i bought a pair if tickets and searched them down ! i love this taco truck ! !	2937
0	one of the great appeals of whole foods is their prepare foods section , offering lots of various hot foods for a fair price . unfortunately compared to other whole foods , it is very small , only a fraction of other ones i used to go to . they do seem to do a good job offering products from various local vendors i 've noticed , offering many of the same products as from the farmer markets around here .	3874
1	a great talent casting site . this site lists castings for all clients . there is a small fee but worth it , not much . annie medina & patrice farmer are amazing	64
1	i like that this location is close to where i teach and close to home as well . i enjoy korean cuisine because of the fresh vegetables , lean proteins , and clean feel to their entrées . i enjoyed the chicken bibimbop which consists of fresh veggies , fried egg , grilled meat , all on a hot plate ! side relishes and kim chee accompanied the plate perfectly ! i enjoy the options here and would like to see what else the menu offers !	435
0	after over an hour wait , i was told it would be another 20 mins . the excuse - only 1 dentist was there that day since the others were on vacation . i had scheduled my appointment several days before so their scheduling issue was not excusable . i decided to take my business elsewhere !	2079
0	this place seriously needs to invest in some new tvs- they are from the 80s i think . maybe the 90s . the food is fine , the service is okay , but the main reason you go to a sports bar- to watch sports- is severely lacking .	2694
1	most of the counter people are patient and helpful to us diy dummies . it is appreciated !	23
1	if you are looking for an honest , caring electrician you 've come to the right place . we have used journey electric for our business and home . they are outstanding . thank you journey for caring about your customers . jamie & liz coffey	2258
0	over rated , over hyped , over priced . $ 7.25 for a chocolate malt is insane . no need for me to go back , i 'll make my own with hagen daas and save my cash .	3604
0	what happened ? we used to love this place ! tonight 's take out tasted like it came out of a frozen dinner box ( and i cringe as i write that comparison because the frozen dinners sometimes taste better ) ! ugh ! why would they fix something that was not broken ? ! ? our chicken was dry and powdery and the vindaloo tasted pasty : ( i am so sad to see another indian restaurant lose it 's touch !	1497
0	typical pt 's with an extra helping of arrogance and no fun allowed . the food is n't that great , the servers have the attitude of we are the corporate store so we are not friendly . this is one of those pt 's that you go to for only one of three reasons . you do n't have the gas to get anyplace else and are desperate for a drink , you have friends that insist on meeting a hot chick here or if there is no place else open .	1520
0	very rude . the man i had massaged my legs for not even 5 minutes and he used he got rocks for not even 15 seconds ! he rushed through my whole pedicure and the nail techs are super rude and unfriendly . definitely not coming back and they 're not getting a tip .	3682
0	such a horrible experience ... the food was horrible ... the owner is a jerk ... and the cops were even present when the owner started some sort of a scene outside . i would never return .	1193
1	i 've been using rhinos maid for ever , they have never let me down . they are reliable and affordable but the most of all , a company you can trust with your home . they even have a key to my house . they clean my house and office just the way i want . i am very happy with their service and their fees are always reasonable . i truly recommend them to all my friends and family .	3647
1	i am in town visiting my grandparents . all the staff was very friendly . they were accommodating to my grandparents dietary restrictions . the food was exactly the way menu was described .	1542
1	this is for their deli . i work in the complex and have at times eaten at subway until i learned they knew about jarod being a pedophile the whole time ( my opinion , they should be run out of business ) . so ! i really wanted a sandwich and decided to pop in to safeway and give their deli a try . i got their italian sandwich and ... .omg ... ..yum ! eating there again today . i 've never had a sandwich so good ! i will continue eating there and trying all the sandwiches !	3938
1	the boba here is such a great price point . you can get a gigantic drink for the same price as a small drink at other boba shops . the service is fast and the ladies there are so sweet . i recommend the passion orange green tea . the also have a vegan menu of drinks ! !	1763
0	scotty is gone . ron is a fake . does not give discounts to military but give free stuff to his fake biker buddies	3241
0	everyone has their own life experiences . my dealings with them might be different than yours . in not leaving feedback as a benefit for them to grow since i havnt found management to be involved anyway .	3104
1	this comfort inn is very convenient and clean . it 's proximity to nearby restaurants is a plus . right off interstate-17 . parking is ample . free wi-fi ... 1 good size heated pool and a spa too . room is clean . and guess what.. they have a good hot breakfast . we enjoyed the heated pool more than anything else , my kids had a real fun after coming from a dusty and hot weather in grand canyon . everything was worth it ... highly recommended ...	3818
1	fun/cute little store with lots to look at . great place for vegas souvenirs . staff full of energy and bubbly as heck . i 'm eating a hammond 's cookie dough chocolate bar as i write this review and i 'm saddened to say that i taste zero cookie dough : ( ... i want to come back to try the ice cream , though .	3722
1	great food , lovely presentation . nice surprise for a shopping center restaurant . ordered way too much food though : - )	626
0	i paid almost $ 24.00 for four tasteless souvlaki sticks . it would have been much cheaper to buy chicken breast and skewer them myself , that 's what they tasted like . clearly not marinated long enough .	2696
0	overrated . we drove there because were on vacation and hear they had several restaurants . that 's true , but the restaurant menus were unremarkable and the bars were one step above a college bar . during the day you 'll find all manner of sidewalk-blocking vendors hawking black and yellow merchandise for all of the sports teams . they left around 6:00 . not sure that 's normal , but it was a relief . this place is literally a strip . store/shops on 1 street , both sides . if you 're looking for average , you 've found it .	2606
0	good tacos . terrible service and waiting times were ridiculous to even get one . even drinks took forever . guys , get your kitchen and bar together . it 's not hard . it 's tacos ! ! es difícil entender porque no pueden sacar su comida en una manera más eficiente . los tacos son buenísimos pero la cocina , bar y los servidores necesitan una lección en cómo funcione un restaurante .	1469
0	the 'old vegas ' showgirl costumes were stunning . however , the show was rubbish . it 's a horrible mash of butchered showgirl meets high school recital . people were walking out halfway through . if the old school las vegas showgirl production is no longer popular ... this production will certainly kill it off for good . what a shame .	3069
1	great place . i was there recently based on other reviews and it is close to home . i am a breakfast anytime person so this place is likely to see me a few times a month . eggs and the breakfast potatoes were very nicely done . the vibe is a little loud so do n't go expecting an intimate scene with quiet conversation . they get busy but i see satisfied people leaving and smiles coming in . very good breakfast experience .	364
1	brought my foster son in to get a pedicure . he has down syndrome and is super talkative to people . the staff at bien nails were so great with him . talking and joking with him . during the pedicure they told him what they were doing and made him feel comfortable . they did a really great job on the pedicure also . we will keep coming back . and just an fyi : they have pedicures starting at $ 10	132
1	love the chicken and gravy ! always fresh and way better than most chicken places i have been to	862
0	when i went here with some friends , we had really bad service , and the pho was more expensive and not as tasty as pho hoa which is pretty much right across the street .	784
1	this place rocks ! being vegan-friendly is a plus . price for the bowls are reasonable . just wish there was a location in the university area .	209
0	not a fan ! my kids wo n't even eat them . they leave a nasty gritty feeling in your mouth and a bad after taste . my oldest went home and brushed her teeth it was so bad .	1770
1	this afternoon , i was at sephora searching for dior eyeshadow . i am very loyal to dior . however , i could n't find quite what i was looking for . a young woman , named meg , offered to help me find the right pigment of eyeshadow . and she patiently searched with me through about 5 brands until we settled on a lancôme palette , and she even showed me how to use it and made over my eyes . she was so kind and patient , she made me want to shop more and i ended up buying some perfume . i found my experience very pleasant .	2574
1	i 'm only giving it 4 stars because it 's an easy and convenient place to take the kids in the winter . we being our own dinner and eat in the food court then they can play in the play area for awhile . if it was n't for this i would give it a 3 . west towne is by far a better mall . but east towne is n't the worst i 've been too . it has potential to be a better mall if they got good stores in the vacant areas .	2594
1	jennifer is awesome ! she was able to please and size my very picky and in between size 14 year old , which is not an easy task . no tears for mom . she knew what to try next just like a pro . yay . thank you jennifer you 're amazing .	3101
1	i have taken 3 different pairs of shoes to be re-heeled . price is good ( $ 10 ) , he does a great job , polishes them , and gets them back in a timely manner .	1266
0	very pretty . nice decor . do not order the veggie burger ! it is mushy and tastes like canned mushroom soup . the fries were great . compliments to the chef . the steak sandwich was barely edible ... i could not chew it ( i do have all my teeth ) . caesar salad was decent . chef gets a light pat on the back for this dish . the wine tasted like wine . for $ 7 i could n't ask for more . compliments to whoever poured it . water was very moist . service was fine .	1529
1	how could you not like this place ? ! ? they have the best food in kent , hands down . it 's never too crowded , they always have excellent customer service and the food tastes fantastic !	675
0	i went there for lunch today . it took a server 25 minutes to even recognize i was there . one seeded i told my server what i wanted . 20 minutes later she brought out the wrong lunch . i had explained to her that was the wrong lunch and took additional 20 minutes to get my proper lunch . as i was ringing out i had explained to the manager what happened . he got very defensive . to top it all off ... they gave me some others leftovers..	784
0	i 'm not really sure why this place exists . it 's always empty and the one time i went in there , i promptly walked out . what a waste of space .	2765
0	its ok ; 2 stars for food and 3 for service . they make a good effort . the fish is edible and if you live here it should suffice . that 's my opinion & of course subjective . but giving it 5 stars is like asking an italian for a recommendation and they give 5 stars to olive garden .	198
0	literally highway robbery ! ! ! ! ridiculous charge rates . they do n't nickel & dime you ... they $ 10 and $ 20 you for everything . a short trip will cost almost $ 20 . i 'll do whatever it takes to not got on this road !	2336
0	ridiculous place for renting an apartment . i have lived at 410 for one year . before i moved out , i have cleaned everything . i can accept the carpet cleaning fee , but there are some fees are just does n't make sense to me . $ 35 dollars to remove a hook on the wall ? 6hours cleaning ( $ 25/hr ) . even though there are nothing to clean ? this company just want charge more and more money from students , i would highly recommend students do not sign lease with this ridiculous company .	222
1	great place to live . it 's real close to a fry 's for groceries and to the fiesta mall for shopping and random other things . also , close to the 60 so it 's very convenient to get to other places quick . when i lived here ( 2008/2009 ) i had very little problems , the management was always friendly and tried to get maintenance done as soon as possible . the only reason i did not continue living here was because i was moving to another state .	1715
0	once again stop for my morning coffee and this place is so mismanaged . three baristas and not a one is organized . fifteen people in line ..one cashier .. one actual barista .. and one walking around .. this place needs more help in the mornings .. the ten minutes standing in line watched four people step out of line and at least the same walk by ..look .. and keep on walking.. your losing business	453
0	first , ticket agent did n't know his movies or the stars that played in them . second , they did n't have iced tea . was offered flavored icee ! how is that comparable to iced tea ! ? third , brought in a large bag popcorn from a movie i watched last week . i was told `` we do n't do refills '' . simple put , i 'm staying loyal to harkins theater ... an arizona locally owned theater chain . 3 strikes amc ... we 're out ! ! !	2406
1	omg i love this place ! huge portions of rice and noodles filled past the container rim , delicious food and when you ask for spicy ... . its actually spicy ! not many places as liberal with spice as this place , most foods places when you ask spicy its tamed . i got lucky learning about this place it truly is one of the best chinese food places i 've ever had the pleasure of eating . i 'll be a returning customer for sure . thank you for existing in this world of mediocre copy cat manchu woks , you my friends are on a whole other level please keep up the good work	522
0	i went to get my tire patched and the manager told me i needed new lug nuts . really ! ! the only ways you can wreck a lug nut is by using the wrong tool to take the lug nut off . nobody has ever touched the lug nuts on that tire except for discount tire and now they want to charge me for their mistake ? ! ! this is unethical ! !	2250
1	this is a must see in pittsburgh with all the history and buildings to tour . there is also a wonderful greenhouse , and the family home is interesting . heather was our tour guide and did a wonderful job .	3461
0	went there today to check it out girl at front desk unprofessional was rude . place looked dirty . children room were hot while the lobby wad cool . when i asked about potty training she told me my g.son would have to wait till he was 2yrs old before they will help potty train .	3483
1	we stopped into public storage this past week to rent a space and met sierra . she was very professional , nice and helpful . all my questions were answered and she even offered to sell me boxes and bubble wrap if i needed them . the storage unit was super clean and the office was well kept and orderly .	1857
0	nails came out a little sloppy . i agreed to $ 25 full set and they charged me for $ 35 . customer service sucks ! they make no conversation and are not friendly .	2297
0	food is good . service is ok . i 've had extra items added to my bill on two different visits . i will not be returning .	255
1	if you are looking to buy a digital keyboard , i highly recommend the sales rep named chris p. in the keyboard section on the ground floor at cosmo . he is knowledgeable about the products , tries to understand clients ' needs and budget , and then recommends products that best suit those needs . based on our conversation , we purchased the native instruments komplete kontrol s88 88-key controller online during the black friday sale .	2682
1	wow ! i have been holding back for like 6 months from getting eyebrows threaded bcs i 've had bad experiences . just moved here and decided to go with farida based on great reviews here on yelp . must say she is by far the best i 've ever been to ! ! ! both eyebrows match ! ! ! i told her a little as to how i like them but let her do her thing . she took her time . was so impressed when she showed me ! happy client ! ! all the ladies there seemed so nice ! very warm and welcoming ! ! do n't go anywhere else !	3806
1	it was a hotel . it was clean and comfortable . what else can you ask for ? well a lot of things , but if you just want a clean hotel , this definitely has that .	3248
0	do n't go . food was horrible . it all tasted like spaghetti o 's . my `` salad '' was just shredded iceberg ..so disappointed . waiter was nice and polite .	189
0	these guys are not trustworthy i recommend you go too another mechanic one guy gives one price and the other gives another price	2846
0	avoid this place ! ! i do n't recommend coming here . i waited almost an hour after my appointment and still was n't helped . wasted my time .	2346
1	got my fiancées engagement ring custom made from chalmers for a great price and phenomenal quality . we ended up getting our wedding bands through chalmers as well . chalmers is always so friendly and helpful . if you are looking for beautiful custom jewelry , then this place is for you .	1982
1	polite , professional , and thorough ! ! ! i went in for a routine preventive care checkup , staff and dentist are friendly . definitely going back	3003
1	had a $ 3900 failure on the moonroof of my bmw x5 . the moonroof was stuck in the ventilate position in the winter time which is not fun . i took the car to the dealer i bought it from . got a loaner car , came back a few days later and picked the car up and happily paid my $ 200 deductible . i sold the car a year later to someone and transferred the coverage to them and they paid me way more than the car was worth because it had the coverage on it and they didnt have to worry about the 9 year old bmw breaking for a couple more years . win win	3496
1	this is a hard one to review . the work they have done for me is impeccable but the prices are beyond ridiculous . when it is something i ca n't fix or hem myself , they do a great job and are their work looks like it was right from the store . they are cash only . no price sheet up which always irritates me to not even have a ballpark idea of what it will be . you do have to pay in advance the full amount . worth it if you ca n't do it yourself but be prepared to pay a lot .	2702
0	everything tastes over processed . very disappointed with the orange chicken and walnut shrimp . will not be going back .	474
1	dr. micheal and kelly run a clean , professional and efficient practice . i 've been going there for many years for routine cleanings and fillings . i finally succumbed to getting my wisdom teeth extracted , and dr. micheal made the experience as painless as possible . he was very quick and thorough , and i healed very well . thanks for taking such good care of me all these years !	2576
1	visited recently for a work lunch . everyone was impressed with their food selections . pizza and salads were really good . fairly standard pizza but it was very good . service was ok but nothing too special .	705
1	ryans pet supply has a wonderful staff in the repair shop . the best customer service in town .	3904
1	this is a hidden gem of a restaurant . every meal has been outstanding . these guys know how to put wonderful flavors together . my wife and i have had several dishes- the pork chop , linguini and clams , blackened salmon , chicken parm , bucatini bolognese , and a pasta special that was offered in the fall were all excellent and flavorful . the food is creative , original and delicious . portions and prices are spot on .	161
0	there is a reason that they have such a bad yelp score . the place is a mess , staff are awful and the management does n't care .	195
0	i paid 125 $ and made the mistake of thinking cleaning people knew to clean floors around a toilet and glass on picture frames , apparently they do not . they did not clean or dust any tables or mirrors in one bedroom and they washed the floors but when i wiped up water with a paper towel my floors were still dirty . when i called to complain they said they could send someone out to fix the job but since i had already cleaned myself i did n't want them back . my suggestion do not use this company but if you do make sure when they take you on a walkthrough you look at everything thourouly	2854
1	this is our second visit here in 2 days . the staff member at the register gave us a great overview of everything . the food is sooo fresh . sarah had a banana shake and it was full of real bananas not just syrup like most other places . i had the chicken sandwich and i thought it was one of the best sandwiches i 've have quality wise in a long time . the sign people dedicated to quality really does apply here . try the blueberry ginger sauce . great ! !	998
1	meet my future wife and girlfriend of the last 7 years here and come back often even though we moved to the other side of town . nice spot still .	1520
1	vivian did my nails and i love them . she was able to correct a problem with my nails and even came in on her day off to fix them ! i really appreciated it and my nails look great ! i have also gotten a few pedicures here and i love their charcoal detox pedi . it is so relaxing and worth the money ! customer service is always great . they are always busy so i suggest making an appointment	3333
0	your sol orwell is not a cookie it 's a brownie . stop calling it a cookie ! it 's also a big rip off . it 's a 7 bite brownie . it 's not a giant cookie . it 's a small brownie !	390
1	just happened to stop in last night and i am so glad i did . this is such a cute little seafood/sushi joint . the service was attentive and friendly . the food was absolutely exceptional ! ! ! and very fair pricing for the size of the portions . fish-n-bowl is my new favorite restaurant . i will pass on ayce sushi from now on and stop in here instead . much higher quality than i 've had elsewhere in town . do n't sleep on this hidden little gem in sw .	985
0	all of vegas was booked and of course this place has vacancy . i would 've been happier sleeping in my car . parking is crappy and rooms are worse than your local roach motel . if it 's between this or the roach motel- i pick the roach motel .	2976
1	was looking for a local mani-pedi on my recent stay in phoenix and found beautiful skin and nails in a small office park just a few miles from the biltmore . the manicurists were friendly , funny and efficient . i was in and out on time with a great looking set of nails . easy on-line booking is a bonus .	3549
1	i can not tell you how much we love their wings ! this is the only place we go to get them now . fried pickles are great too ! wish i could comment on the other food but we never get anything else .	1248
1	we had a great experience from the no pressure salesman to the installers . i was worried at first after reading some other reviews but we had a great carpet experience . they came when they said they would , moved our furniture , installed the carpet and cleaned up . i would recommend them to anyone . they also are much faster than a box store . we are very happy .	694
0	$ 79 dollars for a air filter and regular oil . keep taking advantage of wives , i bet you feel like men .	1093
0	i decided to try this place based on the reviews . i ordered the 6 wing combo extra crispy ! when i got home and started to eat the wings they were no where near extra crispy , barely even done ! i had to pick and eat the pieces that i actually thought were done because i did n't want to waste my money completely ! what a disappointment ! if i wanted semi done wings i would have asked for that !	1397
1	we had such a great experience here . decided to take our toddler here after a not so great experience at a grown up barbershop . we made an appointment with heather . we were late but she did n't mind . she put on elmo for him and was so incredibly sweet . he got the coolest haircut ! ! i was nervous taking him to a kids place thinking they could n't give him the kind of cut i wanted but it looked better than the grown man barbershop . we will definitely be back to see heather !	260
1	i come here when i get a nostalgic for home and family . good selection of filipino/asian ingredients and foodstuffs . they fry fish to order and have hot food offerings as well . so happy it 's just across the street too !	1595
0	rip-off central . they did not know anything about my watch , installed the insert incorrectly and the sold me on a horribly over-priced band made of blue lizard skin . when i brought it in to complain , they arrogantly told me that it was installed correctly and that me i did not know what i was talking about . this was in regards to a watch i had owned for over eight years . definitely go elsewhere if you 're looking to have anything repaired .	2307
0	i ca n't begin to say just how terribly bad this place actually is . a converted office building with poor soundproofing , so much so that they offer guests ear plugs so that they might have a better opportunity to sleep . they offer delivery and pick up to sky harbor airport , but when we returned from a trip there was no one to pick us up at the airport , so we had to hire a cab to take us back to the hotel to get our car back . this place should be closed down to protect the public from this disaster of a hotel and extremely poor business practices .	3162
1	waffles with bananas and peanut butter , you just ca n't beat it ! prices were very reasonable too ! a great little place to grab some breakfast !	580
0	rude and extremely non understanding . last straw was when the dentist hit a un frozen nerve in one of my back molars . pain from my tooth to my toe . this dental practice single handily made me afraid of dentists . so i stopped going , missed two appointments due to being terrified and they followed up by dropping me as a client .	1751
0	becky w , dressed as a manager but ca n't assist someone to the customer service/cashing area because she has a full line and only 2 employees . if you want to wait in line 15 minutes to cash something do n't come here even a coin star	3096
0	omg wtf ... i send few documents to print i even ask on on regular paper nothing fancy i done few times $ 0.14cents a page i go to pick up almost a dollar per page because they decide for me to print in colors ... yeah black ink and a yellow lines around the pages that is 500 % more than i was expecting to pay . of course the was a different person at the counter . i may have to buy a printer after all in amazon of course ... lol no wonder why they are failing n closing .	3587
0	meeehhhhhh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! very average at best , much betta options out there .	1016
1	just went today ! it is not closed anymore he has reopened . very fun and he made it easy and was very helpful , as well as letting you being very hands on with your project	3284
0	if you do n't want to try and fix the issue on my car simply tell me . i wo n't waste time coming here and i 'll take my mazda and its factory warranty elsewhere .	2816
1	i love the state fair it 's fun and i only been there once and do n't regret it one bit , i have n't really had fun like that in a while .	2076
0	today i came by to try one of their smoothies . i ended up choosing `` here comes the sun '' , and honestly it tasted like something i could 've gotten at tropical smoothie or jamba juice . it was n't really worth the $ 8 i spent . i took a few sips and threw it away . it did n't wow me whatsoever . i may come back to try other things , but unfortunately the southwest side of town is already saturated with other juice/smoothie places that 's worth the money .	3897
1	shocking . 5 stars for a dunkin donuts . i gave this a 5 stars because it 's very rare to have really really good customer service , especially through the drive thru- and surprisingly my iced coffee ( with hazelnut and sugar ) was made just right . which is also a shocker comparing to other dunkin donuts . ( sadly did n't get to get the drive thru employee 's name to shout him out ) but good service for us at our first time at this location . thanks dd ( paradise location ! ) .	579
1	awesome beers and really nice pub food . definitely recommend this place . so if you are in yonge street and walking around dundas . go and drink the awesome beers from the 3 brewers . hanging around you will get hungry . do n't worry the service is excellent ! !	670
1	rug cleaning is really good . nice people and great prices . 8x10 white area rug came out beautiful .	3055
1	i really do n't care for ross but i like this location . i could n't find shoes anywhere but this location has lots of shoes compared to other ross i 've been to .	3778
1	outstanding coffee experience . coffee island is the starbucks of greece . they serve delicious pastries and sandwiches along with single origin coffees from all over the world . they sell their high quality coffees and teas for home in wonderfully branded packaging . what completed the authentic experience for me was their greek coffee made in a greek copper briki . i 'll be back to sit on their patio .	3183
0	service stinks , server got our food order wrong . takes the chicken and `` slides '' it off the plate and it takes another 20 minutes to get the ribs we ordered . my friends steak came raw when it was ordered well done and the topping on the cake was we got over charged . completely dissatisfied with this place ! ! ! !	1491
1	great patio for a dinner . the service was excellent , friendly and fast . we waited only minutes for the entrees , which were cooked perfectly and tasted fantastic . cornmeal-encrusted tilapia with lobster risotto and green beans and beurre blanc was excellent . so was the ahi tuna .	979
1	i went to shopper and i had great customer service.also this location is close to the subway	1089
0	oh grace , you are too rude ! ! customer service is extremely poor and how to you sell a tanning package without the color ? ? if your going to advertise a '' deal '' then be clear on what your getting . this review is mainly about extremely rude customer service . when is it appropriate for your staff to roll their eyes at the customers ? ! ?	980
1	lynette did a great job with my dermaplaning and photo facial . i leave looking like a new person .	2620
1	i am always in and out quick with their speedy service & the employees are always pleasant to converse with . i often get a different sandwich every time i have been in & it is always accurate , fresh , & filling . with the amount of meat they put on their sandwiches it really puts other sub shops to shame ( *cough*cough*subway*cough* ) ! a ton of options to pick from & you 're always going to get a great tasting 'wich !	724
0	i would honestly give them 0 stars but i had to give one to start the review . do not go to this mcdonald 's after hours . we sat in the drive thru for 10 minutes waiting for the cashier to come to the window and she never came . we finally drove off only to find her getting out of her car ! it was a horrible customer experience .	1220
0	there 's this bitch there with red hair n that bitch fucked up my order so many times we finna run a train on that bitch	857
1	this is hands down one of the best jamaican restaurants in the gta ! i was greeted by a pleasant female server with a smile . no long wait time , free wifi , tasteful and edible food well pleasing to the eye and stomach . ca n't wait to go back again	1355
0	too many bums and panhandlers . you walk in and you get bothered for a cigarette . you see these bums playing a few cents on the slots and they expect free drinks all night . then you hear them yelling at the staff . then you smell them , that 's the worst part . security should get rid of these malcontents .	2928
1	used avis twice in the past month at the las vegas airport location and i had a very wonderful experience . i was helped by albert on both visits . albert looked up my reservation very quickly and went above and beyond to assist me with my needs . made it quick and easy for us and got into the vehicle right away for a great price . thank you albert and the avis crew at the las vegas airport ! -ron v .	3129
0	ideal image lies and writes long contracts to protect themselves . after 2 years , i still have hair growing in the treatment area . i still have to shave every week and they will not refund and you can not sue . it cost me 1000 's of dollars . after the ninth treatment you have to pay more for more treatments even though the hair should have been gone .	3417
1	my boyfriend and i justoved in down the street and do n't have much food in our fridge . we decided to offer some jimmy john 's . they 've change their online ordering . but still easy to use . the delivery want as fast as i was expecting from previous experiences . it took nearly 30 minutes . thats not exactly freaky fast in my book . thats just a regular delivery time . as far as the food good , it was good . i got the beach club and added bacon , which i wo n't do again . the bacon was way too salty for my liking .	1340
0	terrible management , the blonde lady in `` charge `` all she does is take personal phone calls for her stuff on the office phone , we have been waiting for towels for more than one hour , the pool is dirty and all we got is nothing ... not happy at all . so sad this person is stealing somebody else 's job . i 'm usually very positive and patience but today im definitely not happy at all	2832
1	been here quite a few times and i 've gotten the chicken katsu shoyu ramen each time . they give you a really good serving size of katsu and ramen and the katsu is actually really good ! best i 've had so far in pittsburgh . i had the curry katsu rice once too but i prefer the ramen ( was a tad spicy for me ) . the service is great too the ladies who work there are really sweet ! !	812
1	love ross ! found some great things . each ross is a bit different . this one has the arrangement abit different . also maybe you will find only one shirt rather then 3 of them . the fitting room was closed but they made a fitting room in the middle of the store which is really weird and there 's only two rooms . one room is a bit bigger then the other .	695
0	i 've had good experiences here , but this past weekend they certainly let too many people into the spa because it was so crowded ! no where to sit , talking so loud everywhere , i could even hear it in my `` relaxing '' massage . the spa is gorgeous but they ran out of towels and women were literally waiting in line to use the showers , facilities etc . for example , two women were fighting over the blow dryer i was using before i was done using it . i also got my shoes stolen from the jacuzzi . i would n't recommend it or go back based on this experience .	2305
1	hubby & i came for dinner . generous portions , & they were delicious . service was top notch . the meal was leisurely paced which was exactly what we were looking for .	1242
0	came on sunday as yelp and sign at place says they open on sundays . i arrived just before 11am . waited 20 minutes and no one showed up .	1551
0	terrible customer service . the two ladies at the front are not personable or even nice . i took my car my here due to a car accident and the other persons insurance . it seems that since they do n't have to earn my business they do n't have to be kind . at least greet me with a smile . the coordination with enterprise rent a car was terrible as well . enterprise was great just the clarification on their end of how i proceed was not correct . my service person lisa was the only good thing about them . she called me and gave me updates and was very nice .	1926
1	five stars service , high quality product , the roses are beautiful , quick hand delivery also the customer service was so helpful !	2284
0	low rating for the service . at the bar and only 5 other people and three tables with people behind me yet the bartender was super distracted . i ordered traditional , he asked me again because he forgot to put my order in and boneless came out . he fixed it quick but had to ask for napkins went through those quick he walked by enough to know i needed more but i had to ask anyway . i even bought some sauce for the fundraiser but had to wait to pay my tab while he chatted with a server with no order then only brought my credit card slip and not my itemized tab . sorry for bashing but disappointing	383
1	could n't believe how good the food was for the price- i 'm talking meal and two glasses of wine for $ 18 . great spot for us college students when you need food late at night . waiter seemed a little rude but could 've been the time of night we were there . i had the avocado and brie sandwich , friends had shrimp pad thai , and the grilled cheese .	2718
1	i may be writing this review too early but i had a great experience getting a mail box from this place today ! the lady was so polite and helpful as this is my first time doing something like this . she even said i could do a change of address form there which is way better the going to the post office ! so far so good ! and the price for a box was the cheapest i found and it is 24hour access !	1393
0	after all the great reviews , i expected a good car wash and great service . not , the guy on my car spent the whole time talking to other workers and trying to flirt with every girl that was getting gas ! when he told me it was done and that the qc guy was on cell . right as i got my car it started to rain , of course , when i got in my car i could immediately see that he had n't done my windows or dash . what a waste of 30 mins and $ 27 incl tip ! ! ! ! ! !	2359
0	now i see why they are rated so low ! ! ! ca n't believe this . made an a pickup request saturday . was told after 9am on monday called about 11:00 and was told ... '' oh , we pick up between 9-5 . called again at 3:30 and was told , `` we only pick up in your area between 3-5 '' would have been nice to have gotten this information up front so i could have kept my other appointment or rescheduled them ... .like fed ex a lot better ! ! ! so if you do go with them as for a firm time ... and good luck ! ! !	556
0	this business is extremely unprofessional ! i purchased three dozen cupcakes for my daughter in laws baby shower . paid for my order on may 7th the party was may 14th when i arrived to pick up my order . the business was closed with a notice stating the locks were changed for non payment of back rent . needless to say i was extremely upset because this establishment was locked out two days after i paid for my order . i did not receive a phone call , text or email . that they would not be able to fulfill my order . proceed with caution if you are going to work with this bakery .	981
0	yuck . it 's cold there are no heaters . went in on mon nt and instead of nfl they had big bang theory on all tvs . $ 15 for 5 coronas and not enthusiastic service . pass !	704
1	we came here to look and my husband fell in love with a chihuahua dachshund mix puppy . we also got the veterans discount and the adoption fee was half off . i definitely recommend inquiring about that if you or your spouse is military . the puppy seems to be in great health . and they take donations so even if you ca n't adopt you can contribute .	2689
0	this company does not follow they 're hireing guidelines.they say a background check of 5 years.however , they go back over 20years.and hold against you what you mite have done 20+ years ago.so if your thinking about applying for a driver 's job , & you have a background.do n't waste your time..i , like millions , believe people can and do change.20 years come on veyo !	1232
0	this is a tough review to write , from a man 's perspective i did n't care for goat feathers . they really did n't have a lot of things for men . we visited other antique shops in the area , and one in particular had a lot of cool items for men . i know this is a boulder city local favorite , i found that most of their items were overpriced . example : vintage travel trunk was $ 120 dollars . so i looked on craigslist and ebay and found the exact same trunk for $ 40 .	1526
1	perfect place for lunch ! the variety is great and the service is really fast .	1365
0	i went here for waxing and the first time it was great . when i returned this week it was another story . the esthetician heather was terrible . she was in such a rush that she was literally ripping strips off of me as hard as she could . i have bruises to prove it ! she did n't even pat the strips down on to the wax before ripping it off . she was not thorough at all . this is an experience that i will not be returning for .	228
1	these guys are fast and good ! they really took the time to make my truck shine . i am very happy with their service and attention to detail .	3899
0	absolute nightmare . will never deal with them again . everything from the installation to the store manager was horrendous . do not shop here ! ! ! ! !	616
1	okay i 'm visiting from cali and i 'm so familiar with little dive bars so i thought i 'd give this a try ! martin was our bartender and it was pretty busy for a sunday night i did n't expect a lot of people to be there but he handled everyone 's order accordingly with politeness ! he was playing some good music while making some bomb micheladas with a room full of people . i will definitely make this my go to spot when i 'm down visiting because of the good service i received tonight ! !	850
0	lovely ambience and the appetizers were very well put together but the main course lacked flavor and the service while polite was horrendously slow ( and our waiter was only serving 2 or 3 other small tables ) . disappointing .	785
0	i 'd be all in favor of a great chocolate place on campus , and i 'd even be willing to pay for it , but this is n't it . i have been lured in several times by how good everything looks that they sell , but almost every time i regretted my purchase . their chocolate simply tastes cheap ( which does n't come out so much in the truffles , but is very obvious in the plain chocolate and the chocolate-covered shortbread etc . ) very disappointing . i had coffee once , and it was so awful , i had to chuck it .	3787
0	i went there with my friend on a friday for lunch and we were really disappointed with the food taste . first we ordered calamari , i definitely had better ones . then some dim sum , i did n't like them . i ca n't recall the name we tried a dish of pork which was inside a dough kinda thing , that was ok because it did n't taste like anything . that was for sure my first and last visit there	113
0	good ambience but food is below average . their are plenty of other options around this area . food is super generic , even though green tea is on the house . wo n't be coming back for sure ! ! ! !	1123
0	just happened to be nearby when i stayed in lake las vegas ... peeped my head into what is one of the smallest casinos i 've seen ! no table games ... everything is video ... .even a video roulette and video black jack with a dealer . i guess i should n't expect much since there is n't much in the lake las vegas area ... .	3692
0	terrible customer service . walked into store to make major purchase , wanting to support a specialized store in plumbing and not a big box store . not one employee would acknowledge me . it 's very apparent the employees have an attitude that the customer needs them and not the other way around . needless to say i made my purchases at the `` big box store ''	2825
1	what 's to say ! it 's a grocery store with what ya need downtown . it 's not hipster or shady..it 's just a good , simple grocery store with a great mix of produce , organic and other baked goods . the prices are fair even though some things i know are cheaper elsewhere ; for many of us it means not having to drive so its all good .	1914
1	i had a great experience here . first , there was no pet fee . yay ! second , the bed was very comfortable . yes , it is minimalistic but the rooms were clean and they have a bar and pool table in the lobby . the bartender , roderick , was great and they had christmas ale on tap . i will definitely return next time i 'm in town .	3522
1	i have to admit i was skeptical when they served our soft drinks in a can instead of a fountain drink and then no soup well i was sure it would be a disappointment but well then the entrees came and proved me wrong . my s & s pork was great even the bell pepper was eaten , my daughters chow mein was great the best we have had here in las vegas in over 3 years . my wife thought the pan fried noodles would be the big ones like we are used to but oh well now we know . the only reason this is not a 5 is the soup .	561
0	horrible customer service . i went in and met with one of the reps about getting some rims for my bmw . we looked at several different options and i made my decision . i was told i would her back from him in a few days time . after a week i called and left 3 messages . i never heard from them and ended up buying my rims elsewhere . they did n't even give me a chance to spend my money . after reading the other review.. i would have to consider myself lucky .	978
0	was a fan when they opened.. coffee was good , and enough seating inside and out.staff is great , they try very hard to get your order right.i even liked the little glass enclosed area.with comfy grey chairs..but the last few times the coffee was weak , and other guests were a little rowdy teens , so i took my weak coffee to the trash can and left..do n't see myself returning..	361
1	yesterday was mother 's day and my family and i made a reservation earlier in the week to eat here . they had the table ready for us when we arrived and we sat down immediately . our waiter was extremely nice and patient with everyone . we got our drinks and food in a very timely manner and everything was delicious . no one had any problems with their food , except one and the waiter fixed it before she could even tell him what was wrong . my drink from the bar was excellent . great lunch for all 13 of us !	201
1	omg - the best ! ! ! the key is patience and picking . for example , when i got there , i was a walk-in ( reservations rec. ) . one-by-one , the lady or manager guy motioned that i was next . i said `` no '' like 3x . when i was there , there were 2 guy cutters and 4 lady cutters . for me , the lady cutter that is anally attentive ( just watch her cut other people 's hair ) and the lady cutter who is the best dressed ( did not wear a uniform ) are the best cutters . am i pleased ? totally .	2181
0	wowww what a huge disappointment . i think anybody who have no idea about how indian food should taste like will give this place a 5 star rating . if i can i would give this place -100 rating but unfortunately that 's not possible . the hostess was nice and friendly but the food was disgusting i am not even going to say bad it was disgusting . never every going back	1540
0	horrible place , had their coctel de elote and got some canned yellow corn ! hope it was a bad night , singers were drunk as hell or they sounded like it . could n't get the guts to try anything else . thank god its in the back hidden ! no one should endure this pain !	190
0	would give no stars if i could ! chris the owner is a body shaming nazi and will take your deposit and give you a completely different tattoo then from what you wanted . not to mention the lines are extremely uneven ! do not come here ! !	1658
1	this place is great ! kayaks and paddle boards for rent . everyone working here has a great attitude . they have complimentary bug spray too . lake is great , recommend going under the bridge if you want to hop in the water as there 's a fair amount of kelp in the immediate lake . definitely come here for a fun afternoon on the water !	1291
1	for a old `` mom & pop '' local casino it has the best food in town . been coming here for 22 years and never disappointed . i say the closest thing to fine dining for a local neighborhood casino restaurant that would very well rival most of the strip casinos .	3378
1	love the potato soup and blt . also have great breakfast sandwiches . you ca n't really go wrong with anything on the menu .	1387
1	love spinning here ! it 's always a hard workout and i 've only been to the beginner classes - ca n't imagine what the advanced ones are like . the mon and wed evening teachers are great and play fun music . after a crazy day at work , this is the perfect outlet and a great way to clear your mind . the only other spin class i 've done were at la fitness - these are 100x better . it 's intense , you never sit down , black lights and fun music and everyone is super nice and helpful . i 've been coming here for more than a year and would recommend it to anyone !	3477
1	had a great experience , i went to drop off my note5 with a cracked screen , this was the 4th place i tried the other 3 spot did n't even want to touch my phone . there was a turnaround of about two hours , when i got my phone again carl told me there was something wrong with the screen that my stylus was n't working so he was totally honest about it . today i went back and got my phone fix free of any further charges . they took care of me definitely a+ service !	2930
0	worst customer service ! the guy should be a car salesman . not only that , they are way over priced . i went to home depot and saved a ton of money on the same hanging basket ... and it looked better ! wo n't be back ...	2281
1	great service and food . the staff is very cordial and the food is delicious . the location is very convenient , just off loop 101 .	581
1	i went here last night with some friends for the first time . the bartenders are great from the swing to graveyard . the crowd is a mix . some people go there for the food , some for the sports , but i went for the drinks . they have a nice selection . pizza was great . they even have a nice lounge area in the back with a huge flat screen . only reason i have four stars is because they did n't have a pool table .	1520
1	i 'm glad this location is close to my pad . woohoo ! ! ! ! !	2469
0	first time , ordered the turkey . the sandwich was plain , cafeteria style . the tomatoes were mushy and the turkey tasted like it had been refrigerated for a long time . i only ate half of the sandwich before i could n't stomach it anymore . the staff was friendly , and they did get my order right . however , the music was too loud .	1475
0	order 3 kronuts through uber & realized it was a big mistake . the strawberry fields was so hard when i bit into it i did n't dare go into the other 2 . i 've had cronuts here before & they were delicious . i 'm not sure why they just put them in a box made for a dozen & did n't put them in the individual plastics like before ? ? but after this delivery i will never again . not a good way to wan na keep customers coming back .	3487
1	fast , simple , cool people , 5 stars . do n't let these bad reviews get to you , i drove in and got finished up in about 2,3 minutes .	2208
1	i call them the apple of dentistry . they always seem to be using the latest and greatest dental equipment , which i respect . they 're incredibly knowledgable and do a fantastic job . i decided to write this review after my current dentist ( i no longer live in pittsburgh ) was raving about the quality of my previous dental work . i 'm surprised by the negative reviews . i always had a great experience at dind and referred many people there .	697
1	qpolish is an amazing nail place ! this was my first time here and i will definitely be back ! eric did my manicure and leah did my pedicure and they were both very friendly and kind . their work was outstanding and well worth the price . i 've been getting my nails done for 4 years now and i 've been to many salons but by far this one has topped them all . it 's very clean , well decorated , and made me feel comfortable . thank you qpolish !	744
1	went there tonight ( wednesday ) it was so relaxing . celebrating a mellow a birthday with wine and girlfriends . service was excellent and price great . wed they have happy hour 4pm-close . nice wine selection and tasty food . will go back . hubby will like the beer selection and scotch .	49
0	i 'm so appalled by what i 'm listening to while waiting for my food at this location ! the cooks and servers cursing back and fourth using the f word freely and saying how people 's orders are bs in the full form ! how on earth is this acceptable for employees ! this place has great food but needs to be re-staffed asap !	1387
0	very loud with a large crowd to match . came here seeking suds and we found it - we also found some poutine and other hearty fare to coat the stomach with . i liked the flight of beers that you could get - so much that i have a hard time remember which ones i enjoyed the most . the brown ale sticks out as the best but the others just seemed like regular beer after a while . staff needs to be more attentive - after we got our beer , she pretty much disappeared for an hour . my friend had fun hitting the frowny face on the feedback machine for five minutes while we paid the bill .	670
0	horrible . paid 45 for a gel manicure . i was not expecting that ! everywhere else is 25-30 and the manicure is n't even all that fancy to pay that much . they do n't have much staff either .	2390
1	i purchased a groupon for this location and i expected the experience to be common to say the most , but the staff was very friendly and fun remembered our names and greeted us every visit . i highly recommend this location as i have seen great results .	2588
1	swiss chalet , step aside . kenny rogers chicken , step aside . this is the best rotisserie chicken you 'll have in your life , and paired with the seasoned french fries , this place earns it 's consistently high rating . a combo consisting of 1/2 chicken , salad and fries with spicy bbq sauce ( for only $ 10 , extremely reasonable for the quality ) is enough to feed two very hungry people . it 's cost effective , it 's delicious , it 's rotisserie romados ! : ) p.s . do n't forget to pick up a portugal custard tarts in the neighborhood ! it 's as authentic as it can get in montreal !	1109
1	great country club and course . all the staff was very friendly and accommodating . the course is gorgeous and in great shape . we played the sunrise and canyon nines . the practice area is great . the cart girls , service and food at the turn were excellent . challenging course , but fair and a lot of fun . we were able to play in 3.5 hours . much better course , service , staff , practice facility , clubhouse etc than the bears best and closer to the strip . if you can play this one then you should . i would like to play it more often .	3869
1	this place is by far the best hookah lounge in las vegas . immediately walking in you are greeted by friendly staff who helps with recommendations . the flavors are great and all you can smoke for $ 15 .	2789
1	i chose 10 because the customer service is great . the care that is given towards the body in a full body massage is amazing . i 've had 3 massages from this location and every time i leave my body feels so much better .	2320
1	really friendly staff , and they were in be process of celebrating becoming a `` dementia-friendly '' business when i was there , so that was cool ! my cappuccino was good and they left me to my work after they served me . felt homey and easygoing . do n't have much occasion to go to sun prairie , but if i do i 'll return here .	2516
0	i have been trying to get coffee at this place multiple times but had no luck since they do n't open until late in the day 9am really ... .it also seems like a ice cream place than coffee shop . if you are real coffee drinkers would n't come here . if you want fabulous pastries and coffee visit coffee bean	133
0	this neimans is a mess when it comes to customer service . get off your high horse people ! do n't act you are going to throw up on me mr. i-don't-know-my-kiehls-or-laura-mercier-very-well-but-i-am-really-good-at-peering-down-my-nose-at-you-cosmetic-counter-guy when my boyfriend hands you his mastercard because he does n't ever go there and does n't know any better ! ! ! the salespeople here were so snotty ! designer labels do not require this much attitude . i took my money to nordstrom - other end of the square if you need directions ...	485
0	i 'm disappointed in the service that was provided , i 've gone to multiple location and have never had an eye roll from the employee aka barista and been so rude before and all i ordered was simple drinks and banana bread . find another starbucks near by next time	3154
0	was in sport chek today looking for a rugby jersey . looked around for 10 minutes or so before approaching an employee who , according to his name tag , turned out to be the store general manager . not only was he clueless about whether or not they had rugby jerseys but he did n't seem the least bit interested in helping me find out . terrible .	1676
1	i really like this whole foods market the best because of their wide range of fresh prepared foods i can pick up and take out . i 'm on the go type of person and it 's very convenient for me . i have n't had anything i did n't like . i also like the hot food bar so when i do n't want to cook in the hot arizona tempertures i do n't have to !	3874
1	i 'm late in sharing my son 's experience but a month ago was his first visit to the dentist . the staff and doc were awesome in attending to him and making his visit a positive , yet memorable one for him . see you in 6 months : )	2626
0	giving a 2 star only because the customer service is decent . i love friend chicken but i 'd rather go to popeyes and at least get some flavor . the batter they use for the chicken is also odd ... rolls were good and so were the fries but that was it .	862
0	sorry to say , was disappointed . the standard chili cheese dog was ok , nothing special . i 'm a bit of a chili dog nut and was hoping for greatness .	1566
1	we love coming here . food is awesome . staff is great . we come here often and they remember us everytime . even if it 's a bit of time in between visits . love bringing out friends here too	1229
1	we 've been taking our kids to dr. weber for more than 3 years and love her ! i feel like she not only takes care of the kids , but really cares about them too . she 's knowledgeable and usually suggest the more simple solution first , which we really appreciate . it 's easy to make an appointment and they usually run on time . dr. weber joined bright futures earlier this year and while the transition was a little bumpy with two new computer systems , the office is beginning to run more smoothly . we 're able to access all medical appointment notes from home which is awesome ! we definitely recommend her ! !	2223
1	i 've purchased my last 3 vehicles here , with warranties , and they 've never given me a hassle about anything . the staff is friendly and the service department is knowledgeable . i would recommend to anyone - and do !	1910
1	dannys is in the process of changing their name to jackson 's . came for a wash and mentioned that my ac had a bad smell . matt , the service writer , helped me and suggested to `` bomb '' the inside of my car . he was very professional and not pushy what so ever . had a great experience , car looks and smells awesome ! will definitely come back if matt is there .	3123
1	wow ! ! ! i love that you can order a soft boiled egg with your ramen . we started out with some tapas . which were awesome ... but if you do n't get here early your protein choices may be limited . akin to traditional japanese restaurants . thoroughly enjoyed the presentation and food ... will become a regular.. domo arigato ...	131
0	average steaks ( but expensive ) , so-so service ( manager very nice , server rude ) , overall okay experience but 5 star pricing . not recommended .	971
1	been here couple of time with friends and even if i wan na treat myself for a pizza and wine i 'd come here . my favourite pizza : is basil and pasta : is ravioli . i have tried some starter but i prefer the main menu and , i 'm a pino gal ,	102
1	we had a great experience on our last visit to best buy . i do n't we were we helped by manager for 10 minutes , but we had four other associates approach us asking if we needed help . we were only looking at a smart home thermostat device . at checkout , the associate at the register offered to search google to find a lower price . above and beyond what i expected .	3192
0	food was alright . service was awful . waited almost 20 minutes for the check . we all sat at our table staring at the wait staff and no one bothered to come over . some of the food was a little cold and the nachos we got with the platter were pathetic .	383
1	a nice little froyo place down here in southern chandler . very clean . good flavors . fresh toppings - they even have boba . i rate this on par with my old place , kokomo .	1976
0	had surcharges all week while i was in town . so let me understand this , your busy so you add 1.7 or 1.9x the fare . i ate at several restaurants that had a wait and they charged me regular menu price , not 1.7x because they were busy ? ! one strange policy you have . i used taxis with no wait and no surcharge ! !	2549
1	went to the healthcare clinic at this location on 6/25/18 , carrie was on duty at the time . she was very kind , caring and professional and also gave me a follow up call a few days after to see how i was doing . i will definitely use this clinic again . thank you walgreens for having such a caring professional . rose	1730
1	great place to get ur nails done ! went here randomly on a sunday night and then did a great job ! ! ! !	2407
0	zero stars . zero stars . zero stars do n't let these a holes touch your car . i had simple labor to replace a crank angle sensor and now my car wo n't complete a drive cycle to pass smog . i found a yellow wire to some sensor not hooked up and returned to big o where they told me they do n't have any kind of warranty for the labor even when not completely put back together . this place is a rip off . scam . thieves . do n't go to big o . they will steal from you	3860
1	had a broken dryer that needed immediate attention - it needed an new heating element . the person we originally hired walked off the job and left the heating element and other parts disassembled . i called michael late in the afternoon and he was there the next morning with the part and had it fixed in less then an hour . great work , reasonably priced . i can recommend him without any reservation .	1573
0	i did not enjoy my experience here . it felt disorganized and expensive . i wandered the aisles for an hour looking for anything but it was all just too expensive . maybe half price is true if the books were originally insanely expensive .	836
0	my sanwich was average , nothing to speak about . not sure why they have tables in the resteraunt since they clearly do n't want you to eat there . there are no napkins , utensils or any kind of condiments available . when you ask for them , the staff states that they do n't have them . c'mon , no napkins or s & p for your eat in `` guests '' a term i use loosely since they are not wecoming ! it 's not as if they do n't offer what every fast food in town does to keep cost down on there subs . they more expensive than their equivelant sub par sandwich shop .	1475
1	one of the best places to go for authentic chinese food in montreal in my opinion ! affordable prices , quick service , and consistent food ! everything is very tasty and i keep coming back for more ... pm is where i go when i need comfort food . their japanese tofu with eggplant is one of my favourites , along with buddha 's feast !	1016
1	mill cue club is the best bars on mill ave always have a great time there . excellent custoner service.the staff are all amazing , music is great and best place to watch a game during footbsll season and best spot tovplay sum pool	1966
1	aug 2017 , we called the home warranty to take a look at our a/c unit . on the same day , we received a phone call from a company and scheduled an appointment right away to look at our a/c . the next day , they came on time and said that we needed to replace a motor and the fan ; and immediately replaced both on the same day . i love it !	3653
0	the local staff is awesome ! however the regional manager and public storage policy works against customers who want to consume ( spend ) more with public storage . this `` work '' aggravates , frustrates , and alienates customers ( me ) . it was really weird for me to have to work so hard to give more money to the company , all the while , having the regional managers work so hard to avoid me doing more business with the company ! ?	2449
0	all sugar , no flavor . tried this place out about a month ago . quaint decor , nice ambiance . ordered a snickers and pumpkin macaroon . we each took one bite and literally left . it was all sugar . disappointing .	981
1	if you want to improve your health , then this is the place for you . the core pump machine is so amazing . i love that even my mom who has ms can do this workout . the infrared sauna is beautiful . their monthly memberships include unlimited classes , unlimited sauna and even a laser treatment . plus their staff really care about you and want to help you reach your wellness goals . so glad i found this place !	3206
1	normally a great place with wonderful good that i go to regularly , but do n't go within an hour of closing because they start to strip the buffet then .	135
1	small classes , individual attention , and responsive advisors . i will return for my doctorate ! ! the downside is price ... it 's expensive at just over $ 600/hour . however , the attention makes up for the cost ! ! !	3073
1	so it was time to make the repairs turns out on of my relay fans had shorted , that caused a cascading electrical issue the stopped a full 1.5 of freon from cooling the air . i gladly and quickly paid the $ 516.00 because 25 to 30 degrees coming out of the vent is a good thing . if i am not doing the work to maintain our 2 honda 's . these guys will . honest , no b. s. and interesting to see an all asian mechanical repair shop . everton i spoke to a d dealt with he e been very kind	2041
1	baristas were friendly , i did n't have to wait long and the iced coffee was very good !	683
1	i do n't normally yelp but i had such a good experience with this pep boys that i thought it worthwhile to share . i had to purchase tires for my wife 's car and she worked with a person named herold who was a gentleman from start to finish . instead of pushing extra services , he spent considerable time explaining what needed to be done , what our options were and what was the most cost effective solution . no , this is not what one expects from a car part dealers ... . kudos to herold for showing that the words `` customer service '' still actually mean something !	3020
0	great selection of flicks , but management refuses to hire enough staff to man ticket window . got here 15 minutes before start and could n't buy tix in time . line for tix machine ultra long too . no respect for customers .	2450
1	we love going to this place with our family ! we have two kids and they 're always very accommodating they help with high chairs and finding a place for us to sit . we love their desserts and their potato bacon soup and blts are the best . we always have to get fresh brewed iced teas too . on the weekends we usually get breakfast here- husband likes the taylor ham sandwich , great place for families . i have no idea why anyone would give this place a bad review .	1387
1	this place is the best place for alterations . on a sunday ( around 3pm ) i was looking for a tailor that could fix my jacket while i waited . called all around town . so apparently there are no tailors open past 3 on sunday around gilbert/mesa . found these folks and they tailored it in 30 minutes ! reasonable price too ! ! ! ! ! they go above and beyond to make sure you do n't wait long . do n't go anywhere else !	2702
0	horrible experience every time ! ! look at all of the bad reviews from several people ... . the fact that they have to force you as a customer to stay with them via `` contract '' is pretty sad ! ! ! if they were so good you would want to come back not be forced to . any time i have called into the front desk , the part time help that they hire are completely rude and unprofessional ... i will be going elsewhere i hope anyone who reads this does as well .	1950
1	cute little ice cream shop . the lady behind the counter was super friendly & we got to meet a lovely couple visiting from ontario . my little boy took a while to order but there was none of the 'tude you often get when that happens . she was more than happy to let him take his time ( there was n't anyone waiting ) . his ice cream was good & my caramel sundae was awesome . i want to try a banana split or one of the nathan 's hotdogs next time .	413
1	this location is always so quick and easy . so it was no question when i had an issue with being overcharged for something i went into this branch . i was happy to only wait a few minutes when i was greeted by brandon . i have to say he was so friendly and helpful . before i knew it i was out of there and everything was fixed . thanks again brandon .	3202
0	i wish i could give this company zero stars . i called asking for a cab from scottsdale area and the guy was extremely rude and giving me so much attitude on the phone ... .and then he later told me that they do n't drive to my area of scottsdale . ok then why is it called scottsdale cab company ? ? ? his attitude was intolerable , and i 'm usually one to not care about these type of things . i will never call this service again or recommend this taxi service to anyone .	52
0	meh , prime location so i expected better . typical late night bar food being served in a restaurant . i would had to have been drunk to enjoy the food . do n't waste your time or $	717
0	this is a weird complaint , but i absolutely hate when i can taste dirty tap water in food . everything i had from this taco bell had a lovely city of mesa aftertaste .	1341
0	extremely slow service and long wait . waited over an hour just to be seated after being seated , it took 15 mins just to get a waitress to come take our order . and another 40 minutes to receive a drink and shave ice to come . would never return back to this place . extremely bad staff , uninviting atmosphere , and extremely bad service from the staff . please do not come to this establishment .	176
1	i ordered the nachos . it was very nicely made and not cheap worth the toppings . great customers service all around .	2273
1	waiter was very knowledgable about menu and choices . all the food was very good , and well executed . certainly an above average experience . after much consideration , did not rate a 5 due to better indian food in boston . best indian food we have found in the phoenix area .	1497
1	love this place ! ! ! ever since i discovered it i have not went back to store cupcakes ! ! the frosting is perfect and the cakes are the best ! !	1806
1	pizza was pretty good . got extra cheese - pretty cheesy . the guy inside was cool as well . i 'll order again	538
1	the staff is always so friendly and i love that they remember my name when i come in to tan ! the salon is always clean and organized . i will never go any where else to tan .	2774
1	this gym is awesome ! i loved going there and only cancelled my membership because i bought my own treadmill , which is mostly what i use . thanks for the nice and reasonable experience fitness 19 ! ! !	2919
1	if you wan na meet the coolest and most helpful person ever , go to charter and get help from justin . he is a man of the people . the robin hood of charter communications . truly an icon .	3575
1	what an interesting selection of chocolate covered strawberries ! i love the variety of chocolates and sprinkles that they have on their large chocolate covered strawberries . yum ! so after having a few of these yummy strawberries i had to stop by the actual store on the strip . it was really crowded . the only thing that i was craving was ice cream and they had gelato . while the mango gelato was very good , they did n't have many fruit flavors but they had quite a few cookie and candy flavors . i 'm sure this is a tourist trap and the prices for candy is outrageous . but then again , is n't that the theme on the strip ?	2021
0	i want to give them zero stars ! my flight was late i missed the second shuttle ! had to take a cab and when i got there it was an hour wait ! the air conditioning was off and they were out of waters ! after waiting 40 minutes with my 18month old it was announced that if you were late your reservation was cancelled and the shuttle will take you back to the airport . ended up renting from budget last minute . the beginning of my trip was ruined . never again	3576
0	buyer beware ! ! ! if you buy a car from this place they sell it to you as is . meaning they do n't inspect the vehichles for mechanical issues . my girlfriend purchased a car 3 weeks ago ned 's new tires oil pan is stripped out and leaking oil , cv boot is ripped , cam seals are leaking . they gave her a 1 month warranty from edmonds that was completely worthless , the denied her claim . she drove the car back to cali and has had issues ever since	2227
1	kohls is my favorite ! ! ! i love this store because its very clean , and organized ! theres always awesome clearance sections . i always seem to go in with a plan , and leave with half the store ! ! customer service could be a little bit better , but overall great prices , great selections , and awesome style !	3896
0	sushi was good . chinese very average . delivery guy was needy .	945
1	had their oh cheesus burger and it was fantastic ! ! nice place , clean , wait staff was very nice and attentive . like the atmosphere and look forward to going back when it 's not lunch break at work when i can dig into their selection of craft beers ! ! !	496
0	i had an appointment today at 4:00 pm with kenny . i walked in at 4:00 pm sharp and kenny had just sat a guy in the barber chair . i showed him our text message conversation that confirmed my appointment and all he said was `` give me time '' . i left immediately , drove to another barber shop two miles down the road on durango , and got a haircut . there is no shortage of quality barber shops in las vegas . you 're fired kenny , and since you represent pro cuts they 're fired too .	2366
0	let me begin with i ordered seafood in a land locked state . that may have been the problem from the get go . shrimp fried rice made me sick and my company that had the chicken did n't enjoy it either . we threw our leftovers out .	420
1	hi all , first review . i was working in the area and was told to go here for great food . i love the old diner feel this place has . table was clean , service was excellent . i ordered the burger , cause why not at a diner . it did not disappoint . i even give the fries a thumbs up . my friend ordered the juevos rancheros and he gave it a thumbs up . said the eggs were creamy and delicious . good food , great price , great service , great time . 4 stars . drew	253
1	we had to take our daughter because we suspected an allergic reaction to her meds . the doctor was amazing and very thorough . the nurses were so kind to her when she had to get her blood drawn . we had such a great experience with here that i wo n't go anywhere else when we have a medical emergency .	350
0	wild boar chili and wine were good but bison burger was small and over-cooked and roll was way too much bread for the burger . combination was very dry . fries were greasy and under-cooked . overall , not good for the price .	1226
1	i come here for cheap liquor when i wan na feel like a hobo . lines are really long and i think the cashiers and baggers suffer from down syndrome but store is clean and wide selction of items .	1097
1	fabulous neighborhood resteraunt ! ! great pho ! i love their curry and rice noodle with veggies i will always continue to come here	205
1	a standard chain restaurant with a big selection for food and drinks . consistent quality you can depend on . maybe a little lacking in flavor intensity . my thai red curry rice bowl was not spicy at all although it was listed as a spicy dish . service was efficient and friendly . portion was satisfying and price was reasonable . this location has expanded and there was plenty of seating available . we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table on a friday with no reservation .	534
0	this is the most disrespectful top golf in arizona . my cousins flew in from california and they wanted to go to top golf so we drove 45 minutes on 9.5 mile per gallon car and the place told us that even though we were all 16 and 15 we would still be able to golf , and then after we paid and waited 45 minutes for our bay they told us know and did n't give us our money back . then when we asked for coupons or free games they told us to leave . head management was very mean . never coming again	1483
0	this target is horrible . the employees are rude , the bathrooms are always dirty , and the food area is a freaking joke . the electronics people totally ignored me for 20 mins after i asked 3 of them if they would open a case so i could buy a video game . i finally gave up and just left . this target is crap .	3355
1	i have only positive things to say about this place . as a 1st time patient i filled out all my paperwork online , as well as st up my appointment . everyone was super friendly on the phone and at the office . dr. baker was very nice , friendly and helpful . from my check in , x-rays and exam i was in and out in 45 minutes . i went on a monday , and was told other days are more busy but today was outstanding !	2176
1	we popped into this place several times while we were staying across the road at hotel du fort . the food is good , everything is cheap and beer is served in pitchers up to 5 liters ! a great find to keep the cost of casual meals down .	574
0	talk about a dump located in the bad part of a city . smell was horrible , the local area is a crap hole and we 'll never be back . went here for the hgtv home show and will just go to the other ones located in not so crappy run down neighborhoods .	2076
0	had an annual physical check up couple years ago , paid my co-pay but received $ 250 bill from them . saying my insurance did n't cover part of the claim . my insurance premium is pretty good so i was shocked to receive the bill . called to schedule an appointment yesterday . they said they need my credit card information so they can add it to my file . just in case if any of the claim that my insurance reject , they will charge to my credit card ... ..it is really ridiculous ! ! ! ! dont go there ! ! !	3349
1	my love for this store grows each time i stop by . not only is it packed with locally made items , but their clerks are down right the friendliest people . this time i scored on a made in canada hoodie to replace my crappy target one with bleach stains . this is a really great place to stop for gift buying for friends or family .	1378
1	went through drive-thru with about 20 people waiting . got my food in about 10 min ... .and it was hot ! ! came back a second time with the same situation and same service ! great workers here ! ! ! ! ! !	572
1	came to this hospital after my was having trouble calming down and would n't stop panting . they were so nice and welcoming . even though i was a walk in i still got back to see the vet within 10 minutes . they explained everything and could not be any nicer . even after we left they called to check up on my dog . definitely recommend !	2546
0	pour commencer , le personnel . tellement antipathique qu'on n'ose pas demander d'informations tellement on semble déranger . quand aux produits , vraiment déçue ! j'ai jeté toute la morue ( 1 kg ) parce qu'elle était amère et immangeable . sur 12 huîtres achetées à prix fort , j'en ai jeté trois . je ne retournerai pas là , c'est sûr !	3046
0	stopped in tonight to pick up specific items . i need help locating everything in order in be in and out quickly . it was a little more than 30 min before they close . no one offered to help me . when i asked for help i was brushed off . i get it you 're closing , but the sooner you help me the sooner we all can get out of here . i hate dropping $ 100 in a business that does n't deserve it : (	2479
0	being from out of town i expected this to be a lot nicer than it is . yes it 's a strip club but this is vegas right ? we have nicer clubs in small town ohio . disappointed !	1779
1	our first visit was on a tuesday and it was extremely busy ( did n't know about toonie tuesday ) but there was lots for my little people to do . went with two other mums and it made 6 month olds to four year olds happy . there was limited seating for mums because of the special offer though . would probably pony up for full price and less crowds in the future .	3382
1	we decided because of approximately to eat at this restaurant . our family walked in to a large , overhead menu board filled with american and greek fares . the kids order the small shrimp plate , my wife the burger , and i decided to enjoy my favorite greek dish , the gyro . the place was clean and bright . everyone enjoyed their meal very much . my wife enjoyed the burger and the gyro was one of the best . it was overflowing with tasty meat , red onion , and fresh , red tomatoes . could n't expect better .	501
0	meh . this store is kinda gross . dingy . i 'd rather drive farther to have a better experience	914
0	update ... so i got my car washed for my birthday 3/4 and stupidly did not walk both sides of my car ... they peeled my tint on the passenger side window and missed cleaning the side of my rear passenger door . i will never come back to this location .	2359
1	we have stayed here when it was imperial palace , we have always been happy with the cleanliness of the hotel , even tho they are renovating the place at the moment we have n't got any bad remarks to say about this hotel , i 'm sure that some people just like to put negative reviews , the price is very good when on a tight budget , keep up the good work , the location is brilliant , and yes is ready for a face lift but overall well worth what we paid , so please be patient while work is in progress	2976
1	its a typical walgreens , nothing really sticks out about it . they seem efficient with getting prescriptions ready , and the shelves are always stocked . no comlaints here !	758
1	walmart is fantastic our associates that helped were great olga g `` come in as customers leave as family she is amazing '' yes please	2443
0	most of the time you wo n't find the best prices at any given gnc , however every once in awhile a sale will roll around that you ca n't ignore . whether it be groupon aided or even a store sale , chances are your wallet will win . it 's sad to say , but this is pretty much the only use i have of gnc . their staff is typically friendly , have knowledge on select products , and never trying to be pushy sales-wise . personally , i 'd rather take my chances with some of the locally owned supplement shops .	2757
1	locally owned & operated ! ! ! ! 24/7 great svc , customer service excellent . only company in las vegas nv that is not owned by a major conglomerate ! i have learned so much about internet service/high speed internet & what lv has to offer its residents & business . aka-cox & centurlink , viastat..nothing compares to lv.net get the facts about how internet svc ! learn how it actually works , speed , everything ! ! i think this company is so great i 'd love to quit my career and work for them ! !	3459
1	we went here for lunch and it was fantastic . i had the boneless wings ( medium ) which were really good ! my husband had the pastrami sandwich and that was excellent as well . i liked that the place had a family friendly atmosphere .	428
0	geez that was 1.5 hours of my life i wo n't get back . well actually one 1 hour , cause i walked out ... could n't take anymore . dancers were great , costumes were great , but the music and show itself was just dreadful .	3069
1	decided to try out eyebrow threading here after my go to place , indo salon was closed at the time . im happy with the results . no appointment needed , you can just walk in . cost was $ 3 for threaded eyebrows .	2077
0	this place is terrible ! ! ! i have a severe allergy to bed bugs and started breaking out in welts the minute i went in there . filthy rooms , no internet , the air conditioning did n't work , and there are bugs ! changed rooms twice and still had the same issues . i would n't pay $ 4 a night let alone $ 60 . avoid this place at all costs !	2650
0	i cant say i was expecting a 5 star experience at winchells . i only stopped in because its next to the brake place my car was dropped off at . donuts are not very good here and neither was the coffee . the worker started cleaning the display case with glass cleaner while we were still eating , which made the entire dining room immediately smell like chemicals . i think the only reason i felt a certain way about the glass cleaner was because i had my 3 year old son with me . i will have to bring my car in to the same brake place in a couple of months , but i definitely wont be coming back to winchells	614
1	the issue was finally address with my satisfaction but still do n't understand how the first support requested got deleted from their database .	2131
0	this mall feels like a mall in china , almost everything is knocked off , copied or pirated .	472
0	used to be imperial . currently under reno so place is a mess , dirty and smelly . horrible parking .	2976
1	we are super new to the area and never have had a pool before ! ! ! they are very knowledgeable , friendly and professional ! ! ! two thumbs up ! ! !	3266
1	my wife and i purchased a mattress from brooklyn bedding this week and we absolutely love it , the delivery service was timely and ca n't say enough about the friendly staff . we would recommend purchasing a bed to all of our friends	444
1	companies should sit down and listen to their customer service lines all day to see how over-the-phone customer service should be . i always have a knowledgeable and friendly representative help me out . quite simply the gold standard of banking and insurance in my book .	3429
1	we needed our backyard finished and called them to come out and help us design the space . matt , the designer was great . constant communication , sent beautiful mock ups and gave fair and reasonable pricing for the job . the job took just a tad longer ( just a few days ) than anticipated but was done in the heat of the summer so ca n't blame them . everything came out perfect ! a couple minor things needed adjusting and they came out right away to fix it . our backyard is now a beautiful and space for the baby and we could n't be happier with the service . thank you matt and the team for a job perfectly done !	2387
0	i did the sns nails and they buffed my nails so much that they are so thin now . if interested in sns nails go somewhere experienced with the technique . with the damage done to my nails i might as well gotten acrylic or gel .	265
1	this qt does a fantastic job at keeping their store clean . it has been a while since i have been to a qt . they offer good prices on fruit and coffee . the cashier provided exceptional customer service . the other two workers were hard at work . from my observations this team is very productive and they support each other . great community here in phoenix !	3797
1	you 're missing out if you have n't eaten here . your taste buds are in for a treat . superb !	973
1	i have n't been here for awhile and found the entire store moved around . it 's confusing but only because i was used to the way it was . very clean and organized though . used the self check out so no interaction with employees this time . of course plenty of parking at boca park . everything else is the same ; price , same target products , etc . would go more if it was closer . usually i spend way too much when i go to target but kept it under $ 30 which is not easy to do there .	583
1	i had the best time at di luxe polish lounge ! ! they did an amazing job on my mani-pedi and i was so relaxed after and during the entire experience ! ! i 'm never going anywhere else again ! ! the women there are extremely knowledgeable and very good at what they do ! !	1370
1	mark is the man ! girlfriend 's car had an issue and he took care of it . he was friendly , informative and went above and beyond by suggesting some cool places for us to go to on our road trip . definitely coming back !	2392
0	the service deli/hot food has the absolute worst customer service ! i went there a couple of days ago and the employee behind the counter was making a burrito for another employee and neither one of them acknowledged me . this happens every time i go there . the only reason i go to this store is for the hot food section other than that i would never set foot in this store ! management seriously needs to do something about the lack of customer service in that department .	433
1	great venue . every seat in the house is awesome . been here twice , once for britney and another time for jlo . both were fantastic performances ; sexy , sultry , and high energy ! love , love them and this venue !	2879
1	i 've fulfilled my fantasy of waking up completely disorientated the next morning in vegas , craving a chipotle steak burrito , and getting it ! bottom line : this is a legit chipotle that is destined to make bank off hundreds of hungover and hungry las vegas tourists . this opened right next to the mcdonalds on the strip and it was packed the morning we went ( not surprising ) . it was just us boys with our burritos on a lovely vegas afternoon = ) .	214
1	all i can say is this place is great for what it offers . great movies , great food , great customer service ( yes , busy but that 's great news ) , above all -- great price ! ! ! not upscale for what some want but comfy and homey . kudos to the employees because they show they care about the place and the people . i am sad i moved away but trust me , if i was there i would still go every week like i use to .	3927
0	do not come here ! ! ! i repeat , do not come here . the rooms are disgusting ! ! ! i have red itchy marks all over my body , feels like have bed bugs from my knowledge ! i slept there last night so i 'm assuming there beds and unsanitary rooms is the cause . the outside is very deceiving the rooms are totally different . my sheets were dirty , and they do n't give you any real blanket to use , there is just a sheet on the bed . honestly this is the the worst i 've been too honestly just spend the extra 20 or 30 for a better hotel !	3818
1	doc was funny , staff was professional but also friendly . vasectomy went quick i was not hassled about my decision or pressured into changing it like i heard from many people from other places . honestly it was one of those visits that made you glade you came to that doctor .	2777
0	do they serve food ? i went once and had the best jalapeño poppers . i raved on about it and took my friends there to try that and the bbq . they said they no longer have a chef . i thought ok maybe ill try back in a month . once again , no chef . the bartender was great , but what exactly happened i 'm not sure . i only know that i called again and still no chef so i gave up . i pointed out to them that there was a restaurant posters stapled to their building that said food , it was gone the next time i drove by . havent tried again since then .	1295
0	chicken crusts all over the floor in the dining area . the chicken was so salty it was n't edible . i had high hopes for this place but the dead parking lot says a lot . my tongue is still burning from all the salt . staff stands around doing nothing when the place is dead . even for fast food ... sometimes managers will walk around and ask how everything was . not this place . sooo salty . blah .	862
1	this buffet is like the culture about '' north side of china '' , food may have little bit spicy , if you really can not eat spicy food , just leave this restaurant away . the dumpling may taste 90 % same , but if you are the one who really know about dumpling ( know how to make it tasty , know how to cook , etc ) , you may satisfaction with their dumpling，very traditional taste of `` northern area 's culture of chinese dumpling ( 北方饺子） '' , if you are not the chinese people , the place may not be a good choice for you .	1005
1	love it here ! ! i had the worst experience with mark kia drove 2 hours to get the sand kia they were the best ! ! ! ! especially lauren she was so understanding of my situation and helped me out the best she could ! !	624
0	spring rolls were great . pho broth was thin but overall was okay . pho condiments were provided when asked for instead of available on the tables . papaya salad dressing was flavorless and their garnish choice was odd . lemongrass chicken was disappointing because i tasted no lemongrass . none . it was all sweet peanut ( tasty ) sauce . the fish sauce dressing for the raw veggies was rancid smelling and tasted like dirty gym socks . for our next pho trip we will go to charlotte and deal with the traffic on i77 instead of returning .	1312
1	very happy with the dining room table that we bought from here . it was exactly the one i had been on the hunt for and much cheaper than on amazon or anywhere else . the customer service was not the best , they seemed a bit distracted and uninterested in making a sale until we came up to them which is why its not 5 stars but other than that so far so good . we got the table a few months ago and no problems .	3854
1	one of my favorite streetwear stores . the employees are really helpful and i love all of their clothes . would come again	377
0	i 'm from out of town and i needed to clean up my eyebrows so i yelped `` eyebrow threading '' for current location . eyebrows r us was the closest . i read the previous reviews which were not so good . at this point , i had no choice if i wanted my eyebrows done so i gave it a try . it turns out they did an amazing job , it was pretty quick . although , they were the rudest people i ever encountered . no one says hi , the receptionist gives the ugliest looks - it 's truly a very uncomfortable 10 minutes for fabulous eyebrows ! i personally wo n't ever return if i 'm in the area .	2062
0	to summarize : - 90-minute wait ( after being told 30-40 minutes ) - ca n't have burgers cooked medium-rare - food is average at best - food is over-priced - floor is filthy - `` craft beer '' list is lacking - manager is extremely rude ( but , wait staff and receptionists were trying their best ! ) how does someone start a new restaurant and let it get this bad this quickly ? this location has ruined not only their own reputation , but the reputation of the entire chain .	1323
1	was looking for a dinner spot with 2 things- wings & baseball . arrived and sat at the bar , was greeted with great service from morgan . we really enjoyed the food , particularly the wings ! if you like them crispy like me , i 'd ask them to cook twice . they come out perfect . good drinks & lots of tvs for sports games !	717
1	i had the best chicken marcela ever . the spaghetti with meet sauce was nothing to rave about . prices are great .	4
0	this new purchasing tickets socks ! ! ! wait in line for ever and when i got there the room was sold out i had to go to other and better theater ... where is the customer service here ... .so they just want the money or what ... .used to b better back then ... i will not come back ... i better go to amc theaters ... one star is to much to give but it was not lower options ...	491
0	one of the highest rated shabu places in vegas = huge disappointment . extremely confusing menu ! everything was an additional charge besides a small starter salad , rice , and basic veggies like cabbage . after ordering some mushrooms , udon , and my usual sides the price of our meal ended up being pretty pricey . quality of meat was meh and portions were tiny . even thought it is a small establishment , there was only one server that night so the service was spotty . the overall mood of the restaurant was strange , extremely quiet with soft rnb playing in the background . was it sad that the highlight of my meal was the free ice cream at the end ?	285
0	the general tso chicken was just ok . i had the combo . the pork fried rice was cold and tasteless . i grabbed a side of pineapple chicken to share . it was not even close . i have a great recipe i should share with them . what ever they might believe is pineapple chicken , is n't .	668
0	rude treatment by the # safeautoglass call center at 135 n center street , mesa , az 85201 pushed me to take action . they claim they `` ca n't '' stop calling me because they buy leads for sales calls and those leads are on paper . maybe this will help : your complaint has been accepted thank you for filing your complaint with the national do not call registry . do not call complaints will be entered into a secure online database available to civil and criminal law enforcement agencies . while the ftc does not resolve individual consumer problems , your complaint will help the agency investigate the company , and could lead to law enforcement action .	200
1	amazing greasy spoon ! had the breakfast platter and it was very tasty . hubby had the steak & egg breakfast burrito and he really enjoyed it . the staff was really nice and it was a great cheap breakfast . good stuff . definitely be going back soon .	414
0	my boyfriend went to go get a bagel with egg whites and pepper jack cheese and i went to pick it up and it was covered in oil it was dripping i could n't even eat it . i 'm very disappointed that it was disgusting . i would n't recommend to anyone you are better off going to einstein bagel .	325
0	the service department is good but way-over-priced ! they 'll rip you off not only on the parts but the labor as well ! thank-god i can do most of my own service . a real shame since it 's a such beautiful dealership . it must be something about vegas that attracts greedy dealerships . i used to own a new yamaha fjr1300 and the local yamaha dealer was the same way ( greedy ) , except their service and sales people were also arrogant .	94
0	kinda pricey for the size of portions . very loud due to the fact many teenagers hang out for hours .	1346
1	wow ! the crew was so upbeat and energetic you could n't help yourself from smiling and being in good spirits . even with this being their opening , they still made time to welcome you , shake your hand and ask if they could assist you . i was very impressed .	1006
0	overpriced . only went because we had a coupon . service was ok but not overly friendly either . definitely do n't need to go back ...	3343
1	big fan of this establishment . okay - so i have been frequenting jc foodland for about 5 years . i used to live in the icon condo and at one point i could access the store without having to go outside ! the amount of ice cream i purchased during that time ... .. the employees/owners are amazing . they are super polite and you know what ? they smile and laugh at all my jokes . i leave there with a bounce in my step . they also let me bring my giant puppy in with me and do n't get mad when he rifles through things .	62
1	mammograms are not the most fun and comfortable thing to do , but denise and kim were great ! very professional and did their best to make the mammogram as fast and comfortable as possible . thank you !	188
0	i understand this is an airport bar . but i would 've ordered food , and 3 times the drinks had my server ever said more than one word to me when she first took my order . apparently `` would you like to order any food '' or `` would you care for another drink '' simply was n't as important as checking her phone constantly . oh well , my money is happily welcomed elsewhere ... and from now on will be . just `` wow '' ! train . your . people .	1400
1	all i have to say is that a woman named helen was so incredibly helpful she went above and beyond the call of duty ! thank goodness there are still people out there with a heart who care and who are helpful .	2421
1	i 'm trying to find a good nail salon in glendale since my move from chicago . i really want to like this place , but it 's hard . this is the second time i 've made an appointment and had to wait 30 minutes or more . they do good work , but the wait is insane . update : i waited it out and i 'm really happy with the results . the owner is super funny and the nail techs are good . i will visit again .	1637
0	who is the manager that runs this location ? they 're always out of certain donuts and their customer service is the worst . on occasion i like to pick up some munchkins . but every time i stop , they never have enough munchkins or they do n't have certain ones . usually they have all the ones i do n't like . it 's not just about the lack of donuts it 's the way the employes treat you as well , my business is not feeling appreciated here .	1761
0	i wish i had something nice to say about this place . they have such potential and are so well placed to excel . i ordered the chicken burger sandwich , and for $ 16 you would expect something pretty decent . unfortunately it was barely edible . their drink menu is pretty decent , so i would return for a beer , but stay away from the food .	604
0	we threw away 2 out of 3 drinks , they were undrinkable . grand mocha frappuccino with soy - beyond bitter tall carmel frappuccino - beyond bitter grand mocha - good we got back on the road for our road trip home and gagged from the burnt , bitter taste . our little stop for a treat was ruined . extremely disappointed !	2358
0	service sucked because they were severely understaffed , although it is very easy to satisfy me because i 'm accustomed to the inattentive service in europe . 3 sausage ( their signature dish ) was soggy and cold inside . the salad we ordered was extremely boring ( i make better mediterranean salad at home ) . beers were not cold enough . what else is there ? terrible place . not a belgian/french gastropub , just a cheesy tourist trap .	670
1	whenever i need sports equipment or supplies , sports authority is my first choice . i like the particular location because there 's always plenty of parking . this store is well organized and kept clean . return factor - 100 %	3911
1	nice sports bar & grill . hubby had the chicken salad and i had the fish tacos . both were delicious and the perfect size for a light lunch . the waitress was super nice and checked on us several times . definitely will be back !	428
0	the worst experience ! they are unprofessional and the most unreliable people i have ever come across . they try to deliver the equipment i ordered at 11 o'clock at night but they also forgot some of my tables not only did i tell them they were not coming to my house at 11 pm they tried to charge me an extra $ 100 for telling them i wanted it delivered 9 am the next day as if it was my fault when i was specifically told they would deliver by 7pm . no communication i will never use them again nor will i recommend their service to anyone else .	3620
1	nice coffee place in kensington . came here for a meetup with a few other girls . it was n't loud , we were able to talk without shouting . overall we liked the place . you need to find street parking ; it can be tricky sometimes as it is in kensington .	2163
0	vip or not.. there 's a great band on stage . sitting in vip and you can only hear static ! vi p tent , horrible food not worth the price of admission . drinks are small 6oz cheep wine in a plastic cup . and.. the manager is an ass , truly a jerk with a city of chandler jacket on ... when we made a comment to him about the food quality and poor service he sarcastically said `` well good , i hope you feel that way later tonight '' what an ass . pay 10 bucks at the gate and buy your own food ... and you can be closer than 400 yards from the stage.. so disappointing ...	759
1	thank you to go wild sushi for its immediate response to my concern . they are now back in my good graces . i personally spoke to the owner , who was willing to rectify the situation and also offer me a solution for what transpired at their restaurant . i am grateful and thankful for the immediate turn around . they truly exemplified the meaning of customer service and respect . to all reading this review , they have delicious rolls and the staff is amazing ! ! 50 % off all rolls ( dine in only ) is definitely worth it ! : ) please visit i can guarantee it gets addictive ! : )	431
1	we went here when it first opened to watch a boxing match . we got there an hour early but still had to sit outside and it was a bit warm . there were n't many tv '' s outside so that made it uncomfortable to see one . the food is good . got wings of course and i like that there are so many options for the sauce . it was really busy there so the service was n't the best . but it is like that everywhere on a fight night . anyways , we would go back because it is a fun environment to watch fights at .	383
1	the kitchen manager personally came out to check on our meal , which was wonderful . the food and atmosphere was nice .	428
0	i 've never had a great experience with dr. romine 's staff -- they 're always rude . i 've only seen dr. romine once -- for only a few seconds -- in all the years i 've gone to her office . she 's conveniently located and usually has availability , which is why i continue to go there . unfortunately , her employees have the worst bedside manner i 've ever dealt with . i went in the office last week to have a cyst injected and when the pa , molly , entered the room , she asked what i needed . instead of finishing her question , she started laughing when she saw the cyst . it was horrible .	3050
0	they partner with crooked towing companies . when my truck was stolen , the police left it in the custody of rezhawk towing , for some reason . that company quoted me $ 385 to release it to me , then gouged me $ 200 more before they would do so . if you want to stop crime , do n't partner with criminals .	2322
1	i spent a couple of hours reading my book and people watching . the chicken pot pie was incredible and i always enjoy their coffee . i think those having issues with the free wifi will find that it is now a shaw wifi hotspot . works for me ! i enjoy the cozy atmosphere and the friendly staff .	1035
0	your candles are getting cheap in quality ! most of them only burn down half way until the wicks are useless . i have had to throw away so many that never burned down . the fragrance is also weak ... . used to have great quality candles years ago but not anymore . glade makes better candles and actually burn completely and have a noticeable fragrance .	2600
1	i highly recommend classic gold for your auto body and service needs . i had classic gold paint a part for my motorcycle . the paint job was fantastic and performed quicker than promised . mike installed the part and went above and beyond to ensure a top notch service experience . he did what he said he would do within the timeframe stated . the price was extremely reasonable . definitely check them out !	877
1	i ca n't even start to describe how great penguin air was to us . our ac went out in the 100+ degree heat and we needed it repaired or replaced quickly . first , we talked to will and he was very helpful and honest , showing us all the different units , including pricing and financing . next , the ac installers arrived at our house very quickly and we 're very professional . they did the job in a short period of time . and now we are cool again ! we were super impressed and recommend penguin to anyone who wants fast and honest work done .	2203
0	this sushi restaurant is sub par . the rice in the sushi is not fresh . i recommend sushi loca or sushi fever .	408
0	good deli sandwiches . otherwise it 's a boutique , with boutique prices . just another snobby place ... sorry , sprouts , i expected better .	1686
0	it is a very inconsiderate office . they rather follow the their protocol than a patient in pain . i come here for heel pain . my doctor ordered an insole for my shoes to elevate the pain . i am in so much pain yet they would not give me the insole which is sitting in the office because they are waiting for the person i that department has to give it to me because that is proton and yet this person comes once in 2 weeks yet i am suffering . i would never recommend this office to anyone	2896
1	rooms is dope ... had a smoking room at 1st but the cigs was killing me then the 2nd room they gave me was not the one lol then they bossed my life up so i 'm grateful for that 3rd room on the 7th floor in the 4 tower they gave me ... .what a great way to spend my 2 year anniversary at the quad ... .thanks	2976
1	hey it 's a great place to work out . it 's big and open with a lot of equipment and since i 've been going there for the past few months there never has been a time where i had to wait to for someone else to be finished with a piece of equipment . and if you 're not tired after your workout you can go around the corner ( without leaving the building ) and go bowling ! such a deal !	342
0	i go back amd forth from la to vegas and the golds gym out here are nothin like the ones in la ... this one particularly smells like nasty b.o and feet they dont provide towels wich is important cause it help keep place sanitary .	465
1	this was my 1st time going to the eye doctor . i saw ka-yan sandi cheung , o.d . and she was great . she 's very friendly and got me the perfect prescription for me . i would recommend this office to my family and friends . the staff is so nice and caring . they are very professional and friendly . this will be my eye doctor forever ! keep up your great service , you guys are awesome ! ! !	2107
0	we were in the restaurant to celebrate early mother 's day before it gets too crowded . we have always loved 'on the border ' for its food quality , but just like the other restaurants , understandably , we have seen portion size decrease . but we felt cheated for first time when we ordered chicken and vegetarian enchilada . not only were the enchilada 's not baked , it was hard to cut the corn tortilla , which had been merely grilled , with sauce poured on top . we adked tge waitress , and she said that it was enchilada alright . : - (	1558
0	i agree with the first two reviews ! ! this is the worst dental office ever . the office staff had me leave without a ride after being under gas for three hours . i was found walking north on tatum full of blood and crying . thankfully my daughters drove past me ( they were going to the dentist office to check on me . ) this dentist did n't inform me the consequences of doing full dentures at 37 , i suffered from malnutrition as a result from not being able to eat . still cant eat over a year later . dentures do n't fit . life ruining dentist !	2439
0	now , let 's get this straight : i usually love this . up till this year , this was a lot of fun . this year 's was flat . no utilikilts , no clan inebriated , no mead . maybe it 'll be better next year .	2665
1	having trouble getting grass to grow so decided to have new sod put down . comes directly from their farm . freshly cut . love the new yard . guys showed up when they said they would and did n't take long for them to install it . great business .	1593
1	i have had nothing but exceptional service from national ! they cover things my other warranty would n't and they have great customer service . the service fee is fair and so far the 2 vendors we have had come out have been helpful and presentable . i also have a friend who has been with them for 12 years and she was the one who referred me . they must be doing something right !	3653
0	no one answered the phone for nearly half an hour after the office was supposed to be open ( according to the message ) . i finally got through to a person and was put on hold -- for more than ten minutes . i was a new patient trying to make an appointment . my experience has shown that a doctor 's staff says a lot about the doctor . i will not be seeing this man .	2573
1	matt was very knowledgable and patient in explaining each system and the areas i was experiencing problems . he kindly labeled each of the valves and showed me the correct positions for each to be in . thank you matt !	827
0	worst experience ever.. dermatologist is getting paid to help with skin issues not make me feel bad . i would no recommend this place.. i thought my last dermatologist was bad but the one i saw yesterday is worse . she had the never to ask me to go back in three months.. you never going to see me again . i rather spendy money else where . waist of time ! !	2099
0	woman working on saturday 8/8/15 was incredibly unprofessional , abrasive , and rude . still , my daughter and i waited for 10 minutes . we left when we overheard her being rude to another client . we 'll never go back .	260
1	my fiance , planner and i had our tasting with roots last night and we were totally blown away . the effort and care that was put into our tasting was evident . kellyn and the roots team are so obviously passionate about their business and their roles in the organization . the food was delicious and beautifully presented and we are thrilled to have roots cater our big day !	872
1	my daughter and i are here on saturday and tonight . ella is the nicest team member . she was so sweet and caring . she helped my 7 year old build her sandwich . she was patient and made my daughter feel important . our sandwiches we 're yummy and the atmosphere was nice . she greeted every single customer that came in with a smile . we recommend this establishment .	725
0	i am a fairly new patient here but might not be going back after the last few visits . i had tons of serious lab work done and had never received a call back regarding any information about the labs i finally after a month had to schedule to talk to someone about it and then told me over the phone my diagnosis , but when k went in for the appointment she said that information is completely wrong and unsure where i came up with that . horrible communication . this is only 1 incident i 've had here .	3349
1	awesome breakfast , clean room , love that they were giving first responders ( firefighters , paramedics , police ) free breakfast this sunday . very nice gesture . hotel staff very nice . hotel decor inside room a little outdated but i 'd rather it be clean over updated , which it was . quiet . also like that the hotel is pet friendly .	2101
0	currently i live here . sooooo , there 's a very long pending review awaiting for when i move out ( i do n't wan na funn [ ier ] business with the staff ) . i tell you the most important & main thing : do n't move here ( unless you are 18 yrs old & wants a cheesy party place ) . keeping it honest . see you in a few months for the update .	3029
1	been comming to this location for the past year . first of all there pharmaceutical staff are amazing . always very helpful and nice . beyond this the retail store always has everything i need . good job walgreens team , and thank you for a great shopping experience	758
1	this is probably the dollar tree i went to most often while visiting my daughter in mesa . sometimes she was with me , buying baby shower invitations and wedding thank you notes and household supplies , pet treats , etc , and sometimes i was by myself buying cleaning supplies to clean her less than tidy apartment or filling in missing utensils , a loaf pan , dish cloths , scrubby sponges , whatever i needed , even half and half for my coffee . kleenex , paper towels , a couple of nightlights , just you-name-it . most of this would have cost me two to three times as much even at walmart . i sure was glad they were here .	1831
1	i 'm speaking strictly from an owner perspective - apt hunters ( specifically neil gumbiner ) has been managing my rental home in peoria since 1999 . if i could clone him , i would . i own several properties in several states and this is the only property that has been terrifically managed for all of this time . neil always gets professional people to do any maintenance as reasonable prices ... iow , i do n't have to baby sit him like i do every other pm that i employ . i love him !	3451
0	got the vegetarian pizza . the slice was the perfect size , and cost about 5.50 $ . the pizza did n't really have much taste to it though . could n't really taste any of the vegetables that were on it . wo n't be returning .	1371
1	i went for the 10.99 exterior wash. not a bad deal when you consider they hand dry as well . it was busy when i went so it took a bit but was impressed with the wash and will use them again . i had a lady that seemed like a manager since she was in a business suit help the regular person drying the cars , which was unexpected . the only thing i did n't like was the individual who came by asking to fix a small chip in my windshield . i saw other reviews about it and decided against having him do it after he asked multiple times .	2359
1	great place to eat ! you get a lot of food for your money . the waitress and waiters are very nice . the only complaint i have is the ketchup , personally i like heinz or hunts ketchup but the ketchup they use is an off brand . i have had a hotdog a burger and their fried pickles which all seemed to be great . i will return in the future !	1212
1	i retired about a year ago , needed to fill my day , so i signed up for a cooking class at sweet basil . i have since taken an additional 4 classes and have enjoyed each one . i have learned something in every class and have made a lot of the dishes at home . the recipes are easy , doable and delicious . the chefs are awesome with their tips and information . at 70 years old i am going to continue my cooking education.. i am now looking forward to the 'wok and roll ' class in september ! !	2612
0	at 8:42 this morning 5/7/16 , i started to go online to see if there were any i-10 closures . then the traffic girl from 3 tv came on to report the traffic and assured everyone the i-10 closures that we 're currently going on was eastbound at avondale and westbound at dysart . never did she mention eastbound between i-17 and 51 was completely shut down ! should have known better than to count on her for an accurate traffic report on my way to work saturday morning . thank you for almost making me late . next time i will be sure to tune in to a traffic reporter who is up-to-date on the latest freeway closures .	3585
1	great place to get your ice-cream craving satisfied . ive been to many coldstones in the past and this one is equally good . the employees who work there are very friendly and helpful when i cant make up my mind . as far as people complaining about prices and such . the price is the same as every other cold stone creameries . i usually always get the founders favorite and it is always delicious . i love how they offer a discount for college students if you show an id . keep up the great service guys ! : )	3646
1	this is the best pizza i ever tried ! ! ! we love the `` my big fat greek pizza '' love it ! ! ! !	276
0	i do n't understand how this place gets good reviews . it 's a turn style for cash grabbing , terrible nail and horrible customer service , scratch that no customer service at all . they are mediocre on their best day . as a customer you 're allowed only one complaint , anything else they get frustrated and may even yell at you . no class , no standard .	3368
1	love this dentist . have gotten a deep cleaning here twice now and the experience both times was very pleasant . from the front desk receptionist working with me on payment options , to the x-ray tech being very nice and sweet , to the dental hygienist who is a lovely woman and does an amazing job . i will definitely be coming back for years to come . thank you guys for making it so easy to take care of my chompers .	3191
1	better than expected for an airport bar . came in during the breakfast/lunch crossover time and ended up going with a mushroom swiss burger with onion rings to accompany my noda brewing 's `` hop drop and roll '' . both the beer and the burger were exceptional , bar staff were friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed and not too chaotic , as many airport bars can be . a slight flight delay meant that i was able to enjoy a second and third `` hop drop and roll '' before boarding . great option if you 're flying out of terminal a , post security , charlotte .	1400
0	do not go ! ! ! ! hands down worst place i have ever been to in my life . every employee was extremely rude . the service was slow and the prices are outrages . do not go here unless you feel like being treated like scum and a second class citizen .	1483
0	wow ! ! ! i 'm sure glad i found all these reviews . i thought it was just me that the doctor was so rude when it came to making the payment at the end of my appointment . dr. c has horrible customer service skills . the front desk staff was not great but to be honest they only do what he makes them do . they are a reflection on how he treats staff and customers . i will never go back to this place again !	2497
0	i went here to trade in my honda cr-z in february 2012 , they messed up my credit applying for financing through banks i told them not to apply at . after getting my new car a used 2009 honda civic si there were issues with the car they said they would fix . when i took the car back like they told me to do they refused to fix any issues with the car . the service manager cussed at me and told me to get off his lot when i got upset for confronting them about saying they would fix things they really had no intention of fixing . horrible stress full experience will never go back for anything .	2210
0	i did n't even want to give this place 1 star . i went in around 11:45 , i asked if i could get some food while the bar keep was bringing out fucking food . he declined me food without even checking with the kitchen staff of a hot dog joint . then i still tried to give this place a chance and ordered a beer . i did n't leave a tip but , oh was i surprised when i got my bank statement . the fucking thief of a bar keep gave himself a tip . so you have been warned never go to happy dog and use your bank or credit card because they will rob you !	1407
1	really sugary donuts that are creative and fun . for a softer and more pillowy donut you have to try a competitor like bosa . but for a donut that is unique without being gross , hd is the way to go . try the bacon maple -- -strong !	2053
1	great car wash here in east cheyenne . service was outstanding . car is gorgeous inside and out . price was even better . i will be returning .	3878
1	michael came through again . had a washer that stopped working earlier this summer . made the call late that afternoon and michael was over the next day . after an hour and a half of time and a reasonable bill , the washer was back up and operational . it 's been heavily used and working great since . thanks mike !	1573
0	never again . what should 've been a quick oil change and tire rotation turned into 3 hour/multiple trip fiasco . some unprofessional staff . save yourself the frustration and go elsewhere .	1592
0	they have an add for free ladybugs today but when we got there they were charging $ 6 for a bucket . we ended up getting two and $ 12 is nothing but weird to advertise and not honor	2039
1	their bakery section is heavenly . i have yet to get something from there that i did n't like . i also indulge in their prepared foods section from time to time . their soups are amazing !	2696
1	the food here is awesome . we ordered lamb and goat curry . it was really flavorful . and customer service is just great . eat at this establishment if you happen to be in vegas .	600
1	okay its burgers . what can you do to a burger ? ! well they have a brunch of ideas , and the sick bastards did it to hot dogs too ! the burgers taste fresh and stay juicy . the fries are thin and get cold if you do n't eat them quickly . stay for a shake , the split kind makes the decision much harder . this steak and shake is newer/nicer than the parma locations . worth the stop .	151
0	my boyfriend took me here for my birthday last summer . i was thankful for the experience , but let 's just say not enough to come back . the service , as expected , was good . i do n't expect much sincerity because i know they are trained a certain way , to me it just felt too rehearsed . not my kind of atmosphere . the food was unremarkable . i really ca n't say anything stood out . they were n't bad , but just did n't blow my tastebuds away . we had : nodini , olives , salumi di mare , and polipo e vongole to share .	833
0	i tried to make an appointment at chic lash . the minute the person over the phone realized i had a teambuy voucher she immediately told me she was n't by a computer and would call me back . after reading the review from kim.t i highly doubt i will get a phone call back from them . it seems like this is a big scam . chic lashes participated in the team buy promotion only to steal people 's money and never give them an appointment . absolutely disgusting business practice .	2961
0	the receptionist in the glasses kept moving people 's names ahead last night during your friday the 13th deal btw , just thought y'all should know	3776
1	very good i got helped by helen she did an amazing job i loved it they were nice and helpful they helped me find the right color i wanted ! amazing work !	132
1	i have n't been to a sonic 's before until i moved here to nevada . we do n't have a sonic 's out there in hawaii ( which they should btw ) . i like that they still serve on roller skates like they did in the past . you do n't have to leave your car ! even better ! my fav here is the slushies . happy hour slushies are the best ! super cheap ! love their tater tots ! so good ! ! unfortunately i do n't get to go here very often so i 'm not that familiar w/ their menu . tried some of their burgers & was n't disappointed . their shakes are good as well .	844
1	these are the best waffles i 've ever had . super adorable and a nice and caring staff . definitely with the visit	580
1	i went to this cafe today for the first time ever . what can i say ... i loved it ! ! i had a cup of coffee and a caramel square . each was really good and not overly priced . i ca n't believe i have n't been coming to cafe . it 's a great place to go to socialize or to go and study . the atmosphere is casual and not pretentious at all and very chill .	2163
0	service is good food is decent but 1 ) food are way over priced like 4 lamb skeward cost almost 6 bucks . 2 ) all food tasted the same . 3 ) you have to pay for every drinks , even for water . 4 ) place is small , if you go during winter there 's no places to put your jacket . 5 ) def not going back 6 ) cash only 7 ) they wo n't sperate bills even if you handed in separate orders	1359
0	motel 6 offers more services ... . no valet ... .they give you a huge sign and point to the `` east lot `` no luggage carriers at all walked into room and overcome with sewer odor from bathroom live bands playing at the mesa ampitheater till 11pm decor from the 80 ' s handi capped ... good luck ! no bellman dont stay here motel 6 is a step up lucky i did not get bedbugs	230
0	long before home goods came on the scene , the monroeville marshall 's in the miracle mile plaza was a great place to stop for shoes , clothes or any type of home gift . it was especially great for handbags . for about the past two years , the store has really faltered and i must say , i come out of there empty handed more often than not .	2251
1	love this place ! i get complimented on my nails very often lately . the shape , the colors , more natural look . it gets busy here ( popular ) so prepare to wait or make an appointment pedicures feel great and i like the massage for my legs . relaxing atmophere .	265
1	good diner-y breakfast foods . the old tvs behind the counter are a nice touch but otherwise decor is basic diner . their various versions of eggs benedict all come on has browns rather than an english muffin . a bit weird but it works . hollandaise is quite good . the egg burrito could use more beans but was fine . coffee is n't superb but is n't bad . service is quick and pleasant overall , a decent diner breakfast/lunch place . i do n't know if a place like this could ever be super-impressive but there 's little to complain about .	253
1	integrity tree service is the best ! we have used them for our commercial properties as well as our families homes . they are experts at what they do and our trees have flourished into beautiful mature trees . they charge a fair price for their service . best of all they show up on time and ready to get the job done !	3664
1	i called ten other bakers and this is the only place that said yes to a same day deliver . i need this for an early mother day girl to my friend in az . not only did they say yes they where so helpfull and nice on the phone . they did n't change me astronomical prices either . big points in my book . and to top it all off my girlfriend loved the little cakes . 5 stars all the way .	18
0	such bad service . i went in to get gel manicure and the lady was beyond rude . she was talking on the phone the entire time and then chipped my nail and she did n't even seem to care . the paint job was so bad ! the lady was so careless and in a rush . they were n't even busy . highly disappointed and will never return to this place . i will never recommend this place to anyone .	3260
1	our regular chinese restaurant is closed on tuesday , which was a surprise to us , so we tried the wok . we did carry-out . this restaurant is located in a shopping center . most of the business looked to be carry-out , but they do have a few tables . i was impressed by the cleanliness of the place and the friendly staff . we ordered general tso 's chicken , chicken with snow peas , mu shu pork , egg drop soup and crap rangoons . we were all delighted with our selections . everything tasted great . the portion sizes were large and everyone had leftovers for tomorrow . we will definitely be back .	829
1	the atmosphere was great and we had a super waitress . way to go jennifer ! she was very polite , attentative and quick .	1549
0	very dissapointing service . guys were rude . i stopped by to have a tire checked and was told i would have to wait . had no cars in the building	1921
1	nice place to bowl , but the lane we were on kept shutting down .	3581
0	absolutely terrible service the worker alicia is very rude and shady and so is the security guard name matt . who happened to waste the cops time calling the cops on costumers just because his racist homophobic self felt like it . do not even waste your time here the staff is in alone level , just go to essence down the street way cheaper and actually good service i would rather not smoke anymore than come waste my money here	1025
1	excellent experience . totally would recommend this place . it was a first for us and i would do it again .	998
0	i really wish i had something nice to say about this location . but every time i go in there i have the worst service everything is very inconsistently made they are rude and no one actually knows how to make ice cream . send it tonight i went in there and ordered a large ice cream to receive a small ice cream in a large cup which i paid six dollars for , with the mix ins of a small . i 've been to enough cold stones to know how they make ice cream . and this one does not know how . to see some training done for their employees would be nice maybe some more consistency throughout the group .	3201
1	i thought that the pizza was very good and i really love the atmosphere of the market . i will be a long time customer here .	809
1	lots of choices on the menu . good for the family . we all really enjoyed the food and the margaritas were good , too .	1330
1	love this place ! ! great food at a reasonable price and fast friendly service . i had a chicken pistachio salad which is pretty big and had lots of chicken . i hate when i go to a place and they are skimpy on chicken and you have to pay extra for more meat . anyway my husband loves salmon and had the pasta salmon bowl and loved it as well . neither one of us drink soda so we had water which made our bill only $ 20 . not bad ! well definitely come back .	1387
1	so good ! went there for lunch with my girls and they loved it ! best mac and cheese and bread pudding !	1046
1	always a friendly , knowledgeable staff . everyone always eager to help and answer questions . though they could give more free stuff like puppies or popcorn .	494
1	no shame in my thrift store game ! the inventory is turning constantly here , so feel free coming every week . the deals are ah-mazing ! the store is clean and the staff is very accommodating and friendly . i love it here ! ! poppin ' tags ! !	128
1	tom welsh is a great representative ! he assisted me with my watch repair and they were 1/3 the price of their competition . this is an excellent place to work with ! get this ... tom picks up and delivers ! ! ! ! take all of my jewelry there . ! you cant go wrong using this outfit , they are as good as it gets. ! ! ! !	2307
1	i stopped here for lunch hoping to have some french dejeuner and stock up on some french groceries ! the lunch was good- stinky but tasty cheese in the croque madame and quiche , and the salad was fresh and had french style vinaigrette . we were a little disappointed by the lack of actual french groceries : ( the cheese selection was not too far above trader joes , they did n't even have all of the classics like beaufort , and classic chèvre . also they had a very small selection for the patisserie and boulangerie . to summarize , it was good , but i was just hoping for more variety overall .	1160
0	with no one even waiting in the office there are hour plus long waits . the doctor does n't care if you have made an appt , he does as he pleases . this was my second annual appointment here and 3rd time coming overall ... .i have finally learned my lesson and will never return .	313
0	4 days later the shellac has discoloured and how the black inconsistent splotchiness is more prevalent . very dissapointed .	2148
1	i have been coming to ashley 's for almost 10 years & they are amazing ! ! ! they give the best & longest foot massages with their pedi 's ! ! their salon is clean & professional & they just remodeled as well -- very modern . my family loves ashley nails ! ! : - )	2372
1	the food tasted the same as chipotle back in my home state , so it was consistent . this chipotle also shares the same establishment with panda express and pizza place . it 's very popular ( can get loud ) but the service is quick . you may have to wait a little to find a seat because you 're sharing with the other restaurant patrons too . they do n't have large tables . most sit 4 at most . this chipotle also allows you to order ahead for large groups .	214
0	ummm it was me who was pinned up against a wall , and that situation had been handled on its own ... .maybe you had your facts straight on the wrong person involved ... as for an argument with a security guard , that was the point i was trying to make and clearly no one was giving a fuck . i 've been disrespected in there multiple times and i apologize that this time i spoke out about it and the person did n't like what i had to say .	2860
0	avoid 407 etr like the plague , few minutes ( detour ) cost $ 21 usd , including hertz fine , even with the exact billing number there is no way to avoid their really sucky it system or do direct pay . hertz charged a 60 % admin fee ! dont visit canada or be very careful as this toll highway really sucks the big one .	2336
1	not sure of why the negative reviews as i have been very pleased with the service i got when i was very ill. first , i love the fact that they are open 7 days a week . second , i love that the front staff is very friendly and get you through the process quickly . third , not long wait to see a doctor and fourth the service from the doctor was excellent . i would come here again .	121
0	the lobby is gorgeous , but rooms are very out dated for such a high cost hotel . pool and spa are over crowded . clientele was mixed . staff was friendly . the location was excellently located . i was very disappointed by the rooms appearance ( cleanliness and aesthetics ) .	1690
0	housekeeping can be lazy and the rooms look like its 1995 . internet is nearly non existent . bel hop are hit or miss on transportation and if you store your suitcase they may just give it to someone else without checking tags . the rooms are spacious though	2973
0	there were a lot of sales people busy doing nothing . my husband and i came in to buy new bedroom furniture but nobody offered to help us . they were all either standing around doing nothing or talking to each other . i 'll go elsewhere .	3738
1	it 's close to my work , they are pretty fast , food is always good . for mexican fast food , it hits the spot . love the fish tacos whether they are battered or blackened . i always have my chips with the chipotle salsa . love that stuff ! for a quick meal at a chain it works for me !	1245
1	my first 5/5 review ever ! everything was superb ! the service was quick , effecienr , and attentive ... we were checked on by our own waitress and another member of staff : it was convenient yet non-disturptive . the food was excellent . i was starving and our group ordered a decent variety : no one had 1 negative opinion of anything . the flavours were awesome and delicious . there is enough room between tables to have some privacy . overall , amazing experience and we will be back . thank you to the staff and chef ! parking is a struggle but if you show up for happy hour , there is plenty of close street parking !	1812
1	a group of friends and i stayed here and reserved a 2 bedroom with living room and full kitchen . we were pleasantly pleased with the room till morning rolled around and we were woken to horrible nonstop banging , we later found out that they were reflooring the room above us at 8 am in the morning ! we were not happy and slept crappy because of this . joel the manager called us back and rearranged another stay for us , im really glad i took him up on his offer because the second time around was so much better . i would stay here again in the future .	3091
1	absolutely love this pharmacy for my pets ' meds ! their customer service is beyond measure , and i always leave the call feeling well cared for . not only does the prescription arrive in a timely manner , it also comes with a little toy for my fur kid . i would recommend this pharmacy to anyone , anytime .	2827
1	greeted by axel who saw us through a wonderful 3 course meal and wine pairing . from tomato bisque and gem salad to the vintage board and then flat iron steak for us both ... it was all delicious beyond expectations ! ! great service ... thank you axel and delicious food ... thank you chef ! !	49
1	potato pancakes and chicken strips to die for ! ! ! ! ! great service , fun bar , a must on steeler sundays .	1189
0	the food was not bad . the pesto chicken and shrimp good but the chicken they use in their house specialty was a pre-cooked piece of chicken . service was terrible ! ! ! ! still did n't have silverware when we got food and we asked for it when we got our bread . used a groupon , but if they are using groupon to generate business it is not going to happen with the service they have .	368
0	i tried this spot out because of such positive reviews - however i fail to see the sort of quality everyone is raving about . i chose the chicken teriyaki - and it was ok , standard stuff . and a spicy salmon , it was n't tightly rolled like i prefer and was a bit mushy - did n't hit the spot like my scarborough favourite does . the seaweed salad , seemed a bit more intense than it usually is anywhere else . did n't taste anything special in the miso soup either . sigh i 'll give it another chance again - maybe it was an off day .	41
0	terrible experience excessive amount of time to fix finder . lack of communication with me on progress broke seatbelt , lost car emblem , and had to repair lights ( $ 800 . ) when i finally got my car after almost 8 weeks	8
1	a quick & convenient option when you 've got meetings in the sands convention center at the crack of dawn ! ! vegas can be so cruel -- -ice blended mocha : a good breakfast option to go with my banana.. it 's pretty much the same price as starbucks.. i was n't expecting the chocolate drizzle though note : they also offer pastries , yogurt , etc if you need more than a drink to hold you over	2397
0	it 's really sad that a science center for kids would be this expensive . especially in these troubled times when we should be encouraging families to push science and math in their kids .	3891
0	do n't ever use this place . worst transmission shop in arizona paid for transmission and after 5 months and 5 return visits i gave up and would n't refund my money . i went to checkmark transmission and hired them to start over . owner ca n't tell the truth to save his life . 5months 5 tow bills i gave up .	2605
0	this place has the worse customer service ever had my nails done here before and came the next day because one nail was chipped and they did n't want to fix my nail and then i came another time at 7pm and they close at 7:30 just for a simple gel nail polish and they said they were closed because they wanted to close earlier . super rude staff .	1263
0	service is lacking to say the least . there is literally one other couple in here and after 10 minutes we have water . i guess that is why they need to offer groupons to get customers in here . live and learn .	1317
0	the name is defiantly misleading . this is just your average neighborhood bar . the menu seems interesting until you are served average food at best . you would think having called themselves a wine bar there would be a great wine list , not happening . your options for wine are red , white , blush . good luck with that ! i said it was good for groups but that is only if the handful of large tables are not already occupied .	913
0	extremely slow service and poor communication between employees . waiting nearly 30min for a bagel . the final product was very mediocre when it finally arrives but not worth the long wait or the steep price .	995
1	service . food.atmosphere . on point . if u dont eat here when you 're in vegas ... you are fired ... in life . darcy was the best ! mike lee , thanks for checking in on us !	603
1	it 's popeyes ... we received what we ordered and it was hot . my wife and i each ordered a 2-piece combo meal that came with a biscuit and side . my wife ordered the rice and i ordered the mashed potatoes side . it was located in a service area on the toll road so prices were a little more expensive . there were plenty of seats and tables in an open area and the facility was clean . parking was n't an issue given the service area and there were other restaurants and stores to browse if desired .	1479
1	open box buy is great ! the prices here ca n't be beat ! i just picked up a 70 '' sharp led for less than i could find a used one for on craigslist !	2186
1	enjoy coming here for happy hour . drinks 50 % off . our server brittney was awesome ! very friendly staff . atmosphere is very pleasant . clean facilities . good is good .	1520
0	not good ! one star is being generous . at check in we were told our co-pay was 70 dollars . when we did n't have it we were then asked `` how much cash do you have ? '' based on our insurance we should have no co-pay ! beware ! !	3003
1	i just moved to phoenix a few months ago . i was n't used to how dirty my ( dark colored ) car would get in such a short period of time . i tried another place and it was good , but way to pricey to do on a regular basis . after having my car parked at the airport for a week i decided to try hog wash since it was close to work . i was a little thrown off by the self vacuuming , but got over it . i was extremely impressed with how good the wash was for the price . vacuuming it out myself was n't even that bad . would definitely consider the monthly pass .	2044
1	i love this dunkin and the people that work there ! i can not get over how amazing the coffee is and how good the food is ! the employees are lovely , even in the morning when i 'm not to lovely lol . i am so glad this is within walking distance from my home will visit often !	1532
0	this place was so gross ! i find it funny that the name is sauce because there was almost no sauce on my child 's pasta and on the pizza ! the bruschetta tasted like i might as well have eaten a spoonful of salt & it was definitely way overpriced for the crap that was delivered to my home ! i would suggest getting a red baron pizza because it will be way better than what they call food at sauce . the best thing we tasted from here is the sierra mist soda . huge disappointment & waste of money ! giving one star was being generous ! ! ! !	1161
0	check your receipt ! placed a takeout order today , and when i went to add a tip , i noticed they had already added one . when i questioned the cashier she did n't apologize or anything . tipping should be up to the customer , not the cashier ! !	389
0	was not allowed to take my own clubs in with me nor the coffee i had just bought . therfore we left went up the street a few miles and got to use my own clubs and ha e my coffee . doubt i will return to top golf .	1483
1	my husband and i went in last weekend looking for a coffee table . our salesperson , nick was amazing , very knowledgeable and gave us a great deal . we ended up purchasing the coffee table which came w/matching end tables , small sectional sofa , a queen bed w/mattress , and wall art . everything was delivered and set up a few days later , we could n't be happier with our experience ... .thanks to the wonderful staff at ashley furniture !	1794
1	this place is awesome for bridesmaids dresses ! the alterations are very reasonably priced and they do a great job ! !	1298
0	th lady who owns the salon seems nice but she had a stylist named mary who advertises on groupon and ca n't keep her schedule straight . i had an appointment for friday after telling mary that i was leaving town the next day . she apparently wrote the appointment down for saturday despite our conversation . when i arrived today the salon owner called mary and she insisted the appointment was for the next day . the salon owner did not offer another stylist as she explained that `` mary , handles the groupons.. '' if you own the business , and you employ the stylist - it is ultimately your responsibility .	1999
1	food is good for a 24 hour place . a little pricey but would definitely come back . walking into the restaurant the aroma makes you hungry .	1290
1	i went into the apple store to make a purchase for the first time ever today and it was a great experience . i was dreading coming here expecting long line ups at the cashier but was surprised to find out that they just have each individual employee check out the product for you which really made me enjoy coming here a lot more and made the trip very quick for me . the staff were really helpful too , practically the second i walked in they asked if i need something and i told him what i needed , within the minute i was out of the store . definitely recommend coming here for all your apple product needs	2575
1	i visited this restaurant upon a recommendation from a co-worker , and was certainly not disappointed . i did not call ahead to place a takeout order however did not wait longer than 5 minutes for my sushi to be made . i had a tuna and a salmon roll . both rolls held extremely generous portions of fish , which i did n't expect due to their rather low prices . the quality of the fish was excellent , the tuna was especially lean . the service was professional and courteous . i 'll definitely be visiting again .	24
0	we used to go to this place all the time for cakes and baked items . unfortunately when the owner sold the quality went way down . the people who bought it have not kept up the same standards and they do n't know how to decorate properly anymore . we stopped going and do n't recommend this place to anyone now . we would reconsider if the current owners bring in professionals who can do the same quality work as the original owner .	868
1	impressionism on canvas and via photograph . well curated trope . see it now ! especially if you did not see pix at met show a few months ago . hotspur	101
0	they should have the option on 0 stars . you wonder why you never see black people running a beauty supply now i see why because it 's always some shit . they would n't take my bank card without an id and they run all debit as credit which is dumb as fuck . they are very unprofessional and rude . i 'll never go here again they give all beauty supple warehouse a bad name .	3676
1	honestly , i have nothing bad to say about this place ... and i 've eaten here at least 10 times . the service has always been great , food excellent ( love the crostini appies , pizza and the spaghetti and meatballs for 2 ) . nice vibe with the open kitchen or even sitting at the bar , which we usually do . just writing this makes me want to go !	102
0	this place sucks ! crappy food with even crappier customer service . i hope they go out of business soon . worst bike shop i have ever been to . the people working here are jerks !	3726
1	great bubble tea and dessert with a lot of selections and plus they have a nice selection of food lunch or dinner this place is great to eat with your friends wife or husband . i highly recommend their taiwanese shave ice dessert if you have a sweet tooth for yummy dessert , but beware it 's big so , you might want to share .	176
1	very nice park for a variety of activities including playground and amusement park for children , jogging , walking , golfing and just enjoying the great outdoors .	3471
0	absolute disaster ... i went to this place once ... and they lost my shirt ( which i needed for a wedding that weekend . ) several times the owner promised to call me to let me know the status of things , then just completely failed to do so like a totally irresponsible dufus . the staff could never help me ... just promise that the owner would call ( which he did n't . ) i would never , ever , ever , ever go here again .	2332
0	although i used to love this salon , i do thank them for `` encouraging '' me to find a new `` forever salon '' . i did and love it !	3631
1	i 've stay here 3 times and it 's been great every time ! i would stay there again soon ! the suite with the balcony is quite nice 'cause you can see the pool and parts of the strip . i highly recommend it .	921
1	the loan officer was great and was my home builder 's recommended lender . i was a bit trepidatious at first , but after speaking with michael and him explaining the process to me , my fears were put the rest . his assistant autumn was fantastic ; she was definitely the most helpful and made the process enjoyable !	968
1	great bar ! so i 'm not into leather but i love to explore gay bars in every city i visit so it was great meeting new people . easily welcomed as the staff was great . just enjoyed my time exploring the scene as this is a most visit spot in the district .	1827
0	the only reason i 'm giving two stars and not one is because the employees were very friendly and helpful . otherwise this store is unorganized , understocked , out of everything , and do n't carry a lot of things . also their prices are super high double what i pay that other supplies for certain things . not worth it at all for cheap beauty products . when i heard they do n't let you bring in backpacks and stuff i did n't even want to come here at all but i was right next to it and had to grab a few things , needless to say i wo n't be back .	1659
1	very helpful , my insurance sent the wrong info over . and patty was a real big help at sorting everything ! very good location .	1021
1	nice local place to go for vietnamese food . i usually get the noodles with soup or the pork pho . reasonable prices and very quick and friendly service .	594
1	on of the best chains . very big , spacious , high quality and yummy ! went here with about 10 people . our service was very slow- they brought out one drink at a time . we were there for lunch and they knew ahead of time of how many would be attending . aside from that , it was really good .	1094
1	got to say for five dollars on monday you ca n't beat this deal . grabbed a bite to eat at the food court in front of the theater reasonably priced food . the theater is up to date and the sound system is great too would be coming back here again .	491
1	i 've had several good business meetings here . really the only thing i 've tried is the regular coffee , so i need to try the food and the smoothies . friendly staff and managers and a very roomy location with outdoor seating . i 'll be back regularly ... it 's nearly paradise for coffee shops ! plus i have a rewards card to use .	701
1	great family fun entertainment . went here with my brother a few times over a year ago forgot how much fun it was ! there is a special every day super busy location and friendly staff . always busy i would suggest calling ahead . great staff and improvements always happening .	2235
0	thought i 'd check it out since the reviews are really good . tried it , and ... i think that the food was eh ... ok , i guess . not as great as people described it to be . kinda disappointed . my son had the hawaiian burger and my daughter and i shared the kimchi hotdog . it was so-so . we also ordered carne asada fries , which tasted very american and no mexican flavor at all , it was more like sautéed beef and cheese atop crispy fries . also , we order the euro fries and it was alright as well . oh also , the price was too much for the quality of the food .	1566
0	i was fine with the treatment i received initially . when i read the claim on my insurance company 's website i was shocked to see i had been billed $ 38 by dr shaba for cessation of tobacco counseling . i have n't smoked since 1992 . i talked to his office and they said that he had told me `` not to start smoking again '' during my office visit . really ? ? ? $ 38 ? makes me wonder whether the additional tests he wanted to do on me were indeed necessary ? in my opinion they practice deceptive billing at best and some would call them thieves .	2777
0	i wish the appointment people would answer the phone . left 8 messages and no one has called back yet . unfortunately this is where my insurance wants me to go .	1149
0	this was my first time here ... the food is tasteless . i ordered a cesar salad only to send it back ... kraft has a better salad dressing . also i was served water that had a oily film on the top . my mom asked for extra garlic for her pasta and that was n't provided either . will not be back ... worst food i 've ever had	440
1	very nice hotel , our room was clean and comfortable . kudos to the front staff for letting us check in early . we also got a room on the 9th floor with a great view of the westgate shopping district . we stayed here because we did n't want to drive home after the toby mac concert and the next door glendale arena so it worked out perfectly ! my wife is using the spa this morning for a much needed massage .	1656
0	my boyfriend was in extreme pain and the customer service was atrocious . the front desk women had passive aggressive attitudes and not only did we wait an hour and a half because they messed up his insurance billing but he missed his doctors appointment . plus they did n't even give him his paperwork to fill out until we called the doctors ourselves to get the correct information which took half the time it did for them . very unorganized and not recommended if you have any other plans for the day or want to be heard .	554
0	update . car got stolen right out of our spot ! security saw nothing , management never got back to us on their `` investigation '' ridiculous .	244
0	mediocre food ... ..and painfully slow service . and this is when they were not even busy ... . there were two other patrons waiting for the food before us . at least three other empty tables were dirty ... and no one came to clean them . i am not sure who is giving this establishment high ratings ! ! ! ? ? ?	1252
1	my family has been going to pv eyecare for many years . we have never had any issue with the staff or dr. rios who is the best ! appointments are flexible and prices are competetive . this is a no pressure place- unlike other places . you can buy your frames/contacts there or they will give you your prescription and you can go elsewhere . i am not familiar with any of the other doctors that are there but if you need a great eye doctor- try dr. rios .	663
1	jet has been doing my nails for the last 12 years . i live miles away , and i drive by at least a dozen nail places to get to signature nails & spa . they are great . today i asked jet to give my golden knights nails and he delivered . i love going there and always feel like a million dollars when i leave .	1388
1	i 've been here a few times now . there 's a good selection of scrubs , and always plenty of staff to help . the people are friendly , and the store is clean , if cluttered . they also sell shoes and some medical supplies stethoscopes , badge holders , etc . it 's a good place to go if you need scrubs another medical supplies .	1920
0	service department is a joke . called to ask about a sub frame on my ktm and was given a snappy response that i needed to drive across town to get any information . i asked again to confirm they would be able to get the part and was given the answer that they were pretty sure it was something they could get i just need to come in personally . no price . no availability . no lead time . service staff then said she would ask her manager if they could get the part . decided to hang up at that point . i guess i 'll go online . i get better support from amazon .	195
0	worst experience ever ! this place is not a resort ! it 's a business hotel ! no jacuzzi , dirty towels , burned carpet , crappy rundown games but ... the worst part of it is that there was a dead rat in the pool ! it was bloated and it looked like it had been there for hours ! this was the worst experience of my life ! we booked with the intentions of celebrating my husband 's birthday and had to check out immediately ! the hotel itself looks musty and run down ! stay far away from this one ! !	3835
0	overpriced ! ! ! will not use again . pros : fixed the same day cons : charged $ 245 for a tub/shower cartridge ( $ 39 in hd ) . the issue i have is that he quoted spare part $ 190 plus 12 % mark up plus $ 45 service charge . as it turned out the mark up on a part was over 480 % ! ! ! !	1721
0	we were walking around , not looking for stuff , just looking ... and when we arrived to the fish tanks , we saw multiple dead fish per tank , ok , one fish in a tank i can accept , but multiple for such a big store and what not else you can do there is kind of crazy , would end go there for fishies	2822
1	i wish that i would have known about this place sooner . i have only been here twice since i only discovered it last month . i had the turkey burger with fries and a chocolate malt the first time and i had the frisco with onion rings and soda the second time . i love this place ! everything i ate from here was golden . i can now say that i 'm a hardee 's fan .	800
1	i actually really like this mac because i always know what i need to get in and get out . if you want to get your makeup or something done , then maybe i understand the reviews . but as far as the makeup , they have everything !	3490
0	pekarna kills me . it had the potential to be amazing , but unfortunately , every single cake ( except for the strawberry shortcake which is amazing ) is horrible . and yes , i 've tried them all . i keep having hope that i 'll find something else that 's good here , but it just keeps getting sadder and sadder . the gelato is n't even good..neither are the little pastries ... i 've been here at least 20 times ( work is nearby , and sometimes i pop in to buy a cake for an occasion or some pastries for breakfast ) , and unless i buy the strawberry shortcake , i always find myself really disappointed ! *sad face*	436
0	i went there to get my green machine rodeo looked at to see why i had engine power loss . anyway , i have to put down a $ 1,200 deposit . needless to say , they put a junk yard engine in it that would n't pass emissions . corporate and the manager kurt did n't want to do a thing about the fact i never gave consent for a new engine . i wanted to know what was wrong with mine . on top of never getting status updates about what was going on . do not ever go here . you will regret it	3196
1	i stayed here just one night for a quick work trip . i had a spacious suite , two queens , microwave , mini-fridge , couch , and two tvs ( not flat-screen ) . the room was clean . the staff was friendly and check-in was a breeze . i did n't take advantage of the breakfast but it looked good , about what you 'd expect for hotel in this class . ihop is conveniently right next-door for something more substantial . if i had to spend a few days in vegas , this would be a good choice .	3802
1	i came in for a shattered iphone screen . they had it replaced and out the door in just a few minutes . call ahead to see if they are busy . fast.. friendly.. professional .	2930
1	it 's my favourite coco bun location . it has all my favourites plus it 's in a super convenient location . no complaints about this place whatsoever . it can get a bit dirty because so many people visit it so often but the staff is really quick and friendly .	2211
0	i had a chip in my windshield repaired . the following morning , i realized that the technician failed to properly clean my windshield exterior and interior . epoxy/resin dripped from the location of the chip and ran down my windshield onto my windshield wipers . my wipers were glued to the windshield and the excess epoxy/resin dried into the glass . in addition , the device used on the interior of my vehicle left marks and smudges on the glass . if you decide to go to this location for service , i strongly recommend you thoroughly inspect your vehicle before you leave . i learned the hard way : (	1052
1	management has changed alot at this best buy and i have to say that they are always helpful everytime i go in .	494
0	i had a similar problem as the previous post. , the staff there was rude . i was going to report them to the better business bureau only to find out that they already have a f rating .i wished that i had checked with the better business bureau first . f is the lowest rating that you can get..	2720
0	i made an appointment with david but he pawns me off on other techs . he is the best person there but has no respect for others . miley is good but inconsistent . they have good prices but as they say `` you get what you pay for . ''	3347
0	3 attempts at quote request and no response . i guess that means they ca n't do the job . not going to drive there for nothing	2262
1	i was heading to the gym , when i realized i needed an oil change . thankfully , they were located across from my gym so i decided to take my car there . the front desk receptionist was very nice when i walked in . there were 2 cars in front of me , so i sat and waited . i was in there for about 30 minutes before it was my turn . ron was quick and efficient . he even noticed that my car headlight was out . he replaced my headlight bulb and checked over the rest of the car . he did a great job and was so nice explaining things . i 'll definitely be back .	1324
0	here for a conference . this place is a maze . this place has the worst layout of any hotel i have ever seen . makes zero sense . good luck finding anything . bring a map .	230
1	i needed help with a butane lighter and went right before closing- the girl was very friendly and showed me exactly what i was doing wrong and almost tried not to sell me a new one as i forgot to bring my old one and she wanted to try and fix it . i did get a new one and a few other things too as this young lady was a wonderful salesperson and knew the products . thank you !	3403
0	i needed to remove the gel manicure and ended up going to this place , they took me in without needing an appointment but i wasnt sure how clean this place is , the counter was dirty the tools didnt look clean . staff were friendly but i felt everything i touched wasnt clean	1971
0	i ordered a veruca salt cocktail . it was tasty , but nothing spectacular . the burger was great , cooked perfectly with a nice roasted pepper spread . i have no idea why the small patty was served on a giant bun . i would have preferred a bun that was the same size as the burger . it seemed like the restaurant did n't want to go to the effort to have buns made for them . the service was terrible . after my cocktail i stuck with water . i was empty so often that i eventually drank the water of my table mates . dessert was n't offered at all . i 'm not going to rush back to this restaurant .	1226
0	you know how to inconvenience a loyal patron at the fuel center ? install only the short , non-extending hose , rendering half of the fueling pumps a waste of space . a lot of cars have their tank on the other side . fix it and you 'll stay busier and easier to use , which is the metrics of the future , if you want to maintain loyal customers .	2469
1	i absolutely love the pharmacy here . they are so helpful and kind . they have helped me several situations including calling my doctor to question directions on a medicine i needed to take that seemed off . just because i felt uncomfortable . i love my extra care card and use it religiously and therefore i have saved a ton of money ! my go to pharmacy and cosmetic , vitamin , health care item store !	1039
0	technician forced object down my son 's throat attempting to get an x-ray and left marks in his mouth . when asked if there was another way to get an x-ray done , she replied `` i do n't know where you 're coming from but that 's not the way it 's done . '' extremely curt , rude and blatantly disrespectful . to add insult to injury , the dentist approved of her behavior . never again .	3628
1	ca n't go wrong . make it an all day thing . am service , pool/rest/spa , pm service . one star off since they limited the locals discount to certain services . it used to be applicable to the whole menu .	2651
1	this is close by where we live and its ao convenient . we just stopped here for gas and end it up living with bunch of snacks and drinks . the place seems a bit bussy but its better than going far to anorher gas station and running low on gas . the place is pretty clean and the staff is nice as well ,	507
1	despite what everyone is saying , i liked this show . it was cheap , as i found a nice 2 for 1 coupon at http : //www.mycheapvegas.com , and it was more then i expected . like one of the previous posters said , the liger was cool and worth the entrance fee itself . just do n't go in thinking you 're going to see copperfield . he charges like $ 70 a person for a reason . you get what you pay for and with that coupon , you get a lot more .	865
0	two techs seemed to be rookies tho one had been `` at this location a couple months '' . according to my provider the image was not taken from the requested angle . before having the x-rays i inquired about the cost three times to get an estimate . the most disconcerting experience , however , was `` locking '' my stuff in the changing room ; the key was not given to me but the tech tossed it in the chart rack outside the equipment room accessible to anyone in the hallway . overall , not impressed .	188
1	was here yesterday for the get motivated seminar . now , i am pumped up and more motivated than ever . parking is $ 7.00 . lots of parking spaces . no way to get lost and all you have to do is follow the crowd of people . we were in a smaller conference area on the other side people were setting up for the southern ideal show . thank goodness there was more than one restroom area for the women . first bathroom started to line up . no matter where you go this always happens . found another area of restroom for women . this is a pretty basic and simple conference area with tables and chairs . stage and acoustics are good .	1492
1	i love jersey mikes & was so glad when this one opened . the ingredients are fresh , service was really quick and the employees were really friendly ! the # 13 ( italian ) is my personal go-to sandwich , mike 's way , of course . oh and add cherry pepper relish , trust me ! the `` mini '' is the perfect size for lunch , too !	1289
1	my first of many musicals started here with mamma mia in the mandalay . my middle name is `` dancing queen . '' it was really exciting and the audience got into it with dancing and singing along in the aisle . the cast of mamma mia definitely set a high standard for other musicals .	2752
1	nice people , good coffee and great sammies ! they have included some vegetarian options for those not wanting to get too hoggy . prices are a little steep for wraps and sandwiches , but i think it has more to do with all the local product they use .	267
1	fancy shmancy cosmetics ! but the store layout at the walnut street store is awkward ( narrow store , narrow aisles ) making it difficult to browse around freely ... the best function of sephora . i always feel like i am going to knock stuff or people down . and have trouble finding things . but oh the convenience . they have most everything you could ever want to beautify yourself .	2574
1	this was our first time at this location . we decided to get the unlimited crab . it was delicious . we also had semi- frozen crab but chris , the manager , made sure things were made right and took great care of us . we will definitely go back .	201
1	gr8 location ! gr service ! gr8 room ! i luv aloft hotels . stayed in one in tulsa , ok . it was perfect there too ! they have a real cool concept and style . i 'll stay in aloft 's when ever i can !	3337
1	i absolutely love this place , and treasure dr. kim . she 's thorough , answers all of my questions , and is incredibly personable . she 's also very conservative and knows when something looks suspicious and when it does n't - i trust her judgement completely ! the entire staff is professional , courteous , and one of the best healthcare providers i 've dealt with .	2099
1	food : excellent . from the entree to desert , they did a fabulous job of making some healthy and tasty vegetable dishes . service : good . everyone were pretty friendly , you have to order at the front desk and the food is brought out to you . overall : based on prices , quality and service , i would highly recommend this spot if you 're in the burgh .	21
0	i brought a pair of earrings for my mother for mother day . and today i am in store because they broke . they said that they could not exchange and no refunds . they will try to fix . after i get my mother earring i will never shop here again . very rude	3839
1	you would think that starbucks would get 5 stars no matter what the location . this one doesnt . no drive thru , so you must go in , it 's cramped in there , there are very few chairs to sit and enjoy your beverage and there is almost always a line in there ! the drinks are pretty consistent , and its 4 blocks from home , so those are the only things that keep me going there .	2950
0	came here wanting a real breakfast it fell short . i ended up getting a tuna waffle which was lacking tuna , too much waffle and not enough meat/flavor . the mrs. thought it was `` ok '' but i do n't think we would come back unless to try a dessert waffle .	580
1	my family and i spend christmas weekend here , and it was absolutely beautiful ! staying here was very low-key , which is exactly what we were looking for ! we stayed at a 2 bedroom suite with full kitchen access , and everything was perfect ! the room came with coffee mugs , cups , wine glasses , utensils , plates , bowls , and a cutting board . we also had pots and pans to cook our christmas dinner ! we were on the third floor and had a beautiful view of the lake . my family and i have decided to make this an annual christmas trip since we had such a phenomenal experience .	3916
0	the food is great , but the workers there are rude , lazy , and sit there on their phone at the register . c'mon , do your job !	1259
0	cashier decided to basically wave around my personal products ( condoms , etc ) , then basically after showing everyone behind in a big line what i was getting , she decided to rudely question my girlfriends age like i 'm some creep , as were leaving making a scene , and embarrassing me , and my girlfriend . i would go elsewhere if you need buy something discretely .	3799
0	rude and falsely says that the iphone 6 plus temper glass works on a iphone 6s plus , when the tempered glass was installed it did n't fit right . excuse was that the glass was made for the iphone 6 , but when i asked the store clerk she said that it would be fine . get your shit together !	3560
0	dr. stutman and lisa were awesome , i give them 5/5 review . i will never go back to spectrum though , everyone else seemed incompetent .	2099
1	we came to replace our internet modem and only had to wait about 5 minutes before we met with the cox representative . he was efficient and helped us with our problem ... we even broke down our bill and got it reduced !	3219
0	i am shocked this place has such good reviews . i came here for that reason ... for a pedicure . my pedicure i paid extra 5 dollars for the heel treatment which i did n't get . and i had gotten an ingrown nail which i have never had before . i work at a salon and know how they happen and they should never happen at a nail salon ever ... it was soooo painful . my toe blew up a few days later and had to have a nail tech look and remove the ingrown part . i will never be back .	3732
0	not exactly the type of food i should be eating while recovering during a night out in the vegas summer heat for edc , but it was convenient since i stayed at the circus circus where this krispy kreme is located . the lines are long most of the time , and the one time when it was n't , 2 staff behind the counter saw me standing there waiting and did n't acknowledge me . and it 's been awhile since i been to a krispy kreme , but the donuts do seem a bit pricey from the other ones i 've been to .	2666
0	it 's okay . i love fish , so i 'll say it 's okay . -pitiful number of exhibits for the cost . - very small walkways . -terrible costumer service both times i went . no one could answer my questions about things . -their ads are full of error in grammar . -rude ticket staff this last time i went . -horrible location . if you are uneducated about local fish ( they have a good display of them ) , have money to blow , have never seen the fish wall at petsmart , give it a go . you may be impressed .	706
1	erik and ed were so fantastic throughout the entire process . i love everything about my experience with this dealership !	3644
0	came to this place only to find out they 're closed for renovation . no sign , no notification on yelp or google . get your shit together and take care of your social media so people know . morons .	1073
1	very delicious vegetarian pho . my husband had a seafood pho and said delicious as well . it was pass 9pm , all the shops near our house were closed . this place was a great find . the server girls are so efficient and attentive .	673
