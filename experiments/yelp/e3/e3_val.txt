0	my experience has been similar to the other reviewers . i think dr. feldman is a great doctor . at times i have found the reception staff rude . and the prices are at least double anywhere else for glasses . i have requested my prescription several times but always left empty handed - they said they would but just did n't get around to printing it out . i would return for the exam but not the products .	2536
0	the women were very nice and friendly and listened to how i wanted my eyebrows . that is the only reason i gave them an extra star . i have been getting my eyebrows threaded for almost 6 years now and i have never had a reaction or problem until i came here . the first time it was very painful and when i woke up the next day i was scabbed and red . i looked like i had a disease . it took weeks to heal . i decided to give them another shot last week and the same thing happened ! looks like i will have to drive back to my old side of town to my old threading bar .	3016
1	great laundry mat , clean machines and friendly staff ! cute rocking chairs to relax in and arcade games/ vending machine for the kids . this is the best i 've found in the area . other customers have also been polite and respectful .	2194
0	i was a pretty loyal customer here just because i lived so close , but twice they 've taken off half my eyebrow , once ripped an eyelash out , and actually burned me with the thread under my eyebrow and i have a lovely scar . no thanks .	460
0	american residential properties is horrible and unorganized . they told me i was approved , excited for that . then i called in the next day and they told me i was n't approved ... horrible service .	3536
0	poor service . employees loud and playing with each other . they had to ask each other who was going to ring my order . drink was made badly as well . there were no other customers in line besides me at the time . beware this location on the a concourse . hope starbucks fixes it soon .	3124
0	i came in today for a nice relaxing pedicure i left there in less than 30 minutes it was the worst pedicure i ever had in my life i paid $ 5 extra for the callus remover which i did not receive also i did not get a massage i also asked for a design in which she said yes and then at the end did nothing at all and when i asked how come i was so rushed out of there with the pedicure she said what my next clients here so my pedicure was less than 20 minutes all together horrible horrible horrible customer service i would never come back there again and i 'm definitely not giving any good reviews on this place	3682
0	horrible service here , john was no help and extremely unprofessional . so much for better quality	3041
0	called late to make an appointment for a couples massage after a long day of traveling , when we got there they did n't understand a word we were saying . they took us to start a foot massage and could n't get that we wanted full body . we ended up walking out . if you are looking for a happy ending i 'm sure you could find that here and for sure the places next door . would n't recommend it for anything else sucks we wasted money on the uber ride over from the strip ,	735
0	i went into the store this morning to print my prepaid shipping label and send off my package . the charge was $ 3.27 ! ! ( after it was already printed and affixed ) . i inquired into the charge and was told it was store policy to charge $ 3 for pulling up the email with the label in it and $ 0.25 for the copy . the associate was nice enough about it but this is ridiculous charge for pulling up an email . i will definitely take all printing and shipping business elsewhere . this used to be one of my favorite places as all employees are very kind and helpful .	1853
1	bump it up to 5 : they are consistently wonderful , a place i really look forward to going !	1160
0	the service is terrible . david , the guy in charge is rude and was not very helpful . my car has been here for almost a month , they have been telling me it 's gon na be ready for pick up for the last two weeks . every time i call david says he will have it ready at the end of the day , it 's been like this for literally 2 weeks . i find this ridiculous and would not re commend this auto shop . i just moved here and aamco had left a bad taste in my mouth . the have me back my car not running at all and with a dent .	3150
0	ok , i 'll admit i 'm a bit of a toronto snob , but i really went in here with an open mind to the ways of the big box store ... but this place is just too much for me to handle . stepping into bb & b feels like you just went through a space warp ( or wormhole , for trekkies ) into the farthest reaches of mississauga . it 's humongous , with painfully bright lighting and a generally depressing , soul-crushing ambiance . on the plus side , the staff were very friendly ( when locatable ) . for now , this city boy is sticking with overpriced department stores and hit-or-miss dollar stores for his housewares needs .	2456
1	i went here for the first time about two weeks ago . the beer selection is great , pretty much any beer you can think of is here . i recommend the potus sour power pack .	3199
1	i purchased a groupon for this comedy club never having been here and not knowing what to expect . i was n't too sure at first because it seemed very disorganized and when we got upstairs ( where the club is ) it was much smaller than expected . the comedians were hilarious though , the bartender was really cool-it turned out to be a great date night . i am excited to have this groupon which allows me to go back as much as i want for the next 90 days . i think even without the groupon price i would still come here because of the $ 25 all you can drink and great humor !	2458
0	save yourself . all i wanted was a polish change and the lady who first painted my nails did so horribly . there were bubbles , smudges etc . someone else had to repolish my nails all over again . top it off , they gave themselves a $ 5 tip i did not authorize on my credit card .	1256
0	i want to like this place . but the service is just too bad . wish they take a little bit more pride in the place because it 's just right down the street from my house on main street . the food is hit or miss , usually hits , but not worth the risk with nunthaporn and sweet cakes across the street where both are always a hit ! !	882
1	i am visiting from northern california and want to say how terrific ms. alex is . she gave me a wonderful cut , listened to all my idiosyncrasies about my hair , and was so cheerful and sweet the whole time . love my haircut ! thanks alex .	2169
1	tons of draft beers leaning towards american microbrews . good deep fried mushrooms . dani at the bar is very friendly & efficient . good stop .	211
0	the cakes are delicious but the past two times i 've been there they help customers that walk in after me before they take my order ... . frustrating ! causing wait times around 40 minutes . great cakes but better customer service is needed .	18
1	thanks for jim for delivering donuts to my son 's apartment for his birthday ! we could not make it from california so we started his day off by sending donuts to him and his roommates . thank you !	3137
1	no frills , quick and easy place . came here to get my watch battery replaced . got there 5 mins after they opened . walked in asking for a battery replacement and handed the guy at the counter my watch . the entire process took less than 5 mins . they even set my watch to the correct time ( bonus points ) . the customer service is basic but for a battery replacement , it was good enough for me . total cost after tax was around $ 10.75 , which i thought was a fair price . i will be back next time my watch stops ticking .	2307
0	worst company ever ! ! ! horrible customer service . i saw that this company is pretty good reviews on thie site ( on yelp ) and a great bbb rating so i decided to give it a try . my cousin is celebrating his 30th birthday in vegas in october i wanted to make it special . so i submitted a request online called and emailed . no reponse . what kind of company is this if you 're business is customer service ? never use this company if you are expecting a call back ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1616
1	when in robinson i always stop at this location . for a multitude of reasons . 1 . gas : one of the few places in the area that carry the e85 fuel . cheaper than the regular blend and better if you have the appropriate vehicle . 2 . mto : who can pass up touching that screen and imagining the amazing food about to hit your lips . 3 . convenience : if you are either on your way into or out of the shopping mecca that is robinson , it 's easy to get what you need and get out . 4 . it 's sheetz : enough said .	2273
0	i had 3 bags worth of clothes and they checked all of it in 4 minutes ? what the heck ? not coming here again	1446
1	located in the palms casino . ok it 's a movie theater . it was clean , some of the chairs were a little wobbly . the staff was friendly . the prices outrageous , but that 's par for the course at any theater these days . so if you need a respite from the hustle and bustle of the casino , stop in ant check out a movie ! live it up you are in las vegas for cryin ' out loud !	491
0	i would n't recommend this company . takes too long to handle claims . it 's going to be 3 weeks to get our dish washer fixed . they have too many accounts at this point . will be switching home warranty companies shortly .	3653
0	i definitely wanted this place to be better than it was . the japanese tapas items were n't bad , but everything was pretty lacklustre , over all . i had the gyoza dumplings , which were decent , and the spicy chicken on rice , which was a big disappointment in terms of spice and flavouring . as far as the decor , the rear of the restaurant is lovely and a nice place to sit if you 're in a group , but up-front it 's all leftover diner pieces .	1582
1	first time ordering tonight , everything was great ! veggie torta , veggie tamal , chicken fajitas and elote , we love it all , a lot of flavor and very tasty ! will be coming back again !	1421
1	came here just yesterday on a whim , got a table right away , it was quite empty so i thought it was n't going to be too good ( good places are usually packed ) .was i wrong ! the food is reasonably priced , absolutely delicious and filling and the service was outstanding ! the manager here is absolutely charismatic , attentive and just flat out wonderful . great experience and will definitely return ! !	1319
0	this place is completely hit and miss , which can be very frustrating . the first time i went i got a nice chicken dish with interesting sides ( beets and wild rice ) and enjoyed it very much . second time i got an overcooked flank steak ( grey all the way through ) and a fellow dinner got an undercooked salmon fillet ( raw all the way through ) . combined with the generally grumpy service , this is n't a great option especially considering the excellent restaurants up and down harbord .	1271
1	i went for my first spa treatments there just over a week ago and am very pleased . the package i chose had a number of services and was a very good value for the price charged . the professionals who did each of my services were amazing and i already have an appointment to return . great job everyone !	3880
0	you gon na wait for your food forever . also the portions are small and very overpriced . there 's nothing special about their food . i had half chicken and it was more like an 8th of chicken , not half ...	1331
1	the newest starbucks in the jolly old town of markham is the best . huge space to hang out , excellent , friendly staff , same delicious coffee and food of course but this is one of the very few locations to have the clover press which gives you an individually brewed cup of premium blends offered . the space has a lot of natural light with big windows along one side . parking can be tricky with la fitness in the same plaza . big patio area for frappuccino season . i 'll be coming here a lot !	2438
0	if i could give negative stars i would . this hotel is the worst ! ! ! the rooms are dirty and the smell of mold is throughout the entire room . when i went to complain the jack ass at the front desk ( john ) informed me he was the assistant manager which in fact he is n't . he told me i needed to call orbitz who i booked with .	1888
0	rude service . the bartender ignored us . we love noel and `` dog '' ... but every time we go in when this bartender is in he 's always a douchebag and ignores us . he 's too busy playing golden tee with his buddies .	1295
1	this is my new favourite dessert spot ! i absolutely love their mango bingsu . i love that they use shaved milk versus shaved ice . every time i come here i usually split one with my husband . then one day we decided to get our own , and it was the only time we got super sour mangoes ... totally ruined it for us ... but i guess the mangoes they had that week were n't ripe . i can only go when they first open . if i try to come in the evening , it is way too packed . the decor is absolutely beautiful and the cashiers have always been friendly .	1182
0	ordered their `` signature '' noodle and meat dish . the chicken and pea-size bits of pork were over-cooked and very dry . the noodles were under-cooked and tasted rubbery . when i called the restaurant to complain , they were very rude and hung up on me . stay away from this place . there are lots of other fine chinese restaurants in the area .	474
0	customer service was horrible . i spent an hour looking for what i needed without being asked if i needed help once . they were n't busy so i 'm not sure what the problem was , looked like a lot of talking between employees every time i wanted t ask for help . then while checking out the lady never said anything nice to me , no hi , just asked if i wanted to signup for there reward program thing . no thank you or anything . not a good experience at all . sucks because they have things i need and it 's close to me .	2716
1	i love lotus spa and nails ! ! whenever i come , not only do i just walk-in , but everyone is very welcoming and always smiling . i love the background music that plays , it 's relaxing and soothing . the options to pick out your lotion for a manicure are awesome . i enjoy all of the services they offer , i 've had wax , mani and pedis done here . if you ever need a quick service , feel free to visit lotus . i promise you will be pleased !	1263
1	the regular rolls were phenomenal ! the super friendly woman behind the counter reported they were nothing special , but they were light and deliciously chewy while being sweet and savory . delectable fruit and goguma cakes ! this is a lovely place to pass the time !	1108
1	zen foot spa so far is my favorite place to come and get a massage to relax . their massages are the best . you get a massage from head to toes . is amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! you do n't even want to leave after your massage ! ! ! great service !	735
1	if you are looking for a true authentic birria this is the place . the birria de chivo ( goat ) was delicious . made me think of our family mexican vacations .	210
0	a sign advertising low calories and/or carbohydrates ? ... pizza display behind glass ... pick a slice for oven reheating ... paying roughly $ five per slice ... reheated and ready ... quite thin the crust and breading ... thin layer of cheese hardened on ... tasting bland ... sparse sprinkling of toppings for a large slice of pie ... make a pizza thin as possible with little topping as possible , but explain it 's low calories and low carbs ... umm..no..	1371
1	definitely my favorite traditional chinese food restaurant . every time my family comes from out of town , we eat here because the quality of their food is sooo good ; a bonus -- their prices are slightly lower compared to other chinese restaurants in lv . they only have 2-3 people working per shift , so service might be a bit slow if there are a multiple groups eating at the same time ( it 's completely understandable though ) . so in conclusion , good service , reasonable pricing , and amazing food . ca n't wait to come here again !	294
1	this is a great walgreen 's . it 's open 24 hours , has a very helpful pharmacist , photo center , and the staff is very pleasant . i live just down the street from this walgreen 's and even though i do n't go there often , every time i do it 's a pleasant experience . one of the things i like best is that if the cashier gets a little busy they immediately call for assistance and open another cash register . there is nothing worse than standing in a long line with only one check stand open . thank you for providing good customer service .	1733
0	both 7 and 8 have broken or missing locks and 7 has an entire corner missing plexiglass in the top of the bed . not worth the price if it 's not maintained . and yes these things have been mentioned to the staff numerous times .	1485
0	we took a sushi class . the experience was great but we were disappointed by the low cost ingredients . for $ 55 per person we were hoping for a bit more high quality items and more seafood . they were very skimpy on the ingredients . the owner was not very friendly and we also were given a hard time about rescheduling our class .	2612
0	the drive thru takes over 15 minutes to go through for some reason . no excuse for this to happen every time .	1199
1	i 'll be honest we initially wanted to go to ohso and ended up here due to the wait . this place had a small wait as well but we were lucky enough to luck out on four spots at the bar - and it was great ! the decor is amazing . the blue leather chairs are an incredible design touch . indoor/outdoor feel with open windows and desert plant accents made for a wonderful esthetic . on to the important parts . our bartender , wyatt , went out of his way to make our experience excellent ! he was above and beyond with customer service ! and the food was incredible . get the biscuits and gravy !	1331
1	a really nice wash that 's very clean and consistent . free vacuums and compressed air for finishing off your wash . i 'll continue to come here .	2044
1	i just signed up for service this morning based on the reviews that everyone put out there , so first i thank everyone for their input . i was a little hesitant when i did not see any pricing , but it really only took about 5 min to make a phone call and learn all i needed to know . i have been in contact with them twice this morning and had the pleasure of speaking with alina - she is a sweetheart . i am excited about starting new service with them and saying so long to cox and all of their garbage . no throttling , no maximum usage or over limit charges is going to be sweet .	3459
0	it 's not customary to walk in to your hotel room to find black hairs filling the tub and an empty tube of shampoo next to the sink . this is definitely one of the worst casinos i have stayed at in vegas , but hey , at least the beds were comfy .	3630
0	the worst service . since this place is the only chinese takeout in the area we gave this place two try 's in hopes that perhaps the first time was an isolated incident . however each time was we went the service and food were consistent . consistently awful . the manager is extremely rude . he literally threw my credit card back at me after i submitted it for payment . the food is really awful . i would rather go downtown or to any takeout place other than this place if i wanted chinese . do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs .	1490
1	they are great ! super fast ! polite - professional ! could not ask for better & easier loan ! in addition , nicole rocks ! ! so funny ! ! it 's a pleasure to watch that girl juggle !	3404
1	these folks care about my classic dodge . the service work completed was professionally done , at a fair price . they appear to pride themselves on good communications , with a smile . i would not hesitate to use blackwell in the future .	2084
1	such a perfect friday night activity ! they have 4 different rooms , which i 've now done 3 of . all have great themes and have great puzzles . mandy , phill and paige are all amazing game masters . would 10/10 recommend . the casino room is good for all ages and would not recommend the collector for young children but would for those looking for an extra thrill .	3701
1	they always greet everyone with a smile who enters even when super busy . they have excellent customer service and i never had any problems coming to this store . i highly recommend them and go see mitch who will go above and beyond .	3027
1	this place still makes it 's bills . still here to stay ... so far i ca n't complain about the place not being clean . but i do hate the prices for food . the theater does have good sized rooms and the screen i normally see is pretty big . not much to say on behalf of this theater but nothing worth complaining about . good place for not waiting in line too long	2450
0	terrible experience . told the dude to cut my hair one way and he cut it completely different . the whole time he was cutting my hair he was on the phone and he constantly complained my `` hair was hard to cut '' . even the other barbers in there were looking at cell phones while cutting other peoples hair . completely unprofessional staff . i 'll never go there again and would never recommend to a friend .	761
0	there was a scorpion in my bathroom , i 'm completely traumatized by it . also , my room was n't cleaned . the gm has accommodated me to some point , but did n't appreciate him trying to tell me scorpions are not dangerous . it can kill you and to me that 's dangerous . i 've never had a scorpion visit me in vegas . scary !	2872
0	bad massage . poor communication . rushed massage . bad employees . worst of all : they expect a minimum tip amount . i told them i was paying 20 % , and they told me that i needed to pay them more . they expected a minimum of 30 % . they argued that they deserved 30 % , and they got angrier and angrier when i told them to include a tip of 20 % and no more . they kept shouting at me that they wanted more tip . and then they said it was a required tip minimum . required ? ? are they crazy ? ? ! disgusting . do n't go to this place . it sucks .	463
0	went into the store and asked for a lift kit on a 97 pathfinder and they seemed not to want to help me .	2632
1	so i 'm going to update my previous post now that i 'm back here . i missed it . people do n't bother you and people are smiling seems like since i 've been gone they 've worked hard upgrading . love golds gym	465
1	first off how could you not like this show ! i have seen the show at the mandalay bay in vegas and in san francisco . the vegas cast is unbelievable ! i went to the finale show on jan 4th and again was n't disappointed . i think mandalay bay made the biggest mistake by ending the show . the lion king in vegas what are they thinking ! hopefully another hotel brings this incredible show back !	2752
0	i do n't get the hype . it did n't taste right . never going back	1461
0	went to this taco bell around 10:50pm and there was two teenagers running the drive thru . the girl did not seem like she was an employee as she was wearing regular clothes and her hair was down and she kept flirting with the male employee . this is a health code violation . i will be reporting this to the health district and to taco bell .	859
1	so incredibly happy to have found this doctor ! i have had such an amazing experience here from day one ! the fact that the administrative girls know my name ? impressive . delivered my first baby with dr. deka and i am just so grateful for her ! we could not have had a better experience . though i did have some issues ( preeclampsia and the baby heart de accelerations ) i felt completely confident with her and the entire staff . they truly care about their patients and it is so evident ! i hope and pray i can continue to go here for years to come !	1589
1	ate out there with a group of friends , the soup here is good . this was my first introduction to a vietnamese resturant in ohio .	784
1	this store rocks . the people are friendly and do n't judge my lack of knowledge of video games . erica is a rock star and even went out of her way to hunt down something i was looking for.. love this store .	426
0	they do a good job with the manicures & pedicures however , nancy had a bad attitude and became so rude when she could n't upsell my service . this happened to me twice already . i 'm definitely avoiding her next time !	2297
1	i only get my haircut with my usual barber and he recently retired and so i had to find a new place , so i gave torri g salon a shot . saw the ad for $ 7 haircut , so i did n't expect much but i was surprised and will differently go back . i was happy because the gal that cut my hair actually listened to how i wanted my haircut and executed it perfectly .	441
1	the brass rail is what a dive bar should be . slightly uncomfortable with bad furnishings , decent beer , and a great place to hang . every time i 've come i 've enjoyed it . there 's even an electronic darts game for when you 're tired of squeezing into a tiny booth , watching bad tv or wondering why they sell so many portable bottles of alcohol from the counter . i love you brass rail , you are divetastic , and you make me happy .	1476
1	i have been with usaa since 2001 and i love them . i have never had s bad experience with them . they have always been great service and i love the app as well ! would n't change banks i have had bad experiences with other banks !	1727
1	my husband and i usually take our kids out to texas roadhouse when we want steak we love the butter cinnamon rolls and their salad . i like that they have the waitresses dance to country songs it goes with the environment	560
1	just ate at origin india on paradise rd . the food was fresh and not greasy . the staff was very friendly and it was very homey inside . we has the lunch buffet and being vegetarian and gluten free , there was plenty to eat . highly recommend it if you want a nice , friendly indian restaurant .	600
0	my wife liked place in the beginning but our last visit went bad . she picked our two dogs and the counter girl said there was a problem . the girl said one of our dogs was not playing nice . we tried to get more info about this and got no where . the owner will not respond to wife . this place is a over priced joke !	3100
1	7am monday morning on a business trip and ca n't stop coughing . the hotel gave me a list of places and this was the closest . great choice for me . i was a walk-in but got there before the morning rush . waited about 20 minutes . filled out paperwork and they got me right in . fortunately it 's just allergies and a mild virus . got a prescription and i 'm on my way . and the cabbie who took me , gave me his number and came back to get me when i was done . so nice . on to the rest of my trip .	2517
0	i went to this place for the very first and last time on monday , march 6 , 2017 for lunch . 1 ) this place is way over priced 2 ) my tuna melt was soggy , tasted weird and even smelled weird as if it was not made correctly . i timed from the time i placed my order and received my order - come on 4 1/2 mins . really ! ! ! almost $ 9.00 for lunch . i will never , ever be back . as i stated it was my first and last time here .	799
0	from cali and desperately needed a cut so i came came to get a `` fresh cut '' and dude named ivan fucked my shit up smh . i was specific how i wanted my cut but he did n't seem to be focus at all .	3469
0	this place gave us a quote on the phone and jacked up everything by over 200 bucks . a bunch of thiefs . do not go here .	2210
1	located in upscale south park , beautiful neighborhood . i love to come to regal cinema because it 's just a mile away from my home and the crowd is really good .. if you are in south park then regal cinema a must go .	3680
1	this little chocolate shop , although pricy , sells pretty great chocolates . we purchased a few of the 9 pc assortment to get an overview of flavours and found there . the experimental flavours were great ! and the chocolates look beautiful overall . they are composed of a hard with flavorful filling . good as a fancy chocolate gift	2230
1	the best beef broth i 've had in vegas . ordered their king size pho with beef , tendon , and brisket , and it did not disappoint ! love it !	673
1	kim , shelley and the entire was team are great ! ! ! from the minute i walked in to just get ideas , to ordering invitations , purchasing accessories and our tux rentals , everything was perfect ! even when we ran into slight snags with the tux sizes , they were quick to accommodate us and get the right size within a 24 hr turnaround . thank you was for making my wedding planning experience so pleasant and fun ! no bridezilla moments here !	1298
0	the worse place to rent from if you put a deposit on a property please do n't expect to get it back they will make up things & charge ridiculously expensive prices for small things to charge up your bill ... pathetic ! sonia is rude & advised me to go to court if i want to . also received a 24 day notice ( not 30 ) to vacate via email because they think the owner want to sale the home now ! ! !	1578
0	if the other chicken is anything like the tenders , then you 're pretty much getting breaded meat without seasoning . mac n cheese is n't anything special either .	862
0	$ 6+ for a regular size bubble with tapioca ? what a rip-off . the one redeeming quality about the milk tea was that you could actually taste the tea . however , their tapioca pearls were a little overlooked . they also would n't allow me to substitute the red bean in their green tea latte drink with tapioca pearl , what gives ? ? given most people come here for desserts like shaved ice , i would skip on the bubble tea and head to one of the plethora of bubble tea shops in markham to satisfy your craving .	176
1	went in for an oil change . the staff was very professional . they gave me a full run down on the condition of my car . while i waited they had fresh coffee and donuts . i bought a few filters and two tires . no nonsense auto shop . i would definitely recommend these guys .	2146
0	excited to have them in the neighbourhood.. but i doubt it will be a place i will frequent . it 's laid out nice , and super high tech refrigerated cabinets . when i checked out , the cashier messed up my transaction . she swore and said sh ! t ! @ $ & * ) ( # $ . ummm ... not too professional . i should have informed someone , as i was with my 2 year old son .	3271
0	update to my prior review : i have a groupon to receive a pedicure and they refused to accept it because i 've been there before . that 's beyond ridiculous . seems as if they are more interested in acquiring new customers and do n't care about retaining business from current customers - seems backwards to me . either way , they have officially lost me as a customer and i will not recommend them as a place to go .	744
0	if you 're experienced in buying homes then this is the company for you . if not , stay far away . minimal communication and empathy towards their customers . the only time they communicate is when they need info from you , otherwise good luck with knowing the status of your loan or any information that you may need .	968
1	pediatrics is realy good fast and doctor hernandez is awesome did my son x-ray and check up all in the same place	2503
0	ehh . i can see why this place has a low rating . the servers seemed depressed and so did the food . the mixed drinks were awful . we had the oysters and were asked if we wanted west coast or east coast . not too descriptive , but went with it . we ordered west coast and they did not taste like any west coast oysters i have ever had . wo n't be a next time for this place . so many places to try ! ! !	630
0	they get 2 stars for actually delivering the flowers . looks nothing like what i ordered lol .	3792
1	now that they 've been open for a while and i 've been back many more times , it 's time to update this review . newcomers in the pittsburgh ramen scene make zen not as great as it used to seem in comparison . now , zen 's ramen noodles are good , but what really stands out is their chicken katsu curry . the curry sauce is thick and spicy , and the chicken is tender and crisp .	812
0	i 'm a hudson resident . this place is never open . also , way over priced . great marketing skills to sell duncan hines cupcakes with `` gourmet '' frosting .	2335
0	this place does mediocre nails but their scheduling is horrible ! ! this is my second time having them mess everything up with scheduling and it 's the worst because you need an appointment to get in . when you make an appointment and come in on time , they do n't greet you at the door and still make you wait . i made an online appointment earlier today with the normal girl i like and then they randomly sent me an email saying that someone else would be doing my nails ! no call or anything . and since it 's so hard to get in , now i have to wait one more day .	1429
0	i do n't recommend this place at all ! this is her oldest daughter writing this review . they suck honestly . they did mine , my sisters , and friends nails for a mani/pedi and the lady that did my nails was rushing , i could tell . they left streak marks on all our nails . i have to say they did good for our pedicures but not manicures..	527
1	great small venue ! ( barely fit my 120 guests but everyone loved it ! ) had my wedding 1/7 and it went very smoothly ! family run business so they work well together and are very laid back . low stress and easy wedding ! offer totally inclusive through venue only , we did a mix of the two and it went perfectly . they set up and clean up ! most other venues do n't so that was a huge stress off us .	238
1	cindy is the best technician there ! ! her manicures are out of this world and my husband had a pedicure today and was so impressed . she is always on time . she is very conscientious , takes pride in the work and is very modest . she dose my manicures , pedicures and waxes my eyebrows . i will never go anywhere else as long as she is there . i 'm scheduling a pedicure for my son this week . thanks cindy for your great service ! !	2372
1	the best value for your dollar . free vacuums and a great monthly program . if they had 2 people to apply the prewash i would give them a 5 star .	2093
0	wanted to follow up on the response received . yes , i understand you are full-service , which `` also includes helping with the aftercare and follow-up on surgical procedures '' . i obviously did n't make clear why i was upset about the bill . the office visit was for a checkup on how i was healing and she barely glanced at it . the most time spent at that appointment was to sell me on follow-up procedures .	2430
0	was n't feeling it here ... energy was low , the layout of awful , parking was terrible ! did n't have basic machine set up ex cables , lat pull downs and cables cross overs ! plus unorganized dumbbells ! ! smh	2338
1	working in a medical office , its sometimes difficult to find that perfect outfit to wear everyday . just kidding . this store is great ! scrubs , shoes , stethescopes , you name it , they got it . i love how the staff is super friendly and i can be in and out in 15 min or less ! the 10 % off is awesome too , just do n't forget your student badge or hospital badge .	1920
1	they have treated me great ! ! especially alex ! i bought bamboo , then changed my mind because of customer ratings , i have 3 dogs & teenage boys . maybe wood in my retirement tiny house ! ! i then purchased 2 boxes of wood tile to try out the colors and brought one back even . finally decided on the pecan walnut ! alex was so patient explaining all too me , always with his million dollar smile !	2763
0	nooooo ) : i came here last night and i am 80 % disappointed . the bubbletea is very average ( as usual ) but i guess i expected a higher quality since so many new places have opened up around them ( i recommend coco 's across the street ) . however , it seems they have not upped their game and does not care about being competitive . they 're actually really slow with their drinks as i die of thirst . i got their shaved ice and it was 1151616500 % bland . if i closed my eyes it would be like eating snow outside as a child . no thanks ) :	176
1	good place for decent sushi . the hot food is also pretty decent and they have some odd things that you do n't always see in a buffet ( frog legs and octopus ) . it was nice to try those things . it is expensive , but i have always had good service , never had to wait , and it is a nice clean place .	165
0	this was hands down the worst mani/pedi i have ever had . 2.5 hours - did not know what she was doing . my feet were left rough , my hands were dry , she did not do my cuticles properly , she did not know how to apply gel polish so she put layer after layer - they are dull and ugly . nails are not even and were not shaped properly . absolutely horrible . stay away ! ! ! !	3649
0	eh 16 dollars for an eyebrow wax ? ! no thank you ! too high tech ! i will stick to my koreans who are cheaper and do better jobs of services ! ! !	3338
1	i would say a better panera bread . good lemonade , and soup and salad . pricey for sure .	1387
1	i have gone to dr. berelowitz since i was 12 years old ( i am now 28 ! ) . he did move away for a few years , but i was so happy when he came back to town . he cares about his patients and is very thorough . i know the wait-list is long for him , but that jsut shows how amazing he is . i have had a few endocrinologists since i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 26 years ago , and he is by far the best endo and doctor i have ever had .	2143
0	i came by this evening for eyebrow threading ; the threading session took about 3 minutes for a basic clean up . verdict : mediocre job and service .	2630
1	great customer services . they have the best wings ever . amazing customer service . everyone is so nice as soon as you walk in . i will be back soon . you wo n't be disappointed .	1397
0	black mold ! ! do not do any business with this company ! i purchased a hutch for my daughter and i had mold on it ! was told i would have a new on in 2 weeks it has been a month and still waiting ! the customer service is non existent they do not fallow thru and say im sorry for this as they blow rainbows and unicorn farts at you ! do not buy from this company ! ! ! !	2071
1	what an outstanding service experience ! last minute emergency and a quick call turned into an instant appointment , first class door service , a loaner and text updates . truly exceptional experience and ideal to do business in 2016 . this store moves at the speed of business ! ask for sean c , he 's the man .	2012
1	we recently bought a house and purchased a washer , dryer , and mattress from spencer 's . we have not had the best of luck with customer service from other companies , but spencer 's has refreshed our belief that customer service is still alive out there . thank you !	3784
1	great family fun entertainment . went here with my brother a few times over a year ago forgot how much fun it was ! there is a special every day super busy location and friendly staff .	2235
0	bought my mom a cake here . walked a mile to pick it up and they would n't give my 6 year old daughter a cup of water . for that crappy of service i do n't even want to try their crappy cake .	18
0	wtf ... shell gas pumps on the system for pre-authorization on credit cards i was putting some gas in my car it was a rental they had to return it exactly with half a tank i put $ 5 then realized i need a little bit more then i put two more dollars now i have two $ 90 on hold on my credit card luckily i have enough credit line on the credit card but it 's just the principle i realized our location start using shell gasoline not too long ago hopefully they can fix that s*** or tell the customers was going on ... .. btw this review only reflect the outside pumps by shell	3057
0	wait time in office is ridiculously long . when you call , you 're placed on hold for 10-15 minutes then hung up on . when you call for refills , they `` put in the message '' to the doctor , but it 's never followed up on . when you request refills through your pharmacy , the fax received at the dr 's office goes unacknowledged because their `` assistants are too busy '' . their own words , not mine .	2967
0	stay away from this place . the clientele is not that of which you would like to frequent . they have convicted sex offenders on the run one of which forced himself onto my girlfriend and raped her on side of building and in bathroom ... .on special that they allow to sell drugs from inside there and smoke some weed out on patio . what a disgrace	977
0	very cheap everybody comes here because it was the imperial palace beforehand and it 's the best location for everything but not great rooms in horrible service and i lived in las vegas . there is 1 foreign maid that is nice . find her for your help on cleaning . i stayed here till i left to move to seattle .	2976
1	yay , it finally opened ! i stopped in here today to grab some coffee and donuts , and they were both tasty . i love dunkin donuts , and am glad that they have this location finally open , and its close to my place . great hours , free wifi , and tasty treats anda drinks for all . i believe they have a drive thru here too ! will be back in the future for more coffee , muffins and donuts !	606
0	this place is ridiculous . you know how you press the button to get formula . we press it so many times and asked few employees but nobody is coming . we waited like 15 minutes just to see the person who is supposed to open it and bring in the counter . just the system is so bad .	3066
1	our car sales guy , ryan , is 100 % the best car sales man i have ever met . i usually hate dealing with sales men to be honest , but this has been the most pleasant experience ! he treated me like an actual human being and not like a dollar sign walking through the door ! thank you ryan ! ! ! ! ! kia sands , hold on to him as long as you can !	624
1	this place is a nice little casino with plenty of slots , sportsbook , bowling , and restaurant . the staff is friendly and is always very clean .	3581
0	seems like a big local hangout on weekdays . bartender seemed put out by serving a late night patron even though she had a dozen friends in the place . small bar and $ 6.50 pint . meh . downtown prices .	1037
0	i have to say that we were not impressed . my husband 's dish ( which was supposed to be vegetarian , came with chicken ) was flavorless . vegetables were all right , fairly fresh . i ordered the lemon chicken and it was over-cooked ( so it was that stringy but tough fried chicken ) and the broccoli seemed like it fell off of the truck and then was over-cooked . the lo mein was all right as a side dish . sorry - but we wo n't be going back to this place .	474
1	higher ground is arguably calgary 's best coffee shop . this place has a unique spirit that is hard to create . good for working , studying or meeting with a friend . packed with students and university types . hip . not boring . extensive menu with a few interesting and unexpected options . can be busy and parking is not easy to find .	2163
0	they have a terrible website ! you can not book a ride . there is no app ! wth ! ! ! i think they are out of business .	1232
1	food is 5 star best mexican in the city short rib tacos are so good u wud contemplate smacking a nun for a second visit lol one of the premier stops in toronto for mexican food hands down also very fairly priced	1305
1	was looking for these cute iced cookies for my engagement party and came across this bakery ! i am beyond happy ! came out way above my expectations ! ! i even tried one before wrapping them up and the cookies taste like heaven ! ( p.s- they offer to wrap them for you for an extra charge ... it 's cheaper if you just go to michael 's and do it yourself )	981
0	worst place i have ever dealt with . came in car shopping because i wanted a nissan rogue asked the salesman if there was any negotiation room on the price and the response i got was `` what is my car not worth that ? '' my husband wanted to trade his truck in and they came back first saying they would n't give anything for his trade which is insane then they came back and said 500 which is insulting i could sell the vehicle my self for more then that ! if this is how buying a car is here i 'd hate to see how their service is !	2756
0	school is fine . just be ready for an hour minimum wait if dealing with financial aid . worst ever .	2787
1	the only reason this gets a 4 star is because of breakfast . sleeping accommodations were great . the bathroom/shower was fantastic . comfort inn breakfast has really gone down hill not only at this location but others that i have stayed at as well . improve breakfast and you get a 5 star from me every time .	3387
1	seriously the best massage ! james is great ! definitely recommend this place . especially after a night of drinking in vegas lol	3079
1	dan came out and gave us a quote and we scheduled an appointment which we needed to reschedule . everything was done easily . we rescheduled and dan and his team did a great job removing a vintage spa which had to be cut and carried out through the condo and then they did a great job of cleaning up the leftover mess.very much appreciated the professionalism and service . thanks dan !	3663
0	meh . stopped in for a quick lunch . decent food ( really good tortillas , actually ) , and decent overpriced margaritas . the star rating is more reflective of the painfully slow service . the server seemed a bit lost ; maybe she was new ? she did n't seem to think that a pen was necessary when bringing back my receipt to sign , and was nowhere to be found after dropping off the check ... thankfully the lady at the next table had one . one and done .	882
0	bait and switch ripoff . wo n't honor their estimates . go elsewhere . took my car there to fix the dent they gave me 1200 estimate . when i left the call me back saying that it will be 500 more because they did n't see something . bad place to go i would n't recommend it to anybody .	1819
1	this place has an awesome venue and friendly staff , a must go to for any concert ! my favorite venue in az , nothing but good things to say about this place .	17
0	not a well built hotel . that is the main problem . lots of sound from above room . staff tried to help but they did n't build the structure . the room air conditioner blasts and turns half the room into a meat locket while the other half gets relatively comfortable . or , when off the room is stuffy and uncomfortable . cordless phone did not work . not charged ? lobby is cramped and uninviting . food is not much better than at a holiday inn express . and needless to say this is more expensive and they charge for breakfast . not impressed by this line of properties based on this experience .	3522
1	using iphone app siri , when we pulled up the restaurant , it showed 5 stars , one review . when i went to review myself , all if the sudden , 3 reviews , 3 stars . seems pretty good though . very pleased with jalapeño poppers . the amigo2 was slot spicier than the poppers . not bad , just not expected . sweet endings was also pretty & pretty tastey . : )	408
0	i 'm sad to say i had a bad experience here . my kitten ended up with a nasty infection and an abscess on her abdomen . her incision was fully sealed , so an open wound was n't the problem . she has now been through another surgery and will have a drain for a few days .	2864
1	it was a 30 minute wait to get in but we did go on a saturday so that is understandable . we went as a big group and we were taken care of quickly . we all got the correct food that we ordered ( even with special instructions ) . the server was very nice and friendly . we did not have to ask for any refills . i ordered the mushroom swiss burger with fries and it was delicious ! the burger was nice and moist and the fries were some of the best i 've ever had . the restaurant was clean and even though it was very busy , it still had a great atmosphere to it . will definitely go again !	534
0	the flowers are nice but expect rude customer service . the guy who always answers the phone is incredibly snotty . you ca n't kill this guy with kindness , as i 've tried . i doubt he 's the owner , because it would be a horrible idea to represent your company so poorly . i 've always ordered flowers from here , but i 'm just going to find another florist . it 's not worth the trouble anymore -- i hate calling this guy . if you 're the owner reading this -- please talk to your rude employee or replace him with someone who is decent towards customers . decent is all i ask for .	2585
1	best pizza i 've ever had . everything on the menu is great -- i just wish it was easier to choose . the only downfall is price . they do n't have the cheap pizza discounts others may have , so when we choose pizza , roman candle loses based on price alone .	218
0	if i could give zero stars i would . i had my bumper repaired here and they did a terrible job ! when i went to request that they fix and or rectify the terrible job that was done since the paint is chipping and pealing , brie tells me that they wo n't fix anything with a terrible attitude . do not have your car fixed here ! ! ! please see pictures below :	2537
0	my gel nails have lasted less than a day before starting to peel off on two fingers , and i have not been picking at them whatsoever .	2197
1	my favorite way to treat myself . the big burrito 's are the best thing ever , and i love their on the house salsa and chips . the atmosphere is always fun . enjoyable visit every time .	1558
1	they give a great treatment of acupressure and massage . i would highly recommend . note they prefer cash .	2158
1	i 'd say this is my favourite grocery store in the area . the produce is always fresh , there 's lots of international foods , and let 's face it - you could probably spend an entire afternoon shopping here . you can rack up a pretty large bill , though if you are n't shopping for what 's on sale and are tempted by a lot of the pre-packaged convenience foods they offer . there are a lot of awesome things along these lines , but when you realize just how much you are paying for pre-crushed oreos as a sundae topping ( pc brand i am talking to you ) it is kind of ridiculous .	1665
0	so many great reviews yet we went for mother 's day and my food was horrible . we started out with mob onion rings . quantity was awesome but the actual onion batter tasteless . i got the talipia with lump crab and was nothing special . i did get the loaded bake potato and that was the best part of the meal . i also ordered a side of crab cake that was plated on some kind of crema . yuk ... . overall.. not impressed at all .	1147
0	this place makes you blow dry your own hair after a hair colour . they also will botch your haircolour . staff is more interested in chatting with each other and just leave clients in their chairs with wet hair .	1813
0	vegas is not really vegan friendly , so i was happy to read this place had vegan cheese option . unfortunately they `` were out '' . i opted for a margherita , no cheese with broccolini and roasted peppers . the dough and sauce were tasteless , the broccolini were boiled , with no oil or spices . `` best neapolitan pizza in us '' ? do n't think so ! if you want vegan , try the indian place down the street !	282
1	these donuts are fabulous ! they are a little pricey but i promise even the biggest appetite ca n't eat many of these- they are more of a treat than a breakfast item . they are huge and incredibly sweet ! we like to pick a few and cut them up and share . i recommend the jesus the blueberry but we have had quite a few different flavors with no complaints . again , we like to divvy them up into bite sized pieces to try more than one . would recommend this place to anyone who shares an unhealthy love for this deep fried deliciousness .	2053
1	needs better food in this place tho we skipped dinner and they do n't have anything in here downstairs is closed	3728
0	went and looked on the internet for the best tuna melt sandwich , and they said lenny 's burger shop . boy oh boy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! that tuna melt sandwich was the worst sandwich i have ever had . i should sue google ! ! ! ! ! subway is 10 times better . i will never go there again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1461
1	this wallgreens is a perfect neighborhood drug store . the staff are always helpful and really friendly . they are very speedy when filling prescriptions and they are easy to approach about questions about you r prescription ! they carry everything from health items to snacks and holiday stuff !	1207
0	i buy these bagels for my employees a lot and this location is convenient for me to go to . if i had another option i would , the customer service is terrible . i have not had one good experience here .	477
0	lukewarm soup , small portion of pasta with no flavour . not impressed at all , many more great italian restaurants in woodbridge . very disappointed .	1386
0	walked store 8 minutes with no greeting , associate all hanging out talking . dirty with a bargain hut style environment . some quality items but they buy items and penny prices .	3494
1	ol bandito was dirty ! first time ever using a mobile groomer and was lucky enough to get katie out the same day ! bandit has never looked better and we did n't have to wrestle with him to get him the car . worth every penny . call katie and she will take care of your loved one .	1218
0	beware ! the staff is not very friendly once you sign your lease , and forget about getting anything fixed . i am not talking about just a mninor thing like a window treatment ( that took 9 weeks to fix ) but the larger items such as leaks they just ignore and do not correct . trust me i am a current tenant and they refuse to fix my apartment that floods everytime it rains !	3852
0	i bought bean sprouts from here . first off , they have these in the back and the owners themselves select and bag them to order . i came home and the entire bag was heavy and soaked in mildew . the bean sprouts were bad . they charge by the weight . im disgusted that they sold me bad bean sprouts and charge me more bc bad bean sprouts weigh heavier . health department please visit this location asap !	2965
1	excellent service ! tri and lou were very friendly , even suggested an alternate color and where to go for the best deals on shows ! just remember to bring cash ; )	2686
0	delicious food , but very poor customer service . each time i go i wait over 25 mins for takeout ( even when they 're not busy ) and whenever i check in on my order it 's always `` oh they dropped the ticket they 'll make it right now '' . manager was very dismissive when i was expressing my repeated concerns , and unfortunately i 'm unwilling to return .	912
0	i was burned from the laser hair removal and it was not pretty . i was told it was not burns , i went to my doctor and was given prescription ointment to treat it . so disappointed especially since i took a $ 2k loan with 35 % interest rate for this treatment .	582
1	this is , without a doubt , the best chiropractic experience you can get ... dr. watson did a comprehensive examination , like doctors used to do in the 'good old ' days . warm and personal , yet always professional , she thoroughly explained everything as she went ... as others have noted , she deserves way more than 5 stars ... the treatment itself was phenomenal , top-of-the-line . i actually felt guilty about paying so little for such a tremendous and professional chiropractic experience . i signed up for the monthly plan ... $ 49 a month for four visits a month ! ( that 's like $ 12.25 a visit ) can not recommend it high enough ...	2011
0	i used to love target until target optical came along . their in-house optometrist is a rip-off and only gives you a year for a prescription . since i do not have insurance , this expense is way too high . in my 30 years or so , never has an eye doctor been so strict ( i was three days over my script date ) and determined to not help a disabled person .	583
1	good sales . never any issues . 2 min from our house makes it convenient . we usually stop in for a quick browse and end up leaving with something . they always have really good quality of sales in the middle which we take advantage of each time .	2687
0	the foot spa gave us bad service so the owner chen wrote to us inviting us to this place . no engrish spoken here . upscale from `` foot massage '' for $ 20 to body for $ 30 . same thing as `` foot massage '' . we wanted private rooms and two girls sure sure wait wait ok ok ok but after 10 minutes waiting , , , , no no no the lady waved us away ... . curtains separate the `` rooms '' . i like to pay extra and get privacy without hearing all the people grunting moaning and chattering ... very disappointed	735
0	normally a very good restaurant . stopped by to order food to go . the person at the bar was also taking orders over the phone . when i asked her a question about a combination plate she told me in a rude manner that they did n't make combination plates . the wait for a to go order was 20 minutes . i left and went to a friendlier chinese restaurant two blocks away .	1490
0	customer service non existant . i returned an item and never got a refund as promised . it took almost 2 months and unending emails and calls for them to issue it . they kept saying it `` was on the way '' but it never arrived . i had similar issues to tg who left review here , and i too would never , ever do business with them again . worst experience i have ever had with a department store .	2910
0	i was scheduled for a surgery on july 15 , i was 10 minutes late and the doctor would n't see me . ive had a torn meniscus for a year and then he just says reschedule . terrible	2176
1	also tried the reuben . it was very good ! $ 11 with salad and was made from scratch . delicately grilled and a great sauce !	1035
0	i 've been to this location twice now and i 'm convinced that they are the slowest jersey mikes in the country . i understand that when you 're a new location the employees will be a little slower but this is ridiculous . these guys need some major training . how hard is it to make a sandwich ? for the love of god it should n't take 20 mins to get a damn sub ! that being said i do still like their sandwiches .	1289
1	we came for my friends bachelorette party ! we came in not knowing what to expect and had a great time ! the teacher was fun . at the beginning i thought we were going to be shy and just play with it but the teacher really encourages you to get in to it and you do end up getting some good tips ! lap dance and pole dancing !	3629
0	fish tacos barely had fish , all veggies on cold flout flour tortillas . the chimichurri steak was leather at best w a twice baked potato tasting a little freezer burned . although our server was nice and service was quick , when i said the steak was super chewy ( sirloin ) she said well that 's a cheaper cut of meat ... ..i was like yea , i know but for $ 25 ... ... i buy the same cut at the grocery store and can prepare better than that ! not so much ... .waste of $	951
1	these other reviewers are high maintenance and nuts . this place is great - yes sometimes at peak hours you have to wait . big deal . i have been going here for a while and always get great service and fantastic mani pedis . the owner tony is great - here is the thing , he is fun - if you do n't have a sense of humor maybe you might not get him .	786
0	thanks `` management '' for replying to this matter 4 months later . i 'm already with another car wash , you might have heard of them , jackson 's car wash , they actually know a thing or two about customer service .	2939
1	pedro did a fine job ‍ & kept his appt . on time clean cut perfect fade ! my son was pleased .	3469
1	i have been going to several dr 's to find out what 's wrong with me . none of them are listening . nicholas snyder pa is listening . he is doing the testing that should have already been done . he is thorough and did n't just blow me off . i took my daughter to md now last year . i like how they do things but nick was especially awesome though . as an er nurse i have trouble trusting . not in this case . i 'm actually comfortable .	609
1	cheap and easy . sometimes you question how it 's so damn cheap . also it has a very diverse menu selection .	2718
1	very friendly and personable staff . i was impressed with their timeliness and efficiency during my exam . their selection on frames was very appealing , especially knowing there is a section that is discounted . i was very pleased with my experience and how kind the staff was to me and my son . they also worked with my budget and helped me find the best financial route to go with . i 'll definitely be planning future visits !	2277
0	well they are open ... and they do n't answer the phone . says a lot about a business if they ca n't answer the phone during working hours . it 's also a monday at 1:20pm so it 's not crazy busy . probably someone slacking off . i called multiple times throughout the day . no call backs no nothing .	1630
1	the selection is n't huge here but there 's enough to keep me coming back ! the sales are usually pretty good and the service has always been decent . every now and then the manager shows up at the register and things speed up and he 's very helpful and pleasant , but no one has ever offered me help while shopping or been easy to find when i have needed help .	2617
0	we recently took the class for a bachelorette party . we had 16 people and were promised and paid for a private class . that did n't happen . they stuffed two other parties in with us.no one really had enough time on the pole . if you were on the perimeter you had no room to move , because the people who were waiting there turn , were in your way . the instructor was good , not much fun , the drinks , t-shirt and picture were cute . but as mother of the bride i feel they misrepresented the package .	3629
0	took my car in to get an oil change and car wash . i was informed that they would take the coupon , but they did n't because i was already getting a discount because i had the fuel injection service done as well . now i get to take my car because the check engine light came on and the car wo n't accelerate . it was working fine before then . i will not be bringing my car back .	988
0	ray gives a good cut and seems like a nice guy . however , you absolutely better have a lot of time on your hands because the waits i have experienced seem like forever . i mean women who get cut , color , etc can spend that type of time on their hair but i get a simple fade every other week . as another reviewer notes , raise the prices , take appointments and maybe add one more chair/barber .	2591
0	i went there for a hair cut . hair wash and stylist was great , but it was very hard to communicate with them since they all spoke chinese and not so good english . the stylist did n't quite understand me while the outcome was not bad . the website said $ 50 for senior stylist but they charged me $ 60 + tax . cash only , so i wonder why they charge tax ? ? including tip , i ended up paying $ 80 just for simple trimming .	3610
1	this is the second time i have visited this location the first time was amazing ! an employee named katrina seemed as if she was leaving for the day and say that the line was backing up she immediately jumped behind the counter to assist her co workers . she was awesome the second time i came the line was backed up and a young kid came from behind the counter and started to take order on paper ! ! wow that 's service 5 stars and the coffee was awesome ! !	579
1	tip : peak time is weekend afternoon lol is bigger . 10 bucks is a great deal at peak times . no adult ( s ) fees either which lol charges the 2nd adult for . socks required . can also buy a pair there as well so they have you covered .	1631
1	the best food i want to the a lot of the buffet restaurant this is the best place to eat and great service	135
1	issac is the best ! ! very helpful if you need car keys this is the place will do business again scott	3095
0	i 've been there 3 times for different events . very poor beer selection , if you are not into ipa you are screwed . upstairs there are but too much room to sit , and if you are not sitting they wo n't give you any food , not even appetizers . worst part , i ordered a burger with french fries and was told they do n't carry french fries , crazy ! i think i gave legion too many opportunities already , specially with all the brewery options you have in charlotte .	2608
0	avoid it if at all possible . dr. cummings gave me the most poorly thought out , ridiculous diagnosis in about 5 minutes which ended up being very easy to prove incorrect later on . the pt was actually decent and somewhat helpful but i later realized you only see them once for the most part , then they dish you off to the assistants , who do n't really know much of anything about your specific issue and were not even there at the consultation . it 's always the same story w/ these types of shops , they treat you like a commodity . wish i had never called them .	2755
1	we had given up almost all hope before finally going to this store regarding an iphone that was n't pretty but was working fine just the day before it just cut out . within a few minutes the nice man behind the counter wrote up a receipt for $ 45 and had a preliminary diagnosis of a battery issue that should be resolved with replacement . as promised , an hour later the phone was ready and as good as it was before it stopped working . i 'd recommend this place for anybody ! they actually try to fix your phone and the costs are reasonable .	3817
0	portions will leave you crawling back to mc donald 's and send you to dairy queen after . for how unfilling the rations are the soup in a bread bowl is the best thing i 've had or seen in a chain like this	251
0	was excited to try this `` hand-pulled noodles '' place . on yelp it says they 're open `` monday-friday 10:30am to 10:30pm '' ..well i got there at 9:10pm and they 're closed already . wow what the fuck ? also there 's no official website to know what their real closing time is ! no phone number can be found anywhere as well . will not be coming back . thanks for nothing .	790
1	i can not begin to describe the amazing and professional service you can get at this place . i myself have been a customer of nicole beauty & wigs for the last two years and am so impressed with their service and business integrity . they offer a wide array of high-end hair treatment products at competitive prices , human and synthetic hair extensions and wigs . their products are of high quality and natural-looking that no one can tell they are extensions or even wigs . i recommend this store to any woman seeking to look younger and more beautiful . business owner dany , his family and staff will give you their undivided attention , honest advice and make you feel at home .	2826
1	love kristine , megan , and nick ! they know our `` usual '' and always make time to come by and say hi . not just say hi , though . they ask how our week was , what 's new ... they take a general interest in us which is refreshing to experience from the normal bar atmosphere . it 's dog friendly so be sure to bring your four-legged friend !	704
1	i 've always had a pleasant experience here ! staff is very friendly , interactive and quick on the job ! whether there 's a lineup or not , they 'll still deliver excellent service and ensure that you 're taken care of . keep up the good work ! : )	2438
1	delicious breakfast , served quickly with very friendly and conscientious service . i ordered the avocado toast and had no regrets- it was excellent . nice atmosphere and located in the yorkdale mall . nice choice for any time of day- they serve breakfast , lunch and dinner . made our visit from out of town pleasant .	534
0	we stayed at la quinta because we had a family member in hospital it was a very important visit i had to bring dogs but we were constantly getting phone calls about my one dog barking which was only when he heard maids i heard dogs howling and barking i never complained we were locked out of room . we paid a lot for room that week and we explained our situation i understand but we were all paying customers . besides when we stayed last october i got all bit up by bed bugs so we will not be staying at that la quinta and if you have the attitude feelings mutual that 's fine	1244
0	really bad customer service ! they are really rude and do not have any friendly matter most of them are rude and only care that you tip them forcefully ! they ask you infront of everyone and their gel changes color they do not have good service i do n't recommend it here !	655
1	i 'm updating my first comment , the customer service i received from averie after my first review , was absolutely amazing . she apologized for the confusion and made every effort to make everything right . i 'll go as far to say , they will have my business and respect . thank you again for everything ! p.s these are some awesome cookies , everyone must try !	1522
1	best walgreens in town . very nice staff and always willing to help . pharmacy staff is awesome and is always willing to help . i know it 's stressful for them so i wait for my pain killers because it 's not there fault i 'm in pain and i wo n't take it out on them . front of the store has great customer service when they have enough employees . they always seem understaffed for how busy the store is . see 1 or 2 employees who will bend over backwards to help . always respectful . top notch .	758
0	totally disappointed here , people . server forgot to input my order and the place was n't even busy . i ended up getting the wrong order after a lengthy 40-minute wait . so the manager gives me a $ 2 coupon for my next visit . it 's still sitting in my car . not too generous on the pours ... and the malibu pineapple was too watery . definitely a downer in my book : (	1074
0	after many years of coming here , i have cancelled all future appointments and am looking for a new primary care facility . my doctor , paul b , is an amazing person and am excellent doctor ... but the practice itself has degraded in service . it 's a minimum of a 20 to 30 minute wait for any service ... i left today after waiting over 40 minutes just to have lab work done . if you have time to wait every time you go , this may be the place for you , if your time is important to you , look elsewhere !	3349
1	take your snotty faces to scottsdale , this is metro phoenix ...	2141
0	horrible and un professional experience with this company . if you read the negative reviews below that are very detailed , it mirrors my experience here completely . hugely unprofessional service and they continue to not deliver on their own contracted responsibilities . not recommended .	3485
0	gone down hill fast . produce always sucks . prices are way high . some of the prepared foodsate okay . meat prices are ridiculous .	715
1	inspire courts is one of the best facilities on the west coast ! they host some of the best events in multiple sports and provide a great environment for the youth to train , develop , and have a great athletic experience . the basketball community has been very fortunate to have inspire courts and the people who run it . inspire courts has helped improve the basketball culture in arizona in a variety of ways and continues to do so .	3837
0	the class was fine , nothing special , standard spin class without fancy add-one . i appreciated that it was dark so i only concentrated on the riding . i may have gone back but the woman at the reception desk was unbelievably rude . she insulted me more than once and was mad when i did n't want to buy a $ 80 package instead of the $ 5 first ride . i do n't care if there is a great deal , if i do n't like the class i will not return . too bad they never had the chance thanks to the woman who obviously thought i was below her .	3477
0	do not shop here with your bank card if you bank with : chase , wells fargo or b of a . they charge your account twice and it takes over 3 days for the funds to return to your account . when i called them they explained to me that it is the banks fault and it does this all the time . this is a business that should address this type of issue immediately . i am appalled at their level of competence regarding how a persons finances are put into subjection like that . what if i did n't have the extra $ 800 available in my account ? ! i will not return .	2716
0	terrible terrible service . will never buy there or recommend them . they do n't acknowledge when you walk through the door , they do n't ask of you need any help , ignore you and walk right past you when you ask a question . i would give 0 stars but that 's not an option	1353
1	this location has the best prices and the best service . i rent from them on a regular basis and the staff is always accommodating .	2862
0	wow . this is rare . the service , food and drink was so bad i had to write about it . coffee tasted like flavored water . muffin was rubbery . service was horrendous . i paid 7 dollars and you 're not giving me a free cup of water ? jeez .	683
0	worst casino i have ever had the displeasure of stepping foot in . extremely rude and curt staff . classless and low brow clientele . very filthy and unkept place all together . i understand its not the bellagio , but clean something every once in a while , please . would never ever even consider stepping foot in this toilet of a casino ever again .	3378
1	i 'm in sherman oaks , california . for months the service from ontrac was beyond bad -- wherever or whatever that is . but in the last year there 's a new ontrac delivery man on my street and he 's the greatest . time was i was planning on complaining to amazon about their use of ontrac . no more . i could n't be happier with the service of this gentleman .	556
0	this place is the worst nail place i have ever been too . they advertise one price and then charge you $ 3 to trim your nails $ 5 dollars for certain colors of polish . if you say no to any upgrades they clearly talk about you the entire time and make you feel uncomfortable as can be . one girl came in and got her nails done the day before and one popped off like a cheap press on nail and they wanted to charge her $ 5 another customer was paying and was complaining about an over charge all in my single visit . horrible . go across the street to professor nails were they treat you right .	655
0	very unhappy with the service they provided , my son went to this facility for about 3/4 years and they never called him by his correct name ever . the last straw for us was an emergency visit to their other location on the other side of town to have us wait hours and all they did was try to send me home with a very large bill ( as usual ) and a prescription which could have been given or called in over the phone rather then waste my time and gas going to the other side of town ... .they heard kids in like cattle not really paying any attention to anything but the bill they give you ! !	2626
0	got bagels and coffee to go this morning and was very disappointed . for a breakfast place their coffee is awful and they do n't even have real half and half out or the right cups for iced coffee . they also do not have stevia or raw sugar.. they need to get an update on this bandwagon . i 'll give it to them that their bagels are fresh but our bagel sandwich was half heartily put together . it was dry and they did not get either orders right i asked for a jalapeño bagel and got plain and i asked for pepper jack cheese and got cheddar.. needless to say i will find a different place to get bagels and coffee .	325
0	compared to all the birthday cakes we saw online this was a 1/5 and it looks terrible . when we wanted to add a `` happy birthday '' flag , we did n't except that small of a design ... you can barely see it with that big flower . we wanted a happy birthday flag across the cake like those online and am disappointed .	18
1	good place for school books . good return policy also . no receipt required or you to keep track of a whole semester , just bring back for cash back ! the difference from campus prices is not a major difference but every dollar helps !	336
0	awful experience , do n't come here ! waste of time and money ! rude employee named marisa or maritsa ... . we were fine with paying for drinks but would n't take off a disgusting cheese soup . if you enjoy good quality mexican food . go to mangos just down the road from here or even go to taco bell they are even more authentic than this place . never again	882
0	i do n't blame the people here , i blame the administration of the va itself . if you 're not a veteran , then nothing in this review will really matter to you . if you are a veteran , you already know . while i have injuries , they are relatively minor . i truly feel for the men and women who require constant care and have nowhere else to get it than from the va .	2936
0	went in around 12 or 1 on a saturday and ordered 2 coffees . the coffee was old and burnt , like it had been setting in a pot on the burner since the store opened . and it was way over priced . definitely wo n't go back . pretty sad for a `` coffee '' store .	1332
0	terrible ! ! these guys screw gamers over . im very disappointed in them ! i bought a controller an hour ago , ended up getting home , finding my other one and did n't need the one i bought , so i went back to return the controller , keep in mind i still have the receipt , they said that they could n't take it ! what a joke of a company ! !	2319
0	you should have management and your people learn more about the specifics of the smoking law in nevada and thew differences between serving food at an establishment and patrons who have their own food . this place kicked us out because of ignorance as we were snacking and drinking here .	2494
1	great professional friendly service . lots of current styles to choose from , and i was able to get an eye exam on the same day . 5 out of 5 stars ! thanks owl !	1682
0	brand new 8,00 miles on a 2011 honda cry , bought in hawaii , drove from long beach to nephews in las vegas-no problems.since my 260.00+ so called oil change things are goings wrong fast , ex . dashboard lights go out , today oil change from 50 2 weeks ago to 20 % today.per john-guys forgot to rebut control panel -i have to check owners manuel . customers-it is better to take your car to the dealership , pay the big $ , but save on headaches and idiots this this place	2123
0	paid $ 14 for the gold car wash and it horrible ! half done job ! water marks all over my windows and all over my car ! never going again . he took the tip right out of my hand before i even saw my car ! ! ! ! ! !	3878
1	had a reservation at this place . has a good atmosphere , good furniture , good people and great service . we ordered two main courses which are absolutely fantastic , drinks are well kept up ... especially when i asked them to make the vesper martini from the james bond movie and it was all good everything lol . biggest thing was they looked at my special request here on yelp when i made a reservation and came through with it ! 5 stars all the way : )	1331
0	i had a meeting for an estimate on june 1 . chris came to give the estimate , and was very knowledgeable . he said that he was a little busy and would get back to us after the weekend with an estimate . it is now june 29 and i have not heard anything back .	3541
1	airport , therefore i understand food import can get expensive and affects the pricing and quality of the food . i had a salmon sandwich and my husband had a steak burger , both of which were delicious af . however , the main reason i wanted to write this review is our server heather , was so gracious and understanding towards my food allergies.. and had honest and professional conversations with myself and those around me.. was such a breath of fresh air . she is truly an asset . in addition , the playlist is . literally dancing 80 % of the time . we will definitley be back .	369
0	stopped at this ross to return shoes i bought because it was convenient . i was told because i had worn them , they would n't accept them ! i wore them once . i had the receipt . it took me demanding to see the manager not just have them speak to the cashier over the headset for them to take them back ! i have never been told anywhere i could n't retyrn an item with a receipt . ... worn or washed or falling apart ! i would normally have shopped for something else . ... ..not in that store . never again . the only reason they get one star is because i did get my money back .	764
0	i normally would n't visit a garden in november , but it was open and i 've enjoyed visiting in the past . unfortunately , many major areas were completely closed , including the entire japanese pavilion . maintenance staff were everywhere , often driving vehicles around and operating loud machinery . very few flowers were on display . and yet , i was charged the full price of a ticket . frankly , they have no business charging admission during this time of the year . after buying my tickets , i was dismayed to see that no one was actually at the gate to check tickets ; people were just walking in for free . i felt severely ripped off .	183
1	incredibly interesting menu items ! their pear bread they use for the grilled cheese it really good , and their salads are also well balanced and delicious . generous portion sizes . service was a bit slow , but i 'm not knocking points because i think they were a bit short-staffed that night and because our waitress was incredibly accommodating : she even had a salad remade for me when i forgot to ask for some things left off . really trendy and cute location , outdoor seating area is nice , shaded , and has misters .	1458
1	the food is amazing ... ca n't go wrong with anything . ribs , pasta , steak all the sides ! wine , thumbs up . my favorite bartender is n't there anymore i really miss him , justin was great ; knowledgeable and friendly .	1147
1	another breakfast option finally ! we have slim pickings around here for breakfast . great for late breakfast . i 'm a huge fan of breakfast all day so it suits me . busy in the mornings on the weekends and still adjusting to the busyness . they will get it and be great . sometimes the food can take a while if busy but they are still learning the area and when to staff .	672
0	the ice cream is okay , nothing special , or worth the money . if you can look past the sub par customer service maybe you can enjoy ice cream with your family . the store is just a bunch of teenagers , smacking their gum in front of customers and carrying on their personal conversations on the line ignoring everyone else . i 've worked at cold stone and my coworkers and i never provided such poor customer service . they really know how to make you feel unwelcome	3537
1	im not the biggest bubble tea fan , but this place did wonders for me . i do n't have a strong sweet tooth either , but being able to adjust the sugar and ice levels definitely was a nice touch ! i tried the match green tea ( milk tea ) with small tapioca and it was my delicious ! ! the service was great too , kind staff and quickly served . it was my first time trying coco and will not be my last !	766
0	was great before the renovation , now it 's all hype and pure salt . unfortunate .	1109
0	1st and only time here . ordered house chicken lunch special . egg drop soup that came with it was way too thick . house fried rice that also came with it was too bland . chicken was n't too bad . not impressed enough to go back .	1264
0	it stinks that gamestop is trying to become a glorified pawn shop . it shows in the quality of their preowned items . i purchased two controllers thinking gamestop would obviously be testing things out before trying to sell them , sent them to my nephew and when he opened them , two of the buttons literally would n't even work . as in they were completely stiff like someone superglued them . the fact that they did n't bother even pushing each button before trying to resell them is so sad . do yourselves a favor and just shop online .	3530
0	scheduled an appointment , and took my car to get `` serviced '' yesterday afternoon . the next morning out of curiosity i check the oil , and it still looks dirty . out of all times i 've ever changed oil , fresh oil is clear ... . i looked at the oil filter and it looks the same one with a coat of dirt covering it . a new filter would look nice and clean ... . is it wrong for me to assume it did n't get changed ? my first experience getting a car from a dealer was at this location and i do n't know if i 'll be back .	307
1	memorial day weekend.. i ca n't thank dr , shucmacher , his head nurse and staff for saving my life ... i had an allergic reaction and they immediately went into action when i arrived and i ca n't thank them enough ... it just so happened ( with follow up ) that i have a growth on my tongue that swells when i have an allergic reaction causing me to not be able to swallow and difficulty speaking and breathing ... the whole staff was amazing , caring and truly interested in what they could do to help me ... they were an amazing staff and i ca n't thank them enough ... .thank you from the bottom of my heart ! holly hernandez/pahrump nv	2517
1	this is one of my favorite restaurants.its got delicious grilled cheese for the kids.the encore , symphony , and the dali are simply amazing.plus let 's not forget that it comes with the best chocolate chip cookie you will probably ever taste.this is a great family restaurant.do n't forget the ice tea .	326
1	i am still stuffing my mouth with all that delicious food here . everything is fresh tasty fast and filling . the wait staff are very pleasant . they have 2 locations in las vegas . i strongly recommend jun 's	435
1	i keep searching for a lesbian bar and i 've have n't had much luck until my friend mentioned this place and i fell in love lol so many women come here and the atmosphere makes you want to keep coming back . friendly staff , great music , decent size dance floor , it 's really hard to not like this place . plus there was no cover charge !	2860
0	we did a walk in . been here several times before with ok service . it seems to have been bought out by another company and now it 's the worst place ever . it 's been 3 hours now and still 2 people ahead of us . funny how the number started at two , then 4 , then 1 and now back to 2 . really ? ? ? ?	2618
1	they have really good sandwiches and they 're so fresh ! ! ! i work around unlv and this place can fill you up for the whole day ... its really inexpensive as well which is a total plus for me hahaha .	673
0	i 'm moving back from out of state and had to switch my license back . waited for an hour in the middle of a weekday only for the guy to be a complete jerk and call me names . do n't use this one .	2408
0	rude on the phone . delivery guy got to hotel so they called me down . i get downstairs and the guy is gone . call the restaurant get hung up on . call back . get transferred and he comes the delivery guy . he wandering around the downstairs hallway . pizza was a 1 out of 10 . sauce had no flavor . crust was chewy . i ate 3 pieces . 2 pieces had bone chunks from the ham in them . ham pieces were huge . size of a quarter and about 3/8 inch thick . would never order from here again .	987
1	otherwise known as the `` dino park '' , this park is awesome ! ! the park has a big playground , a big water feature , a big sand box with dinosaur bones , dino formations , a little kids playground , plenty of picnic tables , and best of all : it 's all fenced in ! ! just outside of the fence , you 'll find a big pond with plenty of wildlife and a waterfall , a big grassy area , and restrooms .	367
0	a bearded guy at the mobile spot was useless when i asked him questions . he had no idea of anything when i asked him about sim cards . best buy needs to hire more professional employees .	494
0	be very careful when having your prescriptions filled at this location and always double-check your prescriptions . i found the wrong medication mixed in with my pills . and the explanation ... . '' we do n't know how that happened '' ... '' mistakes happen '' . i will never get a prescription filled at shoppers drug mart again .	2534
0	really poor customer service . worst customer service , in fact . had a layover and passed this on my way to my gate . i grabbed a premade salad , it was n't bad but it was n't good either .	447
1	fingers , fries , wings , pizza ? you name it they have it . we have them deliver pizza weekly to the office . inexpensive enough to feed the whole office without sacrificing taste .	1399
0	went there to get 2 more sheets of glass mosaic tiles ( got all our flooring from them ) .they quoted me $ 75 for the 2 sheets.checked somewhere else and got them for $ 16.it pays to shop around ! ! ! ! they will not ever get my business again .	1403
0	i brought my car in on mon . and didnt get my car back for 3 weeks and there communication , customer service were lacking to say the least .replaced part that did not need to be replaced cost me $ 325.oo . and it broke down on the way home .dont take your car there . i feel cheated and any input i had to say was ignored `` maybe `` because i am female .i give them a half star .	1360
0	i was going here over 7 months already and last week and for the past few other weeks they 've been bs ' n . making me wait . letting others that just arrived go b4 me . wrong readings and at first all the other times i would just walk in and then sent to the back and done in about 1 hr tops . i do n't recommend u go here . the people r friendly but now it 's like . oh he has a purple folder so make him wait . going somewhere else . lose my number	1753
1	love the food but i 've been here twice and both times they 've forgotten something ! the first time it was potato salad and this time it was pickle . very nice and courteous staff though .	477
1	i just have to say that i 'm in love with this place ! it 's a family owned business and they are super friendly ! as soon as i walked in , everyone made me feel welcomed and they were very knowledgeable about there products . chloe did a great job on my hair and everyone was so helpful ! they have a huge selection of products . i will never go any where else for hair supplies ! ! ! i live 15-20 minutes away and do n't mind taking the trip there because they make me feel wonderful when i leave and they are a true representation of phenomenal customer service ! : )	2826
1	i was having a tremendous customer service problem with a purchase that i made from pacific sales inside the best buy store . i had spent endless hours on the phone with them . i finally decided to go into the store and try to handle it in person . the manager of the best buy on marks street in henderson , nevada was just terrific . his name is travis and in 10 minutes he accomplishd what i could not do in literally hours on the phone . i went from a totally frustrated and dissatisfied customer to one that was really impressed by the service i received from travis , the manager .	494
0	there have always been several reasons for me to not like savoy -- outrageous drink prices , absurdly snobby wait staff ( umm -- this is n't paris , garçon ) , and a menu that is not at all vegetarian-friendly . but i 've kept going back for the one thing they do right -- live jazz on monday nights . tonight was a total deal-breaker though -- a pittsburgh cop frisking everyone on the way in ! nice way to start your night -- being made to feel like a criminal before entering the club . i 'll find live jazz somewhere else from now on .	714
0	mediocre at best . standard manicure was $ 15 , if i remember correctly , the place itself is not pretty , color selection is okay . the reason i came here is it was the closest nail salon when i looked on yelp . my nails were kind of crooked and i got absolutely no hand massage . i would n't come here again .	3649
0	refused to accept national meineke coupon for a free oil change . if you want to be cheap , run a mom & pop shop , not a ( formerly ) respectable national chain .	1086
1	texas roadhouse seems to have it down when it comes to consistency . we ate here tonight with another couple and had the usual sirloin steak , mushrooms , sweet potato , and delicious rolls . the service was friendly and timely . they do the birthday celebrations on the saddle and the big texas `` yee-haw '' . i find it better than the annoying songs some places half-heartedly sing . as a friend put it , `` this place offers a high quality steak at denny 's prices '' ( thanks , george ) .	560
0	this place is the worst ! omg . we ordered a thin crust pie and it came out soggy . it was impossible to even hold it up with one hand . the sauce is watery and overall the whole thing was just really disappointing . if you 're in town and craving pizza this is not the spot . hop on the monorail and get off at harrahs/the linq station . theres a pizza spot in the promenade that would be well worth the trek .	282
0	when you first enter , they greet you with a japanese greeting and get you seated very quickly while you wait they have like a bookshelf that you can pick magazines from and read . which is good . servers were polite . those are the only reasons they get a 2 stars i did n't really appreciate the taste of our orders . blend taste‍ portions were small . and price feels not worthy of it for the taste and portion . wo n't visit there again . make your own judgement yourself that was only my experience .	344
1	the food here is so good . i 'm pretty sure it 's cooked in pig fat so that explains why . i like the casual environment but it is modern . it feels like a traditional pub but with a younger crowd . i love the free popcorn the spice on it is soooooo tasty .	480
0	mehhhh . i wish it was better . : ( the waffles were tough . the boba tasted like it was a a powder mix . the service was great though . everyone seemed so friendly .	580
1	i i found that ultimate autos save me from being taken by another auto repair company . when i turn my car over to them and they gave me a quote one quarter of what the other guy quoted me , they did an excellent job and guarantee the job . this was unbelievable . they save me from being scammed by another dealership .	3528
0	once again i got burned by this location . i always say i 'm not going back but somehow end up there . today put me over the top . the parking lot is hands down the worst in the city of cleveland . i almost got hit 3 times by other drivers . the store is still dirty and it took 22 minutes to check out behind a woman using wic . they need to have separate cashier who only deals with this form of payment . never again .	3216
0	i have to say it was ok ... .but prices could be better ... they advertise about friends do n't let friends eat five dollar pizzas ... i have to say for the price of their pizzas i would go to the five dollar place ... the staff was great ... loved them	375
1	i love this place and i 'm very picky when it comes to thai food and the staff is always nice ! plus they deliver and i live on the strip !	1361
1	new menchies location offering everything you would expect from the chain : plenty of flavors , almost too many toppings , and a brightly colored interior . one of the drawbacks is limited seating ( even outside ) , so coming with a large group might not be the best idea . otherwise , this is a great place to stop for your frozen yogurt fix .	738
0	man what can we say about this place ? karen and i went there of course due to seeing it from travel channel and we were both excited but left so disgusted and very disappointed . the lard on the burger buns ? wow that 's just nasty and do n't get me started on the smell of that . pretty cool place to visit and take photos though but dont eat there if you do n't have to .	75
0	if you have all day to wait this is the place to go ! ! always there to make you wait as long as possible . most reliable wait times . never fast always slow guaranteed . so come on down and hang out at discount tire . you just do n't know by the end of the day you just might get what you came in for if not you can always come back the next day and hang some more they do n't care	1004
0	it is what you would expect from any themed place called `` heart attack grill '' . mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the `` nurses '' wear at the bar . van in the drive through section is painted to look like an ambulance . hamburgers are named after cardiac events . the food was bad , greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before . if you plan on going , enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again .	75
0	i 've been to both the aveda school and paul mitchell . i think from now on i 'll stick with aveda . student i had literally was trembling the whole time cutting my hair . i understand wanting to do a good job , but was she ready to cut hair ? and when her instructor told her how to do the cut , and showed her ... she still did it a different way . and i still had to go home and cut one side , because it was longer . i just think maybe they need more instruction . sorry paul mitchell ... .. gon na give my biz to aveda from now on . : (	354
0	straight up disappointed . went to get some matcha water and got over charged and they did n't even make it right . every other place i 've been to for a match water made it with at least three scoops of matcha just for a tall and only costed no more than $ 2 at max . i ended up getting a grande with a single scoop of matcha at the price of $ 3.25 ( the label said ice tea ) it tasted like straight up water .	3641
1	i really enjoyed this restaurant it 's my first time in montreal and in canada in general and my sister took me to this restaurant for lunch today . excellent food and great service ! !	1280
0	i went to this office for several years but finally had it with the extreme wait times to see the doctor . no problem with dr.hamburg 's care . when i complained to the office manager , she was extremely rude ! ! because of her anti-patient attitude , i will not be back . i was able to tell this to dr. hamburg and i hope it will change the office managers lack of skill in dealing with patients . i also told the doctor that his care for my situation was good , as are all doctors and that the office staff is what makes , or breaks , their success .	1942
0	i kinda made me sick but that was just the original i think that some would be very good , i would give it a second chance	3813
1	hi this great quality furniture , i buy my living room set 3 years ago and still the same , beautiful . ; )	439
1	came here for lunch on a beautiful saturday . we were happy to find we could be seated right away . our server was pleasant and attentive . the food was excellent . i had the salad l'americana ( greens , egg , chicken , tomato , cuc , bacon , onions and cheese ) and my husband had the daily special which was a mix of mushrooms , sausage , peppers , tomato sauce and potato medallions -- both are highly recommended . we will definitely return ! !	728
0	the worst baristas and the worst customer service . i go in an order 2 large brew coffees . i pay and then 30 seconds later a barista tells me that it will take 5 minutes to get me the 2 large coffees . 10 minutes later they hand me 2 large coffees that are only half full ! ! ! when i ask them to fill them up to the top properly , they tell me they are all out of brewed coffee and ca n't fill them up . ridiculous . plus they hire staff who do n't speak english . so half the time when i order , the barista does n't understand what i 'm asking for . not ok .	1092
1	so glad i found this place on charleston shit part of town but no this car wash super good	2093
1	jeff 's creativity , passion , and fun brings a smile on your face instantly . i brought two 13 year old aspiring performing artists and they were inspired by jeff 's stories , talent , and humor . this show is great for all ages , everyone leaves with something . i would bring more people to see this .	726
1	love this place ! ! ! fun to party with your friends or bring the kids . best of both worlds . foods good too !	1483
0	why ? why ? why do y'all do this to me ? ? ? thanks for the lousy birthday present . i 'd have rather gotten a long john silver 's gift card . could you have had more turnovers ? could you have at least just held on to the ball ? did the fact that i watched the game at a damon 's bring hexes upon your franchise ? should i have stayed home ? blah . yeah , yeah , better luck next year . grrr .	3306
0	wow , for a $ 6 half sandwich you do n't get much . two very thin avocado slices and minimal shredded chicken . i got the 2 for deal , not much of a deal . the potato soup was lacking in flavor . i wo n't be back to this place .	1259
0	horrible customer service , i purchased a 200 dollar software called dragon nuance for mac , the employee whether new or old when i purchased it opened the product and was informed by another employee that was against protocol . after realizing that it was n't the software i needed i attempted to bring it back and was refused since it was already opened and it had been over a week despite the fact it was within the -5 day window and had n't been activated . very disappointed and will not be shopping at best buy at all going forward .	3192
1	excellent service ! went in to get my screen fixed . only took 30 minutes and my screen is better than ever ! highly recommend !	2918
1	this is all about elina ( i hope i got your name right ) at the self service checkouts . she saw that all i had were two large , awkward items and she checked me out herself so i would n't have to lift them for scanning . honestly , i do n't come to walmart for customer service , and i was having a rotten day ; so thank you for the pleasant surprise and helping to turn my day around .	3825
1	i buy all of my computer and electronic needs at this best buy . every time i go in i find the service always responsive to my needs . the staff is personable , professional , and knowledgeable . i would highly recommend this store . i just bought a computer notebook , keyboard and phone system .	494
0	we come here sometimes , but today i am really unhappy with their coffee . we told them sugar-free black and white mocha , and it tastes very sweet to me , because i do n't like any sweet flavor in my coffee , i went to ask their staff , they said they added splenda in there . something may cause cancer when it get hot and really hard to get out of your body .	3520
0	bus load , after bus load , after bus load of kids with few adults to manage them . holy cow , what a disaster . throwing balls , running kids , and no adults from the schools nor enough science museum staff to manage it all . this was quite an annoying experience , and hard to enjoy the exhibits . they really need to get this under control .	3891
0	took in a dress yesterday and explained that the zipper pull had broken off and i needed a new one . the gentleman at the counter said they 'd have to replace the whole zipper at $ 20.00 . `` but the zipper 's fine -- it 's just the pull that 's broken . can you just put on a new one ? '' `` no . '' oh . okay . best be on my way , then .	3032
0	ok this food may have been a little `` too '' authentic for me . i may have imbibed a bit much the night before but hey it 's vegas . i wanted a nice vietnamese combo plate to soak up the night 's alcohol . i could n't even explain what came on the plate - greasy sausage of some sort , a bit of greasy short rib and some other seafood something . the spring rolls were mostly iceberg lettuce ( super weird ) and not appealing . this was a bitter disappointment	673
1	this target is always clean , well stocked and rarely busy . typically there are 2-3 cashiers during slow times and 4-5 during busy . there is a starbucks and target cafe , i appreciate the option for refreshments .	3259
1	faced the dreaded new swimsuit challenge but got such good service at the bay that it actually was a pleasant experience ! while short staffed at times , when i got someone , their help was professional and patient . just wish there were more of them !	2979
1	reasonably priced . got a gel spa pedicure . had an older gentleman do it and was a little worried at first but he did a good job . would def go back when i 'm in vegas .	2915
0	our group of 11 arrived for our dinner reservation at 5:50 pm and did n't receive our modest dinners of grilled chicken and veal burgers until 7:16 pm by which we were famished and almost through the three bottles of wine ordered . the wait was not deserving of the mandatory 18 % service charge that was automatically levied . the food was mediocre and the service ok but not outstanding . i will not go here again .	1079
0	horrible customer service . they failed to take off an item that was out of stock on their website . a day after i placed the order , they emailed me saying that my item was out of stock . i asked them for a refund immediately which they failed to do so and started ignoring all my calls and emails . this forced me to call my cc company to dispute the charge . horrible and rude customer service , would never ever buy from them again !	978
0	i went to the office for a consultation on a sleep appliance . 10 months later i received a bill for $ 200 . i called the office and they said that is their consultation fee . i was never told their would be a consultation fee or i would never have gone to their office as other dentists do n't charge for a consult . would not recommend anyone go to this office . horrible customer service .	3240
0	been a few times to watch the smaller non known bands starting out , a few suggestions for the owner , get a bartender that can move and not take 5 minutes per customer , hire a power wash company to remove the smell of vomit from your parking lot , lastly , when you promise to pay the smaller bands to perform , pay them and dont stiff them at closing , seen this 3 times already .	316
1	i have n't had any experiences of waiting too long . i have had a great experience with the np neerja seethi . what i look for is someone who will listen , is able to look up from computer charting , responds with appropriate labs or imaging or explanation of why waiting is warranted . i 'm an rn so i try to narrow down what i have before i go in and want the courtesy of explanations . she does this and more !	1562
0	always had a good experience . but do n't call me 5 min before my appointment and already on my way to inform me that they did n't see me ask for my regular tech inna . then proceed to tell me that they now only accept calls to request for inna . okay i understand but do n't call me right before my appt to let me know . not my problem . no one to fix the problem either . then have the receptionist pass then phone and not even tell me she was doing so . been coming here for almost 2 years and same tech yet ca n't be accommodating .	1875
0	the overall service is n't bad , the tune ups twice a year are worth it , but the service men act like sales people : always trying to sell ( push , really ) the next thing like uv lamps , air duct sealing , etc . they make you feel like you 're going to make your family sick if you do n't buy their product . it 's malarkey !	2730
1	bagels , bialys , black & white cookies and challah bread ! so many bagel options . i have never stayed an ate breakfast but this place seems popular from breakfast/brunch on the weekends .	325
1	i 'm so happy we got this store by us ! we 'd drive 10 to 15 minutes just to get something from the grocery store . mountains edge needed this badly . the salad bar hands down is such good quality reminds me of a whole foods salad bar without the whole foods prices ! love this place !	1904
1	... excellent course , price is very good , love the lay out and the par 3s ... .will definitely come back often and bring friends ...	85
1	a great place to take family and friends . kid friendly . would be great for a date night , bachelor party or corporate function . great facility , great food and wonderful service .	1483
0	out of business . this place is closed note on the door says locked by landlord . its too bad because it was a unique experience .	2051
0	i was here last weekend and i was very disappointed . the staff was n't very friendly . and someone finally greeted me after i already looked around the whole store . i went in to look at their betta selection and i could n't believe my eyes ! all the bettas were in dirty water and there was even a dead one ! i attached some pictures of how filthy their water was . it looked like they had n't cleaned their cups in weeks . i was so upset i had to get outta there . dont sell bettas if you arent going to properly take care if them .	1078
1	i 've been seeing dr. chisholm for about 8 months now , and he 's been helping us find options for our infertility . he 's been great about explaining test results and providing options for us to consider . if my day ever comes and i am able to conceive , dr. chisholm will be my first choice to help me through my pregnancy and delivery .	2643
1	this gem of a restaurant and bar has one of the best happy hours you can find in the valley . the wine is well priced the happy hour menu offers a nice variety.love their shrimp and their scores skewers .pizzas are good also . dinner is great my husband had the lasagna and i had the salad with salmon on it as a main entrée we were very happy with our selections atmosphere is good service is good i highly recommend this restaurant	368
1	friendly service and great food . on thursday , the special was 2 mini burgers & fries for $ 4 . it was a complete meal and mmmmmm so good . we had soup and drinks and still only spent less than $ 30 .	1724
0	unfortunately , i was not impressed with the coffee or the service . it was late at night , like 9:30 , and when i walked in i did n't get a `` hello '' or anything ! when i finally decided on something after looking for at least 5 minutes ( never been and had no help with recommendations ) , the barista was short and rude !	3520
1	had a street taco and elote ( mexican corn on the cob ) today and my friend had the green chile cant say anything bad the food was spot on the service was with a smile and timely . we have food truck thursday here at our work and i hope they come back thank you for the great experience	2937
0	not even worth one star ! wasted money last nite on special $ 1 tacos . my dog could n't even eat them	322
1	this safeway has improved over the years and i enjoy shopping here more . the french bread is better than other supermarkets in the area in my opinion . i like the app with the `` your way '' specials . i also like they have better customer service with mostly staffed check out lanes . i 'm not a fan of self checkout at supermarkets .	3938
1	hi . we were there last week and the employees there were very patient and kind with us as my 2 kids kept changing their minds about their drinks and food : ) the cashier , david was very professional and patient as well ! ! ! ! thank you for your services !	216
1	i have been going here for over a year and overall the place is very clean . the staff is friendly and the cardio theater is great .	3446
0	terrible food and service . down grade from bar food . restaurant would not serve my wife an alcoholic beverage who is 30 and had 5 forms of id because they said her license was not her . waitress had to come back three times for order and on top of this was a hair in my salad . beware all and go to mcdonald 's instead .	1193
1	trekked it out to oakville to finally experience a drive in movie . looked everything over online and found out i could bring my dog so of course it was only expected . apparently you ca n't bring drinks or food inside ... we all are entitled to making mistakes ... i actually took that seriously . ( take note for next time ) the diner was only open at screen # 1 of 3 . it 's a fun experience that i do n't mind visiting more . better than watching inside a theater .	1634
0	what a waste of time . took an hour of my day when told they needed 15 min to write an estimate . i do not recommend bringing your car here . i just wanted a quote on the repair , not my insurance company to raise my rates for a repair less than 100 dollars . they wanted to do paint , and replacement of things that were completely unnecessary . unsatisfied ...	1819
1	we 've come back multiple times just for the service alone ! love the wing night . always get a good portion of flavourful wings . ca n't beat the drink specials . clean establishment . clean bathrooms ( which you would n't expect , but they surprised me ! ) love stavros !	698
1	the staff today get a 5 star for their service . there was some complications in the kitchen with our order which delayed our food and timing of all the entrees arriving at the same time . the waiter and manager personally apologized and then comped our children 's meals . i felt like they truly wanted to make sure we still had a great visit and would not hinder our return . well done and noted ! our family 's visit today was great and the ice cream at the end was delicious !	218
1	why am i ( a male heterosexual ) writing a review for this craft store ? well , how else am i going to decorate my man cave with my famous sf giants newspapers ? they did a kick ass job of mounting and framing them . they will also frame jerseys , baseballs , etc .	2060
0	the `` 5:00 somewhere bar '' was terrific . my friends and i have been coming here from the midwest for years and staying at the flamingo because of the location and the 5:00 bar . we were very disappointed at the change to the `` bird bar '' . fortunately , the bartenders have stayed on so far , which is why i gave it 2 stars . if they leave , so will we . and one more thing , we come in the fall for football , and in march for the ncaa basketball tournament . why they removed some of the tvs is a mystery , and will hopefully be rectified .	637
0	the worst nail place i have ever been in las vegas nv . i waited 30 minutes and then i get in the chair to wait another 40 minutes . it was about 8 workers and no one said anything else to me . like i 'm sorry for the wait or anything . i was suppose to get my eyes wax but with they way they handle me i just got my feet done and left . ( couldnt get out of their fast enough ) unprofessional people i will never go back .	2892
0	this was probably the worst car wash i have ever been to . went thru the machine and when i came out the other end the panel to my gas tank had been ripped off . they did not seem to care much . told me that they had seen this before from there drying machine and that my panel must have been missing clips . even if that had not happened it was a pretty shitting wishing job . i paid $ 22 for the super . car still had many dirty spots on it when done . finally insult . the was to include wash of rubber mats but of course that was not done either .	3061
0	i have had 2 cars serviced at this location for the past 5 years and over that time the overall customer service and mechanical service has consistently declined to the point where i will never go back . even though this location is the closest to my home i would rather drive well out of my way to go somewhere else than have to deal with the condescending technicians , the shoty workmanship , and constant delays caused by lousy mechanics and lack of personnel . avoid this location at all cost .	2263
1	i have had nhw for over 5 years and they have been a gift ! gloria has gone out of her way to provide the best service possible . yvette as well . they heard my concern in my voice and i felt cared for and that is hard to find these days . i am truly grateful !	3653
0	the first clue was that we were the only ones in there for lunch . for 13.50 ( thank god we had a groupon ) the enchildas suizas was probably worth about 4.00. and on top of that , they left off the onions and cilantro that was on the menu to make it sound yummy . 13.50 and still hungry . maybe this place is jumping at night . the pieces of steak in the salad was very good though ... .oh , by the way that was 10.50 , for 4.00 worth of meat ...	190
1	dropped my car off to be shampooed inside and detailed . i have a toddler and my car was filthy . they did a fantastic job . car looks like new . i know this place has a lot of bad reviews but glad i brought my car in regardless . only complaint is was a little pricey .	3899
0	a dog escaped and none of the staff were aware.the dog ended up across the street . thank goodness for the people that found him and decided to check if the dog came from their hospital . i do n't feel comfortable boarding my dog there in the future . their prices are affordable the front desk staff is great ... . just that small hiccup .	3030
1	a really quant bakery in downtown champaign that does cupcakes very well . the red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting really are special . i came here for my 20th birthday because all i wanted was a great red velvet cupcake and they did not disappoint .	3749
1	i like the paul mitchell school and can recommend it . good short-hair cut twice . great color and highlighting . level i students . it may be hit or miss but the price is right . it 's only hair . it grows back !	354
1	forget about all the reviews prior to september ! the gym has been remodeled . it was already great but now it is fantastic ! i highly recommend it . plus , i think the new owners took charge of the gym within the last year , and boy did they do a good job ! wow . go see for yourself . i bet you will love it !	3912
0	they did change the seats , but the gas-leak-stench is still there . there is a zero tolerance policy for people with disabilities , as demonstrated by security and the managers . i do not recommend this cinema for anyone , disability or not .	611
0	do n't rent from these people . we have had a water heater go out and it took them 8 days to get it fixed . we have currently a fridge out and we have 9 days with them saying we will get it fixed soon . they have not called us one time to give us information we have had to call them each and every time . when our lease is up we will need to rent again but not from this company . march can not come soon enough . they are the worst company in terms of customer service . my recommendation is to run from this company as fast as you can .	32
1	the only office supply store that has shipping boxes without their logo . i appreciate that as i need blank boxes to ship my products to customers . who wants to ship something with a giant `` staples '' or `` wal-mart '' logo all over the box . i will continue shopping here for all my supply needs as long as they stock the blank boxes !	1782
1	i always go lake sahara location this restaurant is more cute inside and customer service was great but restroom was not clean . food was just okay i like sahara location better	1361
1	the pharmacy is very slow . i usually fill at the capitol clinic , but stopped by here today because i was nearby . i waited almost 15 minutes for my rx even though there was only one other patient waiting . at capitol , it 's usually a minute or two . fill your prescriptions elsewhere . great experiences with clinicians . dr. tock ( derm ) is very helpful and dr. barnes ( optometry ) is fantastic . may be weird , but i have fun going to my eye appointments . she 's great .	2985
0	we bought a living social deal from them . their service was not the best , lack of communication , and they never notify me of anything that may need attention . a pool man always left a blank note , except for his name . people from the front office does n't know what they are doing . you could feel it from them that they are careless about their business .	3479
1	this was oddly fun and exciting . a little challenging to get started , but very addictive once the clues kept coming . the staff helping us out was absolutely amazing and nice . i would definitely recommend to others . will definitely be back to try another room !	1165
1	i 'm in town for a baseball tournament , it 's over 100 outside , and i broke my sunglasses ... these people fixed me up in no time ! great service , and the selection of frames is great . thank you ! !	3767
1	the restaurant with the food truck theme was very good . the overall establishment was very clean and all the arcade games worked . the staff was attentive and polite . it was a great experience . one particular instance stands out . we were going to the go carts and we had one family with one adult and two kids . all three of them are going to sit it out because they did n't want to keep one kid out . however , one of the employees really stepped up and went with one of the kids . this was unexpected and really above and beyond . we will be back .	3707
1	had a bite to eat , with the bootcamp breakfast club team , on the patio this afternoon , after the x-warrior competition at the saddledome . courteous staff , wide selection of beer , great selection of food and outstanding service during a very busy time of day . our meals were all delivered at the same time . salads were fresh , meats were well done , the fries and potato fritters were delicious . the only critique were the clive burgers . the patties were dry and tasteless .	630
0	i used to shop there , was always treated like an idiot , talked down to , the customer service is garbage . their prices are so high it 's unbelievable , and there 's a reason why people call it the home of the one dollar wire fire ! ! ! worst audio shop i 've ever been to , and i 'm a professional of 15+ years . do n't do business here you will regret it .	2427
0	ok heres the deal . the customer service was good for the most part . problem is the screens they use to replace iphones are not an `` iphone '' screen , they are a knockoff . it leads to a couple issues but the most troubling is if you were polarized glasses the screen is impossible to see . the other problem was the sensitivity of the screen . it was always causing me problems . i went back several times to try and fix the issue but when i left nothing had changed . maybe you will have better luck .	3817
1	our new thunderbird pool has been operational for almost a month and we could not be happier ! they made the whole process nearly seamless from the dig to the pebble sheen finish . we are very happy with our investment . their team delivers- superior customer service and pride in delivering a quality product . highly recommend thunderbird pools and spas .	2530
1	i go out of my way to use this business for gas and convenience items - and i do n't even live in the providence neighborhood anymore . that 's how great the people are here .	507
0	the oakland chipolte is in a terrible state . old food and they have rats . do not go .	1418
0	i have gone to dr. santucci since i started middle school . i am into my junior year of college now and had lost my retainer . we met to try and reach a solution for the shifting that occurred . he wanted another $ 4,000 to fix the issue . my family has spent well over $ 15,000 with him . he became very hostile when questioned and was aggressive . for a profession based on patient care , i did not feel cared for and am incredibly dissatisfied with the treatment i received . find another orthodontist .	2877
0	italian sandwich was ok . the filet salad was listed on the menu as medium . served well done . the apps came moments before the entrees which is not much fun . too many guests for one server . food quality is near the price but not quite the price . work on the timing and add staff and you 'll be a better restaurant .	368
0	been shopping here exclusively for 7 years . they recently took out the self checkout and now it 's a nightmare . a quick trip in and out no longer exists . i feel for the understaffed cashiers - the lines are always long and everyone thinks they should go through the express lane . time to give the fry 's across the street another chance . you never realize how good you had it until it 's gone .	2105
0	staff is unprofessional and unorganized . they will send you random bills out of no where several months after your visit . shady practice .	2209
1	my favorite place in champaign . they have cops on the tv saturday nights , just like i used to watch with my dad . cheap beer and lots of locals . love it .	1476
1	they were great ! ! excellent customer service ! i was not promised a time frame because that 's unrealistic ! there are times when a body shop , to no fault of their own due to parts not immediately availble ... ..etc ... .have a car in longer than average . i understand and i get it ! some people just have totally unrealistic expectations ! if you go forward with an open mind and patience , most times everything will turn out fine !	1819
0	usually has the tools and/or things you need , but the service is awful . seems like nobody is willing to help the customer . my recommendation - another lowe 's or home depot	3428
0	i was so disappointed with this place . i ordered a cold noodle dish with pork and spring rolls and then you pour the sauce over it that i 've ordered in many different vietnamese restaurants . the noodles kept sticking together and were way too thick for vietnamese style noodles . my mom ordered seafood noodles which was decent . their chicken wings were tasty . some people in my party ordered malaysian/indonesian style curry which was tasty but a bit oily . i thought the portions were quite large .	331
0	staff at the front desk were friendly , but the facility is old and musty . the pool is closed until spring and the locker rooms were really gross and dirty . i would n't recommend coming here .	3922
1	fun place but the taps could use a good cleaning	2237
0	horrible ! ! ! i went in for a regular brake job and it took them much longer then they said it would and then a week later my car full on stops while i 'm driving and i have to get it towed . turned out that they did n't torque down any bolts ! ! ! you have to torque everything down . stupid and incompetent	2485
1	we were initially disappointed with the service here . new to mccarran rent a car , we did not know that we could go downstairs for the priority service . so we waited upstairs for 25 minutes to learn that . however , our frustration was short lived when we got to liz in the priority area ! she was efficient , personable and very helpful ! ! go liz ! ! !	3129
0	this store provides delivery service which i use since i do n't have a car . no more . their service has become horrible , always late . i do n't have all the time in the world to pay extra for one-hour delivery and nothing ... no call . i call the service and they claim he called when he did n't . never using the service again .	2316
0	just your typical over-priced , weak service sandwich/salad chain . a lot of people behind the counter talking amongst themselves and starting at you blankly when they finally decide to help you . my friend and i met here for a quick bite . she got a large salad and the mac and cheese kids meal . paid over $ 18 . the kids meal did n't even come with a drink , she had to get that separately . not a great experience . next time i 'll go to smashburger or the teriyaki place on the end .	701
1	great place to get your car or truck washed . my car is clean and friendly people . i recommend this car wash to all my friends .	3899
1	thom smith was a dream to work with from start to f8nish . he is professional , patient , and compassionate . he is timely and specific with requests for needed documents and information needed to process the loan expeditiously . i highly recommend working with thom smith at hfg .	2518
0	dan is great . otherwise avoid this place . they overcharge and never file the insurance correctly . do not go here .	1274
1	i love this place . i was introduced here by family as my birthday lunch and that was a treat in itself . have someone take you out and it ends up being somewhere good ? i got the sushi my first visit , and everything was picture perfect . now , i frequent here when i 've got a craving for good food !	961
0	of at least a week and half of getting a fill my nails have turned a yellow/green color . i do n't know if it 's because they use cheap clear coats or what but it 's very ugly and disgusting to look at . never going back	655
0	the first meeting with john the owner went extremely well however , once the deposit was paid everything went downhill ... the cabinets came in wrong ( which we had in writing ) john screamed at me and said he would need to do over ( sorry but not my fault ) . john had to come out multiple times as he was extremely forgetful and not organized in the least bit . on install day they did n't show up at all ! our job was moved about several times due to his disorganization . on our final discussion he cursed profanities non stop . do not do business with this company..not worth the $ 600 savings over the top notch companies .	1667
1	delicious . open 24 hours . horchata on tap ( most places make you pay for refills ) .	857
0	i have been to this place at least 5 times . i always get the fish taco . this time it was too salty and tasted old . i prefer my fish taco grilled . they had it battered . two thumbs down . but the atmosphere was good . i watched my panthers play and had good laughs .	1558
1	two thumbs up ! our group of 3 wanted a good cheap full body massage away from the high roller hotel massages , and we snagged a great deal here . 36 dollar special for 1 hr foot and body ... it was exactly what we needed and we were out of there relaxed and recharged . the masseuses were courteous and did a good job of working our knots out .	735
1	nice sized store . sells maternity clothes . decent service . enjoy coming here !	3449
0	i am laughing after having just left this place . the white spot on my car is left over from me wiping it to see if it was a stain . the only noticeable difference on the inside is the seats look vacuumed . will not be returning .	3899
1	working for veyo is great , i would recommend it . only thing is cancellations are a pain . you often go 15 minutes or more for no pay . now the call centers cancel a lot of them before you go too far , which is good .	1232
0	wish i could give negative stars . everything we ordered was terrible ... and i mean everything . lentil soup , falafel and hummus . the staff all look miserable . when we were looking for our server to ask for the bill , she finally showed up stinking like an ashtray . no wonder she did n't come by to check on us once . the restaurant itself needs a serious clean too . the booth seats are filthy or stained . overall , a very unpleasant experience .	89
1	great park . always nice people around . good fishing .	680
1	stop in here often ! this location is always clean , friendly and has so much in stock . the great additional things are : they have a special milkshake machine that 's great for the kiddos . soft drinks for .89 cents daily ! ! get the circle k membership card for even more savings & special deals . they just finally added the chicken rollers that are really good ! ! they have about 5 different flavors offered here ! plus delicious hot dogs , nacho 's , snacks galore , munchies and so much more ! ! gas prices are fair and they offer the fry 's discounts..	2563
1	very nice , only 24 lanes but i had a great time . the setting gives me a private somewhat isolated feeling to develop my skill set	451
0	we were very happy with cdcs remodel of our pool . the did the decking as well . there were cracks in the new decking , warrantied , and we have been trying to get them back out for months . now , i ca n't seem to get a response out of anyone . too bad ...	659
0	if you are coming for only sushi i would not recommend this place at all ... it tasted old and fish seemed to be precut/minced ... the only reason for the 2 star was there creme burlee was ok . easily in the bottom 5 of the sushi places i have been to	1362
1	i am so impressed that even though there was n't much room to stand when we went to celebrate dingus day , the bartenders were quick and friendly - even when people squirted water at them and thrashed them gently with pussy willows . they are the most professional corner dive bar servers one can imagine . what an experience !	1407
0	s-l-o-w . the food here is really good . it there is just zero sense of urgency . literally every time i 'm here i 'm always waiting on the staff . it does n't matter if they 're busy or slow , you should expect to wait when you 're here .	1365
0	these people are snobs , i took a friend there to try to sell some vintage costume jewelry , and this man took a look at a few item and told her all she had was yardsale junk . very bad customer service	3804
1	love the satay soup base here , free to sub in too ! spring rolls are also good . fast , friendly service .	577
1	the atmosphere is sooooooo beautiful ! great menu with quite a variety , a little pricey , great craft cocktails . i had the chorizo chile relleno with an over easy egg , very delicious . they have a farmers market cocktail that 's made with a green chile vodka - very unique .	1331
0	i was actually surprised at how pleaseant the folks were there . they were very on the ball so to speak as well . however i 'm still not a fan of the place . it is more like a take out service . what can you expect from a unit in a mall though ? there hours are limited to when the town center is open too : (	2438
1	walked in and got greeted immediately by a friendly employee , she directed me to the jump rope i was looking for . they had many selections and great prices .	1050
0	i had come in super pregnant under my insurance for an appointment . i needed some work done that would have to wait till after i had my kid and made an appointment . i came back in and had the work done . after the work was done , they inform me that they no longer accepted my insurance , after , when its too late for me to change my mind and go elsewhere . so wrong to do , esp knowing i just had a baby to support and dental bills are expensive .	2779
0	i purchased a pecan pie for my son . the pies was at best 3 of 10 . the customer service was 2 of 10 .	2637
0	i would n't if i were you . the food is absolutely horrible and expensive . bland , soggy crab puffs , the shrimp tempura had more tempura than shrimp . i 'm not sure it even had a 1/4 of a shrimp . no rice served with the curry . the best part of the meal was thr fortune cookie .	779
0	went in friday the 22nd . two of us went to the bar , threw some money in the machines , not busy at all and literally watched the bartenders walk by us 10 times each before we finally flagged one down , and practically begged them to get us a drink . one kitchen guy actually brought me a chair ( the only person that actually acknowledged us or talked to us ) because the one was missing ) . he 's the only reason this review even gets one star . needless to say after finally getting our first drink after 20 minutes we left and will not be back . please promote within and get rid of these bartenders with zero personality .	1520
0	i went into this shop asking about if they can replace a fuel filter on my chevy malibu . the answer i got from the shop attendant was : `` you will have to replace the entire fuel pump assembly with the total cost of $ 770 . '' lol i 'm very much offended that they tried to con me . i had my fuel filter replaced before for $ 70 but all of a sudden it costs $ 770 ? i 'm never going back to this shop again , i do n't do business with con artists .	2552
0	very disappointing , bought deserts for a dinner party realizing they all with no exception taste 2-3 old , stale crime and dry very dry and old pastry . not doing that again .	1160
1	i can not believe i am doing this review after a miserable marriage with rogers . the staff at this location are tremendous ! very helpful , personable , professional young guy helped me out . great customer service and interpersonal skiĺls . solid place . but i still hate their call centre of hell .	323
0	smells like a mold & ashtray combo , the grave bartender is slow and the mood is boring . i live close and wanted to check the place out when it opened a couple months ago . first & last time here . one thing that was nice were the bathrooms , very nice touch on the blackout bathrooms & also smells better than the bar . if the rest of the bar was that same color and smelled just as good , you would have yourself a fine establishment . would n't take much .	86
1	these guys are the real deal ! everyone was so awesome , from wendy in the office , to our designer brandon , and our installer raffa . brandon customized a shower door for us , the aesthetic is perfect . 2 weeks later raffa installed it ( in like , 45 minutes ! ! ! ) it is a beautiful upgrade that will add considerable value to our home . i will highly recommend crystal clear view glass at every opportunity , and will use them again if i ever need anything glass !	934
0	i ordered several subs for the construction guys building our pool . the subs had very little meat and vegetables . mostly bread and blah . very disappointed because i usually like jimmy johns . they just do n't care about to go/delivery orders at this location . you do n't realize how sucky they are until the driver is gone . last time i order from there .	1340
0	i pick up food orders from here all the time , and every time i ask for something extra light ranch or salsa this place demands that they charge extra . normally i am picking up 6 to 7 item orders . they clearly got their money on a large order but apparently the walls will fall down if they give away a ranch or salsa . places like this are the worse	717
0	ordered a grilled cheese sub , the menu says it comes with tomato and fresh basil . food was delivered and i received a sub with melted american cheese . period . also ordered a cold sub , which was fine . both were supposed to come with chips and a pickle spear , according to the menu , so i ordered one small order of fries . both subs were delivered with fries so we ended up with way more than we wanted , and having spent a few extra bucks on an order of fries that was unnecessary . i wo n't be ordering again .	459
0	my husband and i have to loyal to this place since they opened . now the last two times we have dropped it off for a tire rotation , i go to pick it up and it has n't been done . my time is too important to me to bring my car here again . do n't waste your time .	2262
0	julie kramar saw me , and she was very rude to me . keep away .	1916
1	i was very nervous about how the floors were going to look but they did a beautiful job installing the auburn oak hardwood floors ! the installers moved all the furniture back after they cleaned up and were they very nice to work with also !	2611
1	i have been coming in here for many years now . what is not to love~ ! i think the food is pretty fantastic ! pizza , really good . wings , excellant ! salads are freash and flavorful . like how easy it is to call in an order , pick it up at the window and go . good staff , the decor is a bit old fashion in an 80 ; s way . but , in the grand scheme it means nothing . i like the food here so i will be back many times ! lots of parking in the lot as well .	1482
0	i got a very cranky private message regarding this review , telling me that karma will come for me ... i guess someone did n't like that i complained about the girl that answered nascair 's phone . maybe it was her ? maybe it was her boyfriend ? maybe it was a supervisor ? who knows ? but what i do know is that i 'm glad i thanked her , hung up and called the next hvac company that was recommended to me .	730
1	this review is based on gambling only . specially crap table . las vegas club and plaza are the only hotels downtown that have the fire bet . played craps here , and hit 4 fire bets . best place to play craps specially if your a hot shooter . dancing dealers also . its great to watch dancing dealers and throwing dice blind . did n't play any slot machines .	3630
1	great food for an affordable price . the broth was flavorful and yummy so were the noodles . the food also came so fast although the restaurant was pretty busy .	790
0	we waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive . food quality was well below average and certainly not what i have come to expect from steak n shake . onion rings were lukewarm and soggy ( certainly not hot and crispy ) and steak burgers were just ok ( mostly bun ) . milkshake was good though , and came right away after ordering . server was pleasant , apologetic for the wait , but inattentive .	1068
1	despite is ridiculous name , it is a great club . really good mash up music-ciara meets grandmaster flash meets madonna 's hung up meets britney meets rick springfield 's `` jesse 's girl '' then eurythmics in 5 minutes or less , well done dj vice , well done . decent drinks . this place gives hetero clubs a good name though my sister & i agreed there was n't a good looking guy in the place . so give another star if your hooking up depends on alcohol and good lighting .	3596
1	i love that this location is right off the freeway so it is easy off , easy on . i have to say that i have never been inside . so i can only say that the times that i have been here there has been no line for the atm , they are always in working order and the area is always clean . the turn to get to the atm can be a little strange if you are entering on the rainbow side of the building . you almost have to drive in and then make a u-turn , unless there are no cars in the parking lot .	12
1	where can you go to hear great jazz , drink super cocktails , be served by very special people and listen to great live performers of american jazz ? andy 's wine bar , that 's where . also , there is no cover charge . the menu provides many options fo all .	1261
1	one wireless specially carl my to go guy when i have problem with my iphone reasonable price , courteous and friendly staff . love , love this place . great place for computers and phones fix .	2930
1	i come for asthma care and honestly it has never been under control until i came to this place they really take their time to explain why they do what they recommend because they know it works . the whole staff and providers are so friendly and go above and beyond to relieve your symptoms . if you are looking for a fast and efficient practice i highly recommend this place as they are super busy but know what they are doing when it comes to allergies and asthma .	1964
0	very slow and poor service . waited to get my room for over 3 hours and they keep telling me it will be ready shortly .	1859
1	they are great for families and all ages . specials every night of the week after like 8/9pm to close . always friendly and sometimes super busy . constant upgrading the last couple years . i would recommend then first for the area to go bowling . and the arcade has gotten much better with like 30 games on card swipes .	2235
0	he put me on a med after only seeing me for 5 minutes . then 6 month later i was severely depressed and tried to kill myself . do not see this crook .	3928
0	i like the 90s decor , but ... almost $ 6 for a simple pretzel ( no salt or cheese ) . my husband and i played 4 games and it cost us $ 57 . what the heck , it 's almost a luxe to bowl now ! music sucks too !	2235
0	i was very disappointed . i ordered smoked turkey and it tasted like some packaged lunch meat . the server explained nothing and i had to ask for lettuce and tomato and mayo as the sandwich came dry with just meat and bread . service was so slow . they then charged me extra for the tomato on my turkey sandwich without telling me ! unreal . tomatoes were not fresh at all . i will never come here again .	1380
0	very slow service ( 1:30 ) . ordered appetizer , never came . food order took 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches and chicken fingers . and they were cold when they are supposed to be hot . wo n't be coming here again . if i could give it no stars i would .	534
0	absolutly terrible experience ! ! sloppy job on nails , bad costumer service , and waited for 2 hours . once i finally got seated the nail lady rushed me and then continued to finish a previous clients one nail that broke , which took longer for her to do than my entire set of nails .	1288
1	went to this walmart to pick up some money from money center . the lady at the counter gave my money to someone else , even checked the gals id which did not have my name on it obviously . so , that was low key a disaster , but the manager fixed the error immediately . could have been worst . that experience gets half a star but the manager was pretty cool and chill dude so he gets the four stars .	2913
1	this was my first time getting my nails done . what a great experience ! my friend and daughter and i all wanted something done but had trouble finding a place that stayed open past 7 . we called eva and the nice gentleman said he 'd stay open past closing time to take care of us . great price too , i got a full acrylic gel set plus the mani/pedi for my daughter for the price of just my set at the previous place we checked out . very happy with how everything turned out and we will definitely be back !	1272
0	i would have to say that this is one of the worst hotels ive visited . the room 's bathtub was chipping away and there was cracks in the lighting fixtures , this is not something expected of from a so called 4 star hotel ! the worst part of the experience was the customer service . i hope it had nothing to do with not being able to speak french .	1671
1	the customer service at this store is the best . jimmy knows how to take care of customers . thank you again pep boys henderson !	2960
1	for late night pizza this is perfect ! do n't trust google directions . it 's the first entrance north of fatburger in the same space as el dorado .	543
0	the store is great ! the reason i 'm giving it the stars it deserves is because of the deli and bakery at his location , the customer service from these two is absolutely unacceptable ! i order fried chicken last week and when i went to pick it up it took about 25 minutes just to get asked `` what i needed '' add another 10 minutes just so they can find what i ordered ! they need for employees to work the deli	2220
1	i have purchased games a ps3 and a ps4 pro here and the service was always helpful to find multiplayer games kids can play together .	3530
1	best service . best price . if you 've got teenagers constantly breaking their idevices you need to go there .	3560
0	in the past i spent about $ 500.00 here a month . one day upon entering the store heading toward the produce a `` produce person '' approached me and said '' i like it wet `` . he made no other comments to me or anyone else . this seemed very strange.. whole foods needs to re-instruct their employees to not annoy the customers unless they want to keep losing business .	433
0	this place is awful . the doctor has no time for her patients , spoke to me so fast i could hardly understand her and when i went to clarify what she said she seemed annoyed . i would n't recommend this place at all . i went on to find a much better dermatologist office , and i would not recommend this place , not if you want someone to spend time with you , and thoroughly explain your concerns .	2526
0	sighhh . a year after a disappointing dinner at the restaurant we had finally convinced ourselves that we should give their sicilian style pizza a chance . we ordered a mushroom pie and garlic bread . i wish i could say i loved it and we would order again , but unfortunately not the case . the crust was greasy and dense but most upsetting , had no flavor . the cheese ( as you can see in the picture ) had a more plasticy/chewy texture rather than creamy . the garlic bread was dry and oily . sorry guys . there are too many other places that we need to try before going back , again .	423
1	best shawarma i 've ever had ! ! ! my mouth is watering just thinking about it right now damn it ! amazing super friendly ppl work here too so that 's always a plus .	1206
1	today i took my newly adopted yellow lab in for a standard wash , condition package . cost was less than $ 30 . i 've never taken a pet in for grooming services but lawrence would n't let me wash him myself . he was a stray picked up by the county before i adopted him so i know nothing of his history . he came out happy and looking very good . they definitely met my expectations and i will use them again	3094
0	if you 're a movie theater in a casino , either have a bar inside the theater or allow patrons of the casino to bring in outside drinks . absolutely ridiculous .	2000
1	cheap groceries , decent selection ( unless you 're into seafood ; that 's quite limited , though it did expand a little bit in the last few years ) , clean store . great for budget grocery shopping , especially for items on sale . i tend to buy the bulk of my groceries here , and then supplement with fancier products from farmer 's markets and specialty shops . you do have to bring a quarter to grab the cart , which i often forget , but it does keep the lot neat and tidy and the prices low , so i ca n't complain too much . hey , it 's a no frills !	2276
0	the pharmacy here is constantly a mess . slow service , whether it be inside or in the drive thru . the speaker outside does not operate half the time either . be prepared to wait forever for a prescription to be filled and if you find yourself lucky enough to get it filled , hopefully they bill the correct insurance and not one of your old , expired plans . also attitude and s general unwillingness to show empathy of any kind are job requirements to work here .	1641
0	scheduled manicure and pedicure one day . came in , was seated and was told to wait . waited for over 30 minutes , went back to the front desk , they said they forgot about me . i was nice about it , i guess that happenes ( not at the good places , but still happens ) . at the end was n't even offered a discount ... pretty shitty move .	154
1	have visited many sell my stuff canada sales over the past few years and have always come away with a great new item and a positive experience from dealing with the staff . i have purchased a few vintage and designer handbags from their sales ( for a fraction of what they cost retail ) and am always excited to check out the sales to see what treasures i might find next ! highly recommended .	3564
1	great service : fast friendly and on par . i get that it 's a dunkin ' donuts but it had 1.5 stars unnecessarily . 5 *****	3759
0	went there sunday afternoon at 1245pm ! we were the 3rd order in line . at 13:25 , the owner came to us and asked if we were order # 47 , our order were sitting on the counter for the pass 5 mins ! unbelievable ! the girl who took our order actually looked at the bags several times ! in my opinion , its not a good burger , the patty was super dry , outside of the patty was abit burnt too ! for the price of fresh cook burger i had a much higher expectation !	1337
1	this place is a hidden gem . i 've heard of this place but never really took the time to stop . this place is pretty authentic . the decor is even authentic . the place is small and the tables are close together . i decided to get ramen with the miso broth . it was savory and delicious . it was filling and just plain good ! my husband got the sushi platter and he was pretty pleased with it . he said it was very fresh . overall , this place is good ! please note they do not do any substitutions !	1
1	we bought our new iphones here recently and raedell helped us . he was awesome ! great attitude , friendly , knowledgeable , and took his time . we will definitely continue buying our electronics here . thank you , raedell , keep up the great work ! !	494
1	so cheap . went with my sister and no one was there ! such a perk for homebodies like us . will be back to play !	451
0	charged us twice for one order and said they could n't do anything about it , never paid us back they basically just stole the money from us	1308
0	everytime i come in here it 's the same story , 1 cook , no-one hosting , and you 're waiting 20-40 minutes for your food . the doors always have fingerprints on them and it feels very ghetto .	1504
0	found this place on yelp looking for a cheap taco joint near asu . i was quite disappointed with the food i received . i ordered three carne aside tacos with rice and beans . the rice and beans were tasty but my tacos were nothing special at all . they were n't even served with cilantro or onion ( a taco necessity ) , instead it was sprinkled with some old brown lettuce and diced tomatoes . also each taco came to be three dollars which is pretty expensive for the type and quality of the little tacos . i wo n't be coming back .	562
1	update . i 've tried them again . loved the fries dipped in bbq sauce . i got a grilled chicken sandwich was good , but a little dry . plenty of lettuce , the tomato was fresh . the honey mustard was good . i did n't care much for the milkshakes , but they were ok. for half price during happy hour they are a good deal . i also tried the apple slices with caramel dip - excellent side . the lemonade was great - not too strong , but i think a bit more sugar would be a good idea . i went through the drive through - very quick service . the workers were very nice .	998
0	give a start because there is no negative rate . my employee has been stranded for two hours we requested the tow before 6pm it 's now 7:46pm and they have n't arrive to the location to tow the car . talked to john over the phone . rude , would not even let me talk he kept talking over me saying the guy should arrive to the location any minute now . ridiculous ! ! ! !	2010
0	we thought we recognised some of the pastries from a shop in chinatown that we liked and decided to pick some up . the buns were much greasier than what we had and lacked any flavour . we tossed every single one of them , they were all inedible .	2211
0	they really need to have someone who answers the phones who understands and speaks the english language better . having to repeat myself 3 & 4 times is not cool . i told what i needed .	3282
0	completely terrible steak was inedible . service was not much better . would not recommend ! ! also fries are not frites opening a bag of frozen fries from sysco does n't make frites ... shame on bonfyre ! ! ! ! second try is still a tasteless trip to food hell ! should of found a sizzler .	951
1	tea lattes are always a personal favorite for me at the coffee bean . of course , at this particular location , you 've got to take advantage of the 10 % discount when showing your unlv student id . if i had a more portable laptop , i 'd definitely come here to lounge more often because of the nice atmosphere in here . i wanted to try the pumpkin latte today , but by 11:30am , they had already run out of them . darn ! however , the winter dream tea latte i had instead was great , and it warmed me up instantly , considering it was really cold outside today .	3238
1	cool , they have a free train you can ride that goes through the whole mall ! they have tons of shops and adequate parking . the food court is n't as big as it could be , but it works . the patrons here are a step down from fashion square but a step up from metro center . enjoy .	2815
1	just came back from a rainy day wine tour , we were very hungry and cold , as we walk towards a restaurant that we found at yelp , here comes these big chinese words on the window of restaurant p.m. `` 粉 麵 飯 '' , take one look at the menu and decided to go inside . we were not disappointed . we had three very authentic cantonese dishes and they were delicious .	1016
1	went in to get my car 's ac charged while i went to the gym . i was quoted at few other places a $ 25 ac check fee , $ 25 hookup fee , and between $ 30-35/lb of freon . freddy 's waived the cheek fee and was only $ 25/lb . plus kevin had helped my fiancee on his motorcycle before and gave him a $ 10 off coupon then so we could use that too . ended up being less than $ 70 instead of close to $ 150 like some other places . great people ! great service !	2198
0	went in here looking for a tent , they were all over priced , missing stuff or broken . it looked like a bunch of inflated yard sale items . ooh and the food items looked gross . like how could it be legal to sale old damaged food ? that stuff should 've been given away . then again idk if i would trust it .	692
0	the yoga room is great -- nice new floor , lots of windows . the teacher was about average . but the locker room is very crowded , there are n't hot water taps on the sinks ( ! ) , no towels or blower to dry one 's hands , and -- and this is a deal-breaker for me -- there are advertisements on the bathroom stall doors ! yick ! ! not exactly the calm , relaxed space that i look for in a studio . if you go -- and it 's a fine studio , if you do n't mind the issues listed above -- plan extra time to find parking . it was a challenge for me .	2472
0	took my saturn vue in for work on an electrical problem . they gave me my vehicle back with unsafe brakes ! ! ! almost got killed on i17 after i left to go to work they tied up the parts with zip ties ! i took my vehicle to a referred mechanic and he solved they problem with brakes and electrical issue . dont go here for auto repair ! they dont know what they are doing ! now i am trying to get a refund and the manager is arguing with me about what caused the problem ! ! omg just do n't go here for anything !	3405
0	there was no line . ordered a bubble tea and had to wait for 20 minutes . the person did n't not start making it until we asked and looked mad . the drink was also too sweet . would not come again .	3080
1	we came to see the backstreet boys last night and it was such a good show ! while we were waiting for the doors to open we were talking to some of the ushers ( jenny , tamesha , and wendy ) and they were very friendly and helpful ! they even kept us entertained while waiting . they helped make our night even better ! yay for backstreet boys being back !	2879
0	not sure why i keep deciding to come back here . rice is rock hard and has no flavor , along with most of the other food on the half-empty buffet trays . $ 10.50 for a plate of stale food and a drink that they forget to refill ? no thanks .	1575
1	i 've been going here for a while now and i am a girl who is obsessed with her hands . i get reuglar acrylic and i have to say tina is the best ! if i go there and tina is n't in there i will post pone my fill in . i highly recommend this place . even after my nails have grown out i still get a lot of compliments .	1256
1	thank you dr c and staff for all of your amazing services and care through out the years ! ! !	1855
0	the food is horrible ! we ordered our food and in less then 5 minutes we were served . burnt pancakes , breakfast potatoes were plain and hard , sausage had a bad flavor , bacon over cooked , toast was chewy . the entire meal tasted like it was out of a frozen breakfast meal box that was heated in a microwave . hostess and waitress were nice . the quality and size portions are not good but i guess we got what we paid for ... .. cheap crap food .	672
1	i bought a new elantra over the weekend from jay schaeffer at san tan hyundai . he was polite , charming , knowledgeable , and never tried to oversell us on what we did n't need/want . he was patient and checked several companies ( usaa and costco ) for better deals , and he worked well with the finance guy to get us the best interest rates . from my research , i know we got a great deal . highly recommended ! !	3041
1	this is a great petsmart with caring employees . i 'm always impressed with how patient and friendly they are . the prices vary but they have great clearance on toys and outfits quite often . the grooming salon is fabulous . i take both my dogs there for hair and nails , theirs get more attention than mine : )	3094
0	am i the only one that went into this place sober realizing that the 1.5 '' diameter × 5 '' long bar of ice took up 3/5 of the glass ? wow i 'm glad i looked at my son 's honors geometry notes to figure out that we totally got ripped off ! and thanks to the dj every song he spun had the n word in it . classy ! not ! ! ! ! !	2513
1	we love their thin crust pizza and are sad the location on gilbert and germann closed !	1451
0	this place was not great . quality of items not up to par with what i 'm used to at other savers locations . i never leave empty handed at a thrift store , and if i do , it 's because i figure i 've been shopping too much lately ( but have something in mind i would get otherwise ) . this place had absolutely nothing that interested me whatsoever . i was so disappointed ! i may go back today and give it another shot , but this was more full of junky items than any other thrift store i 've ever been to .	128
1	went to a bridal shower here today . food & service was wonderful . we had a salad bar with choice of chicken or salmon to top it off . beautiful views , great decor & comfortable atmosphere .	3106
1	after reading various positive reviews here on yelp , i scheduled a morning appointment . naheed , the owner , welcomed me as her first customer of the day . it was my first time getting eyebrow threading done . she was quick , professional and approachable , and made me feel welcome and comfortable . we actually also did a wax as well . which was thorough . it 's best to get an appointment , as there were walk-ins waiting after i was finished . thanks again naheed , i plan to come back again when i 'm due for one of your services again , you deserve 5 stars .	1729
0	worst moving company you can possibly hire . careless with your furnishings . disorganized , could careless about you or any of your personal belongings . i 've moved 6 times with the same furnishings , this move damaged countless things , broken legs , scratches , dents , latches ripped off , racked antiques , just ca n't say enough bad things !	2353
0	customer service at this dealership needs improvement after you purchase a vehicle . how to follow up with a customers need to be incorporated in the training process . my salesman was nice but after you leave that desk i would shop around at another dealership .	3065
0	had the most extrutating visit here on thanksgiving sunday . barely anyone in the restaurant but the service was so slow . food was fine but ca n't get over how slow the service was . got there for 6 pm service and did n't leave until 8:50 pm . honestly every time my wife and i hear that we are invited here , we dread due to the consistently slow and unattentive service .	163
1	i absolutely love this store ! this year i decorated my table for christmas i bought red place mats and small christmas stockings to hold silverware go to the album to view my table decorations .	2240
1	this is a self serve gas station ... .not to much to yelp about . unfortunately the lines are always crazy long ... ... i use to find if i went later in the day it was n't so busy but for some reason it always is now ... .i recently realized it opens at 6am during the week so i went one morning after work around 7:30am & there were still long lines ... .. if you want to pay the price for their less expensive gas prices then be prepared to wait in long lines ... ... ... ..	2172
1	i am so grateful for their help recently . saved the day when my old 2005 ls430 overheated when taking my wife to medical appointment nearby from prescott home . they reacted well to my unsheduled visit and helped us out . yes , costly but worth it . thank you folks	3065
1	was traveling from out of town , and got suggested to go to crow 's nest . crow 's nest was booked up for the entire day and they told me to check out king 's landing . little bit of wait but was able to walk in and get a nice clean cut . barber was attentive to detail and the location was a nice place to hang out for an hour . highly recommend this place !	3239
1	this is the very best customer service i have ever received ! from the online level-of-service options with no hidden costs , to the efficient & effective service , splish splash could be charging so much more ! in addition to the expected `` regular '' service , our tech identified a potentially expense filter problem and with his expertise , all it costs us was a washer ! letting us know the basket was cracked and getting it replaced ( again a nominal charge ) cleaned up the pool surface almost immediately ! if you want personal , high-quality pool service at a reasonable charge , splish splash is a premier pool service company !	3421
1	it 's no secret that i love ice cream . this ice cream is very lovable . a yummy waffle cone dipped in white chocolate and sprinkles with cake batter ice cream with cookie dough , oreos and fudge ? someone tell my mom i 've gone to heaven earlier than expected . she got a brownie sundae that was also fabulous . sit outside in the courtyard and take in the nice view of the fountain . chill , relax and enjoy these delicious treats !	3537
0	bad doctors , bad pt staff . the doctors are a mob that want to make money . dr. zoltan was curt and weird . dr. armendariz was a jerk , period . the pt staff does not do astem . astem is a physical approach to fixing an ankle . instead , all i did was strengthen to no avail . bobby from texas was the only hustler of that group in tempe , the rest were either not knowledgeable , casual and not willing to go the extra mile .	2755
1	i 'd have to say that when i look and shop for quality , the employees are very attentive to me and also carry on a better dialogue compared to hm and zara .	485
1	had a great couple massage ! located in a cute little house ! libby and emily were fantastic , thank you very much . definitely worth the visit . if you 're debating on a spa try carmel day spa and saloon . they provide a lot of other services like hair , nails and spa stuff . i 'm a guy so i 'm not sure about those services . not sure about the other reviews but we had a great experience .	3554
1	dr zedek has been a big help to me . his advice has been beneficial and he switched my medications and it has helped improve my mental health and my enjoyment of life . scheduling is very easy and despite having a busy patient-load , he tries to stay on time and get you in at the scheduled time .	3928
1	just an awesome experience ! you walk into an office that is bright with good energy , a more than friendly and intelligent staff that also educates the patient . my appointment was for my son but i will personally start going here myself . we are new to the area and the dental office i had gone to for myself was not the greatest experience so i am thrilled to begin a new dental relationship ! ! ! !	1452
1	best uv tans and spray booths ! always clean , affordable and quick . love this place : )	3115
1	love the new interior ! ! ! ! ! reclining seats . hardwood floors . excellent . this is way better than the old style setups . willoughby commons has done it up right ! ! ! ! !	2671
0	terrible office employees : i ca n't give this apartment complex any stars my daughter was forced to move out in december because of the suppose it barking dog issue . she chose a buyout option and then was never given any security deposit back and told the apartment was a mess five of us spent eight hours cleaning that place top to bottom . darlene , toni , shannan , and dan all have lied and manipulated . please do n't even look at this place . they 've also had many flooding issues and their apartments are dirty and not painted correctly and the carpet is very cheap .	1953
1	i 've visited this location twice now . once around veteran 's day 2017 when i was in charlotte for the nc renaissance festival and most recently the day after christmas 2017 while visiting my brother-in-law . i have no complaints . both times we were seated in reasonable amount of time , received excellent service and the food was well prepared . i 'm sure on future visits to charlotte , assuming we stay near this location , we 'll dine here again .	1549
0	terrible clientele ... i am a middle aged woman and was asked to get off weight machine that was not being used by a 20 year old thug and then screamed at and sworn at by his scary friends and not a single person nor employee did anything about it even though the guy has done it before . not enough gym equipment at all and the classes are generally useless except for spinning and a couple of randomly timed insanity classes . it is a true meathead gym posing as upscale . will leave for one in port credit	2762
1	great service ! so i came in the rental area slightly intoxicated and picked a fight with the guy at the desk . : ( it was my fault , his hands were tied , but both gentlemen were super friendly and we ended being taken care of very well . all in all not a bad experience !	3129
0	everything was nice that night , friends , food , music and wine selection . they done taketh it away by letting julie the waitress work there nice nasty tude . she was spoil more so than the grapes . julie , get a grip on your tude and not the money	263
1	the store was one of the larger ace hardware store that i have been in but the staff made the difference . to a of people being helpful made it a fast trip !	2697
1	where else can you see pouters , pet a wallaby and eat roasted corn ? the fair is the bomb , as it were . my dear love and i went one afternoon . the weather was glorious , the crowds were light , and there was plenty to see and do . we spent a little while in the body exhibit which is a little to much for me but others certainly seemed to like learning about the body including my dear love . i love the fair and we had a good time .	2076
0	so this place is great if you want to get pills for all sorts of problems . when it comes down to being a doctor , they are the worst . miss diagnosed 3 times and let alone the prices for all their treatments . on top of that , they charge for paperwork that needs to be filled out for employer 's when you get sick . over all , my doctor now . is not a doctor at all ! ! ! ! ! !	609
0	came here for a 1 hr reflexology massage . lady at the front kept trying to convince me that i only wanted a 1/2 hr foot massage . place was n't busy at all . in fact 4 of the workers to include the lady that was checking me in were sitting around chatting and playing with their phones . i ended up just leaving and going somewhere else for my 1 hour reflexology massage . do n't plan on ever trying this place out again .	2014
1	michelle is amazing ! ! she is so knowledgeable and personable ! my skin has definitely benefited from the facials i 've gotten . michelle was also super understanding when i had to reschedule due to weather . i highly recommend mireji ! i would never go anywhere else !	750
1	delicious spring rolls and lunch combos . friendly staff . great for lunch or dinner . free delivery within a few miles .	779
0	i have been going here for years . the drs and nurses are great but everytime you go back you owe money for a previous visit . my kids do not have insurance . i called today to get them in for a cough . the woman couldnt give me a price . she said it could be between 32 & 175 dollars each kids . she was cocky in her vagueness . i asked if she could narrow it down & she said no . this will be my last trip ever to mesa pediatrics after years of going there .	3893
1	how do i love chipotle ? let me count the ways ... cilantro rice ( mmmm ) , fresh corn salsa , burritos as big as your head , prices easy on your wallet , funky industrial-aztec decorating scheme , and hip tunes on the stereo . beats the stuffin ' out of the usual fast food joints . who would 've guessed that chipotle is owned by mcdonalds ?	1328
0	new to the area , needed a place to get my nails done for my baby shower so thought i 'd try bally nails . i got a french manicure and the whole time i had to keep asking the lady doing my nails to fix them . eventually i just gave up and decided to except the fact that this place is just not worth my time . it 's been a week and my nails look like i 've had them done for a month or longer ! they look ferocious thanks bally nails ..	2830
1	this place is fully stocked with asian goodies . has a very nice produce section , although i 'd prefer my assi in good old illinois . but hey ... this is one of the very few places to buy asian groceries out in arizona ... nice selection of meats and canned items . they have an asian condiment selection galore ... every plum sauce , soy sauce and hosien you can think of in multipel brands ! ! ! ! also has a bakery and bubble tea counter	3269
0	these guys were terrible . they offer a groupon for $ 29 , but if you do n't realize that it is n't for synthetic oil , they wo n't offer a rebate on the groupon when you get there and then they up charge you another $ 50 . one employee said people needed to learn about there cars before coming to them . he also said that he 'did n't give a shit ' if i posted a review , so here it is . another rep who dealt with a frustrated customer muttered 'the joys of dealing with the general public ' as he walked away from her . be very very very careful with these people .	2655
1	i 've shopped off and on at penney 's my whole life . this store is the best . excellent customer service from the manager all the way to the cashiers . i recently encountered a frustrating situation with an online order , i called the national customer service number and it was a 13 minute wait . i called this ahwatukee store and the assistant manager took over and had the issue fixed immediately with extremely satisfying results . they have my loyalty .	3633
1	the bartender , manny made me his specialty martini 's ! the most awesome bartender i 've ever met ! if you are here at aria , look for manny and ask for his specialty martini 's . cucumber martini , strawberry martini & blueberry martini .	3457
0	we had the lunch special and it was not real seafood . imitation everything . even the salmon looked too red for it not to have been soaked with petroleum ( red dye ) . yuck . i want to vomit it all out .	198
0	this restaurant has potential . however , the managers are rude , petty , racist , biased , and indifferent . i invited my family to this restaurant to celebrate three family birthdays . to my dismay , one family member was completely disrespected due to the fact that he could not eat the sushi that he mistakenly ordered . the manger tried to force him to pay for food he could not eat . she did n't offer to prepare an alternative dish for him . she was rude and obnoxious toward him and said , `` do n't ever come here again . ''	890
0	plain and simply overrated and expensive . i will not be go no to this place again . for what you pay for a hot dog you can buy all the ingredients yourself and make multiple ones or just go buy a whole meal .	1566
1	i just had the best service from stephanie and chris . they had patience and did my tattoo just how i wanted it . chris was so soft with his technique but quick . in and out ! thank you ! will be coming back ! -tofu booty .	1658
1	nice spot . popped in for a quiet lunch at the bar- good ipa , decent food but most notable for the great and friendly service . thanks ! !	670
0	very disappointed with the service . called many times and never got anyone to come back to me . called and was put in hold and no one would come back on the phone . you can never get anyone to help	558
0	warning this is not a strip club we walked in n there were no strippers we sat for 1hr n still no strippers dancing . this place is a fraud n rip off do not be fooled . i spoke to the manager and he was an even bigger dumb ass for believing that its ok for a strip club to not have strippers . horrible	1779
0	yet another disappointing trip to this store . this time it was the pharmacy . omg , what a hassle ! each time i say 'never again ' . hurry up sprouts at 7th ave. and osborn ! ! !	2316
1	we love shabu shabu and this store has been put jackpot when it comes to buy all the ingredients and vegies -pots etc ... . we love how the vegie prices are so cheap and the produce is always fresh . we always have such great experience coming here . love it !	2670
1	ordered delivery and it got here super fast , which was surprising because it was raining like crazy . food was great . got chicken fingers w/fries and breaded mushrooms ( and there were lots of them ) . only minor complaint is i wish it came with more ranch to dip in as there were only 2 and that was n't enough for all the mushrooms and 5 fingers .	987
0	hmm no thanks . tiny little aquarium with one cool tank of medium sized sharks and otherwise a bunch of flotsam is not worth my $ 20 . go to the zoo if this is your sort of thing . or better yet , columbus 's zoo , which has an aquarium many many times cooler than this one .	706
0	thr staff was really rude when we asked for a reschedule . so rude that my 8 yr old refused to back to the swimming class . and they still kept charging my credit card for 2 months . when i asked for refund they refused . never going back there ! !	2360
0	and now the scorpions have arrived . worst place i 've ever lived ! more bugs then i 've ever seen	3700
0	response is a lie . the reason the groupon was expired was that they ignored all correspondence until the expiration date had passed . i called several times and the line never picked up . left several messages that were never returned . finally after the expiration date had passed ( which i had previously given in the messages i left ) i got a call back . my groupon was for a mechanic to come to my house . the person responding to my call said i would have to bring the car to them . the car was not operational , hence the reason why i purchased an at home service .	1360
1	stopped in for some panda while passing through . pretty typical panda . the service was good . the food was good . place was clean . no complaints	1495
1	psls is an amazing practice . from 2007-2016 i was an aba therapist for children with autism . during that time i observed multiple speech and language therapy sessions at different practices and i can honestly say that psls is the best one out there !	1712
1	shout out to rich at the front desk ! were always happy to see him and all the other employees for that matter . this gym may not be the nicest or have the best equipment but it gets the job done and we 've made great relationships and really feel apart of the community since joining back in march 2014 . we 've been long time members of different y 's across az and tx but there is definitely something special about this one ! giving 4 stars since they could use various equipment additions and improvements . all in all a great place and i recommend .	3922
1	i thought that makers & finders was strictly a coffee shop , but after stopping by they actually had a variety of breakfast/brunch sized meals . i ordered an avocado toast expecting it to be light , but to my surprise it was seriously very filling . on top of the avocado was a fried egg and cherry tomatoes . it was definitely a lot better than i expected and above average when it comes to avocado toast . it also comes with potatoes on the side , which went perfectly with the meal . it 's definitely a great stop for a break while shopping in the downtown summerlin area .	1332
0	this place has a lot of money hungry ... . greedy bartenders . they charged me a 25 % gratuity when i met 6 friends for drinks at the bar . we were standing ... .no dinner ... . quick to slam me . total bs . drinks are wayyyyyyyyyyy overpriced ... . and they screw you . they do n't care about this but i wo n't come back ... .. you should n't go either ... . if you have to go ... . order your drinks and pay cash to avoid getting ripped off by the bartenders . earn your tip ... .. do n't steal it ... ...	2513
0	this place closes between 3 to 5:30pm everyday ! they are so lazy , they do n't even bother to turn the open sign off . really , is this such a high-end restaurant that we are n't worthy of getting served outside core meal times ? this place just opened up , so if the management running the place had half a brain , they would n't turn away customers so that their lazy cooks and servers can take their afternoon nap .	943
0	do n't stop here if you have a meeting to get to . i would be fine if this was my vacation and do n't mind waiting 10+ minutes for a simple cup of coffee . terrible service ! ! ! ! !	2397
1	i see a few negative reviews but i 've been a customer for over 7 years and have never had any problems .	1393
1	was definitely pleased with the level of service at the hilton toronto . i was greeted well by the front desk , who upgraded my suite as requested to the executive floor . they also ensured that my requests for a mini fridge and appropriate amenities were met . the room itself was stellar with two double beds , large desk and ample space to comfortably rest after a concert at the nearby molson amphitheatre . the front desk helped arrange transportation and have me a ring when my ride arrived . checkout was painless and while i did have vouchers for breakfast at the hotel . i was n't able to take advantage of it due to my schedule .	73
1	i went back to the store after getting an email from the owner and did get two trees from him that i was very happy with . he really does have the best prices in town and i will be getting more from him in the future .	3400
1	we left around 9am . that is apparently a pretty early time to leave seamless . a very memorable time here although i was a little out of it . good times all around . definitely would love to go back . limo rides to and from were even more memorable . i think the limo ride there is reimbursed with paid cover .	1754
1	service department gets 5 stars ! they are trustworthy and capable . they have taken great care of me for the past two years . i would not take my car anywhere else .	1424
0	i hate giving 1 star reviews , but its deserved . there is no return or exchange policy . all sales are final . buyer beware . i 'm stuck with a $ 2,000 bed that i can not use . i 've been to other ashley locations and always been very happy with the experience . this time , i wanted to make a large purchase since i just moved . the rest of the items was a good deal , and i am happy with it . but the bed is just the wrong one for me . i wish i would have known so i could have slept on it ( ha ! ) instead of make a decision that day .	3738
1	i came in today with my son and friends to try their matcha soft serve . it was sooo yummy ! ! the matcha has a lot of flavor , very smooth texture but not too sweet ! my son and i will definitely be back soon ! ! owner was super friendly and sweet ! !	2984
0	wings are not that good and if you 're having a special on wings , 1lb + pitcher..10 wings as opposed to 7 would be more of a deal considering they charge $ 20 ! no deal here folks ... atmosphere was a very uk bright lit pub , no music , very hum drum.. although it was a sunday	1064
1	good atmosphere . ok service . food and drinks are unique and good overall . would be better if have even more food selection . good place to hang out with friends .	344
1	just went back with a friend from so cal to get my ears pierced ( 8 gauge black glass plugs ) and get my labret taken back out to 14 gauge . dana and a.j . are the shit , and i refuse to get any piercings done in so cal , only here at htc . you would be well served to visit htc before anyone else .	2790
0	i 've eaten at probably 10 different cafe rios in the chain across nv and ut , and this is by far the worst location . they are not friendly at all , always run out of things , make things wrong ( i have to tell them how it 's supposed to be made . ) if you have 10 extra minutes , drive to the s. eastern location .	1365
0	the snacks are more expensive than the harkins ... and the seats look nice but are hella uncomfortable . i mean go-to-the-chiropractor uncomfortable .	2406
1	second visit was last night . i used online check in but still waited a bit . it was n't so bad . have you been to chandler regional ? there were some sick kiddos that were more urgent , way it goes . i was still before people w similar issues . once in it was fast and dr really listened about my injury . last visit was january and that dr was even better . had that awful fly ! they care for an urgent care . hate seeing such poor experiences ...	3698
0	i got a small pastry , which looks like some sort of napoleon . i forget the name but it has pistachio , sweet pastry cream and a cookie base . i was disappointed because it was so hard and stale ; nothing light or flaky . it was dry and i just did n't want to eat the rest of it . although there were little crunchy bits , i barely tasted any pistachio . rather indulge my calories elsewhere . tea was okay . rooibos has nice citrus note .	160
1	went here for a tan . never even knew it was there ... very clean hotel . not bad for a business trip .	3253
0	i frequented this coffee shop for about a month . i had heard negative things about the owner/manager 's attitude from others , but i like to give people a chance myself . after being glared at , talked to rudely , and ignored on several occasions , he finally was so rude to a friend and i that we are never going back there ( and neither are any of my other friends ) . if you do n't mind being treated like they are doing you a favor by deigning to serve you , then this place might be fine for you .	1807
1	had a bit of an issue with the the pick-up . but they resolved the issue and took care of me . other then that it was great !	2673
0	everything was amazing including lobby bar except construction that started right above our unit at 8am . my toddler was still sleeping from a 12 hour travel day . my husband called front desk only to be told it 's not above our unit which was incorrect lol then they offered us to move . my son is sleeping so no i do n't want to move . the noise continued . i wish they booked us in another room to begin with : ( . i love the hilton but this was certainly not the best stay ...	73
1	its starbucks ! available first thing before departing for your flight . they 're used to the long lines so everything moves fast .	1265
1	i was in a tight spot and needed some money to pay bills . i have never taken out a title loan or other high interest loan such as a pay day loan , so i was reluctant to borrow the money . they were very nice , but the process took almost 2 hours to complete . even with the 30-day interest free period on the loan , if you only pay the minimum amount ( which covers only the interest ) , the loan will never get paid off . i have no desire to purchase my car all over again , and that 's my incentive to get this loan paid in full as soon as possible !	3404
1	always manage a good time here . good steam and hot tub . the dark areas are fun and the sling can support a great amount of weight . nice guys and the roof is a sunny refuge . i will be back .	3345
1	this place has the best philly cheesesteak i 've every eaten . the employees are extremely nice as well .	777
0	i was going to give them a `` 1 '' star , but they did get half of my order right , and what they gave me by mistake was delicious .	2778
0	i tried making an order looking at their online lunch special menu and it was impossible . the lady on the phone was n't helpful at all . she admitted that their menu changed and that they did n't make shrimp with jasmine rice anymore . she then hung up on me and when i called back , i was hung up on again . if the menu has changed , please update your website . please also train your employees on better customer service .	1203
0	awful experience for my kids , never going back . back staff office very rude not only to my kids but myself as well . they made my children cry and very uncomfortable . i got to say for a kids friendly dentistry , their is nothing friendly about it . will be looking for a new pediatric dentist .	2596
1	my experience with move for less was great . my move was relatively small . moving my daughter into her own place . but we had a very heavy large steel school locker that needed to go up 2 flights of stairs , and around 2 tight corners . my movers joe gomez and mike ramirez handled the job like the professionals that they are . everyone i spoke to from this company was friendly and helpful . their rates are good and so is the service . i highly recommend move for less and will use them next time i have a move , large or small .	3159
1	nor sure why they have bad review but they are so nice , went three time and every time was able to find my needs and customers service is a bomb	758
0	i 'm a new customer with patricia , and she was highly recommended . she does great work when she feels like showing up for her appointments . she will confirm the appointment s then just disappear . i drive a great distance to go to her , but her being so unprofessional and not caring about her business . she has lost another customer .	2742
1	they have re-opened ! the new photographer , kalei , is amazing ! she is so sweet and patient . she is an excellent photographer too ! i loved the pictures of my 3 month old that she took . we will be returning !	1284
0	horrific experience . stay away ... so called manager , tracy brown and his knowledge of profanity was incredible . in 15 minutes , we were asked 3 times if we are serious about buying a car . when asked for his business card , was told to leave the showroom . very sad for the salesman who worked hard and lost out on the commission . we left and drove directly to camelback vw . in less than two hours we drove off with a 2013 passat at a lower price with great deal of positive customer service . only reason for me to take time and write this : i would not want anyone to go through this level of negativity .	2816
0	high end ice cream store ca n't even do a dip cone at 8:15 oh well heading to mcdonalds ...	1201
1	located right next to unlv , and is a place where many college students come for a cheap and well cooked meal . the food here is pretty good , but i heard the banh mi here is the best thing there is . the customer service here was really good as well , we came in a large group and they efficiently handled everything . they tried their best to help us out and were very humorous , the waiter was really nice and communicative . i would recommend this place to others !	673
0	worst ever customer service i came early and they said even if i bought my ticket i could n't go in till the time it started a bunch of incompetent workers ...	611
1	friendly and very helpful staff . i buy all my dogs necessities here and he loves coming into the store	3433
0	update - now national stone is lying to american express telling them that i have the granite ( or actually marble ) .	2090
1	i walked around this new town to me in downtown toronto canada looking for a good pub and ran into this cozy old spot . to my surprise this place reminded me of a san francisco old school pub with two stories , live music in the back and an upstairs different vibe . the employees greeted me and sat me down , recommend a great burger and local ipa . i then walked up stairs to the second bar with a whole different vibe of all ages just relaxing , mingling and i can here the different accents and languages of conversations , very cool ! if your a beer drinker and love ipa try the local amsterdam brewery selection .	1091
1	do n't forget to go shopping at fry 's food store . we got two free passes to the fair already got ta shop some more to get two more .	2076
1	great chili cheese naan , chili paneer , gobi 65 . we asked for spicy entrees and they delivered . too many restaurants wo n't risk giving a customer a really spicy dish when asked . origin was n't shy and created super flavorful and spicy chicken vindaloo , lamb , and a paneer tikka masala .	600
1	excellent care . knowledgeable , caring staff . quick in and out , saved my friend a trip to the er .	3698
0	boring . aging hipsters looking bothered . the coffee is bland , as is the decor .	2504
0	after enrolling our child we could n't get him out of this place fast enough . revolving door of low grade staff , and the owner is n't far off her self .	3582
1	great breakfast today and shaleen 's service was great ! supper friendly hostess and manager checking out too !	672
0	this place is awful- bad customer service , horrible prices ... call a local family owned company- do n't fall for their ridiculous advertisements ! just because they 're all over the tv screen does n't mean they are a great company ! awful experience ... i wo n't ever call them again !	2444
0	totally not helpful bad customer service the high school girls that work there are rude .	2039
1	cant lie these are some pretty awesome lashes , got them about a week ago and they 're still perfect ! as long as they stay like this i 'll be going there from now on !	2148
0	the most expensive market around and they never have their samples available . i do not have the experience of being treated with respect or appreciated . i dread shopping here and am actively seeking and alternative market to shop at .	433
0	i would defiantly confirm pricing before you have your nails done . their menu said services were one price but when i went to pay it was $ 10 more . i did n't want to argue but could n't help but wonder if it had anything to do with him asking me where i lived . the actual result of the work was not great either . i went because i knew that they took walk ins quickly , but i think moving forward , i will make appointments somewhere else .	1099
1	full circle is great ! i have gone to several other car washes and always been somewhat disappointed . even their $ 3 car wash is awesome they clean your car before you even go in and it comes out spotless ! their service is amazing . robert the gentleman at the pay center is so kind and gracious . he delivers excellent customer service . full circle you have a customer for life thank you for the great service	3899
1	karma just moved to a new location on sunset , i 'm so glad they did they 're now closer to my house ! they 're the best hookah lounge around . the staff is friendly and make you feel like your family . david and chris are awesome . if you have n't tried this place you need to get down there and try it out for yourself . they now have a a dj , karaoke night on thursdays , monday night football , they have all kinds of new things going on there . plus they are $ 15 per person all you can smoke !	2789
0	my husband and i frequent the one in nyc on 7th and it is wonderful . this franchise in caesars was absolutely horrible . i ordered the corned beef hash and it looked like a rat had taken a dump on my plate . we took a picture of it and took it to ny and they were quite disguested at how someone could allow this to be served . the wait staff was less than accomodating ( we had heard from the area shops was normal ) so we just left . no tip , nothing . will never dine here again . their nickname was `` the rat deli '' . thank goodness they were closed down .	79
1	maria is the best at removing sebaceous hyperplasia . these annoying things i have been fighting with for the past 2 years .	3366
0	dealing with the office manager and billing was a nightmare . the dr seems alright , but i chose to see a different dr after this bad experience because sadly the dr is over his employees and if this is who he has represent him i can not trust my body to that person . i hope he fixed this in the future .	2802
1	well i ca n't grade the staff we really did n't use them . there is so much cool stuff here from cooking toys to kids toys . we spent a good 45 min there and just poked around . interesting creative and teaching crafts for kids that could enhance any b-day party .	1937
1	zorbas should be a scottsdale historical landmark , if the city council had a clue . which history , i.e . supporting skysong instead of pimpass hockey arena/tempe marketplace where old los arcos was all the way to the wedge , has proven they do n't . but i digress , zorbas . where else in south dale , can young punks who just turned 18 , get kicked out of for recreating light saber fights with 3 foot ( maybe they were 4 ) neon dildos . no where thats where . also , in regards to that area , long live vr .	2914
1	i came on a weeknight during rush hour and this place had no line . i just walked right up . everyone was friendly and smiling and talking to you . they kept the place clean . i grabbed my order to go and the burgers were delish . i love their fries - plain fries . i do n't go for their other styles .	116
1	great beer selection with late night draft specials during the week . they do n't offer much for food outside of little plates , but the bruschetta was on point . when it 's warm out , the roof opens up and you can see a really pretty view of the skyline . parking can sometimes be tricky , but there 's a garage and a lot a few blocks down . i 'll definitely be back when the weather warms up .	780
0	enjoyed the classes , but the administration change was poor . i had broken some bones in my feet and needed to no longer participate . during this time a change in ownership happened and they `` wrote-off '' my balance . i '' m out of the balance of my classes . very disappointing ... .i guess the moral of the story is , do n't get sick or injured during the class series , even if they tell you that they will credit your account .	2394
0	overall , a disappointing experience . the waiter was disinterested and dispirited . i wo n't be going back .	979
1	this bass pro shop is like a dream ! it 's got two levels off all things `` outdoors '' ! ! ! i loved taking photos on the atvs and in the boats ! ! ! ! ! the fountains made it all the better !	2601
1	this is my go-to place for hungarian and central eu food . the atmosphere is dated but has a home style feel to it . live music on the weekends and great cabbage rolls and goulash . as good as trips to budapest and prague for similar fare .	625
1	dr. gawley is an incredibly talented plastic surgeon . immersed in the breast cancer community , we hear and see the best and the worst results in breast reconstruction . dr. gawley is by far the best surgeon for breast reconstruction in town . we highly recommend him to all breast cancer patients in need of breast reconstruction . his work outside of breast cancer is equally outstanding . in addition , he is a philanthropic leader in our community giving generously to help make a difference in the fight against breast cancer locally .	3623
1	i loved my pedicure and gel manicure . three of us came in and they started right away . they do wonderful design request . great prices and wonderful people . i am sure to come back ; )	3649
1	i decided to experiment with crafts and i ended up at michael 's . i expected to see mostly retired customers who do have time for crafts and hobbies but much to my surprise there were a great variety of people , from children to artists ... you name it . not being familiar with the crafting world , i had to ask for assistance . the staff was friendly and courteous and eager to help . i was very pleased with my purchases and my shopping experience at michael 's .	1615
0	great help from associates this was on friday , not happy with reception and assistance i got in meat department on saturday .	304
0	bought a chandelier for $ 375 only to discover that essential hardware and instructions were lost or missing . took me five ( very aggravating ) hours and several trips to home depot to successfully hang the unit . ok , `` fool me once ... '' but the store 's attitude was indifference . goes without saying . i 'm not happy and wo n't be back .	3224
0	beware ! ! bought a tree from star 3 months ago and it died . we were told when we bought it that it was guaranteed for 1 year . when we returned the tree , with the receipt , we were told by the young lady at customer service that she would refund the purchase . however , when she took the receipt to the register the `` manager '' told her that they do n't refund , they only do store credit . so , we were stuck shopping for a new tree and carting it home in 105 degree weather . do n't trust star nursery for backing their products and guarantees .	99
1	workers are always friendly and the store is always well stocked and clean ! i 'm here daily for a pop out of their fancy coke machine . $ 0.89 refills if you bring your own cup-which they encourage ! so happy to have them in the neighborhood ! a convenient stop for gas , or a missed grocery item , or a daily drink ! ! : )	507
1	shannon was our server for veterans day and did an outstanding job . pork chop and gravy were delicious . love their baked potatoes . will be back .	560
0	my family and me came here last night the customer service was horrible . at first my niece wants to get the waffle cone and the short hair girl told us that we ca n't get it because its for tomorrow for a party . i 'm paying for my ice cream not like she give away the waffle cone or something . the girl face look very grumpy . after hearing our conversation my niece no longer wants the cone . i give two stars because i like their ice cream .	164
0	ordered delivery and was very disappointed with the quality . the lemon chicken was the worse i 've ever had . not going back there for american chinese .	486
1	one of the nicest goodwill locations in the valley ! location is clean and fairly well organized . employees are friendly and efficient . they also extend the military and student discounts to schoolteachers on sundays .	1219
1	had a big tree and a lot of roots in our back yard . call tree doctors and after a slight timing snafu on a estimate i got them scheduled to come out and remove it . we did have to wait almost 4 weeks for them to come out but they did a professional job and cleaned up everything very nice . i would recommend them .	1135
1	it 's a small hair salon with limited space but some of their stylists are awesome . of course , not all of them . chiharu was the best among the stylists i had before . she has great skills on haircut . i will definitely recommend her !	2181
0	this was such a rip off . i ordered two medium sized pizza with thin crust . well , the crust looked like a flour tortilla , hard , dry and nothing like crust for pizza . now , image that being cooked with toppings and passed off as pizza ! ! since its franchised , they must all be horrible . i hope someone reads this review and pays a few dollars more , go to a real pizza parlor and be satisfied ... h o r r i b l e ... .not even one star	117
1	we came here to try out their poke bowls because we love poke from hawaii . this is n't like hawaiian poke though , it 's their own take on it so do n't expect the traditional hawaiian poke . the fish was fresh , and we thought the portions were fine for the money . it 's on par with poke in hawaii cost wise ( in usd ) , so it is n't a large amount of food , but fair . we got the big katuna and the ninja and enjoyed both . the crunch from the nuts were particularly enjoyable . all in all , we would come down here again for poke !	309
1	had the pasta bowl which was nice because you could throw in all the ingredients of the power bowl ( zucchini , squash , etc . ) at no upcharge . the bolognese sauce was really flavorful and the chicken was pretty good . i had a friend get everything served in a bread cone . that was weird . he ended up pulling everything out onto a plate anyway . but , he said the bread tasted good . it was just an apparent oddity for meatball transportation .	712
0	i just got ripped off for an up coming show in december . they knew they had money issues , yet they took my money and left me hanging . feeling ripped off .	2898
0	after reading a review about not being called back after a call and an e-mail it happened to me also . how can a company simply ignore a request and still stay in business ? if i replaced my roof with this company and had an issue then i would more than likely have problems . they must be having some issues if they ca n't even communicate with customers effectively . alfred in fountain hills	3097
1	i stopped here recently on the recommendation of a close friend , and was not dissapointed . this is an excellent , adorable 'mom and pop ' family italian restaurant with great food ! the pasta is homemade , and the service was fantastic . my daughter got the spaghetti and meatballs , which she loved . i got the seafood manicotti alfredo , and it was 'to die for ' . so flavorful , with large portions to boot . prices were good too , and at this point , i honestly do n't see a reason to go to the national chain italian restaurants anymore ! great job dominic santos !	1242
0	if you want a great , gourmet cupcake go to the cake artists studio on bloomington road . they are cheaper and she 's an accomplished pastry chef . the cupcakes at cakes are overpriced and not special at all .	3749
1	came here on a whim . staff was friendly . chorizo was delicious if you do n't mind the large dollop of mayo . the paella was simply amazing only bad thing was that a third of the menu was not yet prepared when we arrived at 6:30pm on a tuesday night . would recommend	1167
0	good food , horrible staff , rude , ignorant . mom and pop joints are just very rude in this town .	1499
0	i was disappointed in this ross . the selection was very small . the displays were haphazard leftovers . no one greeted or acknowledged me . it seemed like the unloved step child of the stores i 've been in before .	2037
1	we go to katsu once every couple of weeks and always have a great time . the price , food and service are always on point . we usually have the same waitress and she has gotten to know our family and is always very sweet to our son . no complaints here !	745
0	normally they do an excellent job on their cakes but this time they obviously did not care . i ordered a specialty cake and was very disappointed . the lettering was very messy , there were thumb marks , the decorations were very poorly done ... it was clearly slapped together . the cake was 1 hour late , and no one cared to apologized as i waited . to top it off they put it in the wrong color board . i will not be going back .	868
0	went here for the first time today , honestly , it was pretty average . the way you order is very confusing for people who have never been there . the food was not very good , my friend ordered a sandwich that we had to pick up in `` the line '' and it had been sitting out under a heat lamp . the soup was bland . it just felt confusing and meh .	1276
0	this location is now closed . no business seems to make it on liberty avenue . big mama 's house of soul is gone , chick boutique is gone , the cordon bleu culinary school is closing , the august wilson center is having money issues and now dozen is gone . if sweetlix closes next i will be pissed ! i was n't a fan of their dry , stale cupcakes , but i never like to see a downtown business fail . we do n't have much there now .	2751
0	this place is terrible ! i went because my regular nail lady was unavailable at crystal nails and charlie did my nails . i got just a fill and while filing he cut the side of two fingers with filing too deep and the side of my nails started bleeding . not a professional or talented place . i would strongly urge anyone to think twice about going here .	1844
0	old lao food . i dont recommend this place . would never come back here . seems like all the hot food has been sitting there for days and they just microwave for you when u order	2652
0	i love chick fil a usually , but this location always messes up on my order . i ordered chicken nuggets last time , and i received a kids chicken tenders . today , i order a chicken sandwich with mac n cheese , and they did n't put silverware in the bag . go figure .	572
1	i went in not knowing exactly what i wanted because i do n't usually eat at jersey mike 's subs . dylan greeted me with a smile on his face and more than happy to help me make a decision . he even recommended a couple things . he made me the best salad for my ketodiet . i recommend this location . good job dylan !	1528
0	where do i start ? the standing room only waiting room with a 45 min wait ? the fact the pa never touched my daughters skin . the pa then telling my 13 year old daughter it is ok to re apply makeup ( mineral ) after school before dance ( without washing ) . the prescriptions handed out with coupons that my insurance does n't cover and without insurance would cost $ 400 . then , after the horrible office experience , i called about the prescriptions to see if there was another options , left two messages no returned calls . skip this place .	2099
1	four of us dined the for brunch for the first time . had the mexican bowl , grilled cheese/tomato soup and biscuits and gravy . we loved it all . would say this is my favorite brunch place now . i seldom like restaurants biscuits and gravy , but they hit it out of the park . the service was helpful and attentive in a nice atmosphere . looking forward to trying dinner soon .	1331
1	stopped here on my birthday to use an eb e-club coupon . got a breakfast bagel and a pumpkin crunch bagel w/ pumpkin schmear , which was really delicious . leo , the manager , was very friendly and made me feel welcome . service was quick too , but there were n't too many folks in there at 0700 on a sat morn . wish eb had a branch closer to nellis afb !	1214
1	just bought my wedding dress here ! excellent customer service from robin . love her ! this is my 2nd wedding , came in with my 2 teenage daughters and robin made us feel completely welcome . we live outside of philadelphia and after visiting another bridal shop there , i am so glad i waited till our pittsburgh visit . they carry my favorite designer here and they have an amazing array of dresses . so pleased with my dress and the entire experience thanks to robin ! i would definitely go here if you are searching for the perfect dress .	2938
1	had a choco waffle with strawberries and bananas . it was excellent ! i will definitely be coming back .	580
1	soooo yummy ! the chicken is very fresh and the sauces they have are tasty ! i like it more than canes it is much cleaner .	998
0	food poisoning . thanks greasy fish tacos with cabbage that could or not have been properly washed . i 've also had their mac & cheese which was mediocre . but at least i did n't get sick . it 's a serviceable pub but the menu can be improved . it 's not innovative and nothing on it entices you to order it . there are hardly any vegetarian options . the washrooms are clean and the faucet is motion sensitive which is good .	1569
0	worse paedicure by lilly today . do n't waste your time , try one of the new salons on the danforth .	3247
0	as a followup to the previous poster , southwest dental group has several adjacent offices on rural rd. , there are a long list of unhappy reviews . i concur with carly 's comments that i will not return and that the service was poor and unsatisfactory . hour+ wait , similarly large number of x-rays , very cursory examination of my teeth and no cleaning . i 'll never go back , and i hope the gentle reader never goes there in the first place .	3414
0	based on all the great reviews of this place i was excited to try it out ... what a disappointment . i ordered the overpriced `` carne asada '' burrito ( $ 8.65 w/tax ) and i would be shocked if it was even 20 % carne asada . it was loaded with so much beans , rice and pico ( no guac ) that you could n't even taste the overly chewy carne asada .	562
1	i went in at 4 pm for some new tires . the sales guy was very nice and prompt . since there was no one waiting the got 4 tires and my alignment done in 45 minutes at a very reasonable price . so far so good , so when it 's time for service i will go try them again .	3860
1	if you are at fan expo , you should make time to come here ! exceptional beer list . great frites . friendly service . cool ambience .	1583
0	slow service , and limited beer selection . overpriced as well , just because its in an airport does n't mean they should be adding a premium to alcohol .	604
0	this place is located inside the venetian hotel in vegas . you would think it 's a perfect fix for a late night snack . the set up is nice , all the sides are clearly visible . the meat , however is rather questionable . for some reason , they put their steak under some sort of liquid broth . i mean , i know steak is the more expensive protein and you do n't want it to dry out , but to take strips of meat out of a liquid and plop it atop a mountain of nachos , dripping with liquid , is plain gross . side note to manager-hire people who smile .	1071
1	i 'm not much into makeup but i brought my niece here for her birthday . the place is always well lit , clean and organized the staffers are all nice and knowledgeable except they always try to up sale which is good for the business . lots of products too .	2574
0	$ 120 for pedicure and shellac mani -- are you kidding ? ? on top of that , two of the shellac nails peeled off within 3 days ! ! ! do not go here . and probably just getting off the strip if you can !	1606
1	we love water wings ! my daughter 's been coming to this school for a little over two months now and we 've had only positive experiences . andrew is super sweet with the kids ; you can tell he truly enjoys teaching the little ones .	2856
0	if i where u stay away these people are not honest or ever get back to you horrible customer service do not trust beware all of the good reviews are friends they even broke my computer more then it was when i bought it in and denied it just do n't even bother with these `` '' computer experts '' ''	2855
0	worst customer service ever ! i came in because i had some questions with but my car insurance and a agent would not help me . she kept telling the front desk what to say . i switch companies after and got a better quote !	2675
0	the date of this review is friday , february 5 , 2016 . after placing super bowl bets , i went to the greenland supermarket on spring mountain road . i have been many times to the greenland supermarket in los angeles . for this market in las vegas , i prefer the los angeles market instead .	715
1	after leaving the ford dealership and being told i had a thousand dollars i needed to spend on a corroded battery and engine wiring harness i took it here , whom i have always trusted . they looked at it cleaned the corrosion off the battery and harness to find nothing was wrong . i said i would just buy a new battery then . they tested the battery and it too was fine . they applied a protectant on battery posts and sent me o n my way . did not charge me a dime . honest shop that has always treated me well . glad my warranty is out and i 'm not forced to have my car serviced at ford anymore !	565
0	i would have rather ate at mcdonald 's and i hate mcdonald 's . hot dog was burned . onion rings very greasy ( actually dripping grease ) . i do not recommend this place to anyone .	953
0	honestly , why this is called a mexican restaurant is beyond me . smallest order of fajitas we have ever had . guacamole was literally a mashed avocado and the chicken dish i got with the jalapeño creme cheese sauce i am still trying to figure out . the salsa was awesome and so was the waitress but the food ? no ...	882
0	food was cold . mashed potatoes were cold and had huge idaho potatoe skins in them . they were cold and i had to send them back , then my husband 's corn was cold . my child 's chicken strips came out without the fries . told the manager who replaced the potatoes and corn but seemed over worked and tired did n't really seem to care too much . they need to bring reba and burt back . place is going down hill .	560
0	there is always a first - and this was my first experience with americanized vietnamese food . it did n't taste awful , it just was n't very authentic . we ordered a bun dish , a tilapia dish and a bowl of pho . i may possibly go back for the pho , but that would be about it .	205
1	awesome desserts . i tried their green tea crepes and tiramisu , both of which were not too sweet and creamy but just sweet enough and light to satisfy my dessert craving . their coffee was pretty good too . i thought the price was on the higher end but it is not like i come here all the time so i thought my money was worth it . the space itself is not too big so if you are going in a big group of people you may not be able to find seats . there was also no washroom in the store , but it was just a cute little store and the service was friendly	3180
1	they had a pretty good selection of tap beers which is an automatic 4 stars . the fact that they have pool and a plethora of tv 's made it even better . i 'd visit again if ever in the area .	201
0	the place is what you expect on the inside for design . a cave creek version of fake rustic . the service was a 5 out of 10 because she was slow and did n't know the menu items . philly cheesesteack was tiny and did n't have a lot of meat or cheese . all of the serving sizes were very small considering the lunch pricing . with all of the other great options in that part of the city , they will never see me again and i do n't recommend that you waste your time or money there .	211
1	when i 'm at tc tacos all i get is wild thoughts . wild wild wild . good food great service . hostess is laid back and chill . good vibes all around . will return for another day .	562
0	this place is filthy inside , if you want to wash your hands you have to get a code for bathroom door from front staff . the food is so over-salted	869
1	this place is so creative with their hot dogs , fries , and burgers . so affordable in price that also compliments good size portions . this is one of the best places to eat at in las vegas . buldogi dog and burger is so amazingly delicious , if you 're first time eaters here , i def recommend those !	1566
0	what business ca n't take the time to answer their phone ! and , yes , i tried different times on different days . this also was the same issue with the one in henderson . it 's an obvious problem with the chain . get your act together and fix it so you can at least answer your phones during business hours ! yes , yes , yes , you have clients to tend to , but there has to be some way for someone to answer the phones . i wanted to make an appointment ! forget it now . i 'll go elsewhere .	450
0	required me to sign away my rights . this is ridiculous that a doctor that has the potential to do serious harm would expect a client to sign paperwork that agrees to legally binding arbitration . i recommend people to steer clear of any organization that requires you to sign away rights before you 've even gotten to know their work or who they are . if i were signing up for something experimental , i could understand . standard care - no way .	391
1	love this place ! the food here is an english-styled pub fare . i got the shepard 's pie last time i went and the village idiot burger with poutine the time after that . the food was consistently good and very well priced . the beer is the star at this establishment . i think they share their taps with sin & redemption next door because they have very rare imported beers on tap and they are all well priced ( ~ $ 6.95 a pint ) . would definitely recommend and will definitely be going back .	3344
0	i have spent thousands of dollars getting clocks repaired in this shop . today i brought in a clock that is not working that was recently repaired here . the man refused to fix it and asked `` do n't you speak english there is nothing wrong ! '' he said our granite countertop is not level as of last week when the clock stopped working . to spend a thousand dollars to have a clock fixed and then be treated so rudely is unacceptable and i urge you to stay out of this shop .	2307
1	great oatmeal chocolate chip cookies . and good smoothies . a bit pricy . but well worth it	701
0	this is by far the worst place for indian groceries and clothes . every time i 've purchased groceries there it 's been beyond expired , even though they told me they go through their inventory very fast . i would rather drive out to chandler where the choices and products are so much better and not old . as for the clothes , they look worn and outdated , like they were in the closets of probably their friends and family and just brought it in to the store to be sold because the stitching is falling off of most of the clothes and they look faded . for the price it 's quite overpriced in my opinion , you have better luck with ordering online	2663
1	a good hair professional is as important as a doctor or dentist . the best part of this salon is that they listen to you . they allow you to bring in your ideas and thoughts and work out an awesome hair plan . i may be a 40 year old man but my style is important to me , and leanna helps me achieve my desired look with fun and flair . she even researched the best methods to achieve some serious looks ( taking my dirty blond locks to a stunning silver sparkle . ) they are fun and easy to access and will continue to be my choice for hair care .	1430
0	the worst maintained course i 've ever played . there were giant holes in many of the fairways and even a couple greens . they send off way too many people so be prepared to sit and wait also . the course layout is extremely tight so keep your head up for balls coming from 1 and 2 fairways over .	1138
0	these retail ass clowns get no stars as far as i am concerned . they advertise computer repair services so i lug my desktop up there . at store im told that they are not doing repairs until further notice . they dont offer any alternatives they the store manager and the repair manager just stand there like dolts with mouth open . they dont even offer to take my name so customer service can call me . no wonder they are closing those stores a dozen a day . go to best buy .	1638
0	the website allows you to book a reservation yet it does not allow you to confirm the price upon checkout . omni , it is not best practice to ask for your clients credit card information without informing them of the quote/price they are agreeing to upon the `` confirm '' page . please change . also , when i tried to call in to make a reservation i was greeting with a `` please hold '' in what sounded like one of marge simpson 's sister 's voice . my call was then picked up , transferred and finally dropped . this is why you did not get my business today . i sincerely hope this feedback helps you improve your business .	2901
0	i have been trying to contact kirk through the email address listed on their site ( sales @ thewrightpc.com ) and have not heard anything back for a month . if someone can reply to my email that would be wonderful .	2523
1	got a dozen mixed and a half dozen mixed and they were made to perfection ! ! if you do n't like them , you have no taste ... they are home made and made fresh daily , unlike those made at grocery stores ... yuck ... .	1806
1	toronto has many many great hotels . what separates this is its location ! located on the shore of lake ontario this hotel has everything you need to have a good time .	1859
1	really enjoyed our stay here . the room was quite and very comfortable . the restaurant had great food . our waiter ish was very knowledgable and provided excellent service . the well spa was very relaxing . i had a pedicure and gel manicure from dan . he did a wonderful job , was very professional as well as personable . if i lived here , i would utilize dan 's services on a regular basis .	2973
1	our first visit and it wo n't be the last . delicious flavor in all the dishes we tried and we are vegan so it was great that they were so accommodating to our needs . best customer service of any restaurant , we did n't want for a thing .	202
1	this was the second obgyn office i 've ever been to & i absolutely loved it ! compared to the first gyno i 've been to ( belly wrap boutique & spa ) , it 's a more spacious building & better decorated . dr. delozier was great ! she was very nice & helpful . i wish i could keep going here but sadly my secondary insurance switched & they do n't take united healthcare . but for anyone else interested , i really recommend this place !	1281
0	what kind of tea place does n't serve any hot tea ? ! big bummer for this tea lover . also , the parking is insane , especially at lunch time . would help a lot if you could enter from the parking lot rather than having to walk all the way around the front ... especially after stalking the lot for 10 mins in search of a space .	2238
1	new office for us . today was our second time in for well check . office staff is very friendly . the nurse was funny and friendly . she also did her part of the check up fast and kept his attention during eye and hear exams . dr. deardorff was nice and friendly . he asked a lot of questions getting to know us . he also answer all my questions and gave a recommendation to help me find a new pediatric dentist in the area . great job . definitely recommend .	3570
0	terrible music . some italian guy macri thought he could dj . could n't scratch nor mash up . get some real dj 's please . bottle service was a mess . not returning .	2873
1	my husband and i went to see `` act of valor '' , good movie go see it . : - ) i 'll always be a fan of harkins , it 's a local chain that is based in phoenix and has locations in other states . when we were at this location it appears to be in remodel phase which is a great sign . the location is not in the mall but a stand alone so you do n't have to worry that the mall doors are locked when you leave a late movie . always love the staff at a harkins theater .	2524
1	went in today , i had no problems at all . took about 10 mins for me . good quick and easy place . only thing is its kind of hidden so i had to look for it	2724
0	quick service , but some sales items were `` mislabeled '' . when i went to purchase one of them , it rang up at a higher price . the cashier said that some of the sale stickers must 've fallen off and accidentally stuck on others . seriously ? it was firmly placed on .	3143
1	went back just for the talenti gelato ! omgosh it 's so delicious ! the service at this place is good , but the best thing they have to offer is this gelato ! yummy !	192
0	this place has relatively good quality produce -- though it 's primarily non-organic . they have a small organic section but it 's pretty paltry . just a heads up : the prices ! i am used to paying inflated prices at places like summerhill market and whole foods . but this place has traps . lol i was in there a few days ago and a regular package of non-organic strawberries was $ 14.99 . that is twice the price of expensive strawberries at other luxury grocers . next time you 're in there , keep an eye on the prices . some items are simply unreasonably priced . there is no rationalizing paying 15 bucks for strawberries .	2819
1	clean and a fairly new boston pizza located in the heart of north york . this location is a tad smaller than a normal bp so make sure to come early or give them a call to reserve a table . the service was fairly good but not exceptional . the food was really good . the salad is always a nice portion with fresh ingredients . the pasta was good but pricey for the quantity & quality of the ingredients served . i would definitely return again !	363
0	called to order garage door seal . sent an email picture for advice . they never called back as promised . terrible customer service . i bought one from home depot instead .	3470
1	the best margarita ! ! ! if you tell them if you are sing in the margaritas cost 9.00 + tax	1071
1	good food . very busy . had the southwest omelette which was very good . toast was perfect . would have liked bigger cups of coffee however ... had to keep asking for refills of their maybe 6 once cup .	243
0	internet goes down every night so annoying ! unplug the power of the wifi box unplug the wifi router plugs everything back in works fine 1 hour later again no internet ! for gamers like me this sucks	3459
1	was thrilled to find this place in my travels . there are places i can buy meat slightly closer to my condo by parklawn but the freshness , selection , great service and availability of free range chicken and home made non pork sausage makes this butcher shop well worth the extra walk . they also sell ontario grown produce in season and the field tomatoes and corn i bought were so much better than anything i got at the local grocery store . today i am picking up my fresh turkey for thanksgiving that i pre-ordered earlier this week . i find the prices to be very good and the quality is exceptional . if i could give them ten stars i would .	1639
1	do n't understand why all the negative reviews . it 's an empty theater which is great for us . it 's a great place to catch a movie when you 're on vegas strip . nothing negative to say about this place .	2061
1	i took my entire family here while on vacation . this place is affordable , clean , and the people are really nice , and pay attention to what you tell them . full body massage , foot soak , reflexology and hot stones . great place !	735
1	when i went in i did n't try the food but my buddies said it was pretty good . the atmosphere was cool , live music was on point . the only negative was the service , our server was n't too interested in seating us , and did n't really come around our table to see if we were doing okay . still i think it 's worth checking out for your own , give it a chance .	190
1	i was looking for a new service plan and i got more than that . i received the best customer service . adam was super nice and patient with me . i had so many questions and he had all the answers . he was super personable . one of the main reasons i decided to join at & t was the customer service . they made verison look bad !	2749
0	when your shoes stick to the floor in the dining area , you know there are issues . cleanliness here is clearly not a priority . i expect this at maybe red roof ? but not at hilton property . years ago i remember this hotel has being very nice . i guess management is milking for every last cent . last time here .	2296
0	literally the worst experience of my entire life , from the get go these people are highly unprofessional , untimely and plain hard to work with . do n't expect anything but a miserable experience with these ameuter lenders ! run as fast as you can !	968
0	every time i eat here i regret it . finally yelping about it . this is vegas , a city where amazing food is everywhere . sammys just does n't serve its purpose , the pizza is overly cooked , the salads are delicious but drastically overpriced and most importantly the service is the worst , absolute god awful service i have ever received every time i go and the layout is horrible . i wo n't be stepping foot in there again .	1116
1	took our 2 and 4yr old with us.. the chicken skewers were perfect for the.. tom khai gai soup very good too . their website has some coupons and specials so chck it out before you go .	826
0	unfortunately , i found a dead leopard gecko in their enclosure who starved to death . you can tell by the skinny tail . regardless of their selection , i ca n't support a place that does n't take care of their animals .	380
0	complaint update . their customer service is still horrible . they only seem to respond after my poor reviews and claim they will help resolve the matter but then nothing . on tuesday , june 13 i gave them the order number to reference and now it is friday and still no resolution . buyer beware . if you buy something from this vendor and you have an issue with their product there is zero chance you will get your money back . without a doubt the worst customer service experience to date in my life .	978
0	typical thai fare but small portions and over priced . we ordered bucket drinks ( 12.95 ) and they tasted like juice . the mussels appetizer were basically plain cold mussels placed on top of raw lemongrass-do not order ! the description was deceptive . we ordered calamari , pla pa sa ( fish ) , pad thai , curry , som tum , and pork bone soup and were disappointed . i felt like there was no effort in balancing flavours that thai food is known for , as these items were either too sweet or too sour . the only upsides : nam tok , ( although was 5 thin slices of pork ) was tasty , and service was friendly .	553
0	rude service , bad food . we were starving when we stopped here to grab a quick bite . we were told our food costed one price , but the employee rang up a different price . go somewhere else where the employees actually want to serve you .	1071
0	rude staff manager do n't know his job they waste your time .. i went to try and rent a dresser and bedroom set they said i was approved over the phone then collect all my info on the app just to deny me they act like your time is n't valuable	3714
1	dr badalamenti is amazing , just had a crown done , no pain at all . recommendation to all that are looking for a professional , talented and dedicated dentist , dr badalamenti is the best .	3163
1	amazing cover up by tyler ca n't wait for it to heal so we can do a little more shading	2621
1	just started a new diet . the produce department is well supplied . wish the liquor department carried luc belaire rose . parking spaces could be a little longer in order to fit the maybach or phantom . i am going to be brief . i love the pears . shout out to all 'dem pairs ! ! ! mmg	2105
1	try the salt and pepper squid . crispy and flavourful ! service is fast and friendly , and menu items have been modified upon request . brings back good memories of living in china for me .	1437
1	this is a must stop if you are stayng on freemont street in vegas ! it 's a tiny little hole-in-the-wall piano bar and the piano player/vocalists are amazing ! ! super friendly , intimate and fun atmosphere and it was very cool . they have open mic too so if you are comfy with piano karaoke they welcome you to sing !	3326
0	i was not very excited about these wines . very few varietals offered and many had too much smoke and pepper flavors . the staff however was extremely friendly and the tasting room and outdoor areas are very spacious . not my favorite wines , but still worth trying !	3165
1	great staff . excellent service ! dr. herrera was a great choice for our family doctor	590
0	i live in the parma area and decided to try a new pizza establishment in the area . i decided to try wagon wheel pizza . my wife went up to order some pizza to go and was told that it 's too busy and they are not doing any carry-out orders . this is very disappointing . they could n't say that it would be a wait because of how busy they are , instead they turn away the business . what kind of business that serves food passes up on the opportunity to make money and also gain a new customer . i can say that wagon wheel will never gain my business . i was so upset that i had to share this	2733
0	this location is absolutely horrible never go here you will only be abused my misogynist '' genius '' bar members who stare at you while your product is being refused to be fixed with a smirk . go to ubreakifix across the street wish i could give 0 stars because they made me cry	3579
1	went here for the first time today . tried the rgb burger , delicious ! the loaded fries were generously sized and great . garlic park wings could have used a bit more flavor but very crispy . the atmosphere was fun and rustic . we will definitely be back .	3846
1	very nice hgi . we stayed here on two different occasions , and the service , breakfast and rooms were all very pleasing . very close to the airport , and there 's a waffle house right next door . but try the breakfast here , because raoul can really make an omelette .	3503
1	i love this place so much ! i 'm currently at the bar , listening into some amazing music ! a must visit when in mill avenue . did i tell you how much i love it ? yeah . okay .	1176
1	after being closed for one year , the hotel has finally re-opened and the rooms have been nicely upgraded . i travel often for work so having a nice room to relax after flight ( s ) or meetings it 's a must have . i highly recommend joining their rewards program for frequent room upgrades . i would stay there again . nicely located downtown with access to underground passage to the shopping and eating area is a bonus when the weather is not so nice . great gym facility as well . nice work fairmont montreal .	1671
1	i do n't know ... we actually had a very good time ... i looked through some comments and seems like i 'm reading about a totally different place ... the bouncers were respectful , the atmosphere was fun , my girlfriends and i showed up a bit tipsy already after our supper and ended our night in a great way , getting a bottle and good service with it ... we came to have fun , and we did !	2200
1	every time i come to vegas i make a stop at body english . it is sooo much fun ! the vip room and the tables are great . definitely worth the extra price . there is often a huge line to get in . either get there early , bring some extra cash or some extra good looking girls ! on new years eve this place was rockin . they have fog that shoots down from the ceiling . this is such a fun place !	3596
0	i have come here a lot and it 's always been a great experience . today after going through the wash i noticed my vehicle was still dirty . i went to the attendant and asked to take a look and he just mumbled to me and said he will check . he then went and stood by the manager for 10 min . till i walked over and asked the manager about my issue and he told me that the $ 6 wash was only a touch up wash ? ! ? ... so they advertise a $ 6 wash but the fine print of it is ( if your vehicle is clean ) .	2093
1	i came into the french grocery during the first day of their soft opening . they were almost sold out of pastries , but their kitchen was furiously prepping lunch . i 'm looking forward to great things coming from the french grocery . i 'm very excited that a new grocer is back , and hopefully can produce great food to keep the crowds consistently coming back for more .	1160
0	crabby cashier ... evelyn.. ? ... did n't greet me . did n't speak to me through my entire transaction . heck , she did n't even tell me the total ! ! hello ? ? ? when there are 4 grocery stores equal distance from my house , you really should be nice or at the very least , talk to your customers ! !	3894
1	i have always like menards but i am now even more impressed with them . my daughter was preparing for her upcoming move with a garage full of new purchases including 3 brand new ceiling fans . during our recent flash flood her garage was flooded ruining multiple things , including her new fans still in the boxes . she went to menards , explained what happened , and they said `` get them out of your car will exchange them '' ! ! ! what great customer service , they could have said 'no ' and she totally would have understood . way to go menards .	3780
0	if you do n't mind wading through the drunks and homeless to get inside , this might work for you . dirty , layout is weird and customer service is non-existent . i will drive farther to go to a better location .	2141
1	if your plane does n't leave till one in the morning this is where you should go . best chinese foot massage ever ! ! ask for summer .	2399
0	i have a blast evertime i go to dos . the only downfall for me is the dj plays the same music everytime ! seriously has the same playlist and ive asked him to play certain songs and he says he will ... ..buuuut doesnt . i know alot of people who go there and say the same ! so listen up owners ... ... .add more music ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! maybe a suggestion box or ballot forms ? we buy a drink , we get to pick a song ! just a thought	704
0	deserves 0 stars ! never have pizza ready . they always say `` can i get another pep please '' ? there is no hot & ready about it ! i have been at different times & walked out each time . even complained to corporate website about this location twice & never received a response . i would n't wait for this pizza . will never return . and there was one of those tacky sign twirlers out front the other day . trashy ! maybe if they lived p to the hot & ready concept , they would sell some pies . poorly run business .	519
1	seriously , the best chinese buffet i 've ever had . it does not have a huge selection ( it 's a smaller place ) , but everything it has is great . i love the mei fun noodles and fried scallops . they also have a variety of chicken dishes that are terrific . i come here twice a week .	167
1	have a little cousin who works as a cook there . they 're open late which is really convenient . clean facility and excellent customer service . the burgers are expensive and take forever but the manager is very kind and appreciative . got hellcats , grilled jalapeños , fries , onion rings and waters . over 6 oz of freshly ground beef which i believe is halal . extensive menu with a lot of creative toppings . it 's delicious .	1337
0	they told me an hour and 15 minutes . it 's been 2 and a half ... .and counting . it 's maddening . their excuse ? `` oh , one of the managers left and did n't tell the other manager it needed to get done. '' . wtf ? ! waste of time and $ 95 .	127
0	i came into this store very excited . i played with some of the dogs and they were great but the workers sadly were n't a huge help . lots of them would stand around the cash register talking instead of going around the store making sure everyone 's ok . it was very hard to get there attention . other then that it 's good .	1894
1	great place and awesome results . i love the space suction machine is a full work out and you can totally see changes .	749
1	fast prompt service and congenial helpful drivers .	2531
1	les plus belles filles de montréal ! nice lesbian show ! nice staff , the barmaid at the bar in the back is the best , nice lookin girls , nice dances , not really expensive ! i recommend it	3175
0	strip facing rooms will hear the unshielded music from carnival court . which is great , do n't get me wrong , but does n't end until 3:30 am . so any plans to sleep before then are futile . duct tape on the carpet ; ladies do n't wear the f-me pumps drunk . you will trip . i was there beginning of april , main elevator bank out of order . huge lines to use the two smaller elevator banks . o'shea 's is back and all pretty now . not the same at all . still my favorite haunt . book at your own risk , and ask for a non-strip facing room .	2976
1	i came here after work with only 45 minutes till they closed and they were happy to help . scott gave such care and attention to detail that the end result was amazing ! the inside was very clean and newly updated . i highly recommend !	3309
0	this is the absolute worst wendy 's in the entire country . its dirty inside and out . not to mention , we have found hair in our food . i can not believe the owner would allow this place to be this gross . wonder what the sanitation grade is ?	509
1	amazing ! my daughter and i went on saturday for beignets , which were made to order and super tasty . even better , we purchased some lemon , espresso and peach macaroons for later and those were so delicious ! obviously still gearing up ( empty cases ) but looking forward to the grand opening on july 9th . what a wonderful shop for the downtown area ! my only complaint is that there is not sufficient parking - this place will be super popular and there are only a few spots .	1160
1	ulta over sephora , any day . not only do they have sephora brand products ( urban decay , philosophy , juicy ) but , they also have drugstore items ( revlon , maybelline , etc ) . they have tools for hair , nails , and even a salon . fun place for any girlie girl = )	2479
1	they were great . i came in and they help me right away . they had what i needed . they answered all my questions and help set up all the apps for the new phone .	1032
1	i have come here multiple times for a full detailing , and they always do a wonderful job . my car is always left sparkling clean , and smelling great . i will continue to come here .	1502
0	not coming back . got a haircut i did n't want . he even lined my front edge . i never get my front edged ! ! ! he did n't even ask . said i should have told him . it was not what i wanted . i will continue to look elsewhere . the journey is long and treacherous at times . but a good barber is hard thing to find !	3469
0	seriously - i get it . it 's a busy place . but really , how much does it cost to train your people on customer service ? i do n't mind waiting - i did n't have an appointment . waiting 2 hours was a bit much . none of this is as bad as dealing with completely disorganized and rude staff . if you honestly do n't care about people , why do you do this job ? ? ? ?	1077
0	worst ever ! ! ! made appointment for covered wellness exam ... they scheduled tests not covered by my insurance ... $ 900.00 later , worst place ever !	3349
1	best bagels , bialys and potato pancakes ! we 've lived in the valley for 30 years and this was our first visit ... . we are now customers for life ! ! great to bring a little east coast to my life every now and then ! ! excellent and authentic ! ! great service , too !	325
0	while we were waiting for our food a cockroach crawled across the seat behind my daughters head .	7
0	nasty kimchee rice.. soggy . i asked for chicken and they gave me beef . btw i am allergic . never going there again	435
0	ship to store review** avoid this store as a pickup location at all cost . my mother ordered a few items ( in different orders ) for me to pick up for the kids . i made 3 trips , as i am fairly close , wanted to see what my mom purchased as we rarely have the same taste , and the items came in over a 2 day span . anyway , the first day i told the representative i had 8 orders to pick up . he printed the pick up slips one at a time and went to the back 8 times instead of printing them all and bring back all the items at once .	223
1	very nice customer service . a lot of chinese food i want . chinese speaking let me feel warm and sounds go home at that moment .	3269
1	this is a great place for brunch if you are super hungry . food is nice , not too delicate , but the portion is huge . i like the smoothies too and it 's such a good starter to kick off a great weekend day . the problem is , if you order both smoothie and a brunch dish , you will eventually waste a lot of food . the californian style omelette is just so so and i do n't recommend it .	243
0	burger was pretty bland . girl at the counter was very friendly . would not go back for the food .	1461
1	sea salt carmel frap w/ a shot is the best ever ! ! ! great staff and a clean environment . only draw back is there is not a drive thru window .	3154
0	this place is `` fresh '' , but no longer open 24 hours so no longer `` easy '' . your nearby 24 hour options are neighborhood market at kyrene-ray , walmart near chandler mall , and walgreens & cvs at warner-dobson .	3392
0	i thought we had freedom of speech in america . when i wrote the last review , i did n't say anything that was n't true . at that time . so why would i be threatened with physical violence from the bartender ? reviews are meant just that a review thats all i did and now you want to threaten me for freedom of speech it just makes your bar look bad sorry you have to go through that javier	850
0	walked in to grab a 2 samosas to curb my hunger . me : hi ! can i have 2 beef samosas warmed up please . girl at the counter : 1 beef samosa ? me : no two beef samosas please . girl at the counter : warmed up ? me : yes ... .ugh the samosas themselves were terrible . hardly fresh , not crispy , too salty . never eating samosas from here again .	1731
0	only picked this delicious beer because it was on sale . yet when the cashier checked me out it rang up higher . i had to go snap a picture to prove it . cashier fixed the problem . not a bad experience , but not great . no smile , no how are you , no have a good night . i get as much interaction and satisfaction from a vending machine .	3107
0	dissapointed , i will give it another month and go gain . half of the pizza 's that came out were burnt and had huge bubbles . there are way better pizza places in the northwest , i am going back to northside nathan 's .	192
0	been here a few times and always enjoyed the meal . but as far a background music goes . playing songs with curse words in them when it suppose to be a family business from what i understand is not where i wan na bring my daughter to next time or anyone with children so they can learn such words as the f word and the s word . needs a better song mix	1566
1	lunch here today . was nice out so sat outside . great service , good food . had the blackened shrimp tacos . decent option for watching carb intake . also had the wedge salad with ranch dressing . always one of my favorite salads . my wife and i ate at the location in cuyahoga falls a few months ago and loved it , so when i saw this place , i had to stop . keep up the good work !	632
0	do not be pressured by the delivery man to accept poor lumber . i ended up signing and writing a check but the majority of the lumber i ordered was so splintered it ruined my project . i 'm sorry i ordered from pauls ace hardware and did not go to home depot .	2697
1	had a monthly pass since they opened for all my vehicles . the workers are always friendly and happy to see you back . and having free vacuums is such a bonus . for less than $ 20 a month i can go through and clean my car everyday . worth the money and with the dust and dirt in the area always blowing in the wind so nice to clean your car in less than 10 minutes .	2939
1	overall great experience with these guys ! they were the only company in my area that actually followed through with my inquiry about building my pool and they also maintained this contact throughout the construction process . every person i came in contact with with extremely polite and helpful with all of my question . thanks again for my awesome pool !	3833
1	good music . good drinks.mgreat creme brûlée .	3295
1	presley is my go to for hair . i get compliments all the time on my hair . ive been seeing her for over 3 years . now all of my family now go to see her . she is very professional and loves doing color . she 's open to anything but will always make sure my hair is n't compromised in the process . i love changing it up . i promise you will not be disappointed she is fabulous .	384
1	food was very good . the service was fast and friendly . the price is on par with most mexican restaurants . the restaurant was clean and pleasant .	189
1	came here because of the reviews and it did not disappoint . pricing is on point you get what you pay for ! and you leave satisfied kat did my full set and it looks so goood ! definitely coming back . my nails have n't looked this good in while so thank you for making me look this good again	2326
0	this place is ok , nothing to scream home about . went in this morning got an ice coffee charged extra .50 just for flavor . also got a ham and cheese croissant and it was burnt ! ! ! ! how do you burn croissants ! ! i should have checked before i pulled off but seriously who burns croissants ! the top was so hard sounds like i 'm biting chips . then to top it off i look in the inside i see no cheese and a strip of ham ! like wtf ! $ 6.88 for both items i feel ripped off . lesson learned wo n't be back here .	3137
0	i walked in one day and the girl who was doing my simple hair cut did n't know what she is suppose to do.. i asked the other girl to help and she did ok job after words . it was ok but still not enough for $ 55 i paid . i can not say about everyone at that place but my experience was simply horrible .	1617
1	delivery is available on ubereats . highly recommend less sugar on okinawa brown sugar milk tea as it 's quite overly sweet with full sugar . pudding milk tea comes with jelly-like pudding , not the regular soft egg/milk pudding like other bbt places .	344
1	i needed to donate some clothes so i showed up here and everybody was super friendly and took all my clothes and things that i needed for my car it was really hot and i really appreciate the hard work that the workers are doing ! i will be back to this location for sure	1657
1	this venue is a step above every other venue in regards to customer safety , and sound . the precautions taken are necessary , friendly , and swift . most shows are all ages , so liquor control is a priority . tyler and dennis are friendly and prompt . ask them for the special .	17
1	was welcomed when i entered the store great staff , kayla and brad have the place looking very professional and clean from when we checked in back in april . the facility looks amazing , smells great and the security gate was working correctly . kayla and brad explained the closing out procedures and also reminded me that the locks could most likely be used again if i was to return to this store . it was a great 9 months , my belongings were dry and in the same shape i left them . thank you to the staff and brad and kayla for making this a good experience . we would rent a locker at this facility again no question . michael harmony	3521
1	we love this place . service is always good and food is delicious . korean pancake and meat chun are my favorites .	435
1	on the hunt for a go to nail shop . they have tons of gel nail colors and on the swatches they have the brand so if you are picky about that or looking for a specific color it would make it easier to find . good solid basic pedi . they have everything clearly listed on what you get . i would go back . reasonable prices , $ 18 pedi , $ 20 gel mani	3274
1	the alfred angelo staff are incredible ! ! warren , ashley & anna went above and beyond to help make our wedding day perfect . after a erroneous ordered bride 's maid dress ( incorrect size ) . warren , ashley & anna did all they could to replace the dress in the very short window we had before the wedding . not only did they accomplish getting a new sized custom order bride 's maid dress , but they were exceptionally professional and apologetic . highly recommended ! i 'd give them 6 stars for customer service if i could !	3737
1	i 've been in search of a great barber shop for some time . i 've tried almost every shop with 4 stars or above , and still , never found a truly great haircut . where my search logic was flawed was in that i was hyper-focused on price . yes , sport clips ' full-service cut is more than i would normally want to spend . yes , it was worth it ! a truly custom experience . easily , the cleanest salon i 've ever been a customer at . they ask the right questions , they listen to you , and they 're not finished until you are satisfied . stop looking , guys . this is your barber shop .	1030
1	ohhhh the giant cookies , soooo good . when the place is not packed be sure to try a sandwich , they are good . but most times we get the cookies to go , can not recommend them enough .	390
1	this place is legit ! if you want a real old school diner with great food , this is the spot ! cheap normally is n't a good word but this place is reallly affordable and you get a lot for your money . the manager there , rodolfo will bend over backwards to make all his customers happy ! he needs a raise ! !	1461
0	i think it changed owners since the last time i was there ... .not sure ... they used to have delicious homemade italian pasta or lasagna and no authentic pastas were even on the menu . i was looking forward to it too and was quite disappointed .	423
1	my family and i came here on a tuesday night after my sister 's choir service at st. paul 's . we were given a table quickly and the service was polite . the service was snappy and fast , and the atmosphere was relaxing and cultured . food was great as always !	177
1	i love this place . clean and delicious food . we got a lot of to go goodies for our road trip . the prepared food were fresh , hot and yummy ! the fermented crab is a must try : )	715
1	best restaurant in pittsburgh . bring a couple of great vintage italian wines and let them bring you chefs choice of food .	423
0	this winchell 's location is just ok . growing up in la , winchell 's was my donut joint of choice for quite some time , but this one is n't as amazing as the ones i remember back home . i usually only end up here after a late night of grubbing down in chinatown and craving some sweet to balance out the savory . the donuts are ok , but you can tell they do n't bake fresh throughout the day . the staff is friendly and there is usually quite a selection , but not the best donut . it 's good for what it is , but if i 'm really craving a good donut , i 'll be heading elsewhere .	614
1	i 'm a mobile orderer and love ordering from this starbucks ! the staff is the sweetest and my drinks are always , always made correctly . the barista ( older man ) is such a sweetheart . the barista who is younger with dark hair is very generous with orders as well . it is a small location but being in a downtown i do n't expect it to be any bigger . it 's perfectly located between businesses and restaurants . one downside is parking can be difficult . i suggested mobile ordering and quickly parking on the curb !	438
0	this is an eagle rider franchise which had nowhere near the same level of service as i had in other stores . to say it lightly the manager who served me was extremely rude . did n't even offer me insurance . my bike was poorly inspected , headlights were not working and stand was defective . given i take some of the reasponsibility for not inspecting myself but i was too excited to ride . they do offer really cool bikes though which you will not find anywhere else but be carefull what they advertise on their website is not necessarily what you will get .	94
1	came here for parties here a few times . staff is always super nice . pretty swanky for me . i prefer a place where hookers and pimps usually yelling by a cadillac parked outside and you can may or may not get rocks delivered . if i stay i will update my review but 4 stars is good for a hotel ... .	3337
1	these are the best burritos i 've ever had ! so many flavors ! mexi fries are bomb aswell !	1474
0	i scheduled them via my home warranty company , old republic , to repair my oven . they scheduled me a week out ... okay ... and then the morning they were due to come they texted me saying `` the tech '' had a family emergency and ca n't make it until friday . life happens , i get it . but you have a company to run . get more techs ! what i do n't understand is that this company clearly has issues and a poor reputation -- why are the home warranty companies using them ? !	118
1	just had all our patio couches , chairs and lounges recovered . with a little guidance from designer who showed us a wide range of sunbrella fabrics and designs , we chose aruba , a georgous turquoise . our old cushions were picked up and new beautiful ones delivered at our convenience . i can not express enough the awesome job they did to make our patio and pool areas come to life . they have extremely competitive pricing . i gave them a five star rating and would give them a ten if possible . thank you to an awesome and professional company .	3828
1	this place is absolutely amazing . the people serving are extremely friendly and they have a wide variety of wine and beer to choose from . 65+ wines and 45+ beers . great neighborhood bar ! i 'll definitely be back !	997
1	the wait times are minimal , they are the same co-pay as if i were seeing my pcp , and they have all my records at their fingertips . what could be better ? oh ! the staff , the doctors , the assistants ? all very very nice ! !	3883
1	came in on a tuesday , they open nice and early . very reasonable prices and great product .	3599
1	my first oil change since arriving in phoenix . thank you for fast , friendly & efficient service . i liked having options & recommendations . even though some of the recommended replacement product are pricey the value added service makes up for it .	2881
0	little coxwell . i just found out why they are pho.is richer in color and a little bit thicker but not clear at all . knor swiss now makes pho powder as in instant fall in that great big yellow can tell it 's all base is no natural ingredients in it that 's where i could n't finish it the other day . it 's all chemicals . when i was eating it i could tell . but just to make sure i look in the kitchen and saw a great big can of instant knor swiss pho mix . that 's just plain laziness and a product is not good	594
1	we 're visitors from california , and we were having some car trouble , we stopped at the auto zone to check what the engine light was , daniel and jose were very helpful . we needed some extra tools , and without any hesitation they helped out . very thankful for their great customer service , and a plus is that their bilingual . it was a pleasant visit .	424
1	walked into roots on a sunday afternoon stroll . enjoyed a light brunch with delicious coffee . the ambiance was great.for brunch i tried the latkes with two sunny side up eggs and lightly swirl with sour cream . the staff at roots was amazing and welcoming . will definitely be back soon to try the local brew and wine .	308
0	if you are a thai food lover , you probably have better then this place . i love pad thai and i do n't like theirs . its not as flavor as it should be . everything else is just okay , but not so great and kind of pricey for the quality of the food . service is also just okay . all in all i have yet to find a good thai restaurant in the charlotte area !	895
0	wish i could give negative 5 stars . purchased their groupon , the scammers wanted me to spend 40 dollars to get $ 10 free . not buy $ 10 get $ 10 free that the groupon was for . do n't sell a groupon if you do n't want to honor it ! wasted an hour of my time driving to and from the store . ( groupon refunded my money ) stay away from these scammers ! ! ! !	3507
1	great value for the money . very friendly staff . free upgrade and the car ran great . i was impressed .	3576
1	anytime garage doors was recommended to me by a friend , but i was a little nervous because of all the negative reviews on here . i was soooo impressed by their service ! i was given a 2 hour time slot at a convenient time on the day after i called . the technician arrived within the first half hour of my time slot . he was very friendly and professional . the work was completed quickly , thoroughly , and neatly . i felt like he was being very honest with me about costs and what needed to be done . i was so pleased with the whole experience !	3291
1	donuts were ok ... not bad , but also not great , perhaps because i came later in the evening . what made this location stand out was the customer service . nicest young man behind the counter . very attentive to his customers even though we hung around for a couple of hours and my husband did work on his computer . we will be coming back to such a welcoming spot .	1774
0	came in to grebe a sub on the ran , i stand next to the counter for 10 minuet and no one care about taking my order , i left the place a drove to jimmy johns , you guys have to work on your service	1494
1	good fresh food , great choice of bagels and sandwich ifillings	3372
0	wait times ... ... . ... .. wait times ... .. are you guys still waiting for my review ? well get used to waiting if you go to this place . simple burger combo will be 20 minutes . also the portion is kind of small and the extra charges are high . if you want ketchup you have to use a no name packet on the side . also to upgrade to a fanta bottle the size of a can you pay 1.50 on top of the combo price . as for the burger it 's whatever nothing special .	940
0	i can not speak to their repair work . their est on a $ 1200 lens was $ 500 . they suggested i send it to the manufacturer and i did . amazing that it turned out to be a free , under warranty repair . i could never trust cris to provide an honest quote ever again . i 'd always feel as though i over paid . beware .	633
1	tres bon poulet ... prix abordables et assez bonne quantité . un bon rapport ... profitez pour manger votre plat au parc mont royal qui est a 3 min a pied	1109
1	well its walmart , lol . same as every other walmart . i 'm just glad it 's close ! sometimes they do n't have what i 'm looking for but most of the time they do . i do n't like that they move things every other day and i have to walk the whole store to find what i need . i have health problems and it 's very painful to walk so this creates a problem for me ! ! !	2141
1	the strawberry fro-yo was the best i 've ever had in a long time ! i also loved the location .	1184
1	dr edwards is incredible . she was amazing when my son 's puppy contracted parvo . she taught us how to care for the puppy when he was not staying at the hospital and he has made a full recovery . the entire staff was caring and very focused on keeping the little guy alive . plus , they helped us to find ways to cut the costs associated with the care . thank you ! ! !	2453
1	i have n't ordered much from their menu , but their chicken fingers and wings are delicious . i ca n't really speak for anything else , but i have ordered from here twice and i will continue to order from here again . i 'm also a huge condiments person so what really sold me was their ranch . order a full size and you wo n't regret it . i have only ordered delivery so i 'm not sure how the service is inside their restaurant , but the person who delivers is always quick and friendly . only bit of disappointment is that their delivery charge is $ 5 . i can live with that though .	1399
0	great selection , but i 've been in this store for over twenty minutes now with my sister and have yet to be acknowledged .	1920
0	survival of thie fittest stays true again today . order a bottomless fries and a water and just stare at the girls for an hour . 2 bucks .	75
0	the receptionist is awful . she crossed her arms and zoned out when talking . she did n't offer any instructions and said only that it was a two hour wait . we walked out .	770
0	made an appointment for monday at their ray road location , even got a courteous reminder call on saturday . but when i arrived on time , i was informed that the doctor does not see patients at this location on mondays ! then why make the appointment ? ? ? the receptionist just shrugged . i declined her offer to make another appointment and will find a different podiatrist .	1977
1	j . lo is awesome ! ! ! she put on an excellent show . fabulous costumes and great dancing . so entertaining ! ! i will recommend this show to any and everyone ! !	1771
1	i avoided seeing a doctor because i did n't want surgery . dr kastrup did my hip surgery and all i can say is good things about him . he prepared me for what to expect , the surgery was easier than i was expecting and i was amazed at my progress . the office always seems busy but i blame that on them being good at what they do and the state of our overburdened healthcare system . my wife has seen dr song for several different problems , most recently a fractured humerus and while paperwork seems to lag behind , treatment does n't .	2176
0	do n't go there for a flu shot . slow and incompetent staff . made to wait , told to come back , made to wait again , not able to process cigna . left without getting a flu shot . total garbage..	3044
1	first night in las vegas and picked this place randomly . excellent tacos . carne asada is bombtastic on anything .	857
1	i took my car here two days ago because the 1 year old battery kept dying , it would not start in the rain , and there was a funny sound that may have been the alternator . i figured this was going to cost me money . they worked hard to find my battery warranty as i did not have the receipt . no luck . but they replaced it anyway . i guess i seem honest . after the battery was replaced , they said that there were no more problems showing up on the diagnostics . and so far , i have not had any problems . it cost me nothing . nice and polite . that deserves 5 stars .	3020
1	landmark . this is where i have created some of my favourite memories . it 's only improving as well with their features and facilities and screens getting better all the time . it 's inexpensive as you get two movies for the price of one at a cineplex and we are all super privileged to be in an area with this kind of thing still available . also the staff are helpful if you ever need anything related to your car .	1634
0	i agree with the reviewer above . do not rent from steve or the biltmore group . very unethical . i had exactly the same experience . i could never reach him , he was unresponsive or constantly 'out of town ' . you have to be aggressive with him or you would never hear back from him . if you provide a security deposit , do n't expect to see any of your money back , regardless of how clean you left the place . you have been warned .	3723
1	first time we stayed at this best western . we loved it . the employees went over and above to make sure that our stay was a good one . the hotel was clean and the location was outstanding . we unfortunately left an article of clothing in our room and thanks to kaityn and sam it was sent back to us immediately . the staff was great and we have now found our new place to stay when in phoenix .	1195
1	i made an appt thru their website . they had a automatic chat when looking at the pricing . i thought that was awesome on it 's own . i asked for a female cut and was in the chair 2 1/2 hours later with no wait when i arrived . i was extremely tired ( i 'm sure they could see that ) and was offered coffee . i declined bc i wanted to sleep afterwards . my stylist was casee and she was a sweetheart . she knew i was extremely unhappy with my hair when i arrived . we did the normal wash and blow dry . but she knew exactly what i wanted . i will be back for my upkeeps .	1617
0	sloppy job & the nail tech used a lotion on me without allowing me to read the ingredients , even though i explicitly asked since i have a severe nut allergy . ridiculously overpriced at $ 37 for a gel manicure . tools were also dirty . would not return .	1796
0	very disappointed at the delivery install team 's lack of quality to hide a mistake driving a screw through both the tabletop and shelf without notice before they left . moreover , disappointed with customer service making us wait another 4 wks before a technician can come over to confirm the table is damaged . if this is what i have to look forward to , guess i have to not shop at ashley 's furniture again . too bad , so sad !	3738
1	fun small bar . great bartenders ! ! fun crowd . st. pats day and pretty busy ! mixed crowd . good music nice drinks ! ! !	245
0	this place is nothing but express . waited 20 minutes for two chicken kebab sandwich for take out , and i was the only customer during dinner service . the sandwich was extremely bland , with barely any seasoning , or lack thereof . one more thing , the guy who was preparing my sandwich did not wash the lettuce i saw him chopped and he did not wash his hands after handling raw meat either . i wo n't go as far as recommending mcdonald 's instead of this place , but subway is definitely a wiser choice .	1275
0	after procrastinating for a while , we finally decided to see the jlo all i have show at ph vegas . tickets costs us almost $ 500/- which was a total waste of our money . the audience was rowdy and we believe this is mainly due to jlo encouraging the rowdiness in the crowd . except for one or two songs specially the one she dedicated to her kids the others were really of poor taste - she is not a great entertainer , we have seen many other artists and have enjoyed them very much but this was a disappointment .	1771
1	i have been going here for years and have had wonderful service ! ! they have awesome staff and if i need anything extra like alterations or an item to be steamed i know i can count of them to help ! ! big thanks to jarely , for always having a smile and being helpful ! ! highly recommend this cleaner ! !	1719
1	the avocado toast and mochaccino coffee we go here often on sundays before we grocery shop at whole foods ! i also read they have bottomless mimosas for brunch but i have yet to take advantage of that ! ! i do love the setup of the place , it 's beautiful and has great color tones , brightness , plants , and seating options ! it 's a great place for dinner , lunch or brunch !	1331
0	do not buy from this guys ! i got a text confirmation saying the meeting place was carlos n charlies from 9:30 pm to 10:20 pm , i got there at 10:10 and the host says , oh you are late , you cant go anymore , im like wtf ? as im arguing with the host , a party of 4 arrives and they are allowed to get in ! why them and not us ? we got there earlier than the other party ! ! ! !	2122
1	the montreal location is far better than the toronto or chicago location ! absolutely delicious . perfect place to come for a fast and hearty breakfast wfh healthy options . quality is 5 stars .	243
1	this place has such farm fresh choices and a rotating menu . their salads and bowls are delicious and flavorful . i have n't tried the burgers yet but they look good too .	1269
0	this restaurant is unbelievable garbage ! will never enter again ! some seafood is not fresh , soup is too salty . and the delivery is way too slow . never come ! and no refund !	1016
1	been taking cars here to get fixed for years , and they never disappoint me . just had two cars there last month and now both cars look awesome . thank you bumpermedic ! ! !	2537
1	if you are looking for used men 's and women 's rolex watches , this is the place to go . they know their rollies and seem to always have a nice collection of used watches .	2923
0	way way way over priced . quoted $ 55,000 for installation of 2 lennox ac units . no , that 's not a typo . were not prepared to break down the cost of parts vs labor , i wonder why ? ; - )	1718
1	such friendly staff and doctors ! i hate doctor 's offices , but this one had a warm , welcoming energy or maybe it was the friendly smiling staff . i would recommend this office to anyone ! particularly dr fauer and dr taylor !	938
1	i have been shopping for a louis vuitton purse for a while . i stopped in last saturday and stacy immediately greeted me with a smile . i was n't sure of the exact purse that i wanted . stacy took her time and really listened when i explained what i was looking for . she found me the perfect one . i emailed her yesterday to see if they had the cufflinks that i wanted to get my husband for his birthday . she immediately responded and put them aside for me . i ca n't say enough good things about stacy and everyone at this location .	1493
1	opening day is alway confusing for most businesses , but la madeleine was pretty good ( for the most part ) . i ordered their cáfe sampler ( quiche , salad and soup ) to go , and to my surprise it was bogo . nice start ! for myself i tried their french dip and because tomorrow is ash wednesday , ahhhh valentines day , i order a dark chocolate heart ( photo ) shaped cake for the boss . everything was very tasty and only ran me $ 32.60 after the discount . even better , la madeleine 's is near my office , so i 'll be back real soon .	1276
1	el serbicio es excelente muy amable la señorita q me atendio . gracias la señorita q me atendió es martha castel	1237
1	excellent special pho . have had it many times here . get it to go on a cold winter night . call in ordering fast and problem free . friendly employees . they have 10 min parking in front for pickup but sometimes people use them for long term parking .	172
0	liked the atmosphere but our food took way too long ( 1 hour ) . we had to pause in between because we finished the first few dishes .	1359
0	out of business ... though they have no problem charging your credit card if you had a pass . fortunately , i contacted my cc company immediately to make certain they ca n't keep charging me after reading the horrible reviews of management .	2044
1	quickest and least painful brazilian wax i 've ever received . will definitely go back for same service . owner was very friendly	3079
1	they did a great job in labor and work on the vehicle . although it was a fight to get a manufacture part instead of an aftermarket part purchased and installed . i do n't entirely blame invision auto body service but being a state farm approved service center , more communication and better understanding of the vehicle they were servicing should had been done . overall , the communication aligned and the service resulted to 4-stars .	2680
0	went to the thai house tonight and ended up walking out . we have been going here for a long time and the food has hit an all time low . we both ordered pad thai and it tasted like they used bar b que sauce in it . it was n't even close to the thai food that we have enjoyed over the years . i hate to say this but do n't think that we will be going back anytime soon .	895
1	we enjoyed a great lunch here sunday afternoon . small side salads were huge ! ordered a large half sausage half gotham . it was great and massive . the sausage was fresh and of good quality . the bread is the key . out of everything we enjoyed i would say the warm fresh bread and butter was a treat . was baked to perfection . our server and the rest of the waitstaff did a really great attentive job .	192
0	decided to give it a shot seeing as it is close to campus . bad idea . grease , grease , and more grease . i could n't even stomach taking more than a couple bites . upside : the guacamole and chips are pretty good . i 'd take a pass on this location at least .	1365
0	called the 1-800 number and they refused to give pricing . i know they need to have a consultation to get exact pricing , but seriously- you ca n't give me a range of fees ? ? ! ! after much back and forth , she could only tell me 1-4 thousand range . give me a break ! then , 2 hours after calling them , looks like my phone number was sold to telemarketing for some hotel vacation scam . what a bunch of crooks to do that . there 's nothing i hate worse than my info being sold .	3417
0	complete lack of customer service . i came in 20 minutes before closing to get a quick pair of glasses before the new year . with 5 minutes i had narrowed it down between 2 $ 320 - $ 350 glasses and the manager told me she would pull up my information to ring me out tomorrow . mind you they still have 15 minutes before the store closes . this is the place for you if you like lazy associates that do n't care about making a sale .	3945
1	great place to get your nails done . everyone is so nice , and the actual place is wonderful . only $ 9 for a polish change , but you can not tip on your card : (	43
1	went to aaa for travel assistance . spent time with jessica oergel who was incredibly patient , knowledgable and helpful . got our long weekend planed and everything was great . by the way jessica did her job you can tell she really enjoys what she is doing .	359
1	we 've taken lots of stuff for repairs here the lady was very kind , honest and helpful and she was able to repair a cherished teddy bear of mine that my dog chewed the head off of it looks brand new and i ca n't thank her enough .	2702
0	everything is sooooo expensive ! for these prices , we should have just gone to restoration hardware . amidst their vast inventory , there are only a very small amount of items i would consider putting in my home . i 'm really curious to know who buys these very expensive ( but very dated ) pieces . i should have trusted the reviews and saved the drive time .	1987
0	if i could give negative ten i would . first the salesperson was very pushy she would not let us walk past after we said no five times . we fell for it and she dodnt let us see the after pics just rushed us out after trying to sell us more stuff . our teeth look worse than they did to start with and they are painful . there is spots that she assured us would go away . they never did . dont get scammed by this dishonest business..we threw 150 $ away that could have been used on our vacation .	2667
0	sammy 's is usually a reliable standby , but avoid this location ! the service started out fine , but then fell off a steep cliff . the food orders were wrong for our entire table , so there was big disconnect with the kitchen . they were terribly under-staffed which contributed to the chaos .	1116
0	the worst customer service i have witnessed in my entire life . the lady who does eyebrows here is rude beyond belief ! i heard similar things from my friends but gave her the benefit of doubt . i would never return to this place again and will never recommend this to any of my friends ever !	1383
1	every time the food has been great . i love the grinder sandwich with loaded fries . not a big fan of walking all the way up to the bar to grab take out .	428
0	the owner may be excellent at what he does , but his customer service skills are horrendous ! i went in to purchase a vacuum cleaner belt , no big deal . but when i took the belt home , my husband could not get it on despite his best efforts . i went back to the shop , thinking he may have given me the wrong one . he actually yelled at me for bothering him about such a trivial thing and said i could bring the vacuum in and he would show me how it 's done ... . '' but i will charge you for it ! '' he takes it to the next level ! : - (	932
0	when on a wednesday at 6:28pm your delivery time is and i quote `` over 2 hours '' you should no longer state you have such service . that 's just ridiculous , called rosatis right down the street and they said a respectable 45 minutes .	1399
0	i brought my 11 month old here for some labs . i was expecting a couple pricks on his fingers or feet . instead they put a needle in his arm . maybe that 's the way it needed to be done . but i 'm giving them 2 stars because she stuck the needle in and dug around looking for a vein in his little arm . then instead of putting a wrap on his arm she put the tape . which is the hardest to get off . a bandaid would have been better on the positive side we did n't have to wait long to be seen .	2195
1	went to this restaurant for a business dinner . great decor , good mix of tables , hightops , booths , and long bar tables . great wait staff and ours took care of our large group with a high degree of efficiency . good beer selection . i will stop by the next time i am in the gta .	756
0	we stopped by this restaurant for a quick lunch . the atmosphere was very casual and the service was very fast . i was excited to finally try this place because i had heard so many good things . we ordered the takoyaki and the black ramen . i was so disappointed when our food came and the ramen was salty and bland . the takoyaki was decent but nothing special .	131
1	i really enjoyed living in these apartments . the area is safe and the apartments are clean and spacious . i have n't had any noise issues since living here and parking has always been available when my guests come to visit . the price is comparable with the area . in addition , desert breeze park & community center is within walking distance , which is great if you have children or dogs that you need to take to the dog park . i would recommend this complex and have recommended this complex to my family and friends .	2033
1	anthony resolved my refund issue to my satisfaction and beyond . had a great first session and will be back !	3048
0	being a transplant from la i always supported the local farmers market and such , however since moving to charlotte 'mecklenburg ' have lost faith in this city . let 's just start off being positive.. hmmm.. ... . hmmm.. the baguette spot they got in the corner of the market was alright . with that said . let 's talk about how this place can improve . # 1 the parking lot is crap- pothole city . # 2 the market freshness of the foods i 's crap , everything i 'd either frozen or dead . on a good note , , i enjoyed the box of ramen noodles i purchased from this place . edible and can last a whole good month..	1963
0	nightmare . takes forever to get your items.back . very rude . substandard work . do yourself a favor and go elsewhere	2702
1	another excellent service appointment thanks to brittaney & charlie . they always go above and beyond to take care of my bmw x6 whenever it is in their care . i really appreciated the brand new 2017 x5 that was my loaner for the weekend . my wife to be loved it . we will be considering one when she is in the market for a new car .	1752
0	left off a piece of mail for po pick up on a monday . by saturday the mail had not reached its destination . fort mill po mailman delivers mail all over the place ... we wind up running to neighbors exchanging mail . call the fmpo and they are n't interested . today i got someone persvription meds . i finally got a supervisor who was at least mad enough to want to get to the bottom of it . amazon prime two day means nothing in sc .	329
1	i came here when i got a flat tire . tim was excellent and got me back on the road in about an hour ! ! ! i do n't live in gilbert but happened to be in this area , is recommend this place	2146
1	kyle and mika are awesome the best customer service ! ! ! ! i wo n't go anywhere else ... if you want to be treated good , come see them ! ! ! !	2355
0	just finished watching ant-man and the wasp and it was disappointing today the least . the horrible recliners that would squeak oh so loud was n't what made this a one star for me , it was the fact that the lights continued to stay on throughout the first 30 min of the movie.. we are n't talking about nice low lights , but bright daylight white light right on you as you are squinting to watch the movie . definitely a no go for the future .	491
0	hmm ... lots of stars from fellow yelpers . which means i need to write a review of this place . my husband and i had our taxes done here last year ( for 2014 ) . i was thrilled to be getting a return , and my husband as well . unfortunately , canada revenue had to adjust both my file and my husband 's due to errors made by our accountant at triple m. service time was average . i just think , that regardless of how much you pay for taxes to be completed , the finished product should be accurate . accuracy is one of the best measures of professionalism .	3146
1	if their coffee was as wonderful as their donuts , i 'd give them five stars for sure but i find their hot brew to be a disappointment every time .	3137
1	love this compounding pharmacy ! i went in to pick up a prescription and noticed they have numerous vitamins/books on different health concerns all grouped together . also to my surprise , they have an assortment of doterra oils . looking forward to going back to browse when i have a little more time .	1372
1	good selection of pho , vermicelli , and meat and rice dishes . meals from 7 to 12 dollars . pleasant and clean surroundings . cash only for the moment .	707
1	i got my iphone repaired at this place in mississauga called space electronics they fixed it within 30 mins . amazing service and the rest of the staff there was very professional and knowledgeable and knew what they were talking about . i have gone to other places where they did n't seem to know any answers to my questions ! if you want your phone done right and proper i recommend these guys ! great job and thanks again guys . eric peters from brampton .	1586
0	i gave this store two stars because the selection of items was not bad . we would have even purchased a dining set from them , except for my husband and i were ignored by all sales people in the floor with the exception of the salesperson in the mattress section and the greeter . the sales staff either walked right by us without checking in to see if we needed help or spent time telling each other what sounded like personal stories . we ended up left without buying anything and paid more at the lickng spaces store where we were treated with respect and professionalism . i am not recommending ashley 's to anyone i know . nice job turning away clients !	3738
1	easy communication- friendly service . dropped off truck at 0800 , was called at 1100 saying it was ready . we will definitely be back !	203
1	the food is great ! i 've ordered almost everything from gourmet gringos and would recommend anything from the tamales to the taco salad . my favorite items so far are the fish or shrimp tacos and the nachos .	65
1	got the chocolate raspberry , cheesecake cake , glazed , maple bacon , pistachio , and chocolate glazed donuts ! amaaazzinnngg ! definitely got me going back for more . the donut bread part itself is delicious and chewy . the flavors are tasty . absolutely loved the pistachio it was my favorite and the cheesecake was creamy and on point with a little crunch . the maple bacon melted in my mouth and the glazed was perfect ( especially warmed up ! ) . the place itself looks fun ! very big and open . i enjoyed the openness and it 's great for groups ! this girl has a big mouth for these bigmouth donuts !	1643
0	worst food ... i ordered squid balls , it was disgusting . my friends had the rice bowl with pork . they could n't finish it . popcorn was very salty ... i will not come back . great fun and friendly staff though but the meal was not edible .	344
1	my go to place for most of my gardening needs . employees are very nice and friendly here . they very helpful when it come to anything you need help with . selections are amazing ! so many different plants to choose from that i ca n't decide . keep an eye out for the $ 10 off $ 50 or more than usually comes in the weekly ad on the redplum	2039
0	awfull service..do n't go here ... the guy kept my coupon to give me a discount on my smog check , and when the car failed its smog bec i just had the battery jumped , refused to give it back and charged me $ 10 for failing and no free retest..do not go here unless you want to lose your money and fail your smog .	2208
1	not a bad lunch place . pita was filling and the soda machine has tons of options . i would go again .	84
0	very disappointed to sit there for 20 minutes for only to have the female barber to ask if i had an appointment and complain about having 22 other appointments . very unprofessional on her behalf ! i will not go back nor recommend them !	2465
1	i was in a rush to catch the beginning of annabelle last week . incredible customer service . there were two guys at the counter selling tix and food..i they both worked together to make sure i got my food and made the movie on time . great service ! thanks ! !	491
0	i bought 10-12 steaks hard and grizzely ; it was a special event/ holiday -- ruined our meal . i went back two owners and butcher made me feel like scam artist taking advantage of them . i brought back the meat , very little was eaten ; they 're mouth dropped ; finally gave me my money back ; any other reputable store would not make their customer feel like a criminal like they did- i now buy as little if anything there . if you have a bad product its your fault not theirs unreal ! ! !	473
1	i 'm a fan of this store because of the two lovely ladies at the cashier , who are always cheerful and friendly no matter what time of day . watch out for them , their out-going personality is extremely contagious !	1856
1	the staff here are always friendly , and i have no complaints about the yummy drinks they make for me ! i like to come here and sit outside with my dogs . : )	2242
0	second time here -- second time with a huge wait for the food . kicking myself for forgetting ... do not come here unless you 're job or you have unlimited time to waste .	742
0	worst place in the world . terrible customer service . the front desk ladies are rude and angry . i will never stay here again . it 's disgusting and they promised me a princess suite and i got one of the worst rooms and said that hey are over booked which makes absolutely no sense if i already booked a princess suite . disgusting .	2973
1	first time here and glad to have a new hangout ! ! ! beautiful interior . great food . and our server gabby was the most friendly gracious person ever . we will definitely be back . avocado toast is off the charts .	1331
1	i did my vampire treatment with symmetry spa , it was amazing i saw the result with in 2 to 3 weeks , and no pain at all . i 'm so happy with the result now i do n't have to worry about wearing makeup everyday . the new staff are amazing , and specially catina she has a beautiful personality . thank you so much	306
0	sales dept invited us in for an early trade in . we discussed our requirements on the phone ahead of time . we were told 'no problem ' only to find out they could n't accommodate . complete waste of time . the service department is the worst . multiple visits to fix a problem not spotted . another time they were n't prepared with part as advised in advance . had to come back . again , waste of time . will not be renewing lease .	3940
0	very poor customer service . we had to leave because we felt like our business was not needed . the cashier , hannah , made us feel unimportant and was not very knowledgeable about the products they carry . she was not even willing to do the basic requirements of good customer service . we 'll take our business somewhere else .	99
1	great meal ! i do n't have too many pictures as we were too busy enjoying the food . wonderful service and food . i am always looking for places that have great salads ( hard to find ) and has options for days i need vegetarian options . aladdins is a great option for both . if you go try the hummus - with hot sauce and veggies .	1088
1	i actually do like their food here ! it 's a spacious place and to bring friends for some bowling and food . it a more sophisticated feel to a usual bowling alley , which i like .	742
0	i 've done my nails at multiple places but i hate to say that this place is the worse one i 've gone to . the lady unevenly coated my nails . a few hours after i got them done , my nail chipped off because she filed that nail thin . 3 days later and i 'm disappointed again because the gel chipped off another nail ! i have never ever had these experiences from other nail salons . im not one to wrote bad reviews , but i am just so disappointed	1272
0	we came into the store to find my best friend a dress . it was the worst customer service i 've ever experienced at a bridal boutique . if you do decide to come here , i highly recommend requesting a consultant other than dorthy , she was rude , unhelpful , and completely ruined my friend 's dress buying experience . we could n't run out of there fast enough .	2938
0	i randomly stumbled upon this car wash that was n't far from home . th outside of my car looked clean but once i drove off i realized that the car did not look vacuumed at all and in the backseat still had splashed soda on it . the whole inside looks like it was not cleaned at all and i paid extra to make sure that was cleaned that was the whole purpose of getting a car wash . i also tipped them . i have a baby so my time is valuable biggest waste of time and money if you ask me . i will never go back again !	88
0	you think $ 30 for a ride wristband is n't too bad until , but then they have restrictions on the rides and the entire area is excluded . they fail to mention this when you 're buying the band	759
1	these cakes are hands down the best cakes i have ever had ! so moist and so good . i will be coming here for all my cake needs . i would highly recommend to everyone !	18
0	i called three days ago and placed an order for a dress to be picked up in the las vegas store on 5/17 . today i found out that as of yesterday this store is permanently closed . very suspicious and sketchy they closed with no notice overnight , and not even the phone rep employees knew they were shutting down .	2153
0	the food is great but i waited 25 minutes for my food . unfortunately since we paid upfront we had to wait , it would have been more of a fiasco to ask for a refund . if i was at a family restaurant and waited that long i 'd simply leave but i 've never waited 25 minutes for my food .	964
0	had a terrible experience here . they forgot half the orders at our table and we waited for 40 minutes . worst of all , the employee and someone who looked to be a manager working did n't even propose to put a portion of the meal on the house . i did n't say anything , but just very bad etiquette , a restaurant should take responsibility for mistakes if they want return business . oh , and the italian calzone was terrible with hardly any meat and all peppers .	1307
1	awesome place . lots of exhibits , awesome robot exhibit , amazing sub exhibit , cheap food , but expensive tickets	1924
0	they are trying hard and very nice but the food simply was not that good . we tried the scallop appetizer , very odd vanilla flavor and small portion , and then the shrimp tacos again only 2 small shrimp per taco and lacking flavor . i would have liked to give a better review and would try again if i see reviews where the food has improved but until then staying away .	1253
0	i 've had good experiences with this salon and the prices are n't bad and if you pay in cash they do n't charge tax . but the front male manager is horrible . completely does not understand the concept of time management . do n't even bother making an appointment because they do n't care . he will tell you 5 minutes but you 'll be waiting more than half an hour because he simply does n't want to turn down a client . some ladies are nice whereas others are rude and just want a tip . my pedicure lasted 20 minutes ! ! ! ! definitely would not recommend though .	3592
1	what a great store and amazing staff ! i tried on a dress and she brought in 2 others of a similar style which i ended up leaving with ! i 've been in several times but this was my first time buying something ! totally love this store and what a cute boutique !	1880
1	this place is good to come by and hit a couple balls in the batting cages . $ 2 = 1 token . 1 token = 14 pitches . go karts are adult fun size fun , fast good track . they do have a wall to mountain climb . great place to kill time on boring friday nights .	3555
0	terrible service . after they were 40 minutes late for my appointment , they told me i would be after an appointment that had just started .	1817
1	great food ... loved the chicken curry . although relatively low on spices to tone it down a little , it had all the flavors that i would get back in india . was completely surprised with the belly dance . was pretty neat and a nice show . overall excellent food and really close to authentic . would love to come back !	1497
1	i was there for dinner with a good friend who is used to eat sushi and we had some really marvelous sushi 's and other things there . very good food for fair prices ! highly recommended !	745
1	i 've been going to lvac for over two and a half years - this time ! they have so many class options and i love the zumba ! i imagine the rest of the gym is nice too , i do n't use it much but it 's there if i ever need it . everyone who works here is friendly and nice , and the place is always clean .	3268
0	the food had no flavor , i ordered the meat lovers skillet and was a bit disappointed , it was very bland . my drink tasted funny , again with no flavor . the waitress was very friendly which is why i 'm giving a 2 star review . the restaurant itself was very dark..	1319
1	the most amazing juice ever , the flavor is intense and i no longer choke after heavy hits like i do with other vapor . everyone in my office told me about this place and now i 'm hooked ! ! !	3351
1	very awesome . had so much fun and felt like a kid again . the guides really make this place enjoyable as they are so friendly and easy to talk to . i recommend this place to all my friends to try . most games were n't too difficult but still fun . once you settle down you realize how great the view are from up in the tree . especially in october . they say to bring a back pack for snacks and such but the parking lot is n't too far so you do n't have to lug around your backpack . make sure you 're rested before you go because it does get a little bit tiring .	1970
0	stopped by this place by chance , hoped for something good seeing the reviews , but it was the same old toronto mexican . tasted like cardboard with cheddar cheese on it . plastic bags of pre-shredded cheese , chicken was mucky and had no flavour .	834
1	after trying many places in henderson area . i finally found my favorite nail place that does good pedicure . the usual i get is the $ 20 express spa which i think is a good deal . place is clean and quick . highly recommended because it is clean . that 's my number 1 concern for nail places because i do not want to contract any athlete 's foot or hepatitis . cheers to this nail place .	1388
1	if i reviewed years ago would of five starred . one less for service . we had the bartender/waiter one night and he never came to table . that was while ago , last few times waitress just seemed stressed and talking crap for tips ... really , then improve your service . we go for all you can eat wings , do n't think we 're done after the first ten wings ! bring more drinks ... get better tip . i 've ordered drink and never got to table . still best wings around though ... bw3 is not as good !	1487
0	horrible experience . walked out after they quoted me 300.00 for cut and partial highlights . lady in front was back and forth on phone talking to owner about price . very unprofessional and expensive .	1617
1	2nd swing is great and the staff is extremely helpful and courteous . i brought in 3 wedges whose grips were probably worth more than the entire club at this point . i was offered a few bucks more , per wedge , than i was expecting . after finding a perfect replacement to complete my new set , i walked out having spent less money and less time than i figured i would . russell was extremely helpful and the entire experience exceeded my expectations . i will certainly be a repeat customer now .	1013
1	very few spinning classes in phoenix so limited of where you go . but as far as decent bikes , good instructors and great sound system , 360 will give you a workout , your legs moving and your heart beat way up . the yoga is in a separate part of the building and is very small space .	3477
0	they are very rude and not worthy to go to them , i want to replace my lens because it got scratches . the worker did n't smile or even said hi . and she told me the warranty does n't cover it and i have to pay almost $ 300 for a new lens . i knew that she is just rude and does n't want to work and it 's wasting time to tell her manger because they both are same . so i went to lakewood lenscrafters and the changed id on warranty for $ 24 .	3637
0	this probably the smallest and most uncomfortable airlines i have ever flown with . the prices are dirt cheap but you get what you pay for . they are usually delayed . when they 're not delayed they leave the port five minutes prior to take off time . they do not care about customer service but rather the money . if you can pay for another airline than do so but if you 're looking for a quick getaway with minimal cost book away .	3127
0	never go here . they gave me a horrible gel manicure that peeled in a week . when i went back to get it fixed , the woman raised her voice at me and accused me of peeling them off . so rude and unprofessional . not worth giving them your money .	132
1	acceptable wait times at the walk-in clinic . young dr. mohan upstairs is great . he 's my family doctor now .	592
0	did not acknowledge me when i walked into the shop , and took forever to take my order . when they finally took my order . the server order food with gloves at the register and went back into the kitchen and started preparing food . cross contamination and unacceptable for a restaurant . always wash your hands whenever you prepare food or taking order at the register	322
0	i am from chicago and was in champaign for the weekend . decided to take my brand new car with 6k miles in for an oil change . 25 miles later oil light comes in and there was zero oil in my car . had to call tow truck , spend another night in a hotel , and miss a day of work . are n't they in the business of oil changes ? they need to pay my expenses and pay for a new engine if i need one . horrible .	3376
1	angel and glen were fantastic ! ! ! helpful , professional , and just plain nice . my leather couch cushions look phenomenal ... and the price was very reasonable ( they told me about the recycled leather option which appealed to my `` earthy '' side as well as my pocketbook ! ) ... .thank you ! ! !	1174
1	visited this joint with a bunch of female friends . notable was the very sweet and accommodating hostess . we were served by three different bartenders and two were slightly rude but the third was very friendly . the drinks are delicious , large , and entertaining . the food is fine . obviously , this place is appealing for the atmosphere , and we had a great time despite the hit-or-miss staff . it 's likely that i 'll go back .	292
1	the staff here are very friendly and kind . both my cats , mewes & toast are seen here when they need their annual checkups , shots , or flea medication . the vets have always been extremely helpful and have always answered my questions with knowledgeable answers . highly recommend roncy village vets .	2487
0	: ( i used to be a regular at this particular location but their staff turn over has been high and the quality has gone downhill : (	3084
0	ok i like this place . i like their stuff . a little expensive but still great stuff . what pisses me off is their unprofessionalism . many many times i 've visited them in morning and they do n't open on time . i came back in 35 minutes and they had n't opened . many times during the day they have a `` be back in 25 minutes '' sign and they are never back in 25 minutes . it 's extremely annoying !	2905
0	the biggest joke on the strip . clown town agent at the book claimed they needed my `` card '' . went and got it and placed 2000 on an over 2nd half . counted the money any said confirmed the bet . then said wait a minute ... . came back 3 minutes later and changed a line from 21 to 21.5 second half . forget this bullshit operation . the supervisor is a joke bitch who ca n't answer any questions . just knock this place down . management is a joke .	2271
1	they are the management company for several of our homes and they are superb in customer service and maintenance issues. ! thank you apartment hunters	3451
0	i thought the place was nice enough as were the staff . but i came home with bed bug bites ! never had them before and they itch like crazy ! called the hotel to tell the manager but could not get to talk to him . left him a message about the bed bugs but he never called back . that told me more about the hotel than just the bites . it told me they do n't care about their clientele . he should have at least returned my call , asked some questions and apologized . bad business relations . and that yields zero return patronage , at least from me . i feel sorry for the good people employed by the organization .	2966
1	awesome place ! everyone is so nice and friendly . they like to joke around and have fun , which is great . quality is great and prices are very good . highly recommend .	457
0	took both my boys for simple hair cuts . ive driven by the spot a few times and decided to try them out . each boy went with a different stylist . the one lady was super quick and didnt clean him up or put talc to remove the cut hair off his neck . she didnt even style his hair with gel , she just basically did a poor job . as for my other boy , the lady that cut his hair was a bit more detailed , but she still managed to give the kid a crooked part line . looks more like a thunder bolt than a part line ! lol . with that said we probably wont be going there again .	33
0	i live in the hood and am also a small business owner . i pit an order in at noodlehead and wales over ... .i opened the door and was told , `` just so you know , we do close in 5 minutes . '' okay , so i left . how about , `` hey , are you looking for something ? '' or , god forbid , `` how can i help you ? '' would it be a big deal to stay 10 minutes late ? i hope the owners know how their store is run when they are not there .	3224
1	this is a review as a buyer- i went in for the first time last weekend and found a few great pieces in brands i love ... i was so happy i went back the next week and again found 2 items that were perfect . nicely curated store , good brands , nice staff . ( brands like zara and banana republic )	1762
1	i almost did n't come here because there were a lot of bad yelp reviews but , they were open late and i did n't want to go to the er instead . the lobby was clean and nice looking and the girl behind the desk was sweet . i was seen by dr. peter tretheway and his assistant nick . the dr. was so very kind and compassionate but super professional . i was out in 20 minutes and had everything i needed . he was also very non judge mental about no insurance and rearranged the medication plan to best suit my situation . i would certainly return if needed .	535
0	my eyes have been burning after getting eyelash extensions . the lashes fell out in chunks the very next day . theyve been uncomfortable all week and i have no idea what to do . i tried calling a few times and no answer ... i never got a call back .	3360
0	first timer and not very impressed . wanted to wash off the dust . i now have streaks of dirt down the sides . so it did n't clean it very well to leave dirt to dry down the sides from the drying . i 'll be finding a better car wash	2044
1	rooms were clean and big with refrigerator and microwave in every room . it was quiet , no crazy people around for a 3 star property/ $ 50 range hotel . the location is convenient to 3 awesome casinos . the pool looked nice and clean . breakfast is included with the night stay and it 's not bad- waffles and eggs , plus some yogurt and cereal options . staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to help me find various places in the area .	1888
1	i usually order all my hair care supplies online . however , i was all out and could n't wait for my mail order moisturizers . so of course i browsed yelp gathered my hubby and google maps and headed out to find this location . i 'm so glad we did ! they had everything i needed all very reasonably priced . they have hair care products , makeup , all types of scrunchies and kids hair accessories . the staff was friendly and helpful . they asked if i needed anything but did not hover . i will definitely return .	3676
0	strike 1 : bad iced tea . sent back . strike 2 : bug in my wife 's sandwich ( in the greens ) strike 3 : cold burger and chicken sandwich we 're out . avoid .	369
0	customer service is horrible ! we were the only ones that walked in the store and no hello no acknowledgement whatsoever . i proceeded toward the counter and said hello and the girl just looked up with no expression . so rude ! i would never step foot in that store again ! i wanted to buy a lot of stuff but i ca n't support a store with such poor customer service . looking at past reviews it looks likes nothings changed .	1933
0	u get a good cut but they have u sign in and never check the sign in sheet they pick and choose who is next i waited an hour after signing while others walked in and got cuts even if u make an appointment u will wait an extra 30 minutes if ur lucky . ..if u do n't have a life and have time to adjust to their schedule i guess it 's worth $ 20	3469
0	been going here for a while for the 1/2 price shakes . they are really good . sooo last night i decided to get a burger . big mistake . meat was overdone , way overdone . one bite almost choked me it was so dry .	844
1	i can not believe the fantastic service that rick and the team here extended to my family . no add ons , no hidden charges and extremely reasonable pricing . very friendly and accommodating people that understand the needs of a grieving family . the whole process was so efficient that my family went away with a great feeling that we made the correct decision to use bunkers services	3064
0	the first time i wanted to check out this club i looked at the crowd and they were all ghetto ! ! ! so we left . the second time.. the bouncer was on a power trip and expected us to pay cover plus tip ! we were 4 females ! what club charges for 4 girls to go in ? ! they have really bad customer service ! i 'm not even going to try a third time here . not worth it . and pleeeeease notice the date on all the positive comments for this club ! they happened in 2009 ! it 's so not like this anymore !	3596
1	this review is long over do , but christopher moving is the best . the movers showed up to our apartment 15 minutes early , they were very professional , and finished in two hours . they were fast and efficient . if i ever have to move again ; i will hire christopher moving again . just by far the best moving company here in vegas .	1645
0	horrible service . after being seated i waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged by the waitress . not even a water was offered , however she did have the time to get coffee and water for two tables that were seated after me . when i finally was acknowledged there was a slight attitude in her tone . i 'm done with this establishment .	1262
0	i was here in the holiday season when they did n't do guided tours but had docents placed throughout the house . i felt like they were too eager to interact with me , and it frustrated me after a while . even the docent/guards in the museum buildings were eager to strike up conversations . i 'm sure most people would find it pleasant , but i prefer to keep to myself in most museums , and it seemed like once i had gotten one docent off my back another was there . their enthusiasm was wonderful , but unfortunately for me it was not contagious .	3461
0	came here 3/16 and checked out the beta fish to find multiple fish dead in the containers , two chinchillas huddled together in a cage with no food , water or shelter , found hamsters in the same conditions as the chinchillas .	2649
0	not impressed . greek pita has better food with much better prices . ambiance is nice but food is meh . we ordered the kefta and chicken kabob plate . both plates came luke warm so we asked them to warm our food which they did . the sauce was just ok . overall . .we wo n't be coming back .	185
1	i 'm a loyal customer - i purchase an average of 4 frames from sassy every year ( have been a customer since they opened the 16th location ) . i sport two looks - a casual look and a professional look . sassy provides both . great range of frames , top quality lenses and superior service . there is nothing to not like about sassy glasses . dan and quida are wonderful to work with and most helpful .	3501
1	i was recently informed that the gnocchi is back on the menu . the last time i had it there it was amazing . it was the perfect texture , not mushy at all . paired with the mushroom alfredo sauce , it is delightful . i 'm glad stella 's brought the entrees back . we will be back soon , i love supporting small businesses that make quality food for everyone 's taste buds .	781
1	love sun nails ! been coming here for many many years . amazing staff , very accommodating , clean facility , newly renovated . i do n't go anywhere else because i dont get the same service elsewhere . definitely one of the busiest and best nail salon in scarborough !	3811
0	any bakery that is by appointment only should not have a huge marquee and have posted on there doors that it is appointment only . and then when you walk in look around confuse a man with a box of raw meat should n't treat you like a hobo looking for a place to squat	981
1	what a great experience ! bought my first car at a dealership thru these guys , made it extremely easy and helped me every step along the way ! they really went the extra mile to find me a good car and get me approved . the location is super clean have solid vehicles available . not pushy and in you 're face . they were straight up with me and made me feel informed . defiantly glad i went and checked them out	3305
1	gorgeous lady did a gorgeous job for eyelashes . originally i was a bit hesitant since there has been no reviews about eyelashes extension . the lady who did my eyelashes is very nice and efficient , and they turn our very well . thanks for the great service !	1051
0	jorge responded quickly when i initially reached out but once he found out it was n't going to be a $ 5000 job , all i needed was maintenance ( trim plants ) to start with , he stopped answering my calls and texts . i do not recommend . it 's getting really hard to find good workers	3727
0	first time here ... sooo rude ! ! went here for dinner and drinks . we open the door and this rude lady comes waving us and shooing us away yelling it was a private party ! how about put a sign on the door ! ! ! we have lots of friends and usually come in groups and spend . what the lady should have done was kindly tell us there was a private party in session and she appreciated us stopping by and to please return again . they have for ever lost me and anyone i know as a customer ! ! ! booo	710
0	cool looking place but about $ 25 for 2 chili dogs 2 fries and some sodas was wayyyyy tooo much money and while it was a cool looking place ... .i would not go back only because of the sky high prices .	953
1	i had dr shaba do a vasectomy and i could n't be happier ! him and his staff really made me feel comfortable before the procedure and it went better than i could have hoped for ! also , i have heard from several friends that their doctors made them feel bad for wanting to do a vasectomy and dr shaba was not like that at all . i would recommend dr shaba for anyone considering this procedure !	2777
0	still on my never ending quest for good chinese food in az i walked in this place . it smelled good so i thought why not . the lady who took my order was n't the friendliest but customer service is dead so ok . i ordered pork fried rice , chicken egg foo young , and orange chicken . i am not pleased . i don'tknow how they did it , the rice tasted burnt . the egg fooo young had big chunks of vegetables , too big , and was flavorless . i will say the orange chicken was meh ok at best . needless to say i will not be back . not good .	1459
0	first and last time going there . employees were n't friendly at all and acted like snobs . employees smelt like they had sour clothes on . girl with over stretched lobes issa wench .	2895
1	i had my eyebrows waxed and tinted by zara today and they look amazing ! all of the ladies were very nice and courteous . seva will definitely be my new spot for my brow styling and i look forward to trying the lashes next week and some of their other services as well . thanks ladies !	3614
1	this is not the place for wimpy car , people who do not like dust , or do not like to do a little manual labor . a nice rock yard that quickly weighs and loads your truck with rock and send you on your way . the selection is decent , i guess there could always be more , but thee stones they have work with the local environment . the y also deliver , but not sure of the minimum requirements . they have big dump trucks , i think they said 20 tons or so . that is a lot of rock .	3824
1	ca n't beat the game deal in the stadium . $ 25 for a large 1 topping and two drinks , with 1 free refill on each ! ! you wo n't eat better or cheaper anywhere else inside that park . pizza is huge and so good ! ! can not wait to try their other locations , because the listed menu is limited in the stadium . still they also have pizza by the slice , salads , hoagies , garlic knots ( which smelled delicious ) and beer specials . you can order ahead of time , and can use the entrance as a gate into the stadium . honestly such a great spot for families at the pirate game ! !	293
0	extremely disappointing sent 3 emails to the office and made calls to there office with no response back . i have a town home i was looking to rent it out but i guess there either to big or busy to respond to my enquire . i guess black and cherry property management will be managing my property .	32
1	good food , do n't know how it compares to the rest of its kind , since i 'm new here . we had pork sinigang w/sili , gabi , tomato & onion , lechon kawali , tortang talong , fried bulaklak . dessert was a little better : halo-halo , buko pandan & my fav . turon w/ube ice cream .	658
0	the potential is there ... they just have n't reached a high point , or middle point yet . it is a beautiful setting , as one would expect of a place boasting of ms. longoria 's name . but salt does not make a bad meal better . beso was the 180 degree opposite of blossom ( http : //www.yelp.com/biz/blossom-las-vegas # hrid : djkoxy3xgsgmjsi5lx6vbw ) in the aria in terms of flavor . the chefs should take turns at each other 's kitchens , and maybe sharing each other 's secrets would help the other out .	971
0	the stars are for friendly , helpful staff and the ultra comfy bed . other than that ... not so great . the bathroom is a conceptual disaster . the shower leaks everywhere . the sliding door looks cool , but provides no sound-proofing , so do n't share it with someone you do n't really love . and weird random housekeeping things happened during our three-night stay : glasses would be taken and not replaced , a rag was left in our room , and our big towels were taken but not replaced . and top it off with how difficult it is to alter a sale reservation ( company-wide problem , not location-specific ) made for a pretty frustrating stay .	2188
1	i have had great success with the products purchased from rc willey . i recommend the store	439
0	kathy is a horrible manager first off . her customer service is absolutely horrible . i had to look at my online order that was supposed to be ready 2 hours ago and told there 's nothing she could do . when i expressed my dismay with other customers we were told we could leave . my problem was rectified by another manager named dennis . dennis is the man and the only reason i will be back to this walmart . he greeted me and reasonably fixed my problem without the hostility kathy had .	2443
0	wow . i bought a non sale jacket on sunday , decided i did n't really like it and went to return with tags and receipt . who knew that they no longer refund your money ? ? ? i knew this about sales items but really ? ? ? that is the last $ 40.99 this shitty store will ever get from me . i was treated like i 'd done something wrong just because i did n't like the crappy quality jacket .	3373
0	i am so disappointed ! i stopped in yesterday to see if they had a boneless turkey breast . the guy behind the counter asked me to come back in 20 minutes and he would have it ready . i assumed it would be an unstuffed boneless turkey breast . when i returned i was pleasantly surprised when he said it was ready and at the cash . i bought it and cooked it tonight with all the thanksgiving trimmings . what he actually gave me was stuffed chicken breast ! what the hell ? ! ? ! i am so angry and will never shop there again . shady business !	3151
1	got a small chicken burrito bowl and small spicy pulled pork burrito . both were delicious but the pulled was definitely the winner ! the ingredients were very fresh , love that the guacamole is free and portions were very generous . but it took awhile after ordering to get our food .	31
0	the bagels are delicious but i 'm a bit concerned about the employees sanitation ignorance at this location . there was an employee handling cash at the register with gloves on & right after i ordered my bagels she went & grabbed the bagels without changing her gloves . i asked her politely to change her gloves & to please get me new bagels . she did it but had an attitude about it . not good..	477
1	had sushi here with a friend who came from ca and stayed at this casino . although sushi took some time to make , rolls came out super fresh and the service was excellent . cozy little place to eat at this casino . very satisfied .	1196
0	wait wait wait . car emissions is a scam just to collect additional money for the state . what ever you do do not go to the full service lane go thru the express lanes .	138
1	a big shout out to reina and lilly thank you so much for helping me pick not one but two really different cool sunglasses , all my friends here in nyc are completely jealous .	2386
0	food is spotty but service is good . kung pao was nice and spicy , on request . another time , the fried rice tasted funny . sad . they never seem to do much business , at least when i 'm there . i 've stopped patronizing this establishment , unfortunately , as the quality of food declined a little too much . also i noticed an unusual smell . not a nice thing to notice in an eating establishment .	1550
1	this is , by far the most amazing botanical gardens i have ever been to . the flowers are incredible , the landscapes are so complex and interesting , and the japanese garden is amazing in the fall with all of the lanterns . if you are planning a trip to montreal , make sure this is a stop on your way and hopefully you 'll be here in the fall for the lanterns . bringing a picnic lunch and a book to read can be the best decision of your vacation .	183
0	i hate to say this , but out of all of the cupcakeries i 've tried , cream & flutter is my least favorite . from frosting to cake ... very disappointing . maybe i should go for a cookie next time ?	3749
1	i had a great experience at red line ! customer service was great , i loved the comfortable feeling when i walked in . my cards were better then i had originally designed and were ready for pick up in no time ! i would recommend this company to anyone looking for a great printer . oh and thanx for the cookies red line ! !	1781
0	waited 15 minutes in the only area that had room to stand . no drinks . then finally a bartender/server comes over , ignores us , and served what seemed to be a regular behind us . very unprofessional . wo n't be back .	3846
0	i popped in for breakfast on a saturday . the atmosphere looked promising , and the service was excellent . sadly , the food was unappetizing . it is difficult to screw up a simple breakfast : scrambled eggs , toast , bacon , and potatoes . nothing tasted fresh , and the quality was equal to a diner two blocks away for half the price . it is unlikely i will eat here again .	1204
1	changing my 1 star review to a 4 star review ! service has improved , staff is delightful , and the kind notes on the cups are a nice touch . happy to see this place improving !	1761
1	we really enjoyed our romantic night out at bonterra . the roasted leek and parmesan dip was delicious ! my steak was well seasoned , served very hot and ended up dry and a bit overdone for being `` med-well '' . i was n't able to enjoy most of the steak but my french martini and appetizer were perfect .	886
0	sold me a supposedly fresh salmon belly last week but it 's rotten . very disappointed ! !	2670
0	very frustrated with jen sias and one of her employees . i know she no longer works there but step up and admit you guys dropped the ball . i have been with you for a long time , i wish there was value in that . you have now lost a customer	2675
1	i ca n't remember our salesperson 's name but she was very sweet and showed us almost every pair of sunglasses in the store until we found one my boyfriend liked . the location is a bit small but they have a good selection of different types of sunglasses .	2676
1	i got my id here when i returned to pa from out of state . i went on a weekday during the day . i did not have a long wait . the employee who assisted me was nice . my id unfortunately printed with a black dot on my photo -- right on my nose . it was not there in real life . just a printer malfunction .	2408
1	this place is amazing ! it was very clean and well decorated . there 's lots of space . i was very happy to see that all of my pedicure utensils came out of an autoclave bag ! they made sure to take their time on my manicure and pedicure . they currently are running 20 % off for all services . i did n't feel rushed and they did a wonderful job . i definitely will be back in the evening to make sure to have a glass of wine while i get my next pedi !	2977
0	they showed up 2 hours late . one guy went home sick in the middle of the move . what should have taken them 1.5 hours to load , they spent 4.5 hours . a lot of our furniture is dinged up . they showed up in a rented 14 foot budget truck for a 2 bedroom apartment . would not recommend .	2119
0	this is the worst bar i ever been to . i felt discriminated against i did n't get any service i was still only minority in the bar bartender kept ignoring me this is some real b*******	792
0	terrible dinner . not the same since they moved ! ! last two orders were not correct . repeated the order 3 times and it was still wrong . they screw up a $ 57 order and offer you a $ 5 credit . jimmy joes you can keep your $ 5 . i wo n't be back .	417
1	the green tea with soy milk . is good.this location has great customer service and fast service	3124
1	we came here for birthday dinner for my daughter to celebrate her 5th birthday . i checked in and was surprised to see that i was able to get a free appetizer because i checked in . we had a good meal but our waitress forgot my husbands one side which was a bowl of chili . the manager fixed it . we had the do the birthday thing they do . which was all fun and such . my husband is a snoot and would n't let me look at the bill only to find out that they never took off the appetizer : - (	1491
0	my son got lice from here , was bitten 5 days in a row and there is no supervision . i feel bad for the staff because the owners do n't do anything but collect checks and delegate all the issues to their employees to fix . i had a box full of diapers that i brought the week before but went `` missing '' when we came to get all of his stuff . the owners would n't even come out of their office to speak to me on our last day there . good luck if you decide to take your child there .	3582
0	hackyos is a cool doc but the front desk people here are a nightmare . the way they bill is insane as well . they really need to scrap the entire team of people answering phones and rehire some people with decent personalities or pay better people more money . its bad .	356
0	had a bad experience , staff there was rude and didnt even acknowledge me coming in , they just stared at me and waited for me to say something , they didnt even ask if i was getting a haircut , made me feel very uncomfortable	1862
1	excellent bellini & calamari ! the service is superb ! the only thing is the wifi was n't working but other than that it 's perfection !	534
1	very easy to navigate store . i 've noticed that clearance items are now being mixed in regular aisles rather then end caps . there 's also a starbucks in this target .	2398
1	this place is swanky : ) we popped in here before our reservation at yardbird and had a few drinks . we got a couch in the middle and could people watch in the bar and the casino . our waitress was very attentive and helpful . i am guessing the later in the night the more of a meat market it was , but early evening was perfectly wonderful !	2513
0	my dad just called to see if my out of state mom could be seen as she has ovarian cancer . she wants to come see her grandsons and get her chemo treatment when she comes . he was told they do not have doctors here that treat that . how does a supposedly major cancer center not have drs that treat ovarian cancer . they did n't really seem to care when he called .	2768
1	got my nails done by t. he did an awesome job . he took his time and my nails look awesome . i did the glitter and it looks fantastic .	2710
1	service was very good and there beer and rum r very excellent if u have not tried here this should be a must for u so enjoy like me and my wife did	1110
0	i came here when they just opened at 8 am on saturday . the people restocking the shelves were extremely rude and unfriendly . one man actually whistled at me . that is completely unacceptable , unprofessional , and disgusting . i 'd give negative stars if i could . i will not come back here .	715
1	i call it the 5 week shellac ! great place for a manicure ! highly recommend . the reason i do n't give it a 5 star rating is i chose to tag on a lip wax one day . she ripped the skin off my upper lip . it was horrible and took 2 weeks to heal . stick to your nails .	1646
0	horrible experience . worst drivers ever , poor customer service and even if you complain about a driver and their actions the manager makes excuses for their behavior . i will never ever ever recommend these people to anyone ! i cancelled my services and the driver tossed my final bottles around like a child having a temper tantrum and they want you to open the doors to these people ? ! yeah . no thanks . you suck .	2519
0	i went here on a wendsday and they had a fight break out at the front door . i was told they had pool tables and it was a chill bar . the security was rude and very unprofessional . i asked if i could play pool they said i would have to pay $ 20 to come in . i asked to speak to the manager and he was very rude . his name is brandon he basically ignored my complaint and went on to smoke his cigarette in my face . never will i go there again . do not go here	2728
1	i 've been a customer of wright 's for 13 years and i highly recommend them to everyone . just found their new store and it 's a definite upgrade . amazing how much bigger they have become . great service . will always come back .	2523
0	terrible food , terrible service . the employees were rude . most of them would n't make eye contact so they did n't have to take your order . ordered a veggie omelette . all i ate was the `` toast '' which was not toasted at all and cold . will never go there again .	701
1	excellent yogurt ; fresh toppings ; clean shop ! would definitely come back here again . i selected the coffee/chocolate/vanilla yogurt combination . very tasty ! i added strawberries , chocolate pieces , chocolate sauce and fresh whipped cream . yum ! the checkout process was fast and easy . fun time for my four year old grandson !	1454
0	got a teriyaki with rice bowl was n't so good the chicken was really sweet and the rice was a bit hard .	1459
0	2 stars young lady hope was very pleasant and helpful . ..they have no clue how to be fashionable with nails , at least my long ones and the shape , i had to file my own nails . very poor on cleaning up your nails , do n't no if it was i 'm so spoiled but i just moved here from la , i always get my nails did . ..lol got dud here	3047
1	russian chocolate babka !	3118
1	pretty much the same prices you 'd find at your neighborhood starbucks for a latte or whatever . in this place , that 's a pretty fair deal . the service was excellent and the latte was really good .	2397
1	pretty good hot dogs . we went on kids eat free day and it was delicious . the inside seating was a bit tight , but if you do n't have a large party you should be fine .	58
0	well ... once again they have raised their prices . asada fries almost $ 10 ... .wow ! hope you price yourself right out of business ... ... .bye the way i really liked the garbage can on the salsa bar counter top ... .health district will love that ! ! got ta nice picture	857
1	an appointment was set up with affirmative air through our home warranty company . they called the same day to set up an appointment for the next day . carson arrived on time , was extremely helpful in explaining the problems with our air conditioning and we felt went above and beyond to help us . he took extra time to go over the mechanics of our system and what he was doing . we were very pleased with his work and the service provided by affirmative air . we did have a question later and called to leave a message at their office . they called us promptly the next morning and helped with our question . we would definitely call them again .	2078
1	sweet mango snow ice ! get in my bellay ! i wish this place existed in america . the ice could 've been better consistency , i admit . but this really hit the spot .	176
1	since the day this place opened , alway had club banging music and regardless the best vibes . always , been greeted with the friendliest and down to earth people . if you ever want a place to start a ypur night at , dunky monks is the place to be at !	3336
0	will never go back . i was with party of 5 . one order was completely missed and the other one was completely wrong . my `` cucumber & tomato salad '' consisted of a large clump of iceberg lettuce cut into 4 pieces , partially brown & wilted . there was 1/2 tomato at best and maybe 4 slices of cucumber . not only were a few orders wrong , but it took a long time to get our uncomplicated order to our table on a very slow , early evening .	58
0	went here with a large group for a birthday and the service was horrible ! it took us forever to get our food and half the orders were wrong . some of the food was delicious ; other food was just okay . it might be better on a weekday but horrible on a sat night .	602
1	they were very helpful today period there was a very long line but they went through it very quickly and efficiently . great job . : - )	1111
1	excellent staff from front desk to medical professional that i did n't wait forever to see . rapid check-in via tablet .	2940
0	this place is the worst . just this week i saw this . a big sign saying no video photography in the work out area . within 5 minutes of being there a trainer with a man bun is videotaping his client and half the rest of the gym in the background . nice . know your own rules and follow them .	392
0	this place is not worth a drive out . very friendly staff but the food is average . its slightly better than chinese food you would get at a mall but there are better places on spring mountain . had the cake noodle which people rave about but its basically crispy chowmein . had cold chicken which was ok if you like that . had fried rice which was average . big wong is much much better and with better prices .	1103
0	the service was absolute garbage . this middle-aged lady with the loudest , most rough sounding voice i 've ever heard was a total nightmare . she snapped her fingers at me and was just a deplorable human being . the wait was over 40 minutes for a carne asada plate . oh , and the actual food was average at best . there was one nicer lady who was super sweet . she was light skinned with big eyes and actually smiled . but i wo n't be back , like , ever .	857
0	cash only , made me pay before i got my nails done , over priced ! the longer i wanted my nails i it would be 10 $ extra ? vacationing from hawaii and i can find better services in hawaii .	2686
0	first off his wife is n't polite . also we were told by their assistant it would be $ 380 fee . i thought that was expensive and she said she would talk to steven m voght to discount me . specially since i was a new client and referred . i found a coupon with 30 % discount . when i went in they changed fee to $ 560 and said already applied the discount . i work over at intel and wo n't be quite sharing my experience to my coworkers we were lied to and cheated by steven voght n company . i will be going back to my original tax guy who charges $ 250 . very unhappy .	3144
0	i 've been going to this practice for over a year now . this is the second time they have charged my card without permission . however this time , i wrote an email in may staring that they did not have permission to charge my card and to please remove it . guess what ? charges and overdraft fees because the money was n't there . i am done with this office !	3349
1	great food ! came in for the egg foo young , and it was fantastic . also tried orange chicken , egg drop soup , hot and sour soup , and was impressed by all . clean , fast , great service . you wo n't be disappointed .	237
0	i realized after the fact i was charged more for services and swayed from getting the package deal i wanted because i was a local , and ended up spending a lot more money on a service .	2651
1	i have decided that boba is not my thing . i find it very odd and do n't particularly care for it . with that being said , the staff was very nice . they knew their stuff and made many suggestions on what to order . while i do n't care for boba , due to staff being so friendly , knowledgeable and keeping the store super clean , i am giving them 5 stars ! if you like boba , i highly suggest you check this place out ! my friends that do like boba , advised that this place is the best .	490
0	i ordered my office meal ... .showed up 15 minutes after the requested pick up time and the order was not started until 35 minutes after pick up time . this is the worst cr in the valley !	1365
1	diva toxxx and the girls were amazing one of the best dtag shows i have seen . next time i 'm in vegas i 'll definitely be there	3661
1	these cleaners are amazing . they got stains out of my shirts after the cleaners across the street were unsuccessful . the staff is very helpful and i had an email that my clothes were ready just a few hours after i dropped them off .	2784
1	i love the retro décor . the retro cocktails are my fave too . the food is great , though the service is n't always the best . sometimes , i feel like the employees are put out because they have to wait on you as the customer 's . other than that , i eat here again .	279
1	this place has a lot of integrity ... you can see it all over the walls around the bar paying their respects to the punk legends . yes , this bar is badass !	2045
0	worst pool service i have ever had . they tried to charge me $ 99 for a float switch . it 's a $ 6 item and screws into the side of inlet . once i noticed the charge and declined the install they did it anyway . overpriced and no service .	3479
0	it was just ok . cute little spot when you walk in . ordered a variety to share and it was n't blow your mind , different , just very traditional , simple ingredient pizzas . could have had a decent sit down meal at a little trattoria for the price . service was bland and no ambience whatsoever . maybe ok for takeout but pricy .	923
1	what a great store . you can find mostly anything in this store . i really like the auto care center . bought my tires for my car there . great deal ! best deals on groceries and clothing . displays are always changing in this place . the thin crust pizza from the bakery/deli is actually really good . all your shopping needs under one roof .	2443
1	this is my very first review on yelp . i 'm writting it so everyone knows what a great job universe landscape & design does , jorge ( owner ) is very profesional , nice , personable and comunicative . his work reflects the vision i have for our pathway with the stepping stones he help us to choose . thank you jorge , you are one of a kind !	3727
1	wow . the manager of this place , and it 's employees are outstanding . did n't try to sell me a bunch of stuff i did n't need . very impressed with how the manager runs this place . honest , over the top service . i 'll be back . made a believer out of me . old management was terrible . the new guy in town is awesome , helpful and more than anything ... .cares about the customer .	2542
0	2nd time coming and the sushi was horrible . maybe it was an off night but the quality of the fish was very poor . the rolls were bland . i mean , their baked green mussels were so watered down and gamey that i had to spit it out . and it took the waitress at least 15 minutes just to get us water . i live down the street from this place but i would rather drive an extra 20 minutes just to enjoy sushi elsewhere .	408
0	i wish i would have seen the comments in yelp before ordering- that 's the most pathetic mexican food i had ever ! never ever try it here ! they made it horrible with no taste ! i ordered enchiladas and they put some weird tasteless sauce ! beans as side were just boiled with no taste !	1071
1	we went with very dear friends last night , and found savoy to be fabulous ! we dine out quite often , but it was our first time here . the atmosphere is very chic , intimate and unique . i ordered the butternut squash chocolate raviolis with lobster claw cream sauce , and my husband had the veal meatloaf . they were outstanding ! desserts were perfection as well . the chef came out to make sure we were satisfied with everything , and treated us like old friends . everyone seemed to take pride in their jobs . i would recommend savoy to anyone for an incredible dining experience ! a real asset to the 'burgh dining experience . joel and sue frye	714
1	best gym in akron ohio . great staff , excellent trainers , and very affordable . brian the gym manager is very helpful and answers to all patron needs . not only is the staff amazing , but the newly renovated facility as well .	2063
0	roberto 's is roberto 's . but this roberto 's always looks horrible . never clean . all tables are always covered with crap . but i guess that 's how it is lol .	322
1	awesome flavors , atmosphere & customer service ! highly recommend ! ! fun games to play too like corn hole , giant jenga , and more ! ! oh and open until 11pm for those late night cravings whoo hoo	1903
1	took truck in to have a broken turn signal bulb replaced . clean store , friendly staff . mark webb the store manager , made sure that we were taken care of . not only was the bulb replaced but all of the fluids were checked , and tire pressure as a courtesy check . entire staff was very friendly and courteous . manager took the time to explain what the issue was so we totally understood the problem . will highly recommend and return for all our vehicle needs . worth the short trip from waxhaw , nc richard and barbara allen	946
0	i do a lot of costum work on cars and boats and mainly shopped at this establishment because it was on the way home . almost every time i purchased something on sale it never rang up correctly at the front desk . and the only reason i know this is because i would only buy something that was on sale . their prices are extremely inflated ! it was not surprising to pay 5x as much for an item . i have no clue how this place is still in business . maybe there are enough people that do n't care about value to keep this place going .	3876
0	i had an everything bagel with herb and garlic cream cheese $ 4.75 and a large drip coffee $ 2.50 + tax . the coffee is terrible . it might have been a bad day for coffee . the bagel was dense and chewy which was great , but the toppings included large pieces of salt like a pretzel that i did not enjoy . the cream cheese was extra herby which was a bit intense . i would eat the bagels here again but try a different kind . i will not be drinking the coffee .	995
0	i went to get a meatball cone and they no longer carry it . my friends and i left because that was the only reason we went to fidelli . i wo n't be going back unless they bring back the meatball cone .	712
1	this location has `` world-class service '' . i used to come to this location five days out of the week and they knew what i wanted or took a guess at some of my favorite choice of beverages ! multiple employees remembered my name ! very impressive ! then i stopped coming there everyday because money got tight ! when i did come they still remembered my name !	3396
1	this lvac location is great . always clean , and the staff is very helpful . the playroom is very clean as well and my 6 year old daughter enjoys it here too . the variety of fitness classes are great .	3268
1	this hotel met or exceeded my expectations in all respects . it was clean and breakfast was solid . i did n't use any other amenities , so i ca n't speak to them one way or another . i 'd most certainly stay there again !	3434
1	my lady and i went to living spaces store on bell rd to look at couches . when we walked in we were greeted and told the sales people do not work on commission which was very good to know . i showed the sales lady the couch we were interested in . she checked the store availability and said we could drive to the latham street location for the couch , which we did . upon arrival to the store we received a warm welcome . we purchased the couch for a very reasonable price . we waited for 20 minutes for the couch to be pulled and loaded in vehicle . very nice shopping experience .	2071
0	bought a used 2015 ultra limited from lvhd in january . i traded in a 2010 ultra classic in excellent condition . a trade i regret . be very cautious when buying a used bike from lvhd . the service department failed to properly get the bike in working order before putting it on the floor . cosmetically it looked good , but i 've been having problems since day one which has already cost me $ $ $ ... i 'm going to get my service done at another harley dealership in vegas .	3078
0	always get a second opinion . i had multiple repairs done by this company that i found out later were unnecessary . overall it was my fault for not getting a second opinion in the first place . their management addressed our concerns after the fact and , to their credit , did give us a partial refund for one of the repairs . we 've still opted for another company to take over as our primary ac maintenance provider . my ac is working better now than it ever has which i think speak volumes .	2031
1	the best mexican tacos in vegas ! customer service is what matters ! ! avocados are fresh too ! ; )	857
0	i think the minimum wage has taken its effect . longest , slowest moving line ever . also ... .at 10 am they hardly had any donuts left .	1774
0	stay away ! ! ! i 've only received a handful of mani/pedis in my life , but this was by far the worst . the guy was more interested in the basketball game than in doing my nails . he was watching tv while he was scrubbing my feet and scraped both of my legs with the scrubber ( i actually have scrape marks on both legs ) ; he was sloppy with the polish ; and just generally rough and inattentive . then , i asked for a `` man 's '' manicure and he cut my nails square and proceeded to practically burn through my nails with the dremel . what a nightmare ! ! ! never again !	1272
0	filthiest movie theatre i 've been to in a long time . no staff to clean the theatre , seats with used 3d glasses and used cups . washroom was filthy . 15 $ for a movie is not without the expectation of at the very least a clean seat . a blemish on your brand .	3728
1	the pickled peach is one of my favorites ! their sandwiches , soups , salads and even cold case items are absolutely delish ! if i were to take one star away , it would be due to the cost of the food . while i love it and am willing to pay it from time to time , lunch for two with a glass of wine is easily $ 40.00	1238
0	the lady at the front desk was very nice ! unfortunately , that 's where the `` good '' ended . i had to wait 20 minutes after my scheduled appointment time ( which i understand completely ) but i felt like the stylist was rushing my appointment . my highlights also ended up very brassy - not a good look on naturally dark hair . i hate to be the debbie downer but i 'll take my business elsewhere .	3621
0	do n't waste your money . i have been in here three different times trying to give the benefit of the doubt to the company . i figured at first that it was them being busy or new employees or maybe it was just that i was not an established customer as to why i did n't get good service . the third time should be the charm . not here . i called after leaving because i did n't want to cause a scene in front of current customers . however , they cared so little that they did n't bother to ask my name . there was no apology offered . it was simply `` i 'll let the manager know . ''	786
1	fantastic ramen . possibly best in phoenix area so far . kara age chicken is great too . order nishikawa black	131
1	i headed to the minute clinic to get a flu shot . it was a pretty quick and easy process . you sign in on a computer , which takes 5-10 minutes . depending on how many people are there , you might have to wait . i just waited a couple minutes , then headed in and got a flu shot . the nurse practitioner was really friendly and nice . she also commended me repeatedly for getting a flu shot , and who does n't like positive recognition ?	3830
0	the food was just awful ! i 'm not one to complain but the steak sandwich was worse then something they feed in a jailhouse . there are plenty of better options in cave creek , this place should fail soon ! ! !	211
1	robert from anthony 's plumbing came out and inspected our pipes that had a clog and he was nothing short of spectacular ! very personable , knowledgeable and didnt mind listening to my wife talk his ear off for nearly 2hrs lol..i 'd recommended to anyone with a plumbing issue ! very kind staff and very affordable .	2614
0	do not go here , do not even cosider it for a second . overpriced , shoddy work and complete lack of customer service should be enough to convince you . please see the other 40 reviews that do not recommend this sad business . they are blatant liars and moving locations will hopefully not fool new customers .	2523
1	the guys at the location were very helpful and informative for me and my installers . the prices were great , you just need to double check the inventory when you have a time crunch . thanks , kyle !	2763
1	great stay . personnel very friendly and helpful . ala carte breakfast very good and cooked to order . hotel was clean and bright .	1633
0	just picked up food from there . they forgot one order of meatloaf so i waited 5 minutes for them to bring that out , then when we got home they had forgotten the veggie burger . when i called up to let them know i spoke with joe the manager he said he said `` we got slammed with a bunch of tables and he would go put the order in '' then hung up on me . most managers apologize and try to make it up for screwing up an order being that one person has to eat 20 minutes after everyone else . but joe probably came from managing a taco bell . will never go again and would not recommend to anyone .	970
0	yonge & bloor - -worst experience ever with this optical . they have had crazy turn over for staff recentley and none of the employees would put my new perscription on file and i had to bring 3 different copies before it was in my file . -i also ordered a years worth of contacts and they were shipped but never arrived after 2 weeks . -they never answer the phone and its a new person every time i go down to the store . never coming back	2979
1	first time going today and i definitely will be coming back ! ! i got a pedicure and a full set , and both of my nail techs took their time and did an amazing job ! ! the salon is very nice and clean ! ! and the people are friendly and welcoming ! ! love this place !	3509
1	came in here after going to another shop being unhappy and loved it . made an appt with alex the owner and a soon as my son and i walk in the door they all say hello and ask if i got an appt . not a long wait and one i the barbers came up to me offered me coffee . my son and i both got haircuts and both turned out great by alex . definately coming back 100 %	3469
1	i 've been to lush a handful of times . this is probably the only store that i will be able to justify the price tag . lush is a very ethical company that supports the environment and animal rights . the staff are always friendly and willing to help . the store can be very intimidating but the staff will help you understand and do so in a kind way . they often have expos of the bath bombs . you can sample any of the locations and soaps . if you have sensitive skin , are looking for an all natural soap or want a relaxing bath bomb this is a good store to shop .	2150
0	run from this place the sales people will lie to make the sale . i was improperly informed about the restock fee and how it works the fine print is absolutely designed to cost you hundreds of dollars ... its a scam	312
0	showed up for a massage that i booked . i am currently 30 week pregnant and have been coming to get massages since 12 weeks . i have filled out numerous pregnancy waivers and received massages . today they refused to see me because they have no prenatal certified therapists.. come to find out my last therapist was n't even prenatal certified . extremely disappointed in this location . massage envy , whatever link you added below goes no where . update it 's been almost a week and still have n't been contacted by the manager ... smh	2252
0	one of the worst front office staffs ever in medical history . patients are treated poorly and totally disrespected . there is something wrong when patients are treated like faceless cows . the doctor and pa are good but getting to them is really unprofessional . bad experience .	3566
1	greasy but delicious ! the lettuce wrap burger falls apart and gets all over my hands but it 's worth it .	1315
0	it 's denny 's ! friendly service , food was meh ? nothing to write home about , my bfast potatoes we hot and ice cold ... wanted to b**ch but just passed on eating them and left ...	346
0	stick to the sisig dishes . everything else whatevers . not the best filipino food in town but it will do if you need some drinks and want pulutan . i think this is a lot better than café moda . service is really slow here , even when the place is empty . this place really needs some updates on the décor though . its old looking and seems like there is always a broken chair or table . the booths def need a facelift .	817
1	great service from a salesman dave and they delivered as promised !	3738
0	the worst place you can work with . specially an employee called lynn . i will never go there again .	2380
1	my boyfriend and i happened to stumble upon this place while we were across at joe 's grotto . little red door just in the corner of the complex , but man was it a great discovery ! the food here is superb , reminiscent of the chinese restaurants we frequented when living in l.a. food is served quickly along with tea . we always get the peking dinner because it 's such a great value for how much food you get ! there 's always enough for lunch the next day and you know that chinese food is always good the next day !	1264
1	this is not homemade food . this is a chain restaurant . that being said , it 's a good one . i really like their pizza . maybe its something they put in the crust but they keep me coming back for more .	705
0	0 stars . not being from toronto , i enquired with the locals as to where i could find a nice pub . imperial pub came highly recommended . did n't try the food , but i am never coming back here , and i am actually recommending others do n't either . owner/manager is quite an asshole . i actually witnessed him lunge at and physically assault a young woman outside the pub this week . wtf ? thanks for the recommendation , toronto . many other places nearby without the violence .	1091
1	good job ! it 's mid day saturday 2 weeks before x mas . smiling staff greeting customers as they 're ringing up sales ? check . abundant staff all acknowledging customers where ever they see them ? check . guy busy unloading pallets of dog food , stop to smile , say `` hello '' and ask if i needed any assistance ? check . store spotless and neatly arranged ? check check ... petsmart , kudos on being well prepared for the hollerday crush !	3094
1	so this was my first year coming to the arizona state fair ... i had a good time and enjoyed it , the only thing is that the fair is expensive ! ! we already planned for next year though , to go when they are selling the unlimited rides bracelet because getting on the rides with bought tickets is ridiculous ! i bought 100 tickets for 50 $ but some rides were up to 20 tickets a piece ! no thank you ! the fair is fun and all but next year ill be sure to take more money : )	2076
1	regular burger was delicious ! among the best i 've ever had : ) soft , juicy meat and bun - only thing was the portion was on the small side . fries were average , onion rings over done . loses a star based on price ( $ 25+ for 1 person ) and lacklustre fries	1417
0	overpriced and the worst pad thai i have had in a while . i think there are much better options out there .	1361
1	i have been here twice in the past few months . people seem pretty friendly , but i think the parking should be free .	2081
1	these guys are superior ! super friendly and they try their best to get u the best price and service . my father was in this business for over 30 years . these guys are super trustworthy !	2123
1	had a nice breakfast this morning with the family . alex , our server , was very friendly and patient . she always had a smile on her face . nick , the manager , was also super accommodating and helpful . food was excellent ! we 'll be back soon .	1267
1	i 'd give the wings a b+ . they are a good size and served nice and saucy . the fries were also very good . service was fast and very friendly lots of tv 's and they have the play by play on for leaf games . the only real disappointment is the beer selection ... .only 1 or 2 imports/craft breweries .	1292
0	i order from this location and another near my work all the time . same order every time ; this delivery was disgustingly soggy ! ! ! they also gave me the wrong flavor chips . makes me wonder if they just threw together someone else 's abandoned order ? what i do know is i 'm going on an anti-jimmy 's diet for a while after that tragic mess	1475
0	family run business would sound good , but not the case . the owner linda , ex can can performer as you can see on the walls of the shop , not the best people skills . rented 2 different mailboxes for 2 different time periods , never got email to renew it , got charged $ 15 for late fee , so i let her keep the $ 15 and not go back to get another box for $ 100 . take my business somewhere else for the $ 15 she wanted .	1393
0	sooo sorry i bought a crv here . not happy with the vehicle and very very unsatisfied with the service . bought the car at the end of december . i work from home , park in a garage , so never had the need to use the rear windshield wiper until march . it did n't even touch the window . sunnyside 's fix was to physically bend the wiper . still did n't clean the window . when i finally had a chance to bring it in , they ca n't do anything for me because it 's bent ! unbelievable ! if i could give their service department negative stars i would .	3074
0	between unnecessary and expensive service work and the feeling that every time you show up for service its a nuisance these service guys have to put up with has left me no choice to leave a 1star review . it sucks that they suck because i do n't know of another land rover in town but i just ca n't afford to waste my time or money here anymore , and neither should you .	2659
0	no cook no food after 10 ? dumb . get drunk though . kitchen closed go eat somewhere else .	49
0	the crepe was tough and felt old . what a disappointment as the reviews looked promising	1821
0	went to her new dog wash on eastern .. they are 20 for self wash which is ridiculous in itself . they dont keep it clean and they dont have the best shampoos . i believe i spoke to the owner because she was very rude and defensive . they dont have proper holsters for multiple dogs . .. i had to ask for a waterproof cape after i was soaked . after being washed my dogs still do n't smell clean after their shampoo . overall worst experience .	2324
1	a vip barbershop is great . i got my hair cut for $ 20 without waiting long , and it looked exactly how i wanted . the style of the shop is traditional , and rich who cut my hair was very nice . i will be coming back .	1708
1	my favorite thai place in charlotte ! ! ! my family and i love asian food and eat here all the time ( and have for years ) ! beautifully decorated with great service and outstanding , authentic thai food ! their pad thai is phenomenal , and i love the panang curry ! also do n't forget to get some delicious thai tea and mango sticky rice dessert ! : )	895
1	we had a large party come in before the game this past weekend and the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly . they got us in an area that fit all of us and the service , drinks and food were fantastic , even with a packed house . i will go back when i visit pittsburgh !	2532
1	awesome dentist . quick , efficient cleaning , and very friendly staff . dr. badalmenti fixed a cavity for me in no time at all . terrific experience	3163
1	researched cameras online to the point of exhaustion . john mcdonough , my sales assistant , was patient and helpful while i looked and asked questions . i then left , researched more , and came back today . john again helped me , this time with my purchase of the camera i landed on . happy with my purchase experience . no hard sell , just help when i needed it .	2477
0	lifesavers- short on time and desperately in need of gel mani and a pedi , they had one person do my mani while the other did my pedi . thanks ! ! ! ! ! -- sept 2014 update : it really depends when you go and who you get . it 's good in a pinch , but the last time i had a bad pedi and not so happy ... .	2390
1	this place is awesome . i go allllll the time . they have awesome brands i love like urban decay . they also have cheaper brands like nyx . i love that you can try anything out . it helps me decide whether to buy it or not . and i always use the coupons i get in the mail and get really good deals .	2479
0	they advertised a cheap daily rate on a mustang so i rented it . i needed to keep the car 2 extra days . everytime i call their automated system i get a `` system error can not complete '' . my contract said extra days were charged the same as my daily rate so no biggie . until i get to the airport and return the car . my $ 113 rental ballooned to $ 300 . there were so many fees and charges i couldnt understnad any of it , including a $ 30/day late fee ( which is no where on my contract ) . and btw they still use 1980s dot matrix printers .	3129
0	i love texas roadhouse but i 'm so disappointed with my visit tonight . we specifically asked for a table ( no booth ) and they put us in a booth a stuck a chair at the end . it was n't like they were so busy a table was n't available . more important ... .how do you run out of baked potatoes and sweet potatoes by 8pm on saturday ? you 're open until 11pm ! ! ! someone failed at their job . so disappointed . on top of that , no one came by to fill our beverages . even after we asked no one came by . the bucket of peanuts was empty and we had an empty ketchup bottle .	560
1	great salon ! everyone is genuinely really nice , especially the owner . anna is very sweet - my nails always look great ! definitely my go to nail salon .	415
0	honestly i only come her in the morning and they never have enough people working to take care of all the people coming in for the morning rush . i come here usually at 730 in the mornings during the week and the line is pretty long with only two cashiers . the gas station is n't even long enough to hold the number of cars but i understand that . you ca n't make parking . however you can have enough people working.. if i had another option , i would go there ..	2273
0	after a horrible experience with their fan expo food truck i decided to give them one more try at their beaches location . i ordered a vegetarian burrito and it was the worst burrito i 've ever had . it was extremely bland and filled with plain rice . some of the rice was under-cooked and was still crunchy . there was a tiny bit of cheese and a lot of burrito sauce which just tasted like mayonnaise . as for vegetables there was only 2 skinny slices of roasted red pepper and a small amount of corn and black beans . not much for a vegetarian burrito . there 's nothing gourmet about this place !	65
0	the hours at this starbucks are not reported correctly every time i have been there it is closed . today the employees were working but door was locked and it said closed at 5 when the yelp app reports 8pm .	2950
0	i ordered flowers through 1-800-flowers and the order was fulfilled through this location . i 've attached pictures of what i ordered versus what was received . do n't expect to get what you paid for , and do n't expect for any issues to be resolved in a timely manner if you use this florist . after calling back 4 times over the course of the past week , the redelivery is supposed to be today before 4pm . i sincerely hope that they redeem themselves , i 'll post an update once the new bouquet is received . edit : the replacement flowers arrived and were not disappointing . too bad this is n't what was received the first time .	38
0	horrible management from pam . she is extremely rude and snappy at customers . she needs to learn the law and customer service skills . sad it took someone to get bit by a dog after 6 months of me complaining for it to be taken away . although i still think the dog is there since this person gets favoritism . this park would get 5 stars if pam was n't the property manager .	2622
0	i 've been going to the science center since i was a kid and to say i was disappointed is an understatement . i understand that the center is geared towards children but i would expect for at least the exhibits to work . it was incredibly boring , dirty , and primitive . with all the money the museum receives one would expect them to keep up with the technology that is presented today . i will not be back until some type of renovation has been done .	3891
1	absolutely love how fresh the food is . i had a strawberry , banana smoothie and a `` burrito bowl '' . delicious . portions are decent and kept me full for a couple of hours . the environment was also welcoming and clean .	9
1	great burger joint..cool place , very pleasant staff . it 's a good organic restaurant for all health conscious peeps . they have organic beer as well ! ! fries is tasty and came with a curry sauce and a special sauce which tastes pretty good . we had the el matador burger which is from a bison 's meat , topped with cheese curds , pickled jalapeño , spicy pico de gallo , guacamole , and brioche bun= heavenly tasty ! ! if you like exotic meat like from the elk , wild boar , bison , duck , turkey , ect..this is the perfect place ! !	1417
0	horrible ! ! ! ! their policy is you try on 3 wigs for $ 5.00 ... do n't let me put you out if i want to try on 4 wigs ... very rude especially the owner who laughed as i asked him if helps or participates with the local cancer groups . do n't expect any good customer service ... ..	2826
1	the service was good ! the girl at the register was super nice and patient with us . the food was high quality as well , pretty good . i 'll be honest though it was way too pricey ! $ 25 for 2 burgers and fries ? ! ? not even some type of gourmet style just normal burgers ? i 'm sorry but next time i want a burger i 'm going to save my money and go to in n out for double the amount of food for half the price . nothing against this five guys location in particular , just feel like the franchise in general is very overrated for how freaking expensive it is .	116
1	i like this target , i know where things are . it 's a bit untidy though , that 's my only complaint	1815
1	been getting my hair cut at roberts hair salon for over two years about every two weeks . he consistently gives me a great fade every time for a good price . i will continue having roberts cut my hair as long as i live in the area .	1117
1	mike in service has taken care of our murano for years . miguel sold us a great preowned honda mo included the best warranty . we will always buy our cars from this dealership . it is worth the drive !	394
1	the bus was on time coming and going from milwaukee and the the wifi was good enough to run youtube on my tablet . for $ 20 this is a good alternative to get over to milwaukee if it is for the airport or for other purposes . i will be using this service again .	3132
0	worst einstein 's i 've ever been to . terrible attitudes from the staff , very poorly run . constantly standing around talking and eating behind the counter while the cafe is covered in crumbs and dirty tables . i would name names but there were no name tags on but the girl wearing the hat was the worst . very rude answering our questions and did n't even get our order correct . will not be coming here again . you need to have better management here .	3571
1	absolutely the best ! i can spend hours here . they are family friendly with weekly activities for kids . they inspire me to do more then i already do . i wish this was my personal garage .	2601
0	stay away . just disgusting ! ! ! ! never come here ! ! ! ! my eyebrows were fine but i 'm not picky . the reason for the terrible review is because of the personal hygiene that the staff holds for themselves . i could smell the lunch that she had probably eaten hours ago off of her hands and every breath that she took while working so closely to my face . to top it off she was also sick and blowing her nose with tissues that she had in her pocket without bothering to sanitize her hands before touching my face again . before taking my credit card she also sneezed in her hands without sanitizing them afterwards .	460
1	came to cash my check to pay an overdraft and the clerk said no you have to deposit it and the funds wo n't be available till tomorrow go to bank of america they can cash it for you . wth ? ? so i left very upset , sat in my car for a minute then i went back and signed in to speak with a manager . carmen martinez the branch managerwas so understanding . amazing cs she cashed my check . thank you ! now i can pay my bills on time .	2761
1	my local target , here every week it seems like and have always been treated great . ca n't go wrong with the selection and the store is clean . just re-did the wine section and noticed compared to other targets they carry more clothing selection ( at least for their men 's goodfellow ) which i did n't expect , even the website did n't carry the selection they had on the shelves . only stinker , is now that i have a child i noticed they do not have a family restroom . do n't let that stop you though , get yourself a bag of popcorn and stroll through the store .	2411
1	stumbled into this place before going to see a show at the theatre next door . wow , were we ever in for a treat ! we shared 5 tapas dishes , which was lots of food for 2 people . our taste buds were exploding ! every dish had the most amazing and powerful flavour . the salad was to die for , and so were the prawns and curry sweet potato poutine . the waitress was super helpful and nice , especially since it was our first time here and the menu takes a bit of explaining . prices are very reasonable given the quality of food . i 'm so glad we found this place . ca n't wait to be back !	688
1	visited from tampa and this is one of my favorite bars i 've visited . the old , dark cozy ambiance was great ! the beer selection was outstanding and next time i come to toronto i will visit again !	3344
1	they do a great job ! but can be a little slow so make sure you plan for that ! but overall a great , clean spa !	744
0	i called about a very mature tree ( over 40 feet ) leaning over and asked about supporting it . i was upsold for extensive other work and told the tree should not be supported , but just some branches thinned for its `` sail . '' i paid for all the extra work and that on the particular tree . my mature tree fell over today . i will not be calling them back .	3664
0	i 'm korean and this probably is the worst korean restaurant i 've been too . the food is very bland and has zero taste . i do n't know how this place is rated 4 stars .	435
0	i liked my visits with dr. monroe . she was thorough and knowledgeable . my problem is with payment . as a cash pay i was quoted for lab bills and paid them directly to the doctor 's office . she did not subsequently pay the lab and i now have a collection ! it 's a shame i now have to find a new doctor .	3323
1	stopped in for a late lunch today , sandwich was great ( i had the beach club with sprouts ) , restaurant was clean and service was quick and friendly . i noticed that he young man who seemed to be the manager or shift leader was very involved with the guests as well as his employees . overall great experience .	1340
1	used vivid about 3 times now and adam over there handled it . got a mixed up order once and he made it right immediately and always makes sure the order is processed right and that you get what you are buying . thanks for all your help ! dave	978
0	coffee was great . but service not . i do n't think the cashier likes to be working today and having bad day but i do n't think customer should experience her bad day . hope they see the review and make correction	3669
0	when you depend on the appliance repair service the most , appliance doctor is a big let down . i had setup an appointment through whirlpool service agent on monday for appliance doctor to repair my refrigerator . i even called appliance doctor to confirm the appointment for thursday . a broken refrigerator is one of the most painful appliance to have break down . so when thursday came , no one showed up . i called and was told that they decided earlier in the week to cancel my appointment . no notice given at all . i ca n't believe a business can operate this way and can get away with it .	2660
0	honestly was a little disappointed with cafe darak got the oreo latte and the iced caramel macchiato . it was very sweet even though i got 1/2 sweetness and you could barely taste the coffee in it just had artificial flavoring taste . overall i would skip it not missing out .	2219
0	the sushi chief is extremely unprofessional . i brought my son here a week ago and the sushi chief gave my 14 yr old son a dirty look . i was not aware of it at the time because my son did n't tell me till layer that day . in the past i came here by self and experienced the same problem but i thought maybe he was just having a bad day . i was wrong ! the lunch special is a complete rip off . i highly do n't recommend this place . skinnyfat is next door and there customer service is amazing !	985
1	this place is awesome , and i can happily say ive been to over the past two decades . i 've been here for everything from clothing sales , to concerts , to car shows , to our company holding a christmas party here . the venue is absolutely fantastic to come and visit for any reason , absolutely immaculately clean , lots of room , and the staff are always friendly , always working hard and always willing to help . parking is absolutely free , and has lots of transit options , with go train/bus service as well ! if you have the opportunity to come out to this venue for any reason , do it !	382
0	ok . this is obviously not the cadillac ranch anymore , but the mechanical bull is still there . and the prices too . the food is not terrible nor is it tasty either . just average . which is strange because it is eye appealing . just the taste is not there . i recommend going else where overall .	341
1	my good friends ordered me an almond and fresh raspberry baby shower cake . it was absolutely beautiful and delicious . i do n't usually enjoy cake ! thank you bittersweet 's !	2958
1	visited stool and dinette factory on friday . ..the largest selection of barstools and dinettes in phoenix that i 've seen ... and i 've been shopping . ... ..very friendly saleswoman helped me ... .really nice comfortable store ... found just what i was looking for ... .great experience !	1784
0	the nastiest tacos i have ever tasted , no phone number on the receipt to call to tell them $ 12 spent on garbage.buy at your own risk . i promise , its worse than jack in the box tacos . they should be shami to sell thay mess . pissed to know people eat that and or not warned about it . their license should be revoked ! !	760
1	my son who is 6 yrs old loves this school . he was so nervous at first and was n't sure if he could finish the entire class but thankfully , his teacher stephanie was so great at helping him overcome his fears and was able to let my son learn and have fun at the same time . the place was really clean , staff was very friendly and met a lot of great people in this place . i would definitely recommend this place for families who want their kids to learn how to swim . i 'm definitely enrolling my son again this month .	2856
0	i must say i was disappointed with the lunch i bought for $ 9.00 ... a quiche with salad.more like salad with gobs of oil and a quiche the size of a tart.also my mug had a long dark crack in it which invites bacteria . loved this place before desserts still look good coffee place needs a thorough cleaning upgrade ripped chairs . only meant to help with the comments . sometimes places rest on there past laurels and need to see changes required .	2163
0	food was n't very good . wo n't be coming here ever again . pad thai pasta were stuck together and it was just a gooey mix of a mess . the reason they got a star is for the dumplings . that was the only decent thing .	1459
0	let me start by saying this place has the most rude staff . also , if i 'm going to pay for overpriced candy it should at least be fresh . we got gummy worms and a few other types of candy , the gummy worms had a good flavor but they were hard !	3722
1	raised their prices starting november 2016 buy their shawarma wraps are filling , healthy and flavourful . $ 10 per wrap and try heir been samosas ; spicy and will clear you out . i remember working downtown and if i was hungover or felt like shit , this place would set me straight . bathroom is small but they have a dyson .	1206
1	went in here to get my passport photo . the lady was kind and speedy . it took less than ten minutes total from the time i walked in to the time i walked out . really happy !	1374
0	this place sucks , the workers are a joke up at the registers , today was the best yet . 3 idiots who did n't have enough money were going thru their bags and bitch***about 3 dollars.the cashier went back and forth to the manager several times.he then started playing with his cell phone and opening a water to drink at the register , no help or care by the management as we were there in line for 30 minutes and it was a very big issue to turn around in a handicapped cart . will not be going to that place in the gutter again	2882
1	definitely an old-school movie theater . i would give it three stars but the price is so darn good , they deserve a fourth star . literally $ 2 for a movie ! place could use some tlc but overall they were making it as clean as they could . i did n't really appreciate that the screen had a couple of black splotches on it that i kept seeing during the movie but like i said , $ 2 . very friendly employees and would definitely go back for an old cheap movie .	3927
1	thank god i found this place . i drive all over town for work and i never know where i 'll be each day . i have a l5 injury and workout so i need a ton of help to keep moving . i 'm a big guy and dr. pete is really good at keeping me healthy . my better half has an account and needs a softer touch and that 's the great thing about them , you can pick between the doctors .	2464
1	we had a work event at top golf today and we had an amazing time . the staff were friendly and extremely accommodating . the food was delicious and well prepared and the golfing was great fun . i would highly recommend this facility to everyone that i know . melissa in event planning was amazing and she made our event go off without a hitch . we will definitely be coming back for future work events	1483
1	i was skeptical going to a school bc i did n't have a great experience last time i went to one but traci n. did an amazing job all around . i felt comfortable the whole time , she took her time , asked all the right questions , and listened to my needs . i got a full highlight from groupon . everyone came over to see what a great job she did on my hair . i will def be back to see her ! thanks traci !	354
1	very good massage ! the manager provided us with very detailed information about the location of the store and even we arrived earlier than our reservation time we were able to get our massage right away . overall very good experience .	2399
0	i had a tumor removed . i 'm uninsured and low-income . i received a price quote prior to the surgery , and the quote included everything - surgery , labs , followup . when i had the surgery , suddenly , when i checked out , the price was $ 200 higher . i did n't have a choice , so i paid it . now i just found out that they tacked another $ 100 on top of that because they `` forgot '' to bill for the lab fee . the medical care was high quality , but the billing department is repeatedly rummaging around in the pockets of the poor . i 'll probably be looking for a new dermatologist .	2099
1	all i can say is delicious ! ! ! ! we ordered the watermelon sweet , sweet box coffee , and strawberry latte .	1821
1	this is my go-to spot for pizza and wings . ca n't go wrong with these prices . wings are amazinggggg . not a dine-in spot , just a great place to get good pizza and wings and go .	810
1	going to purchase a car is usually right up there with a root canal . not so this go around . had to buy something quickly since i totaled my car and had my eye on a mazda or vw . worked with taylor stephens who was the antithesis of your stereotypical car salesman . very honest , upfront and knowledgeable i felt totally at ease purchasing a car from berge . overall a great experience if you need a new car stop by berge and ask for taylor . he will treat you right	2816
1	i really like this part of town ... the sams clubs are always busy though ... its best to go in the morning because after the afternoon the lines start getting long ! and people in line have alot of item so you can imagine just how long it takes ! overall everything seems clean and they have a great freindly staff ...	2556
0	renters from one of their properties damaged our new fence and moved out . this rental company has been dodging my complaint for over 2 months ! their property manager , warren palmer , is truly irresponsible and lazy when it comes to resolving an issue	3536
0	i get a reminder call for my appointment . i call the office and i 'm on hold for five minutes only to get an answer and be put on hold again ! my dr. is great been visiting this practice for 15 years . the front office needs a lot of work . time to look for another dr .	3349
1	excellent customer service . my car was taken care of very quickly and efficiently . they really made my experience painless . i would definitely use them again if needed .	1926
1	did n't have very high expectations based on the reviews and then was pleasantly surprised by the meat buns ! pretty juicy ! xiaolongbao is also soupy with nice , thin crust . also loved the dry pot with mixed mushrooms . i think you ca n't go wrong ordering what they 're known for . do n't go for the canto/taiwanese stuff .	943
0	i was seen here today by np rebecca gonzales . she is unfriendly , uncaring and unprofessional . i felt like she was annoyed that i was there . she did not bother to hear/listen to me about my illness . she had her mind made up and that was it . i would avoid going to this location again if needed so that i would not have to be seen by her . the rest of the staff was professional and friendly and the facility was clean .	2906
0	we used titan for one of our rental properties . they did a satisfactory job . a couple of months later , the tenant complained about some water blotching and we called titan and requested that they go back out to the house . their customer service department is horrible . it was like pulling teeth trying to get an inspector to schedule an appointment with our tenant . we kept getting passed on to the next rep , next rep , next rep . when they finally got to the property , they told our tenant that they would call us back with their findings - we never heard anything . again , just bad customer service .	3763
1	great place in downtown toronto for some drinks and apps . they have a nice selection of beers . the apps are a bit limited but they have some tasty options . i had the tuna poke salad app , very delicious and delicately prepared , flavourful and a perfectly developed app . had the goat cheese and roasted red pepper sandwiching with a caesar salad , a great light option for dinner . would recommend this place more for their beer selection . place is open late and great option before heading out to a show or to the movies . enjoy	670
1	randy catered an event with his taco wagon for me and all i can say is that he is the best ! friendly , enthusiastic and professional . tacos are straightforward and delicious . he worked with me to include a vegetarian option and made sure every guest had a great experience . highly recommend !	760
0	had some pad thai . it was n't bad but also not good . it was n't very authentic at all and had almost no spice . a solid meh	973
1	dr. olson is a total rockstar ! i had a fleur de lis tummy tuck per his recommendation . i am so glad he really thought it through as to what would be the right approach for my body . his breadth of knowledge was vast , and his attention to detail unsurpassed . my recovery has been ideal and i did n't experience any complications because of his involvement with my postoperative care . worth every penny i spent and maybe one day i 'll use him to even out my saggy post breastfeeding tatas : )	1349
1	excellent customer service third time purchisng furniture here will continue to buy from this wonderful staff the gm michelle was very helpful and wonderful to work with honestly i ca n't say enough good things ! ! ! !	1640
0	save your money . fast food has better quality beef . their t-bone is totally missing the tender side of the cut . it is a rip off - and high priced . it is meant for people who do not understand what they are ordering or what they should receive .	1226
0	went there sunday nite . the tables are so close together , they never used to be so close.all the staff were squessing between our table which was very annoying . the food tasted great although we were both sick the next day . we had different meals , so go figure .the seats are uncomfortable . if u want a romantic setting , forget it .not a place for an intimate dinner and very loud .an honest review	440
1	i am visiting phoenix and accidentally found this place . i had an amazing , refreshing experience ! ! ! ! very nice , clean and staff was super ! ! ! i had one of the daughters tend me and she was beyond words ! gentle , effective , fast and more . different salons in london , san diego , oklahoma city , i never have had as many procedures done when requesting the same services i did at jb 's nail ! ! ! ! i ca n't wait to come back ! ! ! !	1767
0	worst hibachi experience . i love hibachi in general . this is ranked last in my list . explained why it was empty on sunday lunch . the chef came in on the grill ... acted like someone forced him to cook for us ... obviously no show & tricks ... i had to ask him to cook chicken more because he was ready to serve half cooked chken.. sake was the worst i ever had . never again ! !	890
1	amazing experience . this was our first time to a escape room . we were visiting mesa and were looking for something to do to be out of the heat . we took our parents along and the 4 of us completed/escaped the suspects room . it was so much fun , we finished with 3:57 to spare . thank you for an amazing experience ! staff is very friendly and kind and explain the process very well .	805
0	i would give a zero star if it allowed me . this company is absolutely horrible ! the people i had to work with , primarily jim , never get back to me in a timely manner . a lot was wrong with the property so we had to contact them numerous times . every single time was essentially pulling teeth . i always have to send numerous emails to hear back . the house we moved into was completely filthy . once you can finally get a hold of them , they 're fantastic keyboard warriors and crooks ! do n't trust them .	3045
0	i call this place and ask for a quote . the guy gives me a range quote from $ xx- $ xx . after getting there and waiting for them to pull in the car they call me in and want to show me something . they proceeded to tell me it 's needs this and that to which i told them that it needed those things when i called to get the quote . now they wanted to charge me double what the original quote was . i 'm very disappointed that this was my first time going to meineke and my last . lesson learned	1086
0	if i could leave 0 stars i would.. i 've given the place a chance time and time again through ownership changes and continue to be disappointed . do n't waste your time or money with this place . 80 % of the time their spray tan is out of solution or down . ..and if you are dumb enough to join id call first if you want to utilize the spray tan . in addition , there is n't a locker room or group classes at this location.. you 're better off at lvac	3898
0	waitresses force me to give tips ! wtf ! can the manager explain ? if still no refund , going to complain to bbb . plus , i am not the one having this issues as well . there a few customers that lodge this complaint on google review	1016
0	they have a `` queen '' slot machine . and if fremont st. is crowded sometimes it 's easier to cut through the casino to bypass the madhouse . otherwise i have nothing good to say about the worst dump on fremont st . it 's a shame that instead of imploding the fontainebleu down on the strip that this casino could n't be imploded first . 1 star only because yelp says i have to ...	3630
0	mehhh . they do n't deliver so i had to go pick it up . chicken satays were dry and overcooked but tasty . basil fried rice was mushy and over sauced . scant ( 3 small ) shrimp and 6-7 pieces of chicken . all the right favors but heavy handed execution . chicken and vegetable stir fry with black bean and ginger was the best of them all . i have to say that after reading all of the great reviews on yelp we were very disappointed . to top it off , one app and two entree came to $ 30 . not bad if it was a quality meal but this owing one of those .	1203
0	what a disappointment . the dinosaur exhibit was okay , earning it the second star . but the staff is a bunch of sloppy , rude , hungover college students . $ 20 a person for what was basically a bunch of stuff their aunt mildred cleaned out of her attic .	101
0	today was my third and final visit . i went in for a pedicure and walked out with a burned foot . i was told to be seated in the pedicure chair and the nail tech walked away . the water was already on and half way filled . when i dipped my foot in the water was scalding hot ! the person doing pedicures across from my chair turned around and did nothing . after a few minutes waiting for the nail tech to return i put my sandals on and walked out . so truly disappointed with this place .	1834
1	i ca n't say enough about the employees at herff jones . everyone i came into contact with went above and beyond to answer all of my questions and they even helped to pick out the right size and length of the graduation gown for my daughter . cami was so friendly and helpful today when she came to the school to help organize the 2018 grad walk and to take pictures of all the students . thanks cami for going the extra mile , we really appreciate it ! i hope you got your 3rd cup of coffee this morning	3848
1	great food i had the chicken and avocado enchiladas and they were delicious and filling . they have amazing service my drink was never empty . they host really fun events in the evening and have really good fun djs playing at them . the steady is a great addition to the neighbourhood and ill def be headed there as often as possible ! ! !	11
1	my favourite go to local mexican restaurant . great food and friendly attentive staff . also as an aside , i lost my wallet thursday night biking home along dupont and did n't realize it until friday morning . was stressed and upset not worried about cash but having to replace all my cards , etc . then got an instagram msg from one of their lovely staff , rivannah , saying she found it on dupont . it was returned to me as i 'd lost it . with cash and all . restored my faith in humanity : ) . thank you and see you soon for tacos	1305
0	they do have some cool stuff , i 'll give them that much . the pay out for the top shape stuff i was selling them was laughable . i made waay more selling it on amazon than what they offered me.everything is over priced and a good portion of the staff was rude . i wo n't be coming back anytime soon . as for the guy that was a total jerk to me.keep in mind that you 're a grown man working in a record store that you do n't own.your parents must be proud .	2648
0	this is the worst place ever ! we signed up for a presentation and everything was fine we agreed on our desired gifts gave our info etc and we were supposed to go at 945am wellllllllll after checking in at 915am and sitting n waiting for 30 min i went to see what the wait was and we were told `` oh bus left already that 's our fault we messed up '' and laughed and had to reschedule to 1230 so we went yet again.. only to be told we do n't qualify and nothing can be done poor customer service skills and terrible ethics !	1057
1	fulton as a home builder is great ! the neighborhoods are well planned out . plenty of parks and green space . the houses are spaced nicely . the quality of the build is great as well . i love that my kids can walk to school ! !	3043
1	i took my girlfriend here to get her car since i had a great experience a few years back . the way they do business is so far from the traditional monkey/manager crap that you typically see . the service was so great for my girlfriend , i went back a week later and purchased a car myself . there was an issue with some scratches on the paint of the new car and thy fixed it with no problems or question . i will definitely return again when i get another vehicle .	307
1	i have yet been able to find a shop that can do a perfect coffin until i came here ! the guy that did my nails did such a great job and i love the atmosphere ! i 'll definitely be referring everybody here ! !	3509
0	i called to get internet because cox was way over priced but lv.net told me installation alone would cost $ 100 and $ 60 a month ... ... i thought cox was outrageous but lv . net surpasses cox . ... ... ..	3459
0	i stopped here unplanned for a late lunch with friends last weekend . the menu seemed very standard for an italian restaurant - and perhaps a bit boring . nothing really appealed to me that much , but i split a caesar salad and prosciutto pizza with one friend . neither really wowed me and the pizza was only lukewarm when it was brought out to us . the service was friendly though and their patio was a nice place to spend a sunday afternoon .	240
1	good burger and quick service . had a vanilla shake it was yummy ! we use to always go to chelsea 's kitchen and last two times we had cold food . smashburger is our new go to stop !	669
1	amazing delux pedicure ! ! ! staff very attentive and nice . spa is very clean and well decorated . huge selection of opi nail polishes . plus it 's vegan ! ! ! will come back next time in town	3603
0	doctor called in prescription on 4/18 . told on 4/19 that i had 3 times to pick up next day . i said noon . friday partell called system down had to pick up tuesday . tuesday told not ready will deliver thursday . thursday no delivery . called friday said they would deliver between 6-8 pm . no delivery . what kind of service is this ? no courtesy calls ! nothing ! it 's now been one week and a half ! no excuse for this bad service !	1372
1	we love coming to toad & turtle ! their wing nights are great - so many flavours to choose from ! and sometimes we just do n't feel like cooking and will come for 2-for-1 appetizer nights . their beer and wine selection is great . fast and friendly service , and a laid back atmosphere . definitely a great local pub !	97
1	incredibly impressed with volvo of tempe 's service department ! they reply to email and phone calls very quickly . i brought my car here after getting an insanely high estimate from another dealership in the valley . i made an appt . on a friday afternoon , had my car in first thing saturday morning , and got a call it was ready within 2 hours . unheard of with the dealership i 've used in the past . best of all ... the did the needed repairs for 48 % less than the other dealership quoted . thanks brian & judd !	525
0	service does not exist in the home depot garden area . if you ask they will point you where to go that 's about it . have been there recently half a dozen times , same deal , same lack of service . i give up on that place . lowe 's has a much nicer garden area and people that actually know about plants and are willing to help . i 'm going there from now on .	1398
0	this pharmacy does n't even deserve one star . customer service is terrible . that male pharmacy tech has the worse attitude . i called to make sure my prescription was ready and they told me it was and when i got there they said twenty more minutes and he told me to turn back around and come back then . he was a complete asshole . walgreens needs to step up their customer service and this is why i will always fill at cvs from here on out .	1730
0	okay so let 's start with the good thing about this hotel ... oh wait ! there is n't ! ! my father stayed at this hotel and overnight with a full parking lot his truck got broken in to ! not only his but other people 's . you would think after speaking to the cop that they would have cameras because it 's happened before but nope ! makes you wonder why it has n't been investigated by the staff ... .. ? ? will never stay at a hyatt again ! the entire name disgust me now ! they did absolutely nothing to help us ! ! ! !	2540
1	beautiful work and awesome customer service ! ! their team showed up on time and ready to work . dewey was professional and patient while answering all of my questions . my pool looks amazing ! 5 laguna pool & spa !	3833
0	good selection of merchandise decent service but the prices are high ! ! ! the store is immaculate the customer service was friendly but some of the prices are $ 5- $ 20 higher on products that i purchase at other stores . raw meal is $ 20 higher at whole foods than at vegas discount nutrition , whole foods will be a last resort if i ever go back .	433
0	bad service the waitress hardly speaks english the wait is long the table were not cleaned from the dirty dishes at all.the food was ok but way over priced .	1287
0	i 'm a huge fan of chinese food and i generally like most of dishes . i really could n't finish the hot and sour soup . it was not hot or sour , just with chunks of black pepper which occasionally cracked under my teeth and made it spicyish . the meat was overly salty and had to be digested with a ton of rice and water . i was n't a fan of the spring rolls either , which is really hard to dislike . the only good things were really the service and the carrot and the cabbage on the side . there are just too many good places to eat nearby ... ..	649
0	first of all i feel terrible when i have to write a so so review . but with that said ... i usually go to the nail shop around the corner but had a gift card to use . so i went in today for a pedicure . went to the old location , which the receptionist might have mentioned on the phone ... that they moved ! the chairs were nice and so is the decor ... however ... when i ask for change and she only brings back half of my change that is a problem ! plus a pedicure here is $ 35 and my regular one is $ 20 and there is no difference ! will i go back ... probably not .	916
1	this pool supply store is located in the target shopping area . they do a great job at checking your pool water to see if the chemical balance is right . just bring a sample in and they check it for free ! friendly service too . my kids always find something here that they `` need '' and we have gotten some great discounts on items that have been sitting not the shelves for a while ( like remote control toys ) . check them out !	2202
1	totally top notch service . have been a customer since they opened , will never go anywhere else ! today i took my car for a screw puncture , done in 15 minutes ( called this morning for a pm appt ) and ... it was no charge ! 6 months ago , took the car in for a punctured sidewall , again , in and out in 15 minutes and replaced the tire with the only cost being the warranty . excellent service . i am a lifetime customer	3231
0	the service was good they delivered quickly but the pizza itself was below average . the sauce was flavorless and the dough was a little undercooked , softer than i like . good sausage but that 's all that i liked .	987
0	summerlin maids is the worst . beware , i have had items missing but i ca n't prove it . the cleaning is really bad and they never come on time . do n't waste your time or money with these people . i would n't give any stars but yelp makes you give one star . the office people are very rude and they never answer there phone . please stay away .	2994
1	they were very helpful in filling my prescription for my cat . even though they are a people pharmacy , they still were able to fill vet prescriptions . the prices were lower than the previous pharmacy i was using and it was fast and easy . they did not call me when the prescriptions were ready , however , i had to call and follow up .	3283
1	giovanna is the best hairdresser i have ever had ! she pays attention to what you want and is amazing !	2001
0	called them for a ride and they told me they would be there in 10-25 minutes and they never showed . first time and last time i 'll ever use them .	52
1	the sashimi and rolls i had were delicious . friendly , quick service . as it is a new restaurant , it will take time to grow in popularity but i will be back for sure .	515
0	i bought 7 frozen bags of japanese cold noodle last night . 4 out of 7 were not eatable . there was mold on the noodle . please be careful to purchase the noodle . the bag was not see through . i should 've opened the bags and checked the noodle right in front of the cashier ...	715
0	the worst place ... manager does n't know how to manage and the server does not know what to talk.. idiotic place	600
1	best atmosphere when you have a sweet tooth . friendly staff , great ice cream and amazing malts . love the bananas foster ice cream and a french press to go with it .	3604
0	decided to stop in and get a yogurt even after reading the bad reviews and what a mistake ! this was my first time and could n't find taster cups anywhere . after asking i was finally given three which was great ! i tried a flavor which came out as liquid then went to try another flavor and it sprayed everywhere ! i decided on getting the coconut and pineapple swirl which was delicious besides there being ice chunks in it . i also felt it was over priced . wo n't be going back ... .	1145
0	great place to see ankle bracelets . if your friends force you to go at night , jump in the pool . problem solved .	2553
0	notice the dates of previous reviews ... this place might have been good last year , but that has certainly changed . do n't waste your time with these inexperienced , young girls who have n't yet learned customer service common sense .	232
0	ordered 2 larges . one all dressed one plain . received pepperoni instead of plain with giant air pockets . when called back after 10 attempts because their phone lines were busy , i was told that it was a mistake . yes i agree sending me the wrong pizza is a mistake but the cook placing a pizza with giant air pockets in it which is also 2 inches in diameter smaller than the large ordered in the box is n't a mistake , it was intentional . i have posted the picture . replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust just as bas and ice cold . thank , never will we order here again .	400
0	worst bike shop out of the 12 states i 've lived in ! slow services ( 9 days for tune up ) - they up-sell non-stop then get bent out of shape when you decline add ons / upgrades . look on google you 'll find plenty of bad reviews consistent with this . i 'll be driving my bike all the way to phoenix instead of dealing with this place again .	1946
0	too much flour in the sauce . i want them to do well , but they need to put more flavor -- spices , herbs -- and less fat .	1346
0	i do not recommend shopping online at kirkland 's . the items take forever to be received . when you refuse an order , as i was told to do , getting a refund is near impossible . customer service rarely responds back to emails . it has been eight days and they still have not refunded my paypal account . according to kirkland 's rep , who finally responded once but not to my additional replies , it is the fault of paypal taking two or three days to refund the money . they do not take ownership of the fact they never processed the refund . perhaps they hope the customer does not notice the refund is not given ... .	1576
0	we drove here for the monday sushi special . the server said they do n't have that deal anymore but it is on the home page of their website that sushi is half off on mondays . be forewarned before you waste your time driving to this place	487
1	good atmosphere pre game . seemed solid to me . good burger , fries and beer . wasnt overly crowded so maybe a lot of the complaints about service were not seen by me .	839
0	stopped by 3 fri ago . walked in about 4:15 , sat at the bar . 10 minutes later i left after no one noticed me . barmaid sat behind bar with her feet propped up & never moved . bar guy was texting for 5 minutes , then went into the back never to return . stock boy put beer under the bar where i was sitting but ignored me . so i went to river dog for really good service and a great hotdog . too bad hd . one star not low enough .	1407
0	place is a total mess ! bought furniture a month ago , sent two broken units , the wrong one and wo n't let me even speak to a manager on the phone . just try to call and ask for the manager before you buy anything ! beware ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! call ashley and you wait on hold and finally told no exchanges ? all i want is a entertainment center without a massive crack on the top ! go to rc willey ! ! ! ! ashley was a huge mistake : (	1794
1	thanks to yelp i found peter who made my 2013 acura tl sparkle like the day i got her ! he made all the dog hair disappear and came to my house - so convenient ! definitely worth it and i will be a repeat customer for sure !	2579
0	do not go here ! i waited for 3 hours for these guys to finally tell me i needed to replace a part that was just installed ... no thanks	1604
0	i usually do not write reviews , let alone negative ones . i am in town for winter break from my mba program in new york and needed to get some old suits and shirts altered . all were nordstrom brand shirts and hicky freeman suits . the sales and tailoring staff at 1:00 p.m. on 01/16/2018 made the experience miserable . i know their stores alter all clothes , and to be dismissed for paying to get clothes that i purchased from that store altered is beyond unacceptable . my family has been shopping at nordstroms since they entered the state . not anymore .	1907
0	terrible ! it was not a concert . she had so much filler time with random dancers when she was n't even on stage and talked way too much about nothing . just sing ... like people do when giving a concert . waste of time and money .	1771
0	purchased a car from them and found out later it had mechanical issues so i have been trying to work with them to resolve the problem . they do not seem to care . just getting the run-around . even tried to use the warranty service they sold me but it was no good .	2012
0	it pains me to write this since this used to be my favorite gym in the phoenix area . once la fitness took over this place slid down hill fast . they doubled to the gym fee from what i was paying , fired the parking lot security guard , at least 1/3 of the treadmills do n't work , equipment stays broken for weeks if not months on end , the locker rooms are barely cleaned and usually smell like a sewage treatment plant and nearly all the paper towel holders are gurrenteed to be empty . the list goes on and on , but the only redeeming quailtiy is most of the patrons are friendly .	1802
0	rude staff and bad billing issues . will not go there and will not recommend this place to anyone . it 's already annoying enough to have to go obgyn every year that they should at least try to make it a pleasant experience .	1281
0	computer system was down . they put us in the wrong room . elevators were heavily congested . was kindly escorted to some hidden elevators in the back . room had amazing view of the lake and many windows . bed was very comfy . overall was okay . i wish i could bring bits and pieces of my room home .	1859
1	had my little corgi get a deep dental cleaning bc his tooth broke off from chewing on a bone . i knew i found a good vet when i met with dr roach . he is very personable and does n't pressure you into anything so it does n't feel like a sales pitch with you 're at your appointment . he showed me the x-rays of where the abscess was after the tooth extraction . highly recommend dr roach .	1810
1	great place to hang out , such a cute interior ! the bingsu is okay . i really like the red bean paste : )	1182
1	we just got married recently and have been getting a lot of photos printed . marco in the photo department has helped me every time ! he is so friendly , great customer service ! always smiling , & remembers me ! knows the system and helps me with the prints ! ! great employee ! thank you !	758
0	i found this place to be overpriced , especially the food . the appetizers we got were not worth the money , especially when it came to the portions . if i do come back , i 'll make sure to eat before i go ! but i think this would be a good place to go when the weather is nice , since the back patio looks relaxing . if it were n't for that , i 'm not sure i would return .	49
0	visited for lunch with a girlfriend . two stars for friendly wait staff and fresh modern decor , but not a fan of the over priced , subpar sushi : my salmon nigiri tasted both fishy and as though it were left exposed overnight in a refrigerator , and the rice supporting it was falling apart before my chopsticks even touched it . with so many superior sushi options in the vicinity , i wo n't be returning .	602
1	we love this place ! i have been to plenty of hibachi places and this one of my favs ! the owner is super friendly and always makes sure everything is ok ! the dipping sauces are very good too ! they even have lunch prices on the weekends which is really nice ! its not too loud like some hibachi places !	890
1	great new northern location . modern facilities and equipment . think that there are not enough of the popular weight machines while others are too many . . only gripe is with some members taking over machines for a long time thinking they own it while texting or relaxing on them . there should be postings or reminders on the intercom every so often to remind people to be courteous .	3268
1	great service , fantastic food . tonight having shrimp pad tia shrimp were good size very flavorful . my favorite dish is would have to be spicy basil chicken . this is a must if you enjoy thai food .	50
1	very nice mall at present . well laid out and plenty of selection . features a macy 's , jc penney , sears and dillards as the major stores . has quite a few boutiques , from body central and charlotte rousse , to abercrombie & fitch ( yech ! ) and the gap . 6 or 7 jewelry stores , probably the same # of shoe stores . old navy , victoria 's secret , frederick 's , hallmark , hobby bench , as seen on tv , many others . the food court has a nice selection , as well as a ruby tuesday 's for slightly more upscale fare .	2815
1	where do i even begin ? from the moment the ladies and i walked into this location , we were excitedly greeted by jason b . his enthusiasm to take our order and make sure we were well taken care of was suburb . the interior was super clean and well lit . the other workers who handed us our food was just as equally outgoing . jason even went above and beyond to walk us out our food to our table . a+ for everything !	859
0	terrible delays ! ! ! as we speak i am on a 240 flight from las vegas that has not taken off yet ! my flight from los angeles was delayed as well ! ! uhh !	1623
0	friendly staff unfortunately the food was n't good..as a matter of fact we all became sick	131
0	40 mins waiting for a la carte ... srsly ? orderd only two hot meals and rice ... and this food was disgusting . to be honest , i am not quit sure what it was that i was eating . waste time and money .	851
0	tea was good and the place looks nice enough . but when i walked in the door the smell hit me ... the smell of a dirty rag that has been wet and dried way too many times between proper cleaning . every table reeked of the rag ... it was bad . the management needs to realize that that one small thing makes the entire place unpleasant . putting the damp rag in the microwave for one minute will kill the bacteria causing the odour .	176
0	i have gone to the website 4 times now trying to buy - weekend general admission tickets $ 125.00 for the 4th time and it does not allow it . i have sent email message about the problem . i called 644-4444 , left a message to call me and a girl did call . i explained to her the problem and she said she would have someone look into it and fix it . that was 10 days ago and still not fixed . what is up ? ? ? do you not need the sales ? ?	2955
0	do not use this company , mike is rude , argues every little question you have and id hard to deal with . he only uses one word responses . horrible customer service ! ! ! ! ! !	1573

1	sort of the airport version of your frat days . local carolina beers on tap with bar food to boot . this is the place for serious drinking at clt . and why not ? tsa ca n't see you from here . watch those insurance salesmen loosen their ties as they go round 4 . concourse d .	219
0	either beer or steer clear . do n't get the food ! ! ! everything takes forever to get to you and when it finally arrives , you find that it was n't worth the wait . not by a long shot ! over cooked , under seasoned or plain old bad quality frozen food .	369
0	smarmy , arrogant supervisor with gauged ears and a hipster attitude , refused to sell me alcohol . said my valid temporary d/l , accompanied by my voided picture d/l , is not valid id . nevada dmv begs to differ . i 'm almost 60 with gray facial hair .	583
0	the beer was horrible . it tastes like grass and it was so bitter ! the worst beer i 've ever had ! ! !	993
0	dont come here . ordered the croissant breakfast sandwhich to go . i posted a pic i suggest you go look at it . very sad looking sandwhich . staff was not helpful when waiting for my sandwhich , waited over 30 min and by that time it was cold . last time here .	1332
0	this is an overrated food truck . the most terrible po boy catfish sandwich i have ever had . all salt no real cajun flavour . plus i ordered a catfish and they made a meatloaf ! ! ! then they acted like i made a mistake ! no way i asked for catfish for sure , the lady was not paying attention at all . this is not cajun ! ! !	1007
1	i like this place . i like the music even though sometimes is really loud ! but most of all , i like their nachos !	670
1	dr. syms takes his time to explain diagnosis and treatment options . i was thrilled to learn about new technology that may help me hear and understand better than i ever thought possible . i ca n't wait for my follow up to find out if i qualify as a candidate !	1602
1	always great here . great service , great produce , and great prices . almost every week i come here to get produce and they always amaze me with the efficiency and quality . the food they have at the food court is both cheap and high quality . i recommend this costco location to anyone wanting quality and great prices .	1102
1	first time coming to vi as a newcomer to az , i like that they serve breakfast all day . i ordered the ultimate breakfast and upgraded their standard buttermilk pancakes to the new pumpkin pancakes topped with caramel pecan sauce . i thought it would be a big breakfast combo plate for the price but it was a bit smaller than i expected but the pumpkin pancakes were the best ! the caramel sauce was enough that i did n't need syrup . one of the servers also came back with extra bacon saying she did n't like the ones she previously gave me . totally unexpected and so much appreciated ! the pumpkin pancakes alone will bring me back !	1029
1	the staff was great . the facility was clean with state of the art equipment . in my situation the doctor did everything to figure the issue out , and he did . i had no wait time , and i would go back if i was put into another emergency situation .	350
0	dirty dirty dirty . nice but unhelpful staff . regret staying here . wifi is free but the signal is incredibly weak . no wonder its free .	1786
0	visiting from seattle we visited marigold as it probably had the best ratings around the area we were staying . foodie that i am , i 'd not give it more than 3 stars , food was average what you 'd expect in an american indian restaurant - nothing great . also was pissed that they charged 20 % gratuity for a party of 4 , when we only had 2 adults one 7 year old and one 2 year old kid . common guys - party of 4 and 20 % gratuity .	640
0	just got to this location and brought my family from out of town . first impressions , restroom is a mess ! will give more details after meal is done ... update* service is a little bit better . waitresses looked super tired , probably from working long hours ... she is polite tho . wait time for our table was ok ... not too long .	1029
1	really laid back place - hands down the most awesome jambalaya , the fried avocados were quite good - byob $ 0.50 per beer	1358
0	a ghost town . far away from anything interesting ( or even open ) . rooms are n't ready for check-in until well into the evening ( due to brush-offs like `` inspections '' and such ) . a total letdown . it would have been worth spending several times as much .	1057
0	walked in at 3:30 ( the place is open until 7:30 ) for a fill . i 've been a loyal customer for the last two years only to be told they were unable to take me as they were short handed ; there were all of 4 customers in the whole place ! its a shame . they do fine work but for the crappy experience i just i wo n't go back ever . many times they have closed early without reason or notice so i 'm not too surprised .	3711
1	i love this store located right in downtown belmont . it has consignment and new items . many high end consigned items . i oohh and aahh everytime i go in . the nicest consignment boutique i have ever been in .	15
1	extremely knowledgeable , competent , and attentive . could n't have had a better experience .	3926
0	wow - maybe try this place in person but do not get their delivery . 45 minutes late from their confirmed delivery of an hour , i called . the lady was very rude . i was n't hostile - i just asked if the driver might have gotten lost . the food was ice cold . when i called back to explain , i was treated terribly .	1325
0	called to offer cash on a vehicle . was told after shirt discussion that i would get a call back on what would be an acceptable number . never heard anything back . i 'm sure they do n't care too much about selling a used vehicle as i was told they do n't have much markup on their used vehicles . i was also hung up on once . i would recommend going elsewhere to spend your money .	1424
0	avoid this place like the plague . i dropped nearly $ 6,000 dollars at this place and my furniture is being constantly delayed . they keep on promising an arrival date and that promise is consistently broken . i do n't know that to do at this point .	3738
1	we just celebrated our son 7th birthday here with his soccer teammates ( very energetic boys ) and loved it ! roxy and sam were very helpful and patient with the kids . the place was clean , we loved the decorations , and at the end , they gave an unexpected gift to the birthday boy ! we had a blast , thank you so much !	3060
1	i come here to use the tanning salon . alyssa is the so nice and friendly ! i got a good deal on groupon for a month of tanning . i will be signing up after my groupon is over though . i get a good color here in the tanning beds and i want to try the spray tans here soon . since i already have an lvac membership i did n't sign up for their gym , the gym looks a little small but is conveniently 24 hours . i 'm with happy the tanning salon and it 's close to my house .	3898
0	i hate this place so much it 's the worst service at both locations and the worst management ... ..they need bar rescue at both locations badly	1332
0	visited this branch last week . ask for someone to call and set up an appointment to set up our accounts , no one called . we just stopped in again , no one available to set up our accounts . 10+ cubicles for bankers to work but only 2 working . banking elsewhere now .	3202
1	the oral surgeon , dr. baddam was so fast and efficient . christine totally put me at ease and calmed me down . these girls are very skilled at what they do .	3414
1	after one month trouble with the unit ! but the service has been continuously poor . now on a saturday in the heat of arizona 's summer , we had to call numerous times to get someone to call back to tell us they ca n't come for hours . they need to have service people in the summer ! ! now after waiting hours still nobody ! ! ~ with all the companies out there who needs this kind of aggravation after spending 8000.00 . they have since fired the installers who were so terrible and made good on everything ! ! !	2203
1	i 've been ordering delivery from tony big 's pizza n pasta for about a year . without fail , their food is delicious every time ! my usual order is a pizza , mild chicken fingers & fries , and garlic balls with marinara . the pizza is always hot and fresh upon delivery , chicken fingers are tender and moist , and garlic balls taste like little pillows of heaven . for delivery , i 'm usually quoted an hour , but food often arrives in 30-45 minutes ! how can you beat that ? highly recommend !	459
0	the are good for the price , you get what you pay for . i 'm giving them 4 stars because they always deliver in a timely fashion and the breadsticks are good , same with the garlic dip , 6.00 medium walk in special , 1.00 delivery ? ca n't go wrong on a budget	810
1	the 4 stars are based on my other waffle house experiences . this is a 4-star waffle house . there is an old lady that walks around and massages all of the customers . stay away if you dislike people touching you , because she will . the service is pretty good , but it is sometimes hard to find someone if you need something . the food is always good , but it seems our order often comes out in shifts and is n't always correct when it first comes to the table ... .but it is what it is . and what it is , is good , greasy , waffle house breakfast ! yum !	241
0	so far , i 've had an awful experience . the tech came out and ever since , we 've had ant problems that we 've never had before . i 've left 2 voicemails and spoken to 2 people . i have not received a return call or any service to rectify the ant problem . very disappointing .	2351
0	do n't go to the bakery with any questions , they will literally act like you 're trying to pull teeth from them . i asked a women how much notice they need to do a cake ( the birthday is not till july but i had time to kill so thought i 'd stop in today ) and i thought she was going to fall over on the floor . she rolled her eyes , stomped and everything . wild .	1904
1	love love love their ruelo cake . it 's a delicious cake with layers of decadent chocolate mousse , vanilla cream , a praline wafer and chocolate sponge cake . it truly is to die for . other yummy flavours include their green tea cake with red bean , passion fruit mousse , and mango almond . we 've tried their macarons but we still have n't found a place in the gta that compares to paris ! ! !	1217
1	hi . i recently brought my kia sorrento in for an oil change . the service staff was friendly , it was reasonable and quick . they have a comfortable & big waiting area . they also made recommendations for maintenance but did not pressure me to do it that day . we like sands kia so much we just bought a2nd sorrento last month from them ! i highly recommend sands kia ! jonathan kaplan	624
0	just picked up a dozen cupcakes and found out during the summer they have half the options ( flavors ) of cupcakes available for immediate purchase .	1806
0	horrible just horrible . guy in the front tells us 45 mins for wash and seats shampoo . going on to 45 mins my car does n't get touch . i ask the gentleman in detail he tells me other hour . yeah no go to the cashier she gets an okay from her manger to give me a dree car wash however tells me that tomes varies depending on the cars waiting ... there was 1 .	3250
1	these guys are on top of things . very polite and they work as fast as one could expect .	2146
0	4 stars does this place no justice ! i have been looking at all kinds of different ramen places in the valley and chosen this place . my boyfriend and i had the pork goyza ( 4 stars ! ) we also had the spicy ramen with the curved noodles . the soup had a very bland taste and the curved noodles were over cooked and stuck together . to top it off the pork was a gray color . i will definitely not be recommending this place or even give it another chance ! over all our server was very nice ! *** if you are ever in the area of little tokyo in california you have to try daikokuya ! definitely 5 stars ! ***	131
1	so i was told to try this spot by a fellow yelper and i 'm glad i did it was super yummy their 5 is super spicy so we got a 2 and 3 and that was perfect the yellow curry was amazing and the pad see ew noodles were yummy ca n't wait to go back and try more	1203
1	i have never had a problem with this place , the food comes in big portions and always taste good . the staff is always friendly with us and never gets our order wrong ! i would recommend this place to everybody that ever comes to the north side of vegas ! ! !	1319
0	i got the taro smoothie . it does not taste good at all , very powder tasting . and the boba has no flavor	1763
1	some of my house outlets stopped working after the heavy rains . it was a mess because i did not notice due to being out of town and my laundry freezer was full of chicken and meat . i will just say it was not fun to clean that . i called dodge electric today at 10 am and they were here an hour later on january 2nd , when most people are not even working ! james taylor was amazing ! he came in and fixed the problem quickly . i will definitely call them back if i need to . thanks james ! ! ! ! !	719
0	this company does not deliver on what it says . it takes money and does a little bit then wants more money and now my project ( bathroom remodel ) has gone on for over 5 months with not one aspect completed . stay away from them .	3761
0	i bought the wrong ammunition my mistake . i called to ask about an exchange . took 3 times for the transferred call to go through . when somebody finally answered her accent was so heavy it took 10 minutes to get on the same page . we played 21 questions about the bullets , not upset about my error . iam upset that i felt like they were messing with me .	2443
0	the meat of the chicken inasal was dry and overcooked . we also ordered oxtail soup which was lacking in flavor and had teeny tiny pieces of meat on it . the bangus sisig was decent and i liked it coz it was n't too greasy . service was good and everybody was nice and attentive but the food was a disappointment : (	658
0	i really like the pmhnp i see here , mark wesbrock . my children have seen other doctors here and been equally happy . i 'm insanely dissatisfied with the price though . why is my insurance being billed $ 250 for a 15 minute appointment with a nurse practitioner , when i used to pay $ 90 for an appointment with a psychiatrist with two ph.ds and an md at a different practice ? the numbers just seem off . i 've also been unhappy with the office staff . though always friendly in person , they seem to have trouble with organization and returning phone calls .	1541
1	this store screams japanese . spotless , meticulously organized , and the products are all simple yet functional . the store really is n't very big , but they 've managed to display a solid variety of clothing for both men and women , kitchen and bathroom items , stationary , organizers , gifts , etc ... you walk into the store and you just want to buy stuff ! the prices here seem pretty much in line with their overseas prices . welcome to canada !	3363
1	son ! where do i start ? this place is sonice , and everyoneknows that is better than so nice ! fresh fresh fresh ! you can tell they make it there and not from a can ! i 've been going for awhile now and it seems things have gotten better in the last month or so ! i 'm telling you now that you need to try it ! all the flavors just come together so nice ! the only thing keeps me from going more is the drive ! open one in surprise already !	548
0	i think this place shut down . it was great while it was open and they had a website but i bought four vouchers while i was there ( $ 80 total ) and now there 's no one to get a hold of . people of yelp ! is there anyone else to contact about this ?	3048
1	best food ever ! i ate the corned beef tacos and my husband ate the pork banh mi sandwich and both tasted so amazing . the server also brought us cinnamon chips with banana nutella ... delicious ! the chips were flaky and the nutella had the perfect amount of sweetness . the staff was very nice also . the servers kept checking on us and even the chef came out . i ca n't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu !	57
0	disgusting . filthy bathrooms , dirty floors . the staff did not bring us our full order , then complained when we asked that they go back and get the rest of the food we payed for .	800
1	i purchased an entire home entertainment system from dan at best buy ( scottsdale location ) - outstanding system ! even better was the service dan provided . his follow up was above and beyond and he took his time to teach our entire family how to maneuver through the all the various functions of the system . when we have trouble we have been able to directly call dan and he is quick to follow up . could not say enough great things about dan , our new system , and best buy/ magnoli .	3192
0	ok . most of the staff at this location are really solid , but there is a guy named pablo who works in the butcher shop and your best to avoid him if you can . that 's your safety tip as a customer .	2316
0	this is a rating for the nail salon located at this walmart . i walked in and requested sparkly nails . the finished product does not look anything like the samples provided . they are uneven , sparsely colored and despite 3 coats very uneven . it 's extremely disappointing . i removed them as soon as i got home . not worth anywhere near $ 35 .	3066
0	too bad i ca n't give 0 stars ... it should not take over 30 mins to get food from a fast food joint . the service is incredible unprofessional and the place is unorganized . avoid avoid avoid unless u wan na waste 40 mins of ur life away being ignored and waiting for cold food .	808
1	omg , this place is nice ! ! i just had to stop in and see the different cakes and flavors ! love how cutely decorated all the cakes were and the shape of bundt cakes just makes you think of happier times ! ! if you have n't been here , this is the place to come and have the cutest cakes around ! !	18
1	yesterday i lock out from my house and i open the yellow pages a call liberty lock and key joseph came over unlocked my house make me a new key for my lock and charge me only $ 75.00 i 'm happy ! ! !	1919
1	here to see tantric ! nice venue ! ! ! disagree with the previous comment about the ac ! it is actually cold in here ! big open space with a lot of room ! great sound and reasonable drink prices ! were looking forward to going back for sure ! ! !	17
1	this place is great ! i 've never been a fan of froyo , but this stuff is tasty ! i tried the skinny strawberry and topped it off with mango , strawberries , blueberries , and fruity pebbles . i got the quart size ( yeah , i was asking for a tummy ache , but it was worth it . ) i love how it is self-serve , and you can pile whatever you want on there . it 's a bit pricey at 39 cents/ounce , but if you go to their website you can print a buy one get one free coupon .	1454
1	love this place ! i do n't know what i would do without it . i 'm into just about every kind of craft and they have something for it all .	1937
1	awesome hookah lounge ! right from the start i was greeted and treated as a customer . my hooks was perfect and did n't wait long even though it was busy . courteous staff and friendly people . tv available anywhere you sit . definitely recommend this place if you like hookah or playing pool .	3634
0	well , this used to be my go-to neighborhood indian restaurant . until last night . when i found an insect that i think was a dead baby fly in our take-out saffron rice . no thank you .	889
0	even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad . i 've eaten here and at the one in south end and both are a waste . i usually just eat at the pita pit or risk a bacteria infection and eat from one of the street vendors ( the chicken on a stick is might damn good ! ) by the forum .	902
0	really bad . 1 star food at a 5 star price . definitely avoid eating here . i had lobster and it was so overdone but yet it was priced as if it were fresh from the dock . service was week . they had a huge group come in and it got so out of control . these girls acted as if they were in a pizza parlor , doing cheers and screaming and management never tried to step in . bad food , bad service , bad ambiance . just bad overall . at least i did not get food poison so that 's a plus !	169
1	speedy and friendly service . it 's close to home for me and everyone is very knowledgable . came in for an oil change and much better service than the dealerships here in the city . ask for james , he 's awesome !	2561
1	i have used both the plumbing division and the a/c division of rainforest . they are honest , trustworthy , always on time , call when they 're on the way ... .and fair . the techs are always professional and courteous . i 've written good reviews about them before and will continue to do so every time i use them . no , i 'm not affiliated in any way with this company , but kudos should be given where they 're due . thx	2775
0	there a better indoor playgrounds around las vegas with cheaper pricing and better hours . we went to kangamoo at 1:30pm and they said they were closing . it was on a saturday ! so we took out business elsewhere and it was well worth it . probably wo n't go to kangamoo . way better options out there .	1631
1	this place rocks ! as i parent i feel very confident with my daughter going here . the office staff is knowledgeable and helpful . i would definitely recommend this place to everyone .	654
1	friendly staff and big selection of almost anything you want . since im a big fan of electronics , this club has great , if not the best selection top of the line tv 's ranging in all sizes at a reasonable and fair prices .	2556
0	grilled cheese was average and expensive , coffee was tart and sour . the person making the grilled cheeses was also eating the food at the same time , which was not very appetizing nor sanitary . so if you enjoy huddling into tiny , crammed spaces to drink below average coffee at above average prices because it 's the cool thing to do , this is your place .	3658
1	the rooms are spacious with a separate sitting & work area . even the toilet & shower are separate invade your sharing the room . 2 comfortable queen beds very nice staff at check in . rooms are clean quiet and comfortable i love that there is no smoky loud casino downstairs . there is a free breakfast downstairs but i did not go so i ca n't comment on that only that it 's offered . there is also a refrigerator and microwave in the room .	3253
1	very very good food . lots of variety and great options for kids too . definitely coming back .	1302
0	terrible experience . food is way too salty . service is terrible . i waited 30 mins for my drink and expected a no sugar drink since i orderedd so , when i saw the server serbing multiple same.drinks to different tables i knew she was gon na mess it up . so i double checked with her and she insist its no sugar . guess what , when i tried it , its like has more sugar than coke .	566
0	no stars for this business..dropped off a dress for alteration on a saturday with a promise to complete on thursday . showed up to pick up dress on friday morning and not done . no apology and not even an excuse . if i did n't have a party in friday i would have taken unaltered dress and left . done last minute with a lot of stress . will not return to this business . not reliable .	3401
1	lol , i love that i am considered a regular on yelp here when i was in vegas for a week . we stayed at our time share across the street and they gave us vouchers for the restaurants . if you could n't tell by the fact that i am a `` regular '' , we went there a couple times because the food was good and inexpensive . if we stay at the timeshare again , i will definitely be back to big sur !	1255
1	my ac was not running properly in 118 degree weather . my home warranty company contracted todd edwards to do the service . jason was able to come out the next day . he was professional , courteous , and fixed up my ac unit . now it works great ! thanks jason !	2824
0	if i could give this place no stars i would ! this place is such an unorganized hotel . as i write this i 've been standing in line for 45 mins and the line has n't moved ! they need to get more staff to accommodate all your guests trying to check in ! there is literally one person working here !	3091
0	dealing with this hotel is absurdly annoying - i am currently planning an event there for my organization and their sales/catering team is a nightmare . i 've worked with erinn good ( terrible with customer service and ca n't spell ) and karen bannerman who is supposed to be her boss ( even worse customer service and could n't care less about the errors her staff makes ) and i am completely regretting using the westin . overpriced with frustrating staff !	1859
0	once again i dragged myself out of the house on saturday to buy vac bags . and once again they are closed . good family owned business , but call before you waste the time and gas .	3895
1	i went to 5 other orthodontist before i decided to go with dr.garner . he is a nice man and very thorough in my consult with him . he explained everything he was going to do . he was also the better priced orthodontist from the others and i instantly liked him . my daughter also likes him . he has a great personality and the staff is very nice as well .	2566
0	if you are looking at all these reviews about them charging double out of the blue for maintenance fees ... they are correct ! they said they emailed everyone . but since i never put my email on file and they did not post signs in any of their gyms ... they took my money without notification . i have already canceled my membership and while talking to an employee found out that so far over 20 % of the members have done so . time to start looking somewhere else .	3898
1	love this place ! the deserts are absolutely beautiful and very delicious . they are a little too sweet for me but i always have a few bites and save the rest for a later snack . it 's the perfect place to grab and espresso or champagne and a dessert to start the evening . i have never tasted their wedding cakes but they are some of the most beautiful i have ever seen i love looking at their instagram as well !	981
0	this used to be one of my favorite spots . i used to bring people here all the time . last night i went for dinner , the server was very rude , like extremely rude . i did n't finish dinner . asked for check before finishing the appetizer and left . if this continues i expect this place will be out of business very soon . 2 stars because the food was still very good	927
1	our dogs were groomed by michelle and she is awesome ! ! i called in the morning and they got me right in for that afternoon . they even showed up 30 minutes early for the appointment ! i have a husky/malamute and a chow/retriever , both were very matted and they looked so handsome when they were done ! ! chewy has an anxiety issue and does not like the dryer which is why we were never able to take him to an outside salon . they were very patient with him and the fact that they let my husband help calm him down was great so they could finish their job . will definitely be using them regularly !	1218
1	great pizza at a good price . i really like the lunch special . the `` serious '' slice is just enough for 1 person and it comes with a drink too . even though they charge extra for toppings , i always get the extra peperoni . the service has been good . lunch is always quick when i am in a hurry .	417
1	what a way to end the summer . my kids wanted to come to this place before they headed back to la . we go to vegas a lot but we do n't always have time to do other things like visiting atm . however this year it was different ; we had extra time . we came here and our mission was accomplished . we met brett and he was really nice ! thanks for the awesome time ! ! ! ! !	2440
0	i walk in for an eyebrow clean-up and it 's just me in the salon . the lady was on her phone while i 'm sitting there waiting . after about 10 minutes , when i get up to leave , she says `` wait hold on '' and then comes to do my eyebrows . she takes off way too much ... makes them way thinner than my original brow . so needless to say , not a good experience , i wo n't be going back .	1729
1	great alternative when you wan na grab a drink with your friends but are n't in the gambling mood .	2494
0	horrid stay away . i do n't know why i went to this place after reading the terrible reviews . every bad review was spot on . this place sucks beyond imagination . horrid food , and a staff that is totally out to lunch .	25
0	the first time i used these guys they were great , quick , professional and i was very pleased . then i booked a 2nd move and the date was cancelled due to miscommunication . it was rescheduled and at 0615 on the morning of the move i got a text saying they could not do it but would call me to reschedule . they have never called me back . i had to go with another last minute mover , which was a terrible inconvenience but turned out to be just as good . will never call these people again ! ! !	2473
0	i have never had such a horrible nail job done ! within days my gel started bubbling and chipping off ! so pissed .	1637
1	we decided to partake in some laser tag for my friend 's bachelorette party and it was a blast . we also did the indoor bumper cars . i really enjoyed the laser tag course - but it was four on four . i feel like if there were more people it would have been a bit too crowded . we topped it off with slushie drinks which were n't too sugary , but definitely tastey !	1154
1	no wait . good service . great food . my new favorite place . get the french toast . cheap and it rocks .	158
1	i discovered this place after needing a new tire and oil change . what caught my attention was that they had a deal for an oil change for $ 19 . what i really liked about this place is that they let my puppy wait with me in the waiting area . everyone here was really nice and did an efficient job at getting my car back in safe driving condition . i believe that they genuinely care about customer satisfaction and will do the best they can to get you a good deal as well .	2392
0	this location has a horrible customer service . not any of the employees there we saw or pass by us said hello or greeted us . and also this ridiculous lady with a young daughter did n't even say thank you while my daughter hold the door for them . use some manners people	2479
0	i took my car in for just an oil change they asked if i wanted my tires rotated so i said sure . with the oil change they are supposed to top off all my other fluids nothing else was topped off my alignment is now in awful condition . they tired to take advantage of me because i am a female . i was not please with my experience there at all .	856
0	slow slow slow ! made an appointment and still had to wait an hour after that time to see the dr. employees seem to be relaxing and taking their time , hurry up ! i 'm sick and need medicine , get some pep in your step ! honor your appointment times !	535
0	i was working in the ballantyne corporate park and decided to try this place out with a co-worker . i had the reuben sandwich and they went with the cheeseburger . i 'm a big fan of reuben 's and i have to say this one was pretty bad . they definitely need to spend the money to get a better cut of meat if they are going to keep this on the menu . the sandwich also needed more kraut and thousand island dressing . the french fries that came with the meal where pretty good . i 've heard that the club is pretty good so maybe i 'll try that if i go back .	820
0	disappointed to find out michelle no longer works at this location , but decided to give other staff a chance . after two appointments with different people , i decided to go elsewhere . i ended up with wax in my hair and thin eyebrows each time . the best thing about michelle was that she listened to what i asked for . i was very specific when i asked to only `` clean up '' my eyebrows and not reshape them because i wanted them as thick as possible . perhaps the other staff members were n't as experienced .	1875
0	the only 24 hour pharmacy in this side of town and they do n't take my tricare insurance . yet another organization that does n't support the troops . of course i ca n't totally blame them for not taking my insurance as tricare has gone to hell since united health care took over . but still . now my sick kid needs to wait 10 hours for a real pharmacy to open .	758
1	i live closer to the basha 's and fry 's in the same area , but always go to the location for groceries since they have an in-house wells fargo and i can kill two birds with one stone when i need some groceries . they have a great selection of everything you need , with great prices . their liquor and deli sections are probably the best out of the supermarkets in the area as well . the only thing i wish i could find was large bags of frozen chicken breasts . for some reason , either they do n't carry it or i ca n't find it . oh , well ...	1097
1	i had the honor of working for the leonard cohen tribute concert in november , and fairmont is where we had our production offices . the staff was absolutely wonderful the food phenomenal . they also have a beautiful boutique food store that just opened inside the hotel it is absolutely gorgeous with imports from italy and paris- for all of you out there looking for some unique christmas holiday gift shopping i highly recommend you check it out or just go for the waffle station it is to die for ! ! !	1671
0	yeah , this shop has amazing prices i must admit . good selection of juices as well . the house juices i 've tried are good and very reasonably priced , but after a day or two seems like the flavor just is n't there anymore . the premium juices are much better . i also enjoy that they allow sampling which is nice . the deal breaker is that the customer service is not great , and all the employees seem to be bothered each time i ask to see something , or ask any kind of questions . i would rather pay a little bit more for better customer service and a cleaner environment .	1591
1	is this the best hamburger you 'll ever have ? no , but for being a fast food burger it was pretty good with a lot of little extras many other places do n't have . things like the grilled caramelized onions and double the amount of pickles that i have gotten from any where else . there was also two slices of tomatoes which was nice but they were still a little too ripe and could have used another day or two before reaching preferred quality . the menu said free toppings but for a $ 7 burger , they did n't feel so free . if you have n't been to a five guys , its definitely worth the try .	1315
0	i just got off the phone with the answering machine that asked me to wait 1 min . to be answered . after a few minutes the machine came on the line and said `` due to the high volume of calls we can not answer this call , please call back or leave a message and someone will get a hold of you within 24 hrs . '' i thought this was a doctors office and not a telephone company .	938
1	this is a good place to grab a cigar or two and relax . you can bring your laptop and do your thing . there are comfortable lounge chairs to sit on but they only have one table to use for your laptop . they also have a large hdtv on the sports channel . the ceilings are tall so you will not get smoked out . they did not have any rum runners ( alcohol dipped ) or flavored cigars . the staff is friendly and will give you a tour of the humidor room / cigars and they will answer all your questions . you will not be disappointed .	2337
1	reasonably-priced and delicious ! i thought to was absurd to pay between $ 7- $ 8 for a vanilla latte with almond milk at several other coffee shops . i am happy to say this cafe has reasonable prices and they do n't charge for their milk options ( soy and almond milk included ) : ) latte tasted great ! will make this my go-to spot while staying in this area of the strip .	2397
1	epic flavors are the standard faire at the magic oven . i 'm becoming quite the fan ! note that wait times are longer than your average pizza joint , as they make the pizza fresh while you wait .	1063
0	went to this place friday 25jan around 7-8pm . it was darker inside than it was outside ! ! ! really , the only way i could find the bar was by the light of the two people on their laptops sitting at a table ! i love going to vegetarian places , so this was a huge disappointment ! ! ! after waiting a few minutes for service at an empty bar i left . never again !	1083
1	stopped here last night for military monday discount.. it was the first time our family had been here even though we live so close . i will have to say i was impressed with the food and service we received . we all got the tender meals and were impressed with the taste and quality . the tenders are lightly breaded and juicy ... the variety of sauces offered appeals to any taste bud . we will definitely be coming back soon .	998
0	i was so disappointed with venetian nail spa . after reading all these great reviews , i thought it would be a great place to go . during my french manicure ( acrylic ) , i was not asked if i wanted my nails straight or rounded . i also was n't asked if i wanted any sort of pink polish over it . after i left the salon , i realized there were chunks of the acrylic mix left under my fingernails instead of a smooth edge . my nails were different lengths and so were the white tips . sloppy service in general . i wo n't be coming back .	43
1	tonight was a great evening . the grey tie event was excellent . the spinach , watermelon salad , the pot stickers , and the main dish asian beef with jasmine rice . met new people . thus far , this the one of the most nice apartment complex i have ever lived in .	3029
1	a great breakfast and lunch spot . excellent food -- the breakfast burrito is stellar , as is the french toast . at lunch the bacon cheddar burger is excellent , and if you enjoy wraps you need to try the turkey cranberry wrap - it 'll remind you of thanksgiving at any time of the year . it has n't been super busy any of the times i 've visited -- yet . that will be sure to change as word spreads about this hidden gem . nice job by the staff too !	1394
0	i purchased a groupon and scheduled an appointment online . the appointment was confirmed and i arrived 15 minutes early . unfortunately , no one was there when i arrived and no one showed for up the 30 minutes that i waited . luckily , groupon is awesome and refunded me .	2214
0	stay away far far away . tacos were very greasy and the rice was dry . not sure why this is rated 4 star way over rated .	548
0	for some reason yelp 's review filter conveniently filtered out my review along with the vast majority of the reviews for this place . please see my original review for the aquarium , it 's not worth your time or money !	706
1	my first time here at blue 32 was great . i came for happy hour i had the chicken wings and a chambord margarita both are fantastic ! service was friendly and fast .	428
0	i will never buy anything from this place . i was in here about two weeks ago looking for parts for my truck . there was two employees off to the side talking and one of them was stateing how he has a customer on his hook and was gon na up sell the s @ * # out of him . he was bragging about how this customer will but anything this salesman told him he needed even though he did n't . i was so appalled . even if you gon na say that about people that pay your wages , it 's bad taste to bragg about it while customers are in the store .	203
1	oh my goodness ! the wings and oysters are amazing ! ! you can not go wrong with them . the staff was extremely friendly and gave great customer service . definitely going back next week !	201
0	this place needs to check up on its employees . one guy went outside for a cigarette and pissed outside in broad daylight ! ! right in front of the mexican restaurant where i was eating my dinner . and then he continued to smoke his cigarette , went inside & did n't wash his hand before starting on someone 's pedicure ! ! i am so appalled by that behavior !	2736
0	as many people have already mentioned how overpriced their food is , i was not here to comment on how absurd the price is . it was the service . during our entire dining time , they cleared out dishes multiple times before we were finished with them . we had to stop them quite a few time . for a restaurant that intended to situated themselves as a `` classic '' restaurant , the service is beyond subpar . no wonder it was quite empty during dinner time on a long weekend .	1441
0	i walked in and like normal , it was pretty busy but there was n't anyone at the front counter . 2 guys saw me and continued to talk . one of them , dylan , just stared at me and finally asked me what i wanted . told him and all the meanwhile he was leaning on his computer and not really listening . he did n't even tell me a total , nothing . mind you he was just staring into outer space . no customer service at all . someone needs an attitude check .	44
1	omg what amazing prices . bought 3 coils for my lexus es-300 . auto zone wanted 69.99 each . bought 3 for 31.00 each . just called on a radiator for my lexus . auto zone wanted $ 135.99 penny pincher $ 81.00 these prices are amazing !	2027
0	the food here is still great , but the last 3 or 4 times we have dined in and ( especially ) taken out , the service has been poor . the staff has actually been rude , which is really surprising since they are never that busy . the food is still really good , so part of me wants to keep ordering from here , but the service really ruins it every time recently . too bad ...	1458
0	well , they finally did it . wish it would have happened sooner , but it took this long . # walmart finally lost me . they would n't honor their own price . item listed online for $ 13 . in store it 's $ 20 . their product on their website and they said they could n't match that price in the store . yet , i could have selected the `` pick up in store '' option , stood there for an hour while they got it ready , and they would have honored the price . but i was n't allowed to get it myself for that price . shame on that shithole !	3825
0	food was decent at best ... if you can get over all the flies its good . if not , order carryout ...	548
1	i had a great experience here . maybe perhaps there are new people working customer service since these last negative postings because i found them to be very friendly and accommodating . when i got there , i was able to fill out my paperwork and see the technician within 20 minutes and the doctor 5 minutes after that . they were caring , knowledgeable , and wanted me to feel taken care of , which i did . i would certainly come back and recommend this establishment to anyone .	1345
1	i 've been doing business with bette leal and her fine staff of residential & commercial re professionals since 1992 , and can give them nothing less than my very highest recommendation . they are , without any doubts of any kind , the one company in whom you can place your complete trust and confidence . i 've referred many friends and business associates to them , and not one of them has ever given me any negative feedback . all of them , without exception , have been totally satisfied with their professionalism and dedication to the very highest standards of ethical conduct	3315
0	honestly i have not been one to complain but i feel it is necessary in this situation . i was in a car accident and invision told me some of the damage was due to normal wear and tear . they lied multiple times and put me back in my truck where the damage almost caused my wheel to fall off on the highway . i would n't send my worst enemy to this body shop !	2680
0	where hair dreams come to die . everyone here is just very sad and bored looking . not very interested in what you want as a customer . not recommended . mostly unskilled , clumsy or unnecessaryily snobby stylists . there are far better places to go in markham or even the mall .	1430
0	we will never return . our appointment was in 10 minutes and a lady walked in 15 minutes after us and was told there was only one provider and the wait is one hour to an hour and a half and she was taken in 15 minutes . we walked out and the front desk said the reason there was a wait was because of walk ins and urgent appointments . not cool . was told this place was amazing and i will never return or recommend .	1562
0	absolute scam . plenty of dentist scams in vegas , this is one of them . i was lied to about a quote just to get me in . lied to about when they received my information from the root specialist , which might have worked if i did n't watch them fax the information over several weeks ago . not to mention being lied to about available appointment times , to what purpose that served i have no idea but significantly impacted the scheduling of my day . then on the way out , they tried to claim i owe them $ 70 from an account in 2014 , which was paid in full .	3929
0	horrible ! currently at the drive thru . been here for 25 minutes . once i finally get to the mic , `` teriyaki chicken will be an 8 minute wait '' . i 've been to the drive thru 4 times and on 3 occasions there has been an 8 minute wait for teriyaki chicken . this place never fails to disappoint . i 'm from tucson , az and all of your establishments are just fine up there , why not here ?	1342
0	well ... i do n't normally bother to update reviews but this business owner apparently really has an issue if you do n't give a completely positive review and will come back after you 5 years later ! i barely remember this place but apparently they have my records ready to go for correcting my `` lier '' ways . good luck to you precision . i have moved forward and hope you can too ... maybe in another 5 years or so ...	2497
1	i agree with both of the reviewers . these guys take a long time , and once in awhile i 'm welcomed by a napping owner . i only go here when i 'm not in a rush to get things back . and the reason i keep going back is because they do a great job and it 's very convenient to and from work . they also have shoe repair which is very convenient . i think their pricing is fair . i just really like that they have a lot of service options . i have been to cheaper cleaners , and you get what you pay for .	3672
0	terrible costumer service . our server was on the phone with someone on her cell phone in the middle of the restaurant having a full blown conversation , and then finally came to take our order ( still on the phone ppl ! ! ) and then came over a few mins later and said `` sorry guys my manager calls at the worst times i swear '' ugh ok then either finish the conversation first or tell ur so called manager you have tables 2 stars bc the food was decent	1504
0	just came in for an air check , one guy sets me up in position says we 'll be right with me , next guy comes up and says what are you here for i saying air check he says there 's another guy in front of your going to have to move your car . if i was retired i probably would n't care but i 'm on a busy schedule i 'm out of here . expect better from discount tire .	2116
1	dr garcia is awesome and so is her staff . everyone is sweet and my kids love coming here . i have no complaints	2461
1	fast lunch service and an amazing chicken salad ! i would reccomend this location to anyone . our server never let me run out of tea and was a delight the entire time . also ... .free pie on wed !	1029
1	10 out of 10 ! ! ! ryan , drake & theron made everything quick and easy and got me a deal that no other vegas shop could beat ! thanks for the great experience !	195
1	best place for sandwiches . always served fresh and taste great . i go here often usually saturday mornings around 9am and always get the italian night out with extra mayo . must try their tuna sandwich from their big sandwich menu , best i 've ever had . friendly people great you as you enter and leave .	1475
1	this was my first time doing the hot pot thing and this place is awesome . great service , really fresh food , good prices . the scallops are sushi grade , which is awesome because you can just barely cook them ... yum . we were here for lunch and got so much high-quality , yummy food for $ 11 a person . free refills on salad and veggies . ask for extra peanut sauce , it is so good . i ca n't wait to come back here next time we are in vegas .	285
1	best colour technician around ! been coming here for years ! david knows how to work with every type of hair and you will always leave satisfied with his work !	804
0	this is an ok place to go and hang out with some friends after work and maybe get some chips and salsa . i went there for dinner and it 's basically what you 'd expect from a chain mexican restaurant . i was not impressed . there are much better places to go if you are in the mood for mexican food .	1558
0	the person they are calling their manager here has horrible customer service . he gave us an awful look and a very bad attitude . i would suggest going to any other store but here .	1608
0	i ordered acorn-sized gravel and they quick to deliver rock to my house . once they got me to sign , the dumped a covered load of the wrong sized rock onto my driveway and drove off leaving watermelon-sized boulders on my driveway . have called at least 6 times , spoke to one of the managers ( anthony ) and still have not recieved a call back or any solutions . great company if you get what you ordered , but if they make a mistake do n't expect them to fix it . i still have a pile of the oversized boulders in my driveway . avoid this company !	3824
1	matt was super nice , efficient , and knowledgeable . got a new glass and lcd screen for my iphone .	2930
0	charged twice . did n't really make any effort to fix it or be helpful . sad thing is i would n't of cared so much if the pastries did n't taste like dry wall . save your time do n't get scammed and go somewhere else !	1806
0	extremely unprofessional employees . the front store supervisor jennifer is extremely rude and seemed bothered that i was actually trying to buy something from ross . also she decided not to fold my clothes but wad them up in a ball and shove them in my bag . i walked out on the 132.49 sale and will never shop at ross again	1678
1	boy was this place packed ! we are so glad they 're here - as our `` dining out '' options just turned into `` dining in '' choices from the prepared foods section at whole foods . i 'm super excited about that . some of the freshest produce around ... .. just prepare to fight for a parking spot and be patient checking out , it 's going to take a bit to get out of there .	1428
1	tammie coe 's coconut cupcake is one of my all time favorites ! freaken drool ! soooo good ! my mother in law works close by and sometimes brings a couple of tammies cuppys with her ! i have had a couple of tammies cakes . the cake itself is good and so is the filling , but i am not a fan of her fondant in the slightest . and lets not forget mj breads ! woah ! i am in serious love with the potato rolls that they make for the holidays . their buttermilk rolls are tasty as well ! these are great rolls for kicking up your holiday spread a couple notches !	1125
1	this has consistently been my favourite restaurant for years . the staff are helpful , and the food is always amazing . if they do n't have what you want on the menu , they 're always willing to do something special for you . but everything is good . the chocolate kaluha cheesecake is fantastic . it is the only restaurant that i go to where i always make sure i leave room for desert .	1271
0	trendy looking place which will attract you to go inside and have a try . it is a chicken place . we ended up ordering a variety of appetizers with a main fried chicken . the choice of different sauces is interesting . if you are looking for good food this place is not it . the food was meh ! i would n't go back to eat but to hang out and drink is another story !	1043
1	always amazing every time i stay here . one of the best timeshares on the market today .	1057
0	walked in to buy flowers for my wife the day before mothers day . you would think they would be staffed to help people . instead there was one other customer , my daughter and i walked around looked and no once did we get asked if we needed anything or if they could get us flowers . apparently business is so great they do n't need anymore business . i have bought from here before and service was over the top . i have never been more disappointed . i went to albertson 's and received service that was 1000 % better than what i got here , plus the flowers were priced reasonable .	3622
0	rude washed out bartender . worst service ever.. , thanks debbie we wo n't be back . is this a strip club or local bar .	1688
0	if you want to develop a bowel problem , eat at piggly 's !	144
0	i would n't come to this location again , we received such horrible service . their speed and quality of service was trash . if i could give them zero stars i would .	1523
0	hollywood men in california was a million times better . would not waste my money to ever see show again . dancing was mediocre , staff was rude ... .blah ! ! ! ! ! = (	2149
0	i went here thursday evening with my friend . i got the grilled chicken pho and almost immediately after eating it i had the worst stomach pain . i vomited about an hour or so after eating . throughout the weekend i was unable to eat anything without vomiting . i went to the hospital today and they confirmed it was food poisoning . will not be going here again unfortunately as the chicken was not cooked properly .	577
1	i popped in at around 9 am with a battery that would n't stop draining . i dropped off the phone and was told i could swing by around 12 to pick it up . the phone works great now and it 's depleting like crazy . great service . well worth the charge of service . would 100 % recommend on any phone repair moving forward .	2378
1	newly remodled best buy . it is nice but seems like it wasted a lot of space when they did . they only seem to have 2 registers as well , and they are poorly placed . otherwise , it is a best buy and prices are good and service is alright .	494
1	favorite sushi place in calgary so far ! all the fish seems to be nice and fresh every time i have gone . love going to the all-you-can-eat dinner . plenty of seating for large parties . it gets a bit loud in the evenings so it 's no the best for a romantic date night . but i love this place !	206
1	i do n't know why this place gets such a bad rap for the price and location you can not beat it i paid 22 bucks a night its right in the middle of everything my room was clean the balcony opened the casino part was awesome we got drinks faster here than any other place we went to the only reason they do n't get 5 stars is because the front desk lady was n't the nicest person to deal with	2976
1	used to live in mtl and this was a staple of the city ... a fire closed their doors for a while and they took the opportunity to give it a facelift . chicken is second to none . order for pickup to avoid crazy lineups mid day .	1109
0	the people are nice and are truly trying ... but they know nothing ! overall it was a total let down . it was like staying in a ho-jo or super 8 but the price was not ! just a total bummer . you should n't have to block the cold air coming from the windows , watch for peeling paint or carpet pulling up ... stay somewhere else .	3522
0	they approved my loan . i e-mailed them and called them numerous times they did n't return my calls . they gave me a higher interest rate ; 3.5 % more than any credit union around . i stopped by their branch . the loan woman had no interest in giving a loam . she asked me if i wanted to cancel which i answered yes . what a waste of a trip to their branch .	1687
0	this was the first male strip club i 've been to and i was pretty disappointed . there were about 5 dancers and only one guy was good looking ( imo , see picture ) . he was also the only good dancer so they definitely saved the best for last . the first dancer from cali was extremely awkward to watch , he must be new . i expected it to be much more fun and wild for a bachelorette party but it was pretty chill . there were n't very many people there for a thursday night either .	5
1	this is the best grocery store in the downtown/central area . i actually live next to the mcdowell/7th safeway but drive out of my way to go to this safeway on osborn . the store is always nice and clean , the parking is n't stressful and there 's always someone attending the alcohol section to assist . i will continue to drive farther to go to this store !	2316
1	do n't understand why there are so many bad reviews . i 've never had bad experience with this company . they always deliver packages really fast . for me it 's the one of best shipping services .	1755
1	love this big o . quality service , excellent customer service . i purchased 4 tires . they had better prices than discount .	3405
1	this is probably one of the smoothesss cake ever its like ur in the cloud but is it worth it ? ? ? for me i think is 8/10 jst for a small cake its not worth waiting for hours .	2253
0	some of the absolute worst food i have ever put in my mouth . we got wings and a chicken bacon ranch sub . the sub was basically a folded calzone and was complete grease , the bacon tasted like it was made in a microwave and the chicken was chewy and gross . the wings tasted like they were frozen and heated up in a microwave as well . i could have made better wings at home with 2 percent effort . we will never eat here again , waste of $ 45	954
0	do not go to this doctor i made an appointment and still waited an hour and a half to be seen . they took me in the back and i waited another 30 minutes i also needed to be referred to a doctor and dr. defreshi referred me to the wrong doctor . the staff did n't know my insurance after being there three times . the staff was also rude and insufficient . the only person there that was customer friendly was jennifer	3465
0	nice location and view , but absolutely the rudest staff i have ever had the misfortune to meet . have no intention of ever staying here again .	1859
0	service left allot to be desired , as i am in the business . my training always included that first come , first serve . but obviously that is bypassed when friends show up ? and this administrative fee that is automatically added to the bill is illegal unless it is posted . sorry route 28 , you wo n't get my money , nor my co-workers . happy new year !	114
1	love it here ! a lot of people complain about prices / lack of sauna jacuzzi / steam room whatever but if you know how to workout none of that matters ! very clean equipment , great free weight are with an amazing variety of weights ! the price is not bad at all ! we get access to any la fitness anywhere in the us ! if you think it 's too much then learn to manage your money ! ( :	1981
1	i was hesitant about advantage because of the bad reviews but i got a great deal . they of course tried to upsell but that is their job . the only problem i had was they gave you both set of keys and you could n't separate them . it was so big i could n't fit them in my pocket .	2138
0	service was slow , wings dry and the waitress never came back to ask me if i want another drink or clear the table . have n't seen the check i could walk out but i wo n't . oh and the ladies bathroom is so disgusting i would rather go in the woods	788
0	got hit by someone with progressive insurance . it 's been a week and no one has called me . my car is n't drive able . nothing . then the claims adjuster is on vacation . so how much longer do i have to wait for someone to get back to me . augh . horrible service	3280
1	i 've been taking my vehicle to performance for about a year now . these guys are the best ! whether it 's routine maintenance or a major repair you ca n't go wrong with the outstanding customer service they offer .	2047
1	what a quaint and delicious tea joint . the space is so relaxing and modern . i had their sun devil tea boba , and man o man was it delicious . today i also tried their cold brew , nice and smooth . great space , great product . definitely stop by if you are looking for great tea !	2238
1	no complaints here . fairly cheap for the overall quality of the place and service . appointments are n't necessary but i suggest it . they were fairly dead when i got there but within the matter of minutes it became a full house of mani+pedi walkins . alex is great , always kept asking if what he was doing looked okay .	3732
1	i have been in many starbucks , but this store is always so clean . the shift manager jay is very professional and aim to please her customers !	2893
0	order food comes to payment front counter goes we do n't accept american express . since when does a business decided what cards they will except or not	586
0	live in antiquity so was very excited about crafty burgers . first time food was good but service was terrible . visited 4 times since . onion rings very greasy . ran out of fries ! ! slow although they were not busy . a mess in the kitchen . sat in last booth and floors were very dirty . hope they get their act together ! ! !	1046
0	poor selection of lingerie . dancer shoes from the 80 's . wayy over priced dancer wear . fascinations adult store down the street blows this place out of the water . they do sell other things such as bongs and porno although the smoke product prices are inflated as well . would not recommend .	1703
1	service was exceptional and my food was hot as well as my coffee . for the brand they give good service . they are in a great location and are a needed feature for this part of gilbert .	1770
1	i picked up lunch and the bartender andy was very excellent . he is extremely friendly and makes otb a place worth going to .	1558
1	update : they have modified the 21+ portion of the audience so that you 21+ can go to the front in the as well as the all ages section . i like to think my previous review made this happen . if so , thank you for listening . i enjoyed having a drink and being up front at the same time . it is a great venue ! absolutely perfect . the sound quality could n't be better . staff is really nice . bathrooms are exceptionally clean . this is my favorite venue .	316
1	i took my mom here for brunch on sunday and we had a great experience ! the food and wine was amazing and the staff was very warm and welcoming ! the chef even came to our table to make sure everything was to our liking . i will definitely be back ! !	967
1	whenever i need to make sure i get those perfectly arched brows , i have to stop by here . the only downside is that it is n't the most pleasant experience but beauty usually never is !	2630
0	rude came in8:45 close at 9 told us we could eat quick we could if not no do not eat here rude rude	135
1	i have never , ever , ever had any issues with a westin . this westin in toronto continues that streak of excellence . check in was extremely easy with pleasant staff . rooms were extremely clean and the water pressure was great ! they could improve by adding outlets by the bedstand . that i believe is almost becoming a no-brainer in our hyper-connected world . location is great , but there was a lot of construction going on . once they 're finished with that i think it will be better than outstanding .	1859
1	gorgeous in the summer , and even better if you can get a seat ( or a standing spot with a view ! ) . they have fun , good drinks that are pretty much average in terms of price , at least for downtown . their caipirinha is especially good . it can get pretty crowded by the bar but even so , service is pretty fast ! when you close your tab they are really quick about getting your card back to you , which is nice .	780
0	management is terrible . place is run by a bunch of teenagers and everything is outdated . do n't waste your time or money , i promise you 'll be disappointed .	1154
0	both i , and the people with me , all agreed that the staff was snobby and rude , almost fake . customer service is not their expertise . they were not welcoming , attentive , or kind . will not be returning to this location . as someone who has worked in managerial customer service positions for 9 years , trust me when i say i am not normally one to complain , because i know we all have bad days . but for all four women working to be acting the same , bratty way ? not cool . much rather drive thr extra ten minutes to tanger . also , this store has a much smaller selection and sales..	653
0	smells terrible inside , we should have turned around and walked right out . food was not good at all . my husband and i had some type of food poisoning from there . will never recommend this place to anyone .	857
1	our first time here and we were pleasantly surprised ! every dish we ordered was so tasty and flavorful ! ... .volcano chicken , singapore noodles with beef , drunken noodles and fried rice . then tempura cheesecake yum ! ! our new favorite asian restaurant ! great service as well . we are impressed ! !	1203
1	saw dominique for an all over color . my hair is super short and no one has ever seemed to get it right . he nailed it ! awesome service and great guy to be around would highly recommend !	2274
0	terrible experience with dr santucci . very unprofessional in his dealings with my 12 year old daughter . my daughter made me switch orthodontists ... .. nic f	2877
0	had a very horrible experience with zipcar . a very unhelpful financial team as i was fined an unbelievably high amount for no fault of mine . the reason for which i was fined was not communicated to me properly even after calling the zipcar team and emailing the financial team . i would never use or recommend zipcar to anyone .	2232
0	my boyfriend and i took our new puppy here for her first groom last week . exciting time for us all ! but once we got over how different she looked after getting shaved , we started to notice what a horrible job they 'd done . stray hairs everywhere , very uneven trim . after removing her bows it looks like her hair was cut while in the bows . she looks like she has a little bit of a mullet now : ( her nails were trimmed very badly . and she was still matted . then they wanted to complain that she does n't like being groomed. ! never again ! ! we paid $ 60 for this . !	2108
1	skyler has been going to pete and mac 's for several years now . usually one or two days a week to play in the small dog day care group . she loves it and everyone is always so good to her . she has also stayed for several days in boarding when we go on trips . we have her play in day care everyday then . she always has fun and comes home exhausted . she also has her hair done there and always looks so pretty . really i 'd say pete and mac 's is her 2nd home . i would definitely recommend pete and mac 's : )	3108
0	why is it so difficult to be polite to a customer ? there are so many gun stores and gun shows . if the men here would just have some common sense customer service i would recommend this place .	1183
0	updating my last review . finally got to speak to someone in dr bradford group . rafael . the same guy who i have left messages for while i hobble around in pain . according to him he never received any of the voice mails i left and blamed everything on being shortstaffed . when i called him out on his bs he had no answers and nothing even remotely like an apology was offered . i mean why should he apologize for making me walk around in pain for weeks and not knowing why . btw the only reason i finally got him on the phone was because i threatened to come down there and not leave unless i got to speak to someone .	2176
0	the people who work here are just terrible at customer service in so many ways . they talk to me like i know nothing at all . i constantly feel pressured to buy things and wish i did n't purchase a package at this location , not knowing it was not usable at any other locations ...	3329
0	far out of the toronto core , near the airport . it 's a giant cement box full of fluorescent lights and filled with whatever the event is .	382
1	good service . we were seated pretty quickly and given water right away . our waitress was a trainee but did an excellent job . she got our orders right and was very proactive . the food was good . we ordered a marshmallow and strawberry toast and a popcorn chicken . total came out to $ 19.00 so it was n't the cheapest but i think the quality of the food and service was worth it .	176
0	dirty and disgusting . i emailed corporate and they handed the complaint over to the local store and the local store does not care . please be very careful . i am literally calling the board of health tomorrow . people are allowed to take samples and reuse the sample cups while the cups retouch the spout of the yogurt which then spreads germs . so awful ! horribly managed .	2581
0	we love barnes and noble but this store does not deserve to carry the name . it 's a terrible representation and if barnes and noble cares anything about their brand reputation they should get to this story immediately and clean it up ! please start in the bathrooms ! horrendous !	2218
1	3rd year in a row for us at this show . sands does a great job . we came here for the industry night and now here for the regular show . amazing .	587
0	they ca n't get an order right for the life of them . yesterday ( 06/23/16 ) when i went they left off a whole meal ! how do you do that ? they also shoved what they did give me in a tiny bag which squished the burgers ... it 's such a shame that these people think they really deserve 15 am hour .	844
0	all i did was to write an email enquiring nicely about service availability and the reply i got ? just 2 words , a curt `` not available '' . the service staff kevin needs some service courtesy training ! meanwhile , i brought my business elsewhere where the service was more courteous and professional .	2952
0	i 'm not really sure how to write a review for target - are n't they the same everywhere ? oh yeah - this one has a garage underneath it . it 's a target . what more do you need to know ?	1626
1	do n't go in here expecting high class food . they serve simple breakfast and lunch meals . it is not above average , maybe not even average . but the price is right for what they serve and the staff is incredibly friendly . the ambience of this place makes it worth going to , if you love diners that is .	253
0	cheap tickets , awful staff , probably a good idea they got the self serve kiosks . the remodel is nice but does n't make up for the lousy customer service and rude popcorn makers	491
1	fast , friendly , professional . self serve equipment is newer and quality . all this and including a towel and air freshener sets them apart . clean and stream lined set up . this is the future of car washing . looking forward to more locations in vegas .	2093
1	i travel to disneyland at least once a month , but when i am home in vegas i like to visit this store to experience some of that magic from the parks at home . the store is beautiful with a castle , coloring areas to watch movies , and great trivia games . the merchandise is straight from the parks , so if i forget something at disneyland , i can always come here to pick it up .	1960
0	do n't get the chicken bake ! i think the food court people are all new so they 're still learning . we bought 4 last night . all burnt and barely any sauce inside . we did n't check until we got home . make sure to double check the food quality before leaving . i 'm super disappointed . i 'm surprised they 're okay with releasing this when it 's a new store .	1609
0	i find the defensive nature of the dentist to any sort of negative feedback or suggestion to improve patient care completely off putting . i 've never seen an owner on yelp `` fight '' with negative reviewers .	2304
1	ha ! nobody wants to review a title loan place because it 's really embarrassing . and financially dumb . and a lot of other things negative . but ... when you lose two homes to foreclosure , lose your job , get divorced , get your wages garnished by a nazi-like hoa at your new job , and get hit with $ 175,000 in medical bills ( $ 18k out of pocket ) all in an 18-month time span , you may find yourself walking into a title loan place . like me : ) very friendly , professional , quick to make a decision , no crazy questions , etc . if you need to borrow against your car this is the place .	3404
1	the restaurant was located right by our gate so we decided to give them a try . i ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was huge ! pretty good for airport food . hubby ordered the bbq , bacon , chicken sandwich . he seemed to like it . only came with chips no fries : ( good place to stop and eat when you want to grab something before your flight .	219
1	i 've driven both the matrix and mini from this location . both vehicles are in great condition and cleanliness . driving the matrix was a good wakeup call for me as i 've had my heart set on owning one for years . i also found out driving the mini that i do n't fit . there 's lots of leg room but i had to stick my head into the sunroof area .	2232
1	irene was awesome ... went in not sure if i want to cut off my hair ( because of fear ) but once done it was fabulous ! she even gave me the name and info of a charity i could donate to . loving my new style and she has a forever customer now .	3655
0	the worst pedicure i have ever received . extremely basic . i filed nails , polish on skin , rough heels ... waste of cash	3347
1	i had an issue with car wash coupons but once kendal lay heard about my problem , it was resolved within days . convenient location and excellent customer service .	2198
0	i was looking for suits for my wedding in july . we worked with tamber who was extremely helpful in picking out the royal blue suits that we were looking for . she was very helpful and wanted us to get the right combination of colors . fast forward 2 months . they have miss placed our suits . only care about prom suits . all suits were measured incorrectly and some had to be reordered . very disorganized there , only have 2 employees working . horrible service after the initial meeting	3942
0	a bit fancy for a quick bite and certainly not the dive it was in the past . i probably should i go back , but a little overpriced for the neighborhood . decent beer specials on draft night , but pretty underwhelming overall .	1253
1	love the burgers ! ! ! brought myself and my bf family from out of town and they love this place : ) something different from others .	964
0	for my 20th anniversary on valentines day i was surprised by a bouquet my husband had sent me to the palazzo after coming back from le reve show , although very beautiful i was really sad that the next day 2 of the roses were already dying 1 was full bloom and the water was beginning to become cloudy ! did what instructions said daily but no use my bouquet was just getting worse . for $ 150 i think they should last up to a week ! ! maybe the glass beads did n't let the stems breath idk or the way they cut them you could see the stems darkening where they cut or scraped them . see my pic !	545
1	this is hands down the best pizza in las vegas . tasty and healthy , almost too good to be true .	1371
0	alberto 's and roberto 's are my favorite taco shops in southern california to find one in las vegas was a treat until i ate here , i will not be back	322
1	went there for the very first time today for lunch . ordered the $ 6.00 lunch special burger . service and burger were both excellent . out the door for $ 6.95 after tax not counting the tip . i highly recommend it .	68
1	seriously amazing coffee . very impressive selection of tea as well . the best coffee and vanilla latte i have ever had . the vanilla syrup is made in house and has perfect flavor . might be the best cafe in all of cleveland ! unique and delicious snacks too	2344
0	decided to try this place because the chef used to work at shibuya - one of my favorite sushi place in calgary , opened up his own restaurant . from what i 've heard , it is similar to shibuya but ayce . honestly i can spend the same amount of money and get better food and service at shibuya . their food took a very long time to arrive . fish was not that fresh . lamb skewers were cold and hard when it arrived . service was slow . i will not come back as i have had better sushi at other places for the same price if not less .	206
0	purchased $ 2,800 worth of furniture last night on last day of black friday sale . the sales person rachel said she 'd talk to her manager to get me the best deal possible . when i got home i realized the prices seemed higher they what i researched online prior to visiting the store . turns out the `` discount '' they gave me was $ 307 more than the advertised sales price . so i will call today to see if they will adjust the price or i will cancel the order .	1794
0	my daughter and i and arrived at 4 pm ( our appointment time ) and sat there for 15 minutes without even being acknowledged . walked out and went to autumn lee nails instead . the only good thing i can say about the place was that it looked clean .	1661
1	good beer selection and decent food . i recommend the potato skins for an appetizer with prime rib chili on top . for an entree try the blackened chicken alfredo . also great place to watch games at .	970
0	i want to try something new since i never have latin foods before . i ordered the pollo saltado to go . fries on side . no soy sauce . fine with me as long as no salt on it . all good . about $ 17 for the meal . food came out of two big food containers . not worth it . small portion . not enough for the price being paid . chicken strips is dried . i wanted something with fries so i got this plate . i did n't even get my rice that was suppose to come with the meal ! i 'm just disappointed . first time and the last time for me .	927
0	probably the worst airport bar i have ever been to . next time i will buy something at the duty free store and drink it from the bag hobo style .	369
0	the lady employee was at the door on 9/12/18 around 10:30pm , saying store is closed because system is down . she could 've make it as manual transaction until their system is back to normal . i used to work at retail store and that 's what they 're supposed to do . all i need is a light bulb for my headlight . so , bad customer service , did n't even try to help .	424
1	been here at least 4 times and have not been disappointed . prices are a bit high . i think the best are the pan roasts but the clam pasta was excellent if a bit spicy which i do n't mind but some might . the crab cakes are decent size but seemed a bit bland to my taste , but it has been awhile since i have had crab cakes anywhere . mostly bar seating around the open kitchen with some tables as well . out in the open in the middle of the casino and has fairly late hours which is good .	1255
0	i have lived in this complex since 1998 and have been through a number of management companies . current management has been underwhelming to say the least . they have changed the front gate entrance from card keys to a numerical code and everyone has the exact same code , not very secure . they have made the process of picking up a package from the office more difficult than it needs to be and i have been waiting for maintenance to come fix the toilet in my bathroom which is unusable for almost four hours . not holding out much hope that they will show up today .	3515
1	ordered delivery and got here very fast ( under 30 minutes ! ) . you have to order the wings . they were so tasty . also recommend the pizza with the spelt crust . very flavourful pizza . both the pizza and wings were not oily either as others have mentioned . probably the only place around here that offers lactose free , gluten free and vegan options all at one place .	1063
1	love this place . best choice of toppings and sides . have eaten here at least five times before and never had an order that was n't great and prepared the way i asked .	724
0	very expensive , but the real complaint is the womens restroom . the worst ! all 3 toilets were disgusting with stains and rings around all the bowls . no toilet seat covers , no toilet paper , and it was obvious no one had been in to maintain or clean in a long time . avoid this place if you can .	3296
1	wow . what to say ... this steakhouse will blow you out of the water . the food is absolutely amazing and the service is even better ! aaron took care of us and the service was impeccable . make sure to try the pork belly mac and cheese . the ny strip is to die for . will be back soon ! maybe even this week !	481
0	we loved our therapist . but the office manager is so rude . she could n't be bothered to try to work with our insurance . she made it so uncomfortable going that we left and found another therapist .	1712
1	the store staff is friendly and accommodating . i went in looking for a particular lipgloss and i was n't able to find it where you normally would fine chapstick . the women at the beauty counter advised me where to find it and also told me that there were new styles coming out soon so be sure to buy the ones i like now because they will be changing . my only complaint is that the parking lot is so dark and there are usually sketchy characters hanging out in front of the store asking for money or rides to places . it would be really nice if they could provide better lighting to make those walking to their cars alone a little safer .	3937
1	currently getting a spa pedicure and i love their service . she is taking good care of me , and is doing a fabulous job .	2736
0	i want to give this place 5 stars just for the chicken and egg sandwich but i cant . this place is always out of the bagels i want . manager is slipping . other than that , always had friendly ppl working . fairly quick . a bit pricey ( about $ 10 for breakfast sandwich and medium iced coffee ) . the coffee is so strong you wont need to open the door to leave , you can just run through it like the kool aid guy . creamer canisters were all empty too . i think might need a new person running this location	477
1	the new pharmacy manager is excellent ! she has her team in line and gets stuff done quick ! even though the pharmacy is busy ... ..we get our prescriptions quick and she is always smiling ! i will tell all of my friends to transfer to walmart pharmacy on baseline & greenfield ! !	3825
1	dr mendoza was amazing ! ! i 'm sad that he 's not with them any more i definitely will try to find him.. i 'm going to see a different doctor and hopefully things will go well.. really sad mendoza is gone : ( still had a great experience	2223
0	terrible jobs done here . they try to up sale lots of services not needed . facial are more expensive than other places but makes no different on the level of service .	2326
0	just left after seeing a movie . got a classic vanilla cupcake . i 'm pretty sure that was a store premade type frosting . frosting was subpar . compare this to kreative kupcakes in avondale it 's like night and day .	1806
1	my friends and i came for a nice evening to chill . i 've passed by this place many of times . i knew it was a smoke shop but not a lounge . the environment is cool and relaxing . they play hip-hop all night . there 's no alcohol so i gave it 4 stars . the employees are very helpful , and professional . griffin was our host and he rocked ! there 's plenty of seating to accommodate large parties . they offer house flavors , that have a mixture of fruity flavors . also additional flavors with no gummies . there 's a store upfront to purchase hookahs , flavors , and additional items for smoking .	3013
0	when i came to eat here they informed me i lost my sunglasses there the previous visit , and when i asked to have them , they had no clue where they were and told me they think one of the employees or manager took them home with them because it had been too long . it was two weeks prior ... i will never come back .	1011
0	went to this cafe to get a coffee for my wife and get some work done with my laptop while my car was being worked on nearby . the attendant who was a there ... told me that their free wifi is only free if each both of us got a drink each . what stupid policy who ever came up with that one . bone head decision . shows that they clearly never graduated from a higher education . especially in an empty cafe . simply never going back to that place . no wonder starbucks and coffee bean dominate the markets . good luck . this is first hand information img_1965.png	2219
1	for the hottest bartender join ( kaylee ) wednesday nite at hot shots , fast , effent , breathtaking beautiful , wednesday 6 pm to close	1311
0	not in love . it 's a regular coffee shop . i ordered ginger espresso on a monday morning and the staff was so rude . the coffee was way too bitter and tasted cold . would not go back .	184
1	had an event saturday evening and errands wanted get a coffee or tea . it was only 10pm and every place was closed so looked up the newest starbucks and open til midnight . this was nice to find out as cinemark theatre is across from them . i had a green tea and dave had carmel macchiato . plenty of tables and sitting areas and was nice to see so many people just hanging out enjoying their coffee . i look forward to sitting on patio when weather warms up.im just thrilled to find out the hours ! !	3641
0	i had great hopes of finally finding a dr ! heard great things about dr. monroe . however , i had a difficult time getting an appt . the office answering machine kept answering and no calls were returned . i finally booked the appt thru an app zocdoc . i arrived at the office on time . was told the dr was 30 minutes behind schedule . after 2 hours and 25 minutes i left . i got in the elevator with a woman who told me she is a great dr but the wait can be painful . i will not return to this dr .	3323
0	this place was awful they made are experience so traumatic . the employee including manager needed some retraining . i 'm sorry but i do n't have anything good to say about this place . we wasted 300+ $ here for nothing .	1095
1	fabulous food ! christina makes the best margaritas around ! definitely worth the trip to boulder city .	340
1	i absolutely love my new floors ! john and alfredo were wonderful and did a great job installing them !	1379
0	made an appointment during the phone call the man i was speaking to was very rude . came there right on time waited 30 minutes before i decided to leave . not sure why i even made an appointment if they were going to completely ignore it .	822
0	stopped in for the guac and chips . server seemed annoyed that we were not staying for dinner . hey , they should be happy we were there at all . there was no one in the place . the guac portion was tiny , flavor , mediocre at best , chips boring , not hot and crisp . priced at $ 10 , a complete ripoff . in a city with so many choices , this place has to do much better to be noticed .	971
1	the people behind the counter are friendly . been here twice and always had excellent service . the waffles are tasty .	580
1	took my van in for a recall matter . the guy who helped me , robert , was very friendly and told me my car would be ready to go within an hour and a half . the car was done in about an hour as promised . i have always experienced great service at this dealership and always bring my vehicles here for any service needs .	2210
0	friendly service..but the food honestly tasted heated up from another day . came with the family and we got full off there bread instead . the bread they bring in the beginning was very yummy and soft ! but the food is not worth it , i did n't even like there fries because they have too much garlic , and i 'm a person who likes garlic but felt it was too much . not coming back unless its for the bread lol	1491
1	love it . very nice service lately . young thin girl works at the drive through , and she is sooooo nice ! ! long hair and a bit brownish ! ! !	1250
0	terrible experience . such a disappointment . horrible customer service . would give -5 stars if possible . show was cancelled last minute , and no one bothered to email or notify us . waited over an hour , only to be met with a sloppy and aggressive performer by the entrance being incredibly inappropriate , unprofessional , rude , unapologetic and offensive towards everyone who was waiting . i 'd highly recommend chippendales instead , your money is much better spent on actual gentlemen who are professional , sweet , and know how to create a good fun time without being disgusting and misogynistic like the thunder down under guys .	2149
0	when i was applying to live here the management staff were so accommodating , helpful , and nice ! after i moved in i was beyond disappointed with the management and maintenance staff . trouble tickets take forever to be `` completed '' . other tenants for the most part are just as grumpy and rude as the staff . it is a great location , but in my opinion it is far from worth it .	1828
0	patrick did a fantastic job on a rental property we are vacating tomorrow . carpet looks like new . patrick was friendly and professional . i will use hydrocare services again at our goodyear home and would highly recommend them . thank you patrick !	2248
1	their service was quick and fast ! i really enjoyed their new boneless buffalo wings ! super saucy and that 's the way i like it ! the cherry limeaid we a little watery , but that 's okay . the area is super far from my house but it 's a nice location . definitely happy with the stop i made !	994
0	worst . place . ever . guest list line is longer than regular line , and they made you wait outside in the cold until 12am , when guest list is over so you have to pay anyway . bouncers have a penis complex , are aggressive and literally do n't give a shit . plus i 've heard that the music in there sucks too . after 2 hours of waiting in the cold , we left and went to b-side .	1282
0	they had me walking out with a mullet . i had to finish layering my hair myself . and they were rude with dirty look . i 'll stick to my sw durango location	3232
1	the lobby is a crowded mess before shows , the bathrooms are piss ( get it ! ? ) poor , and entering a show can be pretty annoying . all that said , i love watching shows here . the audio is good , the place has panache , and you can feel the history sitting there . they generally seem to attract good acts . free and easy parking is a cherry on top .	3868
1	this mall is more my speed than the one closest to my house , fashion square . they have stores that appeal more to me like old navy . they recently got a gelato place and a cool little dog boutique store where you can get fresh baked treats for your pup . the mall has another unique store that is a favorite of my boyfriend , the hobby bench . the only thing that really bums me out about pv mall is the book store is now gone .	2815
1	steven did our make up and he was not just friendly but so skilled in his work ! left looking and feeling like a super model , could n't have been happier with my experience ! ! thank you steven !	3316
1	yes , they are open ! the food is delicious , the portions are generous , the margaritas are good , and the specials are solid . each time we go there , the service is friendly and efficient . i just had the texas lunch fajitas ( photo ) and they were really tasty : well seasoned and fresh . as far as quality mexican food goes , i definitely think this place does it well . they 've been working hard on the place and i ca n't wait until they finish the patio ( and hang the sign ) .	651
1	kara our server was amazing . she was quick to grab our order regardless of how busy they were . she was on top of it ; she asked us constantly if we needed anything . food was hot when served and delicious .	520
0	service staff were not attentive . i had to call them several several times for various reasons : for menu , spoon for soup , etc . chopsticks did not seem to have been properly cleaned as they had a sticky surface . beef brisket/tendon ramen soup did not have a single piece of tendon and the brisket was overspiced and touch as rubber . location is good for theatre- and film-goers . but food is definitely over-priced .	113
0	these people are liars . i asked if they were in the aetna network , they said yes . now i come to find out they are not and they expect me to pay when they lied to me . the lady on the phone says they are told to say they are in network for all insurances , that they take all insurances . now i can not even get a hold of their billing department . beware of the pop up urgent cares . bad mojo .	2058
0	please please be aware that if you leave a bad rating here or you do n't like patrick ( as many of us dont ) or even if you choose to go somewhere else ... you will be harassed like i have been *if you would like to see proof of how he harasses you please message me once again , this mill is not worth the trouble unless you plan to hire patrick as a dj , his wife to make flowers and so on , cheaper and better options for your big day with less drama ! ! !	238
1	the process from beginning to end has exceeded all my expectations . dr schroeder and his team are the best . i have had nasal polyps removed before about 15 years ago and this time was a far better experience . thank you very much	737
0	i hated sonic food in general . the servers were nice and the food came quickly though . dont know what else you can expect .	994
1	you can not beat this ice cream ! ! ginger is fantastic ! ! ! closed last time i went by , but they posted a sign saying opening around the corner in february . hurry up february ; get here .	3606
1	i am not going to comment on authenticity . been to this place a few times . each time friendly service and good food at a fair price . one of the better chain mexican food places	1094
0	horrible customer service . we just moved to the area and this would have been a great location for us to use as a dry cleaner so i was excited to try it out . first time we took our clothes in they damaged a new sweater beyond repair and then it took forever to get a hold of a manager . after several calls got the information to the owner who never contacted me or returned an email . still no compensation or anything offered . will never return ! would have given no stars if possible .	3695
1	i 've been to only a handful of events here but every time the staff have always been curious , bathrooms are easy to locate , and the space is generally well laid out for each event . special events parking are reasonable ( we paid $ 7 ) and again , the attendants working in the toll booths have always been very pleasant . the new holland pavilions at the alliant energy center is a beautiful new addition with well maintained and clean bathrooms .	3028
1	my family has been here many times . we check in online and barely have to wait in the waiting room . everyone is very nice and the office is always clean .	3193
0	i 've been coming to this store for a month . most unfriendliest , unhelpful , rude cashiers . akira ( japanese looking girl ) definitely needs to go ! ! mcdonald 's is always hiring ! ! customers is why you have a job !	2316
0	they came to my door today . i never knew a baptist church went door to door . i go to church , so he asked me if i knew i was saved . which i do . i have my beliefs from my church . he kept trying to get me to listen to him and look through the bible , but i kept saying that i would rather talk to my own pastor about salvation .	3393
0	it was ok . it was cheesy and i 'm not a huge abba fan but wanted to see what all the hype was about . got discount tickets so i guess i ca n't complain too much .	2752
1	convenient place for tex-mex food . overall experience was fine ... decent food , service was okay and good choice on the menu .	178
0	i booked an appointment over a week ago and less than 24 hours before my appointment i got a call that the dr. would not be in and would i like to schedule something next week . no apology or explanation . i will choose another dr. who respects a patients time . wayne	3598
0	took 35 minutes for 8 wings to go : ( most expensive and worst wings i 've ever had ! service was just as bad . employees like to chitchat while you 're standing there right in front of them waiting to place your order . you do n't even get ranch with your wings that 's extra . the girl taking my order was filling up dressing cups at the same time and acted like i was bothering her ! ! i should 've walked out .	1397
1	great hours ! ( at least in the summer time ) my favorite is their snow cones ! they 're delicious every time ! also their soft serve is great too ! i have n't actually tried the hand dipped , but they have lots of flavors of the hand dipped and snow cones ! fairly priced on the snow cones too ! ! customer service is okay , it 's mostly a bunch of teenagers.. you expect the ritz customer service ? lol i hope they stay open through the fall !	2075
0	cashier george that sold me a console was extremely rude . i wanted too by a second pair but was told in very rude almost unwanted reply . this guy was equally rude over the phone . what the hell is wrong with this guy ? does he not want business ? buyers stay away	2687
1	very professional the way i like it . gave me a new way of looking at my hair type as it has changed . ave a new confident style i can wear . would recommend ! everyone was nice and savvy .	2295
0	how can a fancy place not accept credit cards and charge a fee for using debit ? you ca n't have the nice interior design , the wifi , the food selection and those prices and not offer a convenient form of payment	2971
0	my mistake for getting thriftys ice cream but the scoop was so small tonight it was about 5 bites . i 'm sure when they scoop it for themselves is very different . always looking out for your best interest .	2564
0	if you are going to go here beware . make sure to actually see dr rostan and not one of her rude pushy assistants . stay clear of diane i think that was her name . she was not willing to compromise , took over 30 min to see me , wrote the wrong persricption when this was the reason i made the appointment , and was not going to with me on anything . so disappointing . make sure to see the real doctor when going here .	2430
1	consistent never really a bad drink and generally has all food in stock . not super friendly ... but hey ... just give my my jo and shut up .	2778
0	one of the worst experience at best buy i was in there about 10 minutes ago and was never asked if i needed help not even by the four guys standing by with each other laughing they must have been too busy	3192
0	pricey . i just bought this house and my realtor recommended these people . charged me $ 220 to replace a capacitor that did n't cost more than $ 30 and put in a $ 40 programmable thermostat for $ 195 . i 'll go find a new firm when the service contract is up .	2031
1	bought a used audi from them , they are easy to deal with , and eager to make deals . take your time and do your homework ! !	2333
1	went to md anderson for my prostrate cancer , scared , concerned , thoughts of dying . met my main nurse sally , and a doctor kumar . from that time on through my 39 radiation treatments , i was shown nothing but respect , love , and understanding from entire staff . the treatment nurses deserve the most respect , for the demanding job done daily . all in all , if you have cancer , go there now , do n't think you will be disappointed , they saved me .	2768
1	this cozy little store does n't always have the produce selection of an outdoor market , but what it lacks in produce selection it makes up for in dry goods and convenience . it 's open long hours 7 days a week and carries dairy products , eggs , dry goods , produce and has a small cafe . also the local bread here is amazing and ridiculously cheap for the quality .	2488
0	obviously this place is going to suck , but you do n't exactly move into somewhere like this because you want to . oh and the beezy up front towed my car one night . another huge con is its location . on the bright side , i do n't ever recall seeing any bugs and as a single white girl i never felt scared or unsafe , so i guess there 's that .	2974
0	in a casino ... and not open 24/7 ? ! ? ! drunk humans love pizza ! ! ! why do n't you at least extend the hours ?	282
1	awesome service and got me a cake within an hour ! the white chocolate raspberry is awesome and so is there gluten free chocolate chip !	18
0	we attend several conferences at the sands expo and we always have an issue , mainly with theft . we 've had our computers and equipments stolen on 2 different conference trips within the same year . of course , no one seems to care . security sends you to the conference security and the police department . they all make you file a report but no one checks cameras or investigates the issue . absolutely no concern which is why the thieves get away with it . we will reconsider attending a conference in this convention center in the future .	587
1	new to spanish trails club house the last call is at 9 and the waitress says you do n't have to go home but you ca n't stay here . so to the cart . burgers were great and the yelp deal made it even sweeter . going to love the new digs ! merry christmas !	3869
1	i love you virgin ! 1 . comfy seats 2 . great decor & lighting 3 . excellent service 4 . free cable tv 5 . first checked bag free under 70lbs . what more could you ask for ? ? ? ? ? other american airlines should be embarrassed with their awful frozen sandwiches , miserable staff and early 90 's static-enticing seats .	1623
1	i ordered a dozen cupcakes for my birthday yesterday , and wow , these cupcakes are as delicious as they are beautiful . the owner , tina , does an excellent job at customer service , and goes above and beyond to make sure each individual customer is satisfied . i loved having a variety of cupcakes to choose from for my dozen , and the ladies i shared them with truly appreciated them ! you will be receiving all my future business ! thank you tina , and the entire pixy cakes staff !	1806
1	cool bar/lounge combo in the aria to hang and pre-game . pretty classy place , definitely classier than the haze nightclub they got . you can chill at the comfortable lounge tables or play some blackjack at the tables inside the lounge . this place is dimly lit so it has great ambiance but its hard to see the cards you are dealt . the odds are already against you but then you go to deal with alcohol inhibition and lack of vision and hence i lost a couple bills in 10 minutes . great selection of alcohol , the shelves are endless here . also , very good hostesses .	456
0	this place is not a good meal option . my jaw is sore from eating the leather sandwich . they call it a steak sandwich , but i know leather when i taste it . good thing it came with mushy french fries to give my over worked jaw a rest . why 2 stars ? first , hop drop and roll on draft ! very good . secondly , good music . only option to sit down and eat in terminal a . united , please fly out of another terminal !	1400
0	i 've been to bonfyre two times . the design of the restaurant is gorgeous . my first visit , i brought out-of-town guests expecting a pleasant ambiance and delicious food . both visits , the food tasted like frozen lean cuisine . it was barely edible . both times i ordered a pasta dish . my guests ordered meat and said it was also devoid of appreciable flavor . the redeeming factors were the service and the decor . ultimately , i was disappointed to have taken my out-of-town guests to bonfyre when there are so many great restaurants in the madison area .	951
0	one person working and 7 cars waiting . not only am i handicap waiting 20 minutes but i am going to miss my flight . according to the worker , who is taking his sweet time per car there is only one worker on sunday 's . i called the main number and he said he would bring someone down . when he did he just asked if i was the one who called and then turned around and left . wow . ca n't wait to talk to ada about this .	2134
0	something has changed ... this used to be one of my favorite places and we would eat here weekly . in the past few months , it seems like some of the recipes have changed . the shrimp puffs now have bits of green in them and the consistency of the filling is lumpy rather than smooth and creamy . the panang is still decent , but every other dish that i 've tried to rotate through has been disappointing . we keep trying it in hopes that it will get better again and that we 've had a fluke experience , but it does n't : ( it makes me sad . i want the old tottie 's back ! ! ! : (	779
0	a long wait but they were very nice about it . they do n't use sterilized instruments and the paraffin tub was gross . it was 70 for a pedi and a shellac manicure . my shellac started chipping that same day . the next day two more chipped . hands down the worst shellac manicure i have ever received .	3213
1	i love yelp . we travel quite a bit so it comes in really handy . i sometimes wonder why it picks up some specific businesses .	2220
1	authentic , divey in a good way sports bar that is equal parts bucs , steelers , and of course penguins ! good bar food and relatively cheap beer specials given proximity to pnc park which is across the street . some awesome vintage sports memorabilia too .	2532
1	this is the best location in town . you are right across the street from punch bowl social , big bang and margarita ville . which means when that friend in your group gets out of control you can send him back to his room to sleep it off . it is also walking distance from west 6th street which has more food and bars . if all of that did n't convince you to stay here there is also a shuttle service that will drive you to and from any location within 5 miles .	3337
1	i give this coffee bean 5 stars because it is so consistent ! the girls that work there are always nice and give me the mall discount . my drink is always made right and tastes the same each time . i always order an iced vanilla latte but i think i want to try an iced tea lemonade next time . just to try something different !	2204
1	great doctors and staff . dr. eze is very knowledgeable on pain management . they also have a medical spa and do quarterly presentations . i attended the nov presentation on liposuction and liposculpture . this was a lot of fun and i learned a lot . he is very knowledgeable and skilled in this area as well .	1780
1	best place to buy bed in gilbert . josh helped us find best bed for us at a great price .	679
0	waited in line for over an hour . there were eight people working the counter but only three or four of them were actually helping people . no idea why this is so slow . no excuse for making people wait in line over an hour to rent a car . will never use budget again .	2134
0	this place got such great reviews on yelp so my son and i went to check it out . we both ordered pho because it 's our favorite . the beef and tendon was nice and soft . the broth was very average and the noodles were really sub par . too bad . we wanted so much to find our new 'favorite ' place to eat pho . we are new to scottsdale and will keep looking . not good enough to go back unfortunately . : (	205
0	a group of us decided we want to give them a shot . all signs said they opened at 11:00 am . we arrived a little early at 10:55 so we waited in the car till 11:00 , went and tried the doors , locked . we waited till 11:15 and still locked . even a couple employees were trying to get in and could n't . so we waited till 11:20 and gave up . we went to bw3 right next door , great food , great service , and they open when they said they would .	1094
1	the best cupcakes i 've ever had ! very busy place and best to go early . worth it . my favorite flavor is salted watermelon ! yum ! do n't be fooled by the main st parking . parking and a entrance is also available in the back .	2335
1	this place is super fun ! had a great experience here a few months ago looking for a low-key hangout in downtown phoenix . i was pleasantly surprised with the live latin jazz and the food options were great too ! i recommend if you 're looking for a smaller place free of heavily intoxicated people , this is the place to go .	190
1	tv stations need yelp too and i 'm excited to be the first one to give it ! i watch 3tv for most of my news , especially mornings and weekends . they do a great job of providing useful , entertaining and to the minute news as it 's happening . i know i can always count on 3tv and they do a good job of hiring friendly and entertaining reporters and anchors . they also have news on the most out of every station so i know i can always turn to 3tv . that 's about all i can think to say but if you need a good news source , turns to 3tv !	3585
1	never had a bad experience here ! quick , yummy , and excellent customer service . i have even had the food here and was impressed . will continue to be a patron ! : )	2572
0	i have been there many times and they never say hi and thank you to customers . they have the worst customer service . i wo n't come back !	2965
0	the worst dining experience in my entire life . i 'm not talking about the foods , but the quality of service . the dim sum lady was rude , we asked three times to not serve food that we did n't want and she still ignored us . i spoke to the general manager and she seemed not to care or even at least saying sorry .	0
1	beautiful new office , amazing staff and marlena the assistant is awesome ! dr. blank is wonderful as well !	3767
1	i have n't been to this car wash in quite some time since i have moved from the area . today i needed a wash and they were close and i was happy to get in and out of there . quick , excellent service and very kind people . kendra , the young lady who ran my transaction was very welcoming and seemed happy to be offering good service . thank you guys !	3250
0	we went there around 6:30 pm ... all the tables were empty.. ordered pad thai and chicken fried rice.. the waitress swapped spicy levels , when we told her , she replied that chef has swapped and she had nothing to do with it ... i told her it looks like pad thai but did n't taste anything like that as it was very spicy.. she replied people from our place wo n't like it and started explaining how it tastes ... i was shocked to hear her response.. paid $ 32 bill and come out hungry.. i have been to thai house , basil for the past 7 years and never had such bad experience.. never going back to this place again..	50
0	this company did the flowers for my wedding . the woman we worked with was ok and gave some decent suggestions , but when the big day came , the flowers for one side of the family were all say off color . they were supposed to be a shade of pink but they were more red . now when i look at the photos i just cringe because it does n't match . the flowers of the colors for the grooms side essentially were not the color we ordered .	1132
0	not a huge fan of this place , although the $ .99 margaritas are pretty good . great place to come on a friday afternoon for a liquid lunch . i though their food was bland for mexican and rather uninspired . if you are n't a huge tequila fan , there are better laces out there in phoenix .	1346
0	november 20 , 2014 at 5:17 pm jeff warwick , the manger on duty refused to serve me . i left a shopping cart full of items and left . i 'm complaining to corporate . i will follow up if i get a response .	2520
1	best dive bar in the neighborhood . debbie and taylor are the funnest bartenders you 're going to find in the area . it 's a dive bar , take it for what it is . but the atmosphere makes the place	1688
0	i came all the way from california for my birthday too try this bar out and i got the worst service from the bartender billy . he was clearly ignoring us . we came for the happy hour 5 cent beers and waited for 20 minutes and the bartender never even acknowledged us . super disappointed in this experience . i would n't recommend coming here .	637
0	worst service , worst dessert ! ! ! fake 許留山！！！he server service is bad ! ! ! i wo n't be returning unfortunately ! ! ! so do n't treat your customer with this kinds of food and service ! ! !	1062
1	minute clinic logging in from internet and showing with no wait time up to a nurse practitioner who actually knew medicine . excellent ! we used to air-evac people into hospitals , so i have a limited bit of knowledge in these matters . the np had worked in a hospital for quite some time and had a good working knowledge . did not over prescribe . just right . both my wife and i have been to this clinic . two thumbs way up	70
0	just so you know . they will tell you it will be a 15 - 30 minute wait at the drive thru ! swear , i just left at 2:30am , 3 cars in front of me & told to wait up to 30 minutes ! insane	221
0	i am a high level healthcare executive and went to this group for my personal care . they are all about the $ $ $ and not about care . they have denied requests for refills of over the counter drugs like ibuprofen and acid reflux medications saying i need an appointment . ( prescription drugs are actually cheaper under my insurance than the over the counters ! ) i am relatively heathy and have been seen in the past 6 months ! find another practice who actually cares about you and not co-pays !	938
1	great addition to south charlotte options ! the avocado and lime grain bowl was fantastic ! good size portion and nice and tangy ! the kids menu is great , we had two clean plates for once ! the assortments of lemonades are a nice touch as well . we will definitely be back !	1269
0	i used to love virgin america , but no more . very unreliable and unfriendly service . no notice of delay whatsoever . plus their staff at las is constantly asking people around to upgrade their seat when the flight is delayed . not happy at all .	1623
0	sooo anoyed . heard an advertisement for holiday special . i stopped @ the bank to get cash so my husband would n't know i got him a massage for christmas . ! st the soecial was not what was advertised on the radio , then they would n't accept a $ 100.00 bill . i had my newborn with me so i was not going to run around trying to cash my bill . went to a spa closer to my house instead .	3862
1	an outstanding classy place . i would say this is the best marriott i have ever been to . we went there as a basketball tournament , and got a group rate . peggy rates as one of the top salespeople i have ever worked with . professional staff , clean rooms , good location , easy access to airport , the breakfast buffet rocks . would stay there again anyday .	230
1	this store has mostly everything for the sports fan . i admit that their prices tend to be more expensive than other places , but they definitely have a better selection . one thing i appreciate is the return policy - they do n't hassle you when you need to take something back . my son could spend hours here , and we find ourselves going here more and more often for all sports related gear .	3911
0	i 'm trying a new laser technician this time because the usual girl dawn is just awfully annoying . she tells me about all the money i would save if i signed up for a membership , but i did the math and in my situation i would n't save any money . i always leave feeling bad about myself . hopefully the other girl is better .	343
0	whatever these assholes quote you ... double it . congrats , you got my money . but you'll never see another penny . p.s . the home button was installed incorrectly . way to go .	3817
0	stuffed pizza is great stockyard is my favorite but the regular pizza the dough is so flat and tasteless i might as well eat cardboard with cheese on it	192
1	i have been a real estate agent for 10 years and have had the pleasure in working with diana gomez-mcgurk and homeowners financial group in several loan transactions . diana always answers her phone , replies back to my emails , and provides great customer service to all my clients . i have been referring business to her for many years and will continue to work with her in servicing buyer 's and making their home buying process experience as easy as possible .	2518
0	i was a first time client and went on a sunday afternoon for a basic manicure and polish . i went strictly because it was convenient and i was in the area at the time . the staff was relatively nice - however i was not impressed with the quality of the manicure . some of my nails were filed crooked and 2 of my nails had polish that were smudged ( not of my own doing ) . i probably wo n't be going back here again - and if i did i would not use the same manicurist .	3369
1	i have to say , the girl who helped me toady was amazing and i wish i knew your name , i tested the bean ( vegan ) soup and it was amazing ! i felt the service was quick for our lunch time rush an she took the time to help me make an awesome decision ! i may have been missing some onions on the salad but thanks ! it still was very good !	1259
1	beautiful hotel . only a mile from the airport . free shuttles are available through the hotel both to and from the airport . the building was clean , inviting and well maintained . i would recommend and stay here again !	2872
1	jeff and his assistant manager ( cant remember her name ) were seriously f-ing awesome . the customer service is a+ in my book ! ! the next time i am in need to rent a vehicle ... .i am coming to this enterprise ! !	2373
1	i had dr padley and could not be happier . a real down to earth guy . spent plenty of time with me explaining what my shoulder problem entailed . i ended up needing rotator cuff repair . every appointment i went to was on time . seems like you never wait long here . great bedside manner . just comes off as a real caring dr. not much more to say other than my shoulder feels great 3-1/2 months post-surgery . just went on a golf trip and played great !	2755
0	literally the worst e.r you 'll ever find yourself at . you 're already having a horrible day ... and this place will make it a million times worse . they not only take 35+ minutes to take back critically ill people , and wo n't let you in until you finish their insurance paperwork no mater if someone is dying , but they then do n't even let one family member go back until after the doctor visits ... you 'll wait another hour+ for that ... .. literally the worst hospital and biggest death trap you 'll ever find yourself at . avoid even in dire emergency ... . you can drive 30 mins further and you 'll still be seen faster ... .	1010
1	la fitness member from out of town . came in for a tour ( and to check on the kiddie club ) and the staff was so incredibly positive and kind ! excited to return .	2066
0	i would like to say the receptionist megan was nice- second the set up was all right , thsy definitely need to update their free weight it reminds me of old school . the trainers seem to be out of shape to be personal trainers . the bathrooms soom to be not clean garbage overflowing , lot of old creepy dudes staring with mustaches and only have one weight scale . no towels provided didnt see sanitizer spray for the machines .	3446
1	very happy with staying here , the lazy river is an added bonus though between running around the strip and seeing free shows , we did n't really have much time enjoy it thoroughly ... the lvb location is set further out from the strip to give you more of a resort type of experience . there are plenty of entertainment onsite , pool , jacuzi , lazy river , pool table , air hockey $ 1 , dvd rentals ( $ 3 ) , foosball and several arcade games for kids ...	1057
1	my go-to-place for everything related to the home . the prices are not cheap - but they have everything you may need and more ! the employees are helpful , even if you speak english ( which ca n't be said about all shops in the plateau ! ) .	1577
0	just a follow-up . had 6 people for 50th birthday celebration . i paid for two people on amex ... got ta love amex they fought for me and i got a refund for that . but , four people i paid on visa debit and unless i go back to vegas and file a small claims suit i will never get a dime back ! so no refund from this bullshit company ! i will keep posting about our horrible experience until they shut down . if you read these reviews and still give them a try then shame on you . no drinks , no admission , no vip . no refunds !	2122
0	i 'm not picky or ever put up reviews but the fish i bought was so gross and old . do n't even bother going there .	1595
1	no better band program with almost 90 % of it all financially funded by the people !	3006
1	stayed here last weekend thanks to a great travel zoo deal . we had an excellent experience for the bachelor party celebration . the princess suite was very large , the customer service all around was outstanding , the room service prices were cheap and delicious , the pool staff was awesome ( they even poured our glass beer bottles into plastic cups for us ) , the main strip was super close and the other guests were friendlyas well . i 'd highly recommend checking it out next time you are vegas ! great value !	2973
0	my vet sent a prescription here for my cat . i was told it would be 3 days for delivery . it is now a week and we do n't have the prescription . this place has horrible customer service . the `` supervisor '' is no help at all . apparently the real manager who is also the owner is out of town and they will have to look into the matter . meanwhile i have a sick pet with no meds and they could care less . avoid this hack pharmacy at all costs ! ! the imaginary owner obviously does n't care and leaves her business to be run by a bunch of incompetent workers .	2827
0	we just checked in and this is the state of the room , ugh ! it literally gives me the creeps . i will not sit on that stained couch with holes in it . i am looking at a all nighter without sleep afraid if bedbugs . i have never been in such a gross room . nick at the front desk put us in a nice room , we think ! prayers for a good sleep ! in the new room the tv in the sitting room does n't work and my husband just killed this bug on the bed ! ! ! gross ! do not stay here !	3802
0	once again , walked in to calgary cycle to make a purchase and ask a few questions . great looking , beautiful store but many items are behind glass , or require a sales person to access . unfortunately , in 10 minutes of being in there , i was not acknowledged once , except for someone wheeling a bike past me , and so i walked out again . waste of my time ... i 've purchased a mountain bike through them before , but if their staff can not be bothered to greet customers or ask if they can help out , this will be my last visit .	227
1	the take care clinic is a life saver ! ! last weekend i was visiting my family for mother 's day weekend . i stayed 2 nights at a hotel and was attacked by bed bugs . fortunately , i did n't bring them back to arizona . seven days after the initial contact the bites have swelled and become painful . dr. lani said my bites became infected due to a bacteria one of the bugs was carrying . gross ! ! ! ! ! ! i showed up without an appointment and without insurance . an hour later i was seen by the doctor and given 2 prescriptions all for under $ 150 . thank you walgreens take care clinic .	1641
1	two lunch items : a goat curry and a jerk chicken . the former was fairly straightforward , the latter had a distinctive flavor different than other jerk recipes ; it 's not too hot for those unacquainted with caribbean food to try . i 'd definitely order it again . i 'd recommend it more for dinner than lunch . the husband and wife combo who run the place are very nice .	54
0	the sign says lash lounge . it is crystal lash lounge . i asked if i could have a discount they said only if you rate us online i did n't think that was fair so i just paid full price i went in and got a full set of lashes she put some strong glue on it said it would mildly affect my eyes i was pulling the lashes off all night long they were burning so bad i asked for my money back they said no i disputed it they ended up winning never again ! ! ! learn how to communicate in english ! ! i told a lot of people to stay away .	2685
1	i love this place ! ! they treat my baby buddy like he is their own puppy . i took my male dog here since i got him november 2012 for all his shots , etc . then i took him daily for approximately 3 months before i moved into my house . i trust them completely ! ! thank you sienna ! ! ! i feel bad for those who had problems . i love them and highly recommend sienna ! ! ! ! !	1700
1	found these guys on yelp . was quoted a price and since it was my 1st time here ( no trust yet ) i called the dealer to compare and they were in fact offering a very fair price and good service . highly recommend this place	1604
1	i love the patio on 8th ave , great for people watching . oj 's has pretty good drink specials , especially the $ 6 2oz mojito on monday . the food is n't amazing.. my fries were luke warm and the burger was a bit dry ( but big ! ) but the atmosphere here is really nice . my friends meals seemed really good , especially the fish and chips .	427
0	no call , no show twice ! ! ! i 've scheduled a time for an estimate two different times and they have n't shown up or called either time . i 'm done wasting time with this company .	827
1	great products ! ! i 'm using the eye collection for 3 weeks and the results are amazing ! !	35
0	actually like the one in mayfield on wilson mills much better . the night i went , parking was limited . their were kids running all over the place with no supervision . it was after 9:30p too . that 's not necessarily their issue but , they should say something to the parents for the other guests comfort . our server kept forgetting to refill drinks . she told us to not tip her well . really ? the kids running around was so distracting that i ca n't even tell you if i enjoyed the food . i believe i got a better portion and burger at mayfield too . not sure if i 'll try again .	496
1	the shop was super clean . they clearly know what they are doing and have a strong knowledge base . the gentlemen that did my piercing did a much better job than i had previously in the same hole . it matches the other ear perfectly . he was explanatory , friendly , and quick . great facility !	2895
1	this place is huge and cheaper then the places ive been to . really cheap glass pipes tooo !	1025
0	consumer beware . if you do not give them a `` perfect '' on their service survey -- -- you will be blackballed .	3065
0	this place never answers their phones or messages . it 'd be nice to use my groupon before it expires but no one ever responds to make my appointment . terrible customer service in my opinion to not answer after a minimum of 12 attempts to make an appointment .	2647
0	umm straight out they are a huge scam . every time i would bring by vehicle in for a simple tire rotation , they would seem to always find an issue with my car . ever since i stopped going to them , have n't had a problem since .	76
1	amazing food guys , it 's a must go ! we had chicken fried rice , red curry & eggplant tofu . everything tasted so good . we are already planning to go back !	1361
0	deli service is always lazy ! dirty ! management needs to step in and make some changes ! ! !	2316
0	honestly , waited in line 20 minutes . had nail in tire . asked for them to rotate and balance as well . they said an hour and a half to 1 hour 45 min . over 2 hours later i returned ( went next door to culvers for free wifi to get work done ) . not done . said it would be done in 10-15 min . overall , over 2 hours to fix a nail in my tire and no time to rotate and balance .	3158
0	fruit tea was great ! it was a little too sweet for me so next time i would like to get half sweet . the sweetness was n't like sugar but instead it tasted like honey so i feel that it 's a healthier choice for teas ! ! ! the mango bingsuu did not look right . i felt like i have almond slices instead of mango bing su . i like how they use fresh mangos instead of frozen mangos . i do n't like how the server kept eyeing at our table and trying to rush us out the door when we have n't even finished our drinks ! !	1182
0	this place sucks , it sucks so bad . i have nothing else to say . negative 5 stars if i could . it 's almost impossible to find good shawarma anywhere north or steeles .	678
1	the absolute best bao in toronto . awesome old school hip-hop soundtrack . stiff drinks . my only quibble : the kitchen does n't understand timing ; orders rarely come out together . but the food is too good to be polite -- eat and order some more ; hopefully by that time your guests will have theirs too .	688
1	very good music and the appetizers were delicious ! the waitress was wonderful as well . overall the experience was great and we will definitely come back !	190
1	brad smith will go above and beyond to provide excellent customer service and do everything possible to make your car buying experience the best possible . he is extremely friendly and knowledgable and is someone that you will want to work with .	3688
1	just picked up a box of coffee this morning , called it in last night , everything went great . someone needs to add store info ... not me	1216
1	i had to swap a class from chandler gilbert and replace it with a mcc class and everyone i encountered was super friendly and helpful ! ! ! the people helping me made me feel important and like they really valued me as a student ! they made everything super quick and easy ! ! the guy helping me helped me bypass all the lines and i was in and out of there in about an hour ! i have no complaints ! ! !	2787
1	this was such an amazing massage i 'll definitely be back ! i had a 90 minute massage with firm pressure with dominic and it felt like heaven ! i could n't recommend this place more , worth every penny and will be returning for another massage this month ! 5 out of 5 stars for this gem !	2455
0	wow . i just called to speak to someone about my car . not only would he not let me finish talking , he spoke loudly at me and then told me that i needed to let him talk and started putting words into my mouth . all i wanted to know was if i could take my car in for them to check it out . i will not ever go to this business after this phone call . if that is how you speak to someone and treat them when they are seeking help from your business , i want no part of it .	3632
1	my 18 month old daughter had her first dental visit today with dr kim . she was able to do a thorough exam , floss her teeth , and applied fluoride . she also offered me tips on how to take better care of her teeth at home . the visit was very pleasant and we are looking forward to going back in 6 months .	1304
0	if i could give a zero , i would . i have been dealing with this worthless dealership for over 5 months trying ( unsuccessfully ) to get a refund from my cancelled extended warranty . i filled out the cancellation form in september of 2015 and was assured i would receive the refund in 2 months time . it is the end of february and somehow , nobody knows the status or whereabouts of my cancellation form/refund . i have called at least 3 times per month since december with empty promises of returned calls . i guess the next step is to go to the dealership and not leave until my issue is resolved .	1424
1	thanks brandon for getting the chairs in the outside sitting area replaced . it 's the small details that make a difference . still the best carwash in summerlin , esp on tuesdays when the full service wash is upgraded to the next level at no extra charge .	2198
1	i come to this starbucks only when i come to the costco . for the most part i like this store . it 's clean , staff are friendly , and plenty of seating . the one thing i have noticed is the couple of gentlemen that do work here always get my order correct and i 'm not having to repeat my order 3 or 4 times . the girls on the other had always seem a little scatter brained , i 'm always having to repeat myself . my iced coffee is always made correct and made in a timely manner . overall this store rocks !	2417
0	the staff is friendly but the doctors are ridiculously cautious . they refused to treat my daughter who fell playing tag on the playground and needed a few stitches for a laceration on the side of her head . we then had to take her to the er to get this simple problem taken care of , thus incurring two medical bills . if you need meds for a cough or cold , this is your place . if you need actual medical care , avoid this place and find a doctor who is willing to actually practice medicine . parents - this is not the place to take your kids .	2870
1	my car looked great . customer service is usually great . heard a comment about my dirty car ( had just returned from a 4,200 mile roadtrip . i mentioned the comment to the manager and she was very apologetic . i will use them again .	2198
1	must visit here ! i love tje atmosphere and the massage is very good . i truly loved the ezperience here !	735
1	wow this place really changed the game for what to expect from a nail salon . such a relaxing and spa like atmosphere ! mellow classical/spa music playing , nature slideshow on the tv screens and very professional staff . they offered my something to drink , water , juice , wine or a margarita even ! supper comfy pedicure chairs that actually gave a good chair massage . fruit in the water i soaked my feet in . but the best part was the quality pedicure i received . she really took her time and did a great job , not just a quick 20 minute pedicure here . this is definitely my new go to place .	265
0	my mom , myself , and some friends went here for lunch . what a mistake . the waitress did not seem to really care that it took us an hour to get our food . i get it is friday and lunch but tables seated after us were surely given their meals way before us . my mom called and spoke with gentleman who said he would take a message and have the owner call us . we never heard from them . we will for sure not be back . lousy customer service , and the waitress brought are meals out to us one by one , and in 10 minute intervals , hard to have everyone eat at the same time .	1510
0	not professional , too much papers in this digital world . very old school . the interviewer did not seem to understand the tax form at all . i never get chance to meet with steven and interviewer does not have good knowledge about taxes . i asked for how much tax filling will cost me and interviewer told me that go to his website and figure out yourself .	3144
0	bad customer service at this location . there were nearly 10 employees , 3 customers and the 2 girls at the register were talking and not making eye contact or helping me . i stood there for 2 minutes and they did n't acknowledge me . disappointing , guess i 'll go to chipotle next time .	1365
0	the food is decent but their customer service leaves something to be desired . as one of the last customers of the night , we were annoyed when the cashier began vacuuming the floor near us during our dinner . after asking her to stop until we were finished , she told us that they have to clean a half hour before they close . then she continued vacuuming and even went on to sweep right next to our table . as a former server , i know that is no way to treat customers at a restaurant .	875
1	i feel like james franco in 11/22/63 when i walk through the doors to this joint . if you like cigars and old antique shit , you will pop a boner when you walk through the doors . smoke cigars , drink fine whisky ( or beer , or wine ) and take a load off in this kick ass establishment . i do n't know about the food they serve , did n't eat any . if they served dog turds covered in cheese whiz i would still fuck with this place heavy .	1683
0	i 've been in twice and i can say the service is very poor . the first time i was looking for a amp and speakers for my karaoke machine . the sales guy answer couple question and left . i wanted some advice but did n't get a chance . second time the two salesman was too busy chatting . i felt like they did n't want to help me out . the price is expensive from other places . never again give kmmmku	2682
1	contacted them to take my parents to the airpprt in september and they were on time , had the best rate , very clean van and very nice driver . so easy and using them again when they come back in town !	1814
0	went for the van gogh experience -- one screen was n't working and those entering the area were n't told -- not good ! i enjoyed viewing/listening ; it was interesting and a different experience , but come on , museum , do n't be charging extra for this exhibit when it is n't 100 % working ! appears this is a museum for kids -- most adults i know would n't be interested very much in the permanent exhibits .	3891
1	the people r nice and the dr is nice to is not a long wait and i came in with pain and the dr and the girls help me to get in to fix the pain	3618
0	market . where ? circles . what ? grill . pasta ? no calamari . no zucchini . no cheese on chicken parmesan . the mussels on the house are excellent . not sure why they serve you a different gravy with chicken . ravioli was not fresh . disappointed . sauce was good . will we come back ? sadly no . too pricey for meh .	161
1	had an issue initially , but they worked with me to get to a resolution that i thought was fair .	3171
0	pros : - affordable prices . - staff were friendly and accommodating . - food was filling . - bathrooms were clean , which is a rarity ... especially since they were basement bathrooms at an asian restaurant ! cons : - the food was average . nothing super special . - we ended up getting stomach aches after eating our meals . - complementary side dishes were mediocre .	396
0	i came here during my break between classes and their lunch `` box '' or bento was mediocre . the tofu in the miso soup tasted like plastic and the salmon teriyaki i ordered came smothered in teriyaki sauce and burnt on the bottom ! probably wo n't be coming here again .	408
0	this place is way over priced and the hair stylists take when to long to hair peoples hair i love jess and lexi with a burning passion but i no longer can do this anymore i would wait because the price was right now there is no point time to find a new place	2522
1	**cake purchase only** wow ! total blast from the past ! carvel is still alive and kicking ! this was the place for ice cream in new york back in the 70 's and 80 's . remember fudgie the whale and cookie puss ? yes those really cool , retro ice cream cakes ; they still make them . little shop right next to harris teeter with fast service . cones , sundaes and all the usual suspects . the cakes are very similar to dq with cake/cookie crumbles layered in . good stuff ! ! ca n't speak to the bad service reviews as we just picked up a cake .	1201
1	i think anyone giving this place hell is either working at another head shop or knows someone working at another head shop . sounds like sabotage to me ! no one has ever been rude to me and ummm the parking situation ? there 's parking in the back and a few places in front . the only thing i do n't like is that the floor is n't very sturdy and when you walk on it and everything shakes .	3403
1	i had a great experience in this store . felicia helped pick out the perfect color and curl pattern of hair to achieve the style in was looking for . she was extremely personable and patient . great customer service !	3676
1	great food and service . the owner is very kind . wish they were in south charlotte : ) . imo , they have the best pho	947
1	had to get a check engine light looked at and this place was able to accommodate my busy schedule . shawn was an excellent person to deal with . he helped make everything clear and earned my trust with his professional demeanor . anyways , he said the component that was causing the check engine light would take 3 days to acquire and fix and he lived up to it . within 3 days i got my car back with that pesky light gone and a fresh oil change which i also requested . will be going back there to get an oil change again this friday since my 3000 miles are up .	3196
0	after recently moving across the street , ancora has a new menu and they ditched their levelup rewards . i 'm pretty bummed out that their breakfast sandwiches are all quite a bit more expensive than at their old location . i get that they are no longer confined to using a microwave , but geez ! $ 8 or $ 9 for an english muffin egg sandwich with no sides is really steep . between the de facto 10 % price increase by ditching levelup , and the 50 % + increase on their food , i 'm out . what was a daily stop is now unaffordable more than once a month .	1070
1	this is my favorite theater to see movies at . i love coming to the jb-x theater - it has a wonderful sound system that does n't cost any extra . they also have som really good deals . on mondays , tickets are only $ 5 ( except sony pictures ) , tuesday 's are 2 for $ 22 - 2 tickets , 2 drinks , and a popcorn for $ 22 . thursday 's are $ 8 for a ticket , drink , and popcorn ( though you must show your palms card to get this deal ) . love this place !	491
1	had a shellac french tip manicure done . love it ! ann , had me in and out of there quickly and made sure i liked the thinness of the tip lines .	3452
0	i called to simply get a price quote and schedule of classes for cpr bls training . yikes ! the woman was incredibly rude and short with me . thankfully i found a much better place to get my cpr certification that ended up being much cheaper ( a student discount ) and the staff there was actually kind and helpful .	2315
0	horrible service no idea how they make any money after waiting 15 minutes for a haircut the barber that was available sat back down and got on his phone i 'll never go back and if u want haircut that 's not the place for it .	3469
0	the first time i had one of thier gigantic pizza 's i was in heaven . it was so so so good . since then i have ordered pizza from them twice and it just has n't been that good . the last time the sauce on the cheese pizza was spicy and my kids would n't eat it . i will not order from them again .	417
0	do not use this doctor . she gave my son the wrong diagnosis and medicine that made him very sick . it made his situation worst and it went on for months . this doctor and her staff never seemed to care . my son refused to go back to her so i found a very competent doctor who cleared up his situation in three days .	2526
1	i recently purchased a dining room set from this location . i am so happy with my beautiful new furniture and the purchase was handled efficiently , everyone was courteous and i would highly recommend this furniture store to anyone .	439
0	dont go here for phone repair the guys working here have little knowledge about phones . they are very unclear about what 's causing damage on my iphone and kept changing words and costs . they are very unprofessional and i would not recommend this place to anyone .	2930
1	coffee and wine ( & beer too ! ) served from the same counter ? yes , please ! note : this 5* rating is purely based on the addition of alcohol from the regular ol ' coffee bar that the other whole foods have , a seemingly larger salad bar area , a nicer , larger seating area to enjoy your food/coffee/wine/beer , and just more selection of product as compared to my home store at square one . why does square one not have this alcoholic beverage option ? i think it would do fairly well there ! i feel a 'suggestion ' email coming on ...	3271
1	my best friend referred me to chris and they have serviced both my cars and did an excellent job- they are on time and fully complete with your service . they can do oil changes , new tires , detailing etc . i appreciate them and recommend them to all my friends .	3125
1	an old gem that we crossed into . it 's in an old shopping complex . got there right when they right as they opened . we ordered beef eggplant , ginger chicken , ramen noodles , and thai iced tea . everything was great with large portions . food was flavorful and came up pretty quick . service was good and price is where it should b. thai iced tea was refreshing . before we left we order a mango smoothie and that was the bomb . they used real mango ! hopefully we get to come here very soon .	1103
0	food was good but service was horrible . the hostess was nice and seated us quickly . the waiter seemed lost and confused . i do n't know if wait staff was under staff or what . they were horrible . got our food order wrong . do not go here unless it 's a slow time or better yet not at all . i would never return . our servers name was charlie .	560
0	damaged the bumper on my car , did n't tell me about the damage and wo n't return my calls to get reimbursed or repair damage . do not use !	1098
1	delicious . all the ingredients are flavorful , fresh , and very tasty . i ca n't believe some people choose qdoba over this place . i could n't stomach it after trying chipotle . 5/5 all the way .	1328
1	i highly recommend using this company for all your stone needs . they are extremely friendly and accommodating . i was in need of counter tops before the big game and national stone came through big time for me . thank you for the amazing experience .	2090
1	sat on the first floor . cozy and intimate . the food was absolutely amazing . delicious wings & cold slaw and fried chicken . we were n't too hungry so three of us split these two dishes and it was perfect . lots of fun and delicious drink options . the beers were delicious too ! did n't stay too late because we had other plans , but apparently upstairs becomes a fun dance club at night . would definitely recommend to young people looking for a new fun place to try . you 'll probably end up coming back : )	1583
0	pretty terrible , the waitress was rude and the salmon was over seasoned . i would not recommend this to anyone . i have not eaten a meal this bad as far as i can remember . unless you love the taste of salt then avoid . thanks for the hype and the expense .	429
0	dumb little kid has no respect for customers . really need to fix service to get more customers .	797
1	efficient staff , cheap prices and good quality work . place is a little spot in south common mall . it 's not a high end place but it gets the job done . i 'll be back . got gel polish change and toe polish change for $ 25 .	3592
1	sat at the bar service was decent , nice bartender . fried pickles were ok..bit too greasy after the top few . cajun chicken pasta was good , spicy which i liked but did n't seem hot from the kitchen . fajitas were average , hot out but had to ask for lettuce . place seemed loud and no music to drowned the sound . will i come back ... only if last resort . it is convenient to area and highway .	178
1	really awesome salon ! so polite , great service ! even let me come in at 5:14 on a sunday when they close at 5 and we 're already packed full ! i will be back !	1388
1	i love this salon . i had my pedicure last week with lee . she is gentle and very thorough . she was very patient - i felt like i was her only customer the whole day - not rushed and enjoyed her conversation . i am going to request her from now on . thank you !	3682
0	terrible customer service . we mentioned to the waitress is our first time to dine . the food has no flavor as your typical thai dish and spice . during the course the waitress never checked on us . there was only one customer besides us to say the least that she was busy . horrible food and customer service . !	1366
1	this place can be a little rough sometimes but i 've always met nice people willing to share a drink with you . tacos are cheap and beer is decently priced .	704
0	i 've been going to flare cleaners since i moved here 11 years ago and when complete cleaners took over my shirts have been dingy around the collar . i was told that they do not pre-treat collars anymore , the prices has also gone up . i wo n't be using complete cleaners anymore.it 's a waste of my time and money .	2947
0	if you are in a hurry do not come here . doctor appointment scheduling is never precise . it 's more of a wish . bring a book ( you may be able to finish a novel while you wait ) . one bathroom available in waiting area . health professionals scream out your name . you would think they would have a better way to announce who is next to be seen . overall a typical sterile and impersonal medical facility that is something to endure .	2735
0	i do n't want to give them any stars ... .tried to take back a printer that stopped working after 25 days . they would n't take it back because it was past their 15 day return policy . i would expect a printer to last more than 15 days so we will never shop at any best buy ever again .	3192
0	just got an oil change at pep boys , and the mechanic notified me that i need to replace the driver 's side cv boot asap ( and eventually the passenger side one as well ) . that said , i have strong cause to believe the cv boot was never replaced at tony 's ( even so i was charged for the part and labor ; see previous review ) . i always had a suspicion that he never made any repairs at all and just charged me $ 500+ for nothing .	3924
0	eh , i did n't like this place much either , especially when i had been craving mexican . the sopes were ok , the salsa was pretty good as well , but the tacos coapa were flavorless . we did n't stay for dessert due to the crappy seating , the bad lighting , and the inept , slow service . not recommended .	1330
1	we started going to kobe for over a year . she cuts my husband and two boys hair . she is the best at the location by far .	3025
0	worst experience ever ... i will not be going back to this place ... your nails end up looking the same as if u were to do them yourself or even have a 3 yr old do them . money wasted and not worth it ! ! ! ppl there are rude not welcoming at all !	2929
0	worst experience please do n't go this shitty place long wait for order delivery .for fucking sandwich they took 1 hour , the bartender is very careless and replied to me `` i am not making it `` . damn worst service in my entire life . manager is also worst and racial .	705
0	i have been going to hannahs for about 6 months . i am a guy and have had 5 hip surgeries in the past few years and have a hard time reaching my feet . the last time i went in the owner refused to give me a pedicure , saying i needed to go to the doctor and that my skin was to dry . i was n't going to write anything but i have n't had a bad customer service experience like that in a while . good luck . no men	2886
1	nice mall . it 's what feels like about an hour and a half trip from the ne side of akron , where we are , so we rarely get out to that side of town . but at least you do n't need an automatic weapon or a platoon of bodyguards to walk the place after 3 pm on a saturday . and you ca n't argue they 're not miles ahead of chapel hill these days . as others have said , let 's hope the slimy underbelly does n't devour this place like the other mall casualties of 21st century akron ohio .	2511
1	after years of services at jiffy lube & after having a bad experience at right toyota , i brought my 2013 4runner in for routine service at avondale toyota . i have now been back 3-4 times and could not be happier with the service . tyler young has handled my service each time . i have been so happy with how quickly , cost effective and smooth my car is taken care of . the customer service is great and does n't have the dealership feel at all . i am grateful for and highly recommend avondale toyota and tyler young ! ! !	307
0	went here last night to get some sweets . peanut butter cookie was stale and bland . it seemed to be overloaded with sugar and was extremely dry . i also got a dark chocolate caramel and milk chocolate caramel ( 3 each ) . these chocolate caramels were stale . period . all for the price of 18.95 . honestly , when i took a bite of that cookie i almost matched back in with that garbage to return it . coming from la , where there is a huge food scene , this place seemed like a tourist trap with low quality food . foodies avoid . only go for the free chocolate tasting for the experience .	3722
1	i chose this restaurant for lunch today and i 'm really glad i did . i got seated quickly and ordered the build-your-own sampler with jalapeno bottle caps , mozzarella cheese sticks and a cheese quesadilla with sour cream , marinara and pico de gallo sauces . the food arrived at the table quickly and everything was tasty , hot and fresh . kathy was a superstar waitress ... she knew when i wanted something and she knew when to leave me alone . ; ) i 'll certainly return here for the yummy food , the great prices and the friendly , cozy atmosphere .	1262
0	i 'm writing his post because you do n't want my wife to . very very very slow service . people were getting served their food that were seated 30 minutes after us .	1558
1	love the local 30 % m-th . the bathrooms could use a little extra tlc but the services and sauna were great . will definitely go again !	2651
1	wow really good and fun ! we picked the topping and sauce and within minutes we had an amazing pizza . i want to go again the possibilities are endless .	282
0	tough sell here in arizona . when i heard about the death metal comment . i 'm good ... . blaming others etc . godbless and good luck	3393
0	the worst experience i have ever had at a nail salon . the short guy that works there is very rude and ruff . he filled my nails and painted the gel on all over my cuticles , my 10 year old could of done a better job . and when i told him to fix it he was kind of mad at me like it 's my fault he ca n't paint . basically i just made him stop and literally walked out . so do n't waist your money . i should of reviewed the comments before walking in there .	2922
1	date night . we ate @ picea977 last night . everything was fresh and well-made . the service was very good , helpful and friendly . the salads were delicious . i had the beet salad and he had the arugula . and yes , the pizza did take a while , but we preferred the atmosphere to libretto or terroni 's where i feel like people are looking over my shoulder to see if i 'm almost finished ready to take in more customers .	257
0	one step above a hole in the wall buffet place . food was edible . very bland , service was very un-attentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot . i 'll take my money elsewhere .	1264
0	i was greeted by a fleeting `` she 'll help you in a sec '' , followed by a silent head nod , which i guess was my prompt to order . i wanted something with meat , but the smell in here drove me away from that . my brc was good , typical pepe 's quality , which i love , but the weekend morning crew need to step it up a little bit	857
0	just left the tropicana movie theater there was roaches everywhere in that snack bar area in the ginger punk in the front is just a full-blooded idiot	611
1	after a miserable experience with yes a.c a few years ago i was pleasantly surprised by the professional , and rapid service performed by dr . cool without any upselling attempts . our ac went out and i expected the worse . i filed a claim with ahs and immediately was referred to dr . cool . i called and bruno arrived with 40 minutes . he expertly diagnosed the problem [ a bad condenser fan ] , replaced it , checked the system and was done in around one hour . i will use these guys from now on for all maintenance and service work on our ac and furnace . i trust these folks and recommend them .	2776
1	this is a great place to enjoy `` taco tuesday '' . they have cheap amazing tacos and their house margaritas are delicious . i normally would have something negative to say about a business , although that is not the case here . you can definitely expect me here more frequently .	1346
1	been here twice in the past two days - and ordered the thai chicken salad each time ! it 's just that good , and the portions are huge . great view of the pool and shaded , with fans to protect from the heat .	1299
1	excellente place que vous passiez juste prendre un bon thé ou café ou que vous vouliez vous asseoir et manger un brownie décadent ou un grill cheese aux oignons caramélisés . le personnel est sympathique , pas stressé et ne met pas de pression pour consommer . les enfants sont les très bienvenus et ont de quoi s occuper ! !	184
0	never fun to negatively review a place that has so much potential . the view , amazing , the service and food ... less then desirable . the wait for your food is very long and when it finally arrives it is sub par . it 's a bit like the twilight zone at times , no apologies and almost like its normal for a sale to take 45 minutes . time for new management , chef and menu .	751
0	used them a lot and generally , i never have a problem . but one caveat -- if you book online , you are required to prepay your parking . if you ever have to reschedule your parking dates , or cancel them , you can almost never get a refund , despite them saying that they will refund you . even after you contact them and they tell you in writing via email that they will credit the refund to your credit card , they do n't !	2531
1	flew allegiant airlines from eugene , or to lax . people who checked us in were friendly and helpful . flight attendances were friendly also . it was a pleasant experience and felt no different than any other airline . plane was a little cramped , but what do you expect for $ 49 ? i will definitely fly with them again .	3127
0	under construction ! ! ! the hotel and downtown scottsdale ! was awoken @ 3 am to the sound of heavy equipment and @ 4 am the jackhammering began . it maybe okay again in the future but i would avoid staying here for the next several months .	3843
0	do n't go there at night you might get robbed walking out . bartender called the cops and me out to be the bad guy ... will not be back	1295
0	went in a couple months back to try to sell some gold and diamond jewelry..no luck . the place looks like you 're walking into an 80 's pawn shop..very outdated . the young pretentious guy was long winded and tried to rob me , saying my diamonds were n't worth much , because of the cut . i will stick to ebay to get more money for my jewelry . they have an ebay store too , which is how i first tried them out , later realizing i totally overpaid for a tiny diamond pendant . never again .	3804
1	loved going to the senior day not only for the discounts for the regal movies but also same day is 50+ and you get a lot of perks like getting a chance of winning the slot game they have for free , do not have to put a dime or dollar into any slot machine , just go to the area where they are playing the game for senior 50+ ! they changed some of the eateries , the cafe is still nice and the buffet is ok .	3947
1	very friendly staff , easy to talk to , made me feel comfortable . i look forward to my journey with family doctors of green valley	297
1	amazing customer service . i actually wanted to leave 4 stars , because i have rented twice and had a considerable wait time ( just because it 's been so busy ) , but i have been treated so well that it totally overshadows any wait time . there are so many locations to choose from , but knowing how well they take care of you ( and how friendly they are ) , it really makes a difference !	1863
1	amazing seekh kababs ! probably the best in calgary ( hint : do n't get the spicy seekh kabab unless you have an infinite amount of time for a session at the nearest washroom if you know what i mean )	1303
0	we used to come here every weekend for football games , but have noticed that it has been extremely cold . we are leaving in the middle of watching the raiders/chargers and dolphins/packers game because we ca n't stop shivering . i asked the people around us and they agreed . turn on your heat !	1520
0	hey get the blonde , the one with the light blonde hair ... off the drive through window . i think i went through half a tank of gas waiting , with only two cars in front of me . where is the regular a.m. guy at ? ?	2358
1	these folks were so kind ! ! when calling around all the well known hotels they would not get us in before 10 and even than they wanted to charge fees fees fees.. motel 6 let us in and gave us a bday discount ! ! ( they really left the light on for is )	3772
1	simply the best ! ! has been my go to store for many of years . amazing employees , customer service , food , coffee , clothes and deal ! !	1907
0	do n't tell anyone but i have a weakness for mcdonalds chicken mcnuggets . today i ordered myself a ten piece and a large order of french fries . after i paid , the guy at the second drive thru window said i needed to park and wait for the fries . i said no thank you and left .	504
1	why only 5 stars ? would n't let me give them 6 ! ok , just saw this place , and had to try . ordered the half dozen , where the person behind the counter picks them out . only she let us pick most of them out . the maple bacon long john , was not a choice for that deal . so , we got 7 donuts , and all we 've tried are simply amazing ! steve	2053
0	the guy working here is rude does n't greet you and just throws the receipt and straw at you . it 's like hey you hate your job quit and go next door and work there maybe then your endorphins will kick in and put you in a better mood .. jerk ! !	3302
0	what a sandwich ... .they say . no it 's not the best ! why ? # 1 the bread is old and hard to chew , # 2 the veggies they put in the sandwich a joke ! 2 slices tomatoes about 5 shreds of thin lettuce and a pinch of sprouts ! # 3 they refused to give peppers on the side `` because they are free '' all this for $ 8.00 not including chips or drink . however the racist remarks and bad attitude are free ... yes mexicans do eat sweet peppers too ... .i prefer them on the side ! ! !	1475
0	incredibly difficult to get in contact with from management . 6 calls and no answer , no offer of help . used to be great . i would n't recommend this place after my experience .	3730
1	seriously my favorite cleaners in vegas ! the two girls that 's work there are always so friendly and helpful . my clothes have always been on time and i 've never had one single problem with any of my garments . other cleaners tend to mess something up from time to time and/or misplace something . at eco cleaners , they 've even given me stuff back that they 've found in my pockets ! it may seem little , but seriously how many other cleaners can you say that will do that ? i 'm a weekly customer and need everything to be on time and on schedule and i would n't have it any other way than eco cleaners ! -joe soto	1596
1	i have been going here for over 7 years . i wont go anywhere else and i live in phoenix . love johnny ; nails are perfect every time ...	415
0	doctor did not thoroughly assess issue with foot . did independent research and my symptoms match more with another issue than the one this doctor recommended . doctor has lots of experience , however attitudes changed in his office once i questioned getting a boot for treatment . more in the business of quickly seeing patients as numbers rather than actually analyzing what the issue could be .	974
1	i stayed here for about 10 days . my stay was so long i think i knew or had at least said hi to everyone who worked there . i ca n't say enough good things about this place . very cute hotel and affordable . staff were friendly and accommodating . clean rooms . quiet . really worth staying here if you are visiting cleveland .	2188
0	security at this establishment does n't make you feel `` secure . '' just about every time i 've been in there , a homeless person has tried to panhandle money from me or cigarettes . management fires the good employees and the building is old and needs to be renovated in a major way .	2928
1	tina did a great job ! ! i brought in a picture of what i wanted and she did exactly that . i will definitely be making nails with love my new nail salon . the pedicure was amazing and ended with a hot stone massage ( amazing ) . it truly was great ! ! ! my gel manicure was also great ! i brought a picture of a very detailed design that i wanted and tina did exactly what i wanted . the salon was clean and the people were really nice . ca n't ask for more than that . i will definitely be back .	1429
1	great , local bakery , lots of brazillian sweets , which are pretty similar to french pastries . very reasonable prices ... 2 huge desserts , a tea and coffee for less than $ 8 ! i look forward to having an excuse to head back to mavis drive ... lots of shopping about .	3184
0	not as good as it used to be - the pho is really bland now , they were skimpy on our bean sprouts ( 1 wimpy plate of all the toppings for 2 bowls of pho ! ) and service is not great . also , they have a new menu that is way smaller and does n't have pictures . the old one was cheezy , but i kinda liked it . : )	673
0	i decided to come to this panaderia because i had the worst craving for a mexican pastry . personally , i thought the selection was quite limited . after i perused the pastries , i ended picking one that looked like some type of roll . when i took it out of the bag i noticed that it was so oily the paper bag looked like it contained french fries , not a dessert . one thing that bothered me the most is that there was a fly inside the bakery that you know was landing on any food it could get on . not sanitary . it was flying around in front of them , they could 've at least tried killing it .	1845
0	love bodyheat tanning , but this location lacks good personnel . visited march 18 , the girl who worked the front desk was rude , insulting , rolled her eyes , and i will never visit this location again ! love aliante location ! employees there always eager to help , and always have a smile on their face !	1314
1	i love the concept of this place ! ! ! i come here quarterly to sell the kids ' out grown clothes , toys , furniture , etc . then i purchase whatever i need . they have sales and some things have the tags on them . they get picky sometimes with what they buy from you , but that 's because they may already have too much on hand . do n't take it personal . chk their website first before selling so you know the tips to get the most back .	2018
0	i go here all the time for to-go orders and i swear half the time it takes 15 minutes and my order is ready and the other half of the time it takes about an hour . today in particular i waited for a full hour and got over cooked chicken with no honey , rice that is so hard it is inedible and mashed sweet potatoes that i would n't serve to a dog with how over cooked they are . why are we waiting an hour for terrible food ?	1549
1	always go to oceans when visiting from nyc . i only go here for the exotic fruit that isnt available in the us . store is always clean and always busy .	2069
1	gilbert center for family medicine has been my primary doctor 's office for 10 years . they are wonderful at getting me in in emergencies and getting me the medical assistance i need . i especially like the fact they have a blood lab on site ! their new location is super organized and nice . it is a pain to have to wait sometimes for my appointment time , but i understand the doctors and nps are taking their time with the patients - just like they will with me .	1562
1	i love this company they 've been around for years and are not only honest but efficient . you can count on them to do the right thing and give superior service . i will use them in the future .	3654
0	i really wanted to give them a good review based on the facts that so many yelpers love them but i just could n't get myself to do it . after the first bite of their seafood pancake , i knew my expectations were too high for this place . the pancake was bland and it tasted more like an egg fooyoung ( sp ? ) than a korean pancake . it was soooo thick ! i also ordered their beef sondoobu but they gave me the yook kae jang instead . again , very bland with lots of spice ( i liked the spice ) . i 'll stick to my regular korean spot on the southwest side and chinatown .	435
0	they stop and give me a ticket and a hot female can just get off . that 's bs phx pd . kiss my you know what .	2322
0	a few months ago i asked them to order a hogue grip for my s & w 65 . they told me it would take a week . when i did n't hear from them i called . they told me it was back ordered . i had my doubts when i was told it would be ordered and would be in a week later . i still have n't heard from them . i ordered one from midwayusa and received it less than a week later . their communication with customers is deplorable . i suppose if they have your item in stock it 's fine just do n't ask them to order anything .	2247
1	i have eaten pizza all over the country . i like all of the various types of pizza . metro is one of my top go to spots in las vegas for new york style pizza . i love the old new york with pepperoni added . i want high quality ingredients , a chewy crust , and the right balance of sauce . metro always delivers . the new $ 14 bottle of wine deal is also a great deal . i 'm giving this 5 stars because it is definitely under rated here .	192
0	why even make an appointment ? ! ? ! it seems like all the employees just ignore you . i brought my two daughters and grandmother in and we wo n't ever give this company our business again . the two stars are for the ladies that did my little girls mani pedi . they were gentle with them and for their first pedi it was good . i wish customer service was at the top of the priority list . there are too many options in the lake norman area not to give great service .	3603
0	the drinks are good & strong ! but the service and overall experience was a complete fail . the 1st bartender scoffed when i asked for recommendations , which is by no means an outrageous question to ask . we were told to `` read the menu , i have no idea what you would like '' ! nice ! how about just naming the most popular drink , seriously how hard is that ! the 2nd bartender was openly appalled by my rum choice , which i found bizarre . she brought over the 2nd bartender to exclaim over my choice once again making me repeat my order to her colleague . this was bizarre and blatantly rude . not worth lining up for !	292
1	great little motel . a bit dated , but very clean . staff was very accommodating and helpful . the breakfast was well maintained ( the eggs were a bit weird ) . but all in all , a great experience . easy access from the 10 with more than ample parking for large vehicles . we will be back if ever in phx .	1335
0	i was for a dinner since friends stayed at the four seasons . a much smaller venue than i expected and the table to narrow that my 'neighbour ' next table elbows constantly touched mine . the food : had their square pizza - typical thick pizza ( thinking pizza hut ) , cheese and basil is fresh , but , the price tag is a bit scary . also ordered duck pasta - it was nothing spectacular and tasted like shredded pork in cheesy sauce . wo n't be a second visit .	833
0	great staff . soggy hotdog . unique menu . soggy wings . i guess , great price but a little disappointed from all the reviews .	1566
1	i love love love these guys they did an awesome job ! they gave me a great deal on the install . rigo and the whole team . took care of all of ladies that where stuck in pep boys ... ladies these guys are the best and wo n't ripe you off	2263
0	the woman answering the phones is horrible . she can not speak clearly , and is rude . she hung up on me twice . also my order took well over an hour to be delivered to my house and i am right down the street . it 's a joke .	987
0	items in my luggage was stolen in a virgin america flight and now i am in my fourth call to them trying to get reimbursed . this is the virgin america experience . update : they just said they will do nothing .	1623
0	staff and vets are friendly and nice but it seems very expensive . recently brought in my dog and was given prescription meds . came back to get a refill and was stunned by the price . later saw the same medication online for about half the price . do n't understand how they can get away with charging that much .	2165
0	never ordering from this place again . they have just changed the pizza oven two weeks ago which cost their pizza to be cook more evenly . this means that every time you order pizza from them the bottom of the pizza will be black ... but they will argue with you that it is not burned but this is how a pizza is supposed to be . horrible service	459
1	i love this store ! so much selection , and sales people are very helpful , not pushy , they do n't follow you around like vultures . there is a discounted selection of furniture in the back too , returned items , or custom pieces that were returned . there are a variety of price points , so that you can be mindful of different budgets . i bought a sofa today , and the sales person was great . i did n't have to go throughout a lot of hassle , and they were able to schedule a delivery time that worked best for me . and they have free starbucks , what could be better !	2071
0	got a $ 20 haircut on tuesday . i guess it is true you get what you pay for . i have n't had a haircut this uneven since i was a kid and i tried cutting gum out of my hair !	2591
1	i love this store ! i was greeted at the door and was asked if i needed help ! i had a question about my hp printer , results in 2 minutes ! then they walked me to all the computer supplies on my list . i was out of there in 15 minutes . maybe the price is a little more than walmart , but it is worth it !	3192
1	stopped in because i 'm alway shopping at frys so i thought why not give them a try . i 'm so glad i did ! i always ask for a specific shape and ann was able to get it done ! i love them . great customer service and very accommodating . will be back and recommend them to others as well .	3390
1	all experience with national stone was just awesome ! ! ! ! from first moment when i called them to get estimate and last moment when i paid , shake zane 's hand and leaved very happy . their customer service , care for customer and taste were unbelievable . jim came to my house at my requested time ( at 7am ) . theresa , zane and mo helped me to choose the perfect quartz for my shiny white kitchen from ikea and save lots of money ( what is a big plus : ) ) ) . my kitchen was done very quick and neat . i definitely will go back to them again and will recommend to all my friend .	2090
0	team was nice and answered questions however they literally look one hour to box 3 packages . borderline embarrassing . i use to like ups stores but their franchised stores are poor at best .	1320
0	would give this place zero stars if i had that option . # 1 - terrible service # 2 - dirty for a restaurant . shoes were sticking to floor , i did not even bother using their washroom # 3 - food was okay , nothing spectacular enough for me to rmbr ... # 4- chinese take out box concept was cute # 5- better then going to random ghetto fast food restaurant around the area ... at least their fried food is made with fresh ingredients .	688
1	i got a coupon in the mail for a free oil change here so i decided to bring my mazda by . austin in the service department was so nice and thorough . he brought a few issues to my attention and i completely trusted him . he ran through the list of items that needed attention and made sure i understood everything . i think i found my new shop for service and repairs !	2816
0	the apartments are very nice but the staffing there is horrible . especially one in particular by the name of joanne . she was very rude , stuck up and unprofessional . somebody needs to tell her that she sucks at her job .	2033
1	very helpful staff . groupon made it very affordable . we had a tremendous time . even for novice ! !	3936
1	i have lived at liv northgate gilbert going on three years . this property has the most amazing amenities and events that any complex could offer . the maintenance staff is right on top of things . the new office staff is fantastic . it is a family friendly atmosphere where you can feel at home if you 're 21 or 91 .	2609
1	if you are a matcha lover like i am , you will love this place . hands down , mcm has the best matcha soft serve in vegas . delish !	2984
1	i love dr k ... .he is professional , friendly and does great work ! ! ! i just found out dr k has new office personnel who care about his patients as much as he does . great news . i 'll be back , no doubt about it now ! ! ! ! ! ! !	2953
1	what an amazing restaurant for healthy and fresh food ! i love the vegan veggie burgers with gluten free buns and the kale quinoa and lime bowl ! my daughter asks to go here so often . this is now one of our most favourite eateries in charlotte ... such good food we crave ! ! thank you b.good ! ! !	1269
0	i do n't know how the other barbers are , but the older white man , do n't go to him . rude , crappy and needs to get his eyes checked to do line ups because obviously he does n't know how a straight line looks	3600
1	thank you nothing bundt cakes for donating mini bundt cakes to the junior league ! i had my first bundt cake ( white chocolate ) last night and it was absolutely , perfectly , amazing ! ! ! ! i thought i would take a bite to try the cake out , expecting it to be good ... it was so good , i finished the whole cake ! the white chocolate bundt cake was moist , had a perfect amount of frosting drizzled on top and down the middle and raspberries in the cake . cake flavor was delicious ! i will definitely be in to pick up some more soon to share with friends .	18
1	had dinner here tonight with my fiancé . we got excellent service from derek , who made some awesome recommendations on the mac and cheese and fettuchini alfredo . atmosphere is relaxing and quiet . i loved the black martini and the super fruit cosmo . we 're looking forward to coming back soon !	1529
1	i 've gotten several haircuts here over the years and they 're always great . the employees are friendly and make you feel welcome , and the prices have always been reasonable . i recommend may 's hair salon to anyone looking to get a quality haircut for a good price while helping out a local small business .	887
1	i am more familiar with inflatable bouncies , but this was still quite fun for little ones . we did n't feel like bouncing that day , so we left it to the kiddos go at it while we sat and chatted . i do like the separate little children 's area . there 's a coffee bar , drinks and snacks are available at the cafe . nice lounge area with a flat screen for daddies that could n't do without sports . overall , a good place to relax and have the children play . i can see this again on my list come summer time !	1664
1	customer service is nice so any things is clean i was looking for some lumber just take time around and 10 minutes .	1820
1	one stop shopping . no need to select stone at one location and the try to find finishing and installation . these people know their `` stuff '' ! best price in town for the complete package . job was done to perfection . owners should be proud that they offer this kind of great product and service . we show off our countertops with pride !	2090
1	my daughter and i just wandered into this salon - how lucky for us ! ! ! great products - skin care line is exceptional . they have a beautiful clean space - soothing music - wonderful staff that all understand and communicate with you in english . manicures and pedicures are amazing ! ! also - after it all - they do a neck and upper back massage ! ! exceptional services and wonderful staff ! ! ! our new 'go to ' place for any pamper me services . have also heard they do outstanding facials ... . that is the next on my list ! ! highly recommend ! !	2148
0	not my usual 24 hour fitness locations at this morning i saw something that is just disgusting . man was standing outside the jacuzzi and scraping his feet the desk staff did not seem overly concerned about him spreading his human petri dish all around a place where people walk barefoot and right in front of the opening to the water . i will not be back	392
1	this evening i watched an air force gentleman come in order his sub and the young lady working there thanked him for his service and paid for his sub out of her own pocket . glad to see there are still good people in this world . she deserves a raise !	1475
1	i can only comment on the first floor . where else can you find dollar drafts in this area ? once my friends and i saw the sign , we settled in for hours , particularly with the awesome , live hair metal just outside . $ 1 rolling rock and hamm drafts ? yes , please . i thought the gaming staff were nice as well , and this an inexpensive , but fun place to hang out .	3630
1	great sushi . the galbi is the best in the city . i have tried to find better but none can compare ! the service is very good . the servers are attentive and knowledgeable .	740
0	i made a 6pm appointment in advanced a few weeks prior . i walk in and was told to wait . a few minutes later another lady walks in and they take her instead first . poor customer service . besides that , the interior sucks . it looks like a shitty ghetto fix up .	2686
0	i was prepared to go out and have a good time , when this establishment turned me away , told me i could n't take part in underwear night besucase i was in four inch heels . as a femme gay man , i felt rather attacked . they told me `` it 's a gentleman 's night and heels make it drag . '' so do n't try to get in to this gay bar if you 're `` too gay '' ! i will not be back .	3661
1	overall a decent dollar tree . i 've been here maybe 6 times or so . the lines are n't too bad , but usually dollar tree 's are pretty good about lines . the primary flaw to this dollar tree is they have zero shopping carts . they actually steal shopping carts from other businesses , so that 's a little ridiculous , but other than that a positive experience .	963
0	we 've been searching for a replacement since our other cleaners moved on , and it seems , after several months of trying new people , we have arrived .	2029
1	food is mediocre and service is okay , they are trying to `` up '' the service . last night my hockey team and i stopped by for some food and to watch the jays -- our normal waitress ( tatiana ? ) was pretty great ! nachos on the house and food came out quick ! my diet coke was already on the table before i even got there ... and they have barking squirrel beer ! tuesday is half priced wings and if you ask nicely for garpar ( not on the menu ) you might just get it ! bear in mind it is medium wings with grated cheese never busy but always regular !	1112
1	i wish a had more stars to give . i 've moved 4 times in the last 2 years and have used these guys every time . i 've had the pleasure of having just about the same crew for every move - steve , kam and ben - they absolutely rock ! they are so professional , very quick and beyond careful with all of my belongings . they always show up at the expected arrival time , they get straight to work and are very efficient with their time . i will , without a doubt , continue to use them and recommend them to all my friends and family . thank you guys for being so amazing ! !	1645
1	visit # 2 was as great as the first ! yum ! maple long john and a homer donut for my niece and i , and cosmic brownie for my nephew ! customer service was great , quick , and the staff is so friendly : ) way to go hurts donut !	2053
1	my sister and i bought an rv trailer 16 ft in las vegas nevada our first . we could n't have had a better sales rep was raymond juvera , we put him thru hell and winded up given him our business , he went way beyond for us new owners . if and when we are ready to upgrade we will be back to see ramen again and bluedog rv . please do if you go there to look for an rv ask for him you have the best experience .	1353
1	i really enjoyed my meal here . the decor is really nice and the staff was really helpfull in navigating the long menu . i started off with some dim sum that was very well crafted and freshly made . the shrimp dumplings and crunchy chicken were outstanding . the two highlights of the meal were the scallops and green beans . i was too full for dessert , so that means i will have to head back . you do get a fortune cookie ! ! one tip ... they charge $ 20 for 3 hours of parking ... you can do better at a lot around the corner .	1441
0	one of the few gas stations in vegas that does n't sell 40 oz beers or single tall cans . everyone else in town does , why do n't you fools sell it ?	3814
0	cash is so horrible and i will never give my money to a club that is so awful to patrons . the dj was so mean , left her booth several times to yell at people who were simply trying to dance and have fun . a place that is supposed to be open to all to have a good time turned out to be extremely judgmental and terrible . i would n't recommend you give any time or money to this horrific place .	2860
1	rissa j. needs to lay off the heroin and chill the fuck out . she wins , machine does n't print out the ticket and she losses her shit . the bartenders did all they could but it was up to the slot tech to fix the issue . rissa was yelling across the bar at other guests and yelled at the bartenders . if anything they had a lot of patience to deal with her annoying , loud obnoxious ass !	1520
1	purchased a mountain bike at this location as a christmas gift . very happy with the bike , the price , and the service . i have been to other locations and not been very happy with the service . the manager at this location was very helpful , friendly , and knowledgeable ; just great customer service .	3911
1	i 'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews for this company . they did an amazing job on my house and the landscaping was n't bad either . i do n't think people on here understand you 're supposed to tidy up your house a bit before they come . they 're also on a 2 week rotation . one visit they do basic cleaning and the next they do detailed . it would be impossible for them to complete both in one visit given their time restraints and large clientele .	2994
0	these people and their employees are a piece of work . got taken by no fault of my own and the owner took a what cha gon na do attitude not gon na persue them over a 3 month contract and he knew it . masssage sucked young cutsie pie girls lack customer support skills and owner is a piece of work	3862
0	they have a horrible answering service ! ! ! i 've been trying to call for the past hour and no answer at all ! ! ! it just keeps on ringing	3059
0	i normally do n't like to give bad reviews on yelp . however , i 've gone twice to kelly 's bar and lounge and had an unsatisfying experience . i felt completely unwanted to be there from the staff . i do n't expect over the top service but i want to feel okay being there which i did n't . we ended up leaving without getting any food because they kept on ignoring us and being unkind .	279
0	my husband and i come here a lot but we will be backing off . this location is inconsistent with their blasts and scoop sizes . my blast was under filled by an inch ( i thought it would be filled to the top ) and there was no candy sprinkled on top . we 've been disappointed lately and do n't feel it is going to continue to be worth the money .	3493
1	good music , beautiful people ! we had a cabana reserved last night , and i thought it was funny to have bottle service with an led flashing rod ( a replacement for actual sparklers , which was kinda strange ) . i do wish it was more inclusive for gay people ; there was a massive crowd but no same sex couples among all the straighties . shout out to janae ( sp ? ) our server , who was so helpful and friendly ! dj was awesome in a glamorous environment ( but have a well sized wallet )	2553
1	we enjoyed excellent service and very good food . salads were perfect as was soft shell crab and chicken livers . broad pasta was excellent as was scottish beef . very good and extensive wine list . wonderful experience and good value for the price	286
1	my most favourite place ever for chinese desserts ! not only are the prices super reasonable , but the food is delicious ! the staff and service is excellent too ! and their tea is really good . i particularly love the design of the store . it is very traditional and not too modern ; it reminds us of the chinese culture and history . it 's a perfect place to hang out with family and friends . the black sesame soup , steamed egg , fried milk , steamed noodle rolls , rice pots , are only a few of my beloved dishes here . i will no doubt be returning ! : )	1062
0	pretty pricy korean place , wo n't come back again . came here wanting to have bbq , but a plate of short ribs is $ 15 while i can get ayce for that price somewhere else . ended up ordering regular stuff . tried cow ribs soup ( so small ) , grilled fish ( i swear the fish weights less than 0.5lb ) , and rice sausage ( flavour was bland , no seasoning ) not coming here again that 's for sure	396
1	everyone was very sweet and our nails turned out fantastic ! great customer service and great pricing ! i recommend this place to everyone !	1838
1	this was my 4th cleaning ... love them ! ! ! i have used for both carpet and mattress cleaning . the staff rocks ... so nice and professional . special shoutout to jeremy & joe who just did a beautiful job on my home carpet today . see you guys in another 6 months . thank you , you 're the best .	1273
1	cute little place ! got here around 7pm , about an hour before closing . bf wanted something off of the savory crepes menu , but we were told they were n't serving any savory crepes at this time.. not sure if they ran out of ingredients or they just stop serving them at a certain time . we got the smores crepes instead & it was delicious . it was packed with a ton of nutella .	1011
1	i went for the basic oil change a few weeks ago . i had a good experience and will return . they completed my change within twenty minutes . that is good enough in my opinion . thank you terrible 's ! !	1544
1	this place is excellent ! ! 5 star customer service and they also got my son 's damaged i pad screen fixed in 60 mins ! ! he really needed it repaired quickly for school ! ! stop in and asj for morgan he is the best ! ! !	1104
0	sushi is decent and fresh . service is very slow . travelzoo voucher users are not treated the same as regular walk-in . for example , sunday family specials are not available . even with the vouchers , this place is overpriced . without the vouchers , this place is outrageously overpriced . skip this place and go to aoyama ( when i do n't go ) or cafe michi or zen which are close by and much , much better .	422
0	there really starting to fall apart . been a member for over 2 years and machines are always broken and takes forever to get fixed . towel service has been on and off . the air conditioner seems to never be on always hot and they have the fans on but all it 's doing is blowing hot nasty air around . i 'm not the only member complaining a few even left to go to other gyms . when i first was a member here i would of given this place 5 stars	2328
0	ordered tandoori grill , worst chicken , stale chicken , the grill chicken had a stale smell and was too dry and hard to bite , seemed like it was recooked and it was tasteless too , got biryani for my kids , portion size was too small , no value for money , biryani too was tasteless and being an indian i feel sad to say this is the worst indian restaurant in phoenix .	202
0	i only give a one star rating because you ca n't put a zero . do not get your hair done here ! ! ! ! they messed up my hair & did n't even dye it the way i wanted . they did it their own way without even asking or talking to me about it until after it was done . even when i mentioned i did n't like the color they did nothing about it . worst decision of my entire life ! ! !	1117
0	worst eyebrow place i 've ever been to . they always thin my eyebrows and fuck up my shape and i have to grow them out and go somewhere else to get them fixed . do n't come here	460
0	i have stopped coming because the food is not that great , the chicken has an after-taste and i have had better food . if it were not for the friendly manager and some employees , i would have not been such a glutton for punishment . the red-haired cashier will ring up your order , and then go to the men 's and women 's restrooms to empty the trash , bringing it through the kitchen ( how tasty ) and then prepare the rice and rest of the meals without washing her precious little hands . i am sure the health department will enjoy this review .	474
1	i came to smart fix with a laptop that had cracked screen : ( after calling around for quotes , i was driving one day and saw their business and decided to go in just to see if by chance they may be a little cheaper than the quotes i had received and they were ! i was very happy with the repair and the guys at the store called me as soon as it was ready . i will save their info for any other repairs i may need down the line	1104
1	spiced rum daiquiri is amazing . so was the famous deli . sooo good . lived the chipotle sauce and sweet potato fries as well . service was excellent and food tasty . very reasonable prices and big portions . love it !	534
0	worst whole foods store ! ! ! they can not keep up with their inventory ! ! they hire the most miserable unfriendly employees . most of them look depressed/unhappy . at least put an act on or something geez ! lol they are definitely in need of improvement .	3874
0	if you like sushi that has mayo , cream cheese , and is deep fried , this is your place . i did n't love it . the stir fry tofu was not bad . but overall it 's too pricey for the portions , especially the sushi .	912
1	one of my favs ! absolutely ! they make this spicy shrimp dish - it used to be available as an appetizer , but now it 's offered as an entree . yummy ... i luv it !	600
1	only used the pharmacy . was on a week long business trip and had to ask a pharmacist a question . very knowledgeable and professional and helped me with all my purchases . it is a small mini store on asu campus but next to raod so easy in and out .	3318
0	it took me about 20 min to get my drink . the waiter is rude and unprofessional . she gave me an attitude even i think she is a racist . the jazz music is good but i guess they mostly welcome white people ... .was very upset and disappointed	3295
1	great food . there wings are delectable . i always love their food and they are pretty fast for delivery . thanks again for some amazing food ! definitely recommend for first timers !	987
1	took my wife in looking for something to spice up valentine 's day . if you go and need help ask for sam . not sure what to say about the rest of the store but sam was amazing helping her find something that fit right , and because of her help the wife looked amazing and confident in what she wore out on our date that weekend . thanks sam because of you she will be back .	3234
1	love that this park is in our area ! my kids love to feed the ducks and play in the gated playground area . summer time is especially fun for them when the sprinklers are on in the playground . overall an excellent place .	367
0	came here for 2 bowls..what a shame..i kept asking for extra and he would n't give it to me and just ignored me..then got annoyed when i told him if he can add extra steak ... the bowls were so small not like a regular chipotle..waste of money and time ... do n't get annoyed at people when your suppose to do a simple job .	214
0	do n't go here if you have a job ... or a life . they make you be a member ( $ 50 a month ) and never have appointments available on weekends or evenings so that you can actually use your masssages . my boyfriend has 26 massages built up and every time he goes to cancel his membership they let him know that he 's going to lose his massages ... ..that 's $ 1300 of services he 's paid for that he ca n't redeem at any location . he tried to authorize me to use some of those massages ... . $ 10 transfer fee , you can only transfer one massage every 6 months .	1950
1	i love this dunkin donuts location ... .they are so much faster than many others . great service and they do n't burn my wraps like the one on crismon.. .	1770
1	adopted our beautiful 2 year old cat here a little over a month ago . the sunnyslope location is beautiful and well-maintained . the only problem was that our cat already had an upper respiratory infection when we adopted him . however , you receive two free vet visits ( including medicine , tests , etc . ) if the pet has an illness that they might have gotten while being at the humane society . they are also great about following up with us to see how the cat is doing and providing helpful tips to make him more comfortable in his new home .	1980
0	waste of time , staff was very unprepared and not helpful . if i could give zero stars i would .	2906
1	hubby and i love this place . we 've had chinese food all over the country , including chinatown in san francisco , and we think the food here is just great . the sauces are so delicious , the veggies are crisp , they put a ton of shrimp in their dishes , and the meats are good quality ( some buffets have really fatty , tough meat ) . if you want the buffet , you need to be here between 11:30 and 1:30 when dishes are hot and fresh . they have additional dishes at the dinner buffet , but we think lunch is the best deal . hope this place never changes .	1575
0	wanted to thank you for driving all the way out here and your closed ... says your open 10-4 and i pull up and your closed ! thanks for taking 40 minutes of my life i 'll never get back ! update your facts	550
0	i had read reviews mentioning the smell , and they were correct . the fish smell hits you in the face as soon as you walk in . if you can get past that ( my wife could n't ) , the store is ok. nice selection , but not as complete as new century which is in the same plaza .	1963
1	this is one of the most exquisite taco belles in all of the phoenix valley . all i can say is wow ! ! ! so . let me start with the décor . classic movie posters really put me in the mood for some authentic mexican food . now , let tell you that not all taco bells are created equal . this one is truly a cut above the rest . it 's finger lickin good . definitely recommend	3
0	father 's day dinner , not good ! the cook must love salt , because my chicken parm was sooooo salty . the calamari was soooo salty . the fish and chips was missing that light flakey batter . the long island drink special had way to much sour mix and ca n't help but wonder if he or she made me a virgin . picking new places to try is always a gamble .	717
1	i was skeptical based on reviews but gave it a shot one sunday afternoon . my friend and i had the best salads ! and we knew we were taking a chance ordering salads since it appears to be a sports bar . they were amazing and the fruity light summer ale the waitress suggested was awesome ! would def go back , prices seemed good too . - ordered the harvest salad -	211
0	do n't waste your money on their laser treatments ! did not only work as dr said i paid for more and still did n't work . either the laser or the `` laser tech '' failed . how much training did she have and why did they tell me this would work and it did n't work at all ! there was absolutely no change even the slightest improvement would 've been something . i feel robbed !	2430
0	this place is n't worth even one star . the owner/receptionist is shady . was quoted over the phone exactly what i wanted . how did just a blow out double in price over the phone to after i was done ? the guy who did it was great . but the owner is a money hungry liar ! ! ! ! ! ! i will never come back . u should be ashamed of yourself . and the girl who did my moms hair was even worse . bad day ! bad experience . the reason he could n't find me in the data base is cuz i do n't want you knowing who i am .	1617
0	the mongolian beef and chicken chow mein were very bland , and lacking on any major flavor .	1264
0	i can imagine how a new trainee is introduced to jambo mesa . here are the rides . some you have to push in order to operate . and you are the break , how much do you weigh again ? you will never have to vacuum the carpet or clean anything . make sure you roll your eyes and ignore people as much as possible . here is your ringworm and scabies treatment kit . you will get used to the smell of feet , but not on your first day . if something breaks , just keep using it . at all costs , act like you do n't care about how ghetto your workplace is .	3439
1	these guys are awesome ! i took a used bow in last saturday . they spent close to an hour checking it over , tuning it , and helping me set it up to my draw length . i asked `` how much do i owe you '' ? and they said $ 15 . i was expecting at less twice that for their time . then i told them i needed some arrows and some string wax . they took the time to find me some arrows at a reasonable price that would work well with my bow . i mean these guys are great . i will be going to them for all my archery supply needs .	471
1	amazing food , enough good options for vegetarians and gluten free needs . very nice staff . would totally recommend folks to eat here . the only thing i would like to see is more vegan gf options and a bigger place . if they did that i 'd likely quit cooking at home and eat here all the time .	640
1	we just ate here this evening , and we will definitely be returning . the customer service was phenomenal , and the wings were even better . cody greeted us as we walked in explained the entire menu , the favorites - spice levels , etc . our food came out just quick enough so you knew it was freshly cooked just for you . the owner came over to our table to ask how the food was and our one year old daughter was quite pleased with the french fries . it 's casual , but very clean recommend 100 % - yum .	1397
1	i had a great experience here at petland . i loved the staff . they were friendly knowledgeable and caring . no pushy tactics just good sales staff period ! i got a baby beagle here while i was just brousing missing mine who had just passed at 17 years 2 weeks prior . they offer a full puppy for life guarantee and full coverage of vet bills for the first 2 weeks should your baby contract anything . i love this place !	1894
1	very happy to see this place rise up . prices are good in general . plenty of savings can be found . service is excellent . workers are always friendly .	1904
0	hmmm i am a darn huge fan of kimpton hotels however when i booked here they failed to tell me there was street and building construction going on during my overnight stay . tisk tisk . this hotel met kimpton standards in decor and food and their famous happy hour but i never expected not to be told about construction jack hammers and all . will not stay at this particular location again for that lack of service .	3859
1	i 'm from new england and love my dunks ! i was c pleasantly surprised to find this on the same plaza as my new hair salon . i stopped by the drive through on my way home . there was no wait and they got my order right which equals a perfect trip to dd ! the lady working was n't overly friendly but the service was fine for me . i 'd def give this place a try - especially if you 're an unsweetened iced tea lover like myself !	618
1	while not quite true authentic japanese style ramen like you get at monta 's in vegas , it 's the best tasting ramen i 've found in the valley of the sun . i find the owner very personable and honest about his attempt at making ramen . he treats it as a work in progress and a constant learning process to find the right balance and above all ... consistency . practice makes perfect ... stop by and take a taste of the young masters craft !	131
1	they have really great calamari and spring rolls , their delivery is quick but they 're california rolls are okay	1231
1	slightly over rated and expensive ! ! ! but it 's still a lot of fun as long as you do n't go broke gambling the night away . good to visit at least once or maybe twice in your lifetime . and i do n't know why people want to bring their kids here ... sleaziness all over the strip ! do n't bring the babieeezzzz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	315
0	wow second update ... that 's a first for me . anyway , my new bumper popped out of place from az heat ( my best guess ) and the pearl white paint from my bumper to my fenders does not match only a month later . so much for all those additional charges the shop justified as needing to blend the paint to match ! we will be taking it to a new shop to have the mistakes fixed .	2654
1	it is strange but the food here taste a lot better than another location i have visited . had just a plain burger but it was really good . we had mussels , pizza , and a killer sausage dish for appetizers . the atmosphere with the multiple levels was very nice , and the staff was attentive . do n't kill me but i am not a beer drinker so the options of non beer drinks were limited .	670
0	wow ... i was going to leave a negative review of this place , but that would be like kicking a man when he 's down . crystal cleaners ... get real guys .	1053
1	we had 2 dogs and baby . we love aloft ! ! ( this was our second time aloft stay ) very clean room , nice bar ( bartender was nice : ) paid $ 50 for dogs but its refundable if dogs does n't destroy anything . one thing we did n't like it was waiting for pack in play about 40 min even we told them we have baby when we booked ( this is hotels.com 's fault ? ) but mostly very good experience . i do n't know why the review is not so good ? if they have a bath tub and complementary breakfast , it would be super perfect ! ! ; )	3522
1	great supply of all the good brands ... two reasons they do n't get five stars ... 1 ) i have waited over 20 mins to check out before and 2 ) $ 30 for professional make up application ... forget that - got to mac , buy $ 40 of makeup and get it done free and better ...	2479
1	i was desperately looking for a hotel . i was greeted by caitlin who did a wonderful job and finding us a room so late at night . it was nice to see that we had a hot breakfast for free . they even had happy hour from 5pm-630pm . my next trip to phoenix arizona i would definitely stay here .	1195
0	if you want 2 dead ants in your ketchup , definitely come to this place . i 'm disgusted and do n't even want to think about how many bugs are in their kitchen .	57
1	closest that i 've found to chinese food from back home ( i 'm from oahu hawaii ) . the only place that i 've found here in vegas with cake noodle . not as good but pretty close ( consistency is not as thick or firm as back home ) . too bad it 's so darn far from where i live ( centennial ) .	1103
0	i ask myself everyday how people stay in business . i have been trying to contact this company about their tours to the grand canyon for two days without a response . their phone rings twice and then rings busy . i have sent multiple emails with no response . it 's obvious they do n't need my business , if they do n't answer their phones , how do i know they will be in business at the time of my tour . moving on ,	2935
0	do n't waste your money ! you may as well take it and throw it into the garbage can . young staff who could care less about supporting your efforts . they just wanted to sell you more to up their commission or what ever they get from upgrading your treatments . injections , b12 none of it worked . i left with several more treatments . waste of time and money !	2168
1	if you love mexican style seafood , this is your place . the menu is in english , but i 've not had a waiter that spoke it . i do n't speak spanish , but i can point to what i like , so it 's always worked . as with most non-american restaurants , they are mucho kid friendly . they have booths and tables . the location is unappealing , as is the exterior , but if you live in phoenix , you 're used to it , so take a trip to mesa for this treat .	299
0	ordered a medium black milk tea boba , no whip cream on top , and blended - $ 5.06 total . the drink was not fully blended at the top portion and liquid at the bottom . it tasted bad . i have had many bubble teas before , and it did n't taste or resemble those other yummy drinks . hard to describe , but it had a taste of blended powder with a lot of artificial sugar . i was only able to take a few sips before throwing it away in the garbage . service was also very slow , there was only the one employee , and he moved slowly . very disappointing ...	2980
0	do not give these people money down to hold a car for you they will rip you off and not give you your money back if you change your mind i gave them 500 dollars plus 20 for their bs credit card fee never heard of that so 520 total now they say they installed a gps tracker in car put gas and washed it and had it all ready and when i ran into issues with their bogus finance charges and backed out of deal they said they are only refunding me 450 dollars and ive been waiting a week and still no credit on my debit card	2227
0	this place is bizarre . what 's with the huge curtain upon entry that serves no purpose and is just in the way of the line of people ordering . the service ? totally unengaging , unfriendly , and unhelpful . the system they have going on is completely unorganized and inefficient . i found the food very bland . and the atmosphere was what it is , an old car garage with new white paint . i will not be returning .	21
1	after playing here for more than a couple of times , i felt bad for my other review . i 'm now giving this place another star because 1 . there are not really any naggy kids anymore , seems like they 're gone 2 . if you get used to the arena , the bang bang rule kind of grows on you . and lastly 3 . i find the refs to be helpful and very chill . yea there are going to be those people that curse at you in the arena and overpriced snacks , but not everything is perfect .	3058
0	never ever shop here . they do not stand by their products . when faced with a complaint about a new bar stool purchase the manager said '' it 's your problem- put the stools in a yard sale '' . these were on sale for $ 350 each.refused to take back and refused to replace . total purchase over $ 4k . never again .	3872
0	honestly , this is a bit of a cheesy show for my taste . if you want to go see guys performing to choreography , tease you without revealing anything , and see mother-in-laws get dragged on stage to grope the host ... then this is the show for you . i will likely not be coming back here . like another reviewer on here stated ... i can see more at the beach for free .	2149
1	travis moore provided great customer service and was a pleasure to work with . i highly recommend reaching out to him regarding the purchase of a new vehicle .	1424
1	roberto 's taco shops have very authentic and tasty mexican food ... awesome frijoles , delicious shredded chicken tacos , rolled tacos , decent spanish rice , and so much more ! open 24 hours and they usually offer a great chicken taco deal on wednesdays ... 99 cents each !	322
1	great experience ! do n't neglect yourself and get all those suspicions moles and lesions treated at this professional and wonderful office !	3598
0	this place is very unprofessional . i made an appointment for 4 o'clock and i was not attended til 6 . regardless whether you made an appointment or not they take customers as they go . i had to run to the lady after she finished someone else 's set just so she can attend me next . this place is also very packed . i got my nails done by mickey and she did not do a very good job . she did it in 2 seconds and they were very crooked . the nail polish and acrylic nail did n't even cover my full nail nail . on top of that she was kinda rude to me and my friend .	2892
0	do not go here ! i arrived at 5:45 pm after noticing my dog excoriating her skin . the front office told me i would have to pay for an emergency visit . they close at 6 pm . the front office only seemed to care about getting out of there and going home . dr. hampe and lynne are very nice . neither of them were on today . do n't go there . now i see why their waiting room is never full . horrible way to treat someone .	1700
0	service is slooooooooooooooooooooow , waited 30 minutes just to get some snacks . overall the theater is nice , just needs to hire more people	2450
1	i 've been to this cafe rio location once . my cousin worked at the university at the time and it turned out to be the perfect place to meet up for lunch , especially since i 'm a big fan and she had never tried it before . as always , i ordered a burrito with enchilada sauce . i always mull over their menu looking for something new to try . when crunch time arrives , i seem to find myself settling for that . settling is not quite the right word , though , because it is always delicious and satisfying .	1365
1	an 80 's style comedy room . the owner is nice , the bartender is nice . great acts come through here . why would you not go ?	42
1	great show , loved the colors . very retro a true vegas must see . and the best part is all the longed legged lovelies half naked . great set design and production	3069
0	i had made several trips back to this restaurant and found the food quality was slipping each time . i finally stopped having dinners here and switched to appetizers when i dropped in . i also noticed that the wait staff had become more and more arrogant over time . apparently poor service , bad attitude and declining food quality along with high prices finally nailed them . they are closed !	13
0	stopped in on our way back from indiana . we are avid starbucks fans , frequenting starbucks all over the country . my wife 's misto was undrinkable , even after sending it back for a remake . first time ever we poured out a starbucks . this is not starbucks coffee !	3678
0	i went yesterday for mothersday and took my mom for the first time . read some reviews seemed like it would be a nice relaxing time . i was very disappointed . i thought it was just the guy i had no it was just the worst experience the massage we both had were too rough and left us both sore it was so painful . their massage techniques were terrible the worst i 've felt . we both need another massage . i 've definitely been to better spas . i will never go back and i recommend everyone to keep searching for another spa to go too this was waste of time & money .	2320
0	if i could give this place zero stars i would . after standing around waiting and watching a mechanic yell at another customer they finally asked how they could help me . i told them i simply needed to see if my tire was able to be plugged and the guy looks over his shoulder and goes `` uhh looks like we 're kinda busy . '' okay ? ... thanks for the help .	1778
0	the employee that goes by annie b , is the rudest more unhelpful person ever . she acts annoyed and agitated when you ask for help and makes you feel stupid for even asking . she definitely needs to work on her customer service skills	1782
0	beware- if u do n't specify in comments u will be forced to use level 1 . i found that out with my horrible hair cut . so i did every thing i could to get level 2 for my color and drove across town to be told 'sorry it 's a level 1 ' wow ! never again- i 'll pay a professional . bad cut and bad color is asking too much to try to help these students out .	354
0	i would not risk my 121 career coming here . very unfriendly and instead of making sure a pilot keeps flying , i got the impression she was trying to ground me . i was berated for having a cup of coffee in the morning , 2 hours before my physical . it was an overall uncomfortable experience .	3888
1	i came here to get my car smog and they were wonderful ! fast , easy , and professional . they also have a $ 5 military discount . i will come here for all of my other vehicles .	2208
1	as always this location is awesome ! they had 4 guys behind the counter and were super fast ! a fee people in front of us but they worked together and we had our food fast ! we got the italian and the club , both sandwiches were so good and fresh , the roast beef was nice and rare . you ca n't go wrong with any sandwich at this location . whoever owns this franchise is doing something right	1528
0	honnêtement , je ne comprends pas pourquoi ce restaurant est si achalandé et si bien coté ... d'abord , le poulet n ' a rien d'extraordinaire et la sauce piquante très grasse , les frites , mis à part les petites épices sur le dessus , n'ont rien de spécial non plus , sans compter le manque d'espace pour manger confortablement sur place . les cheveux du monde dans la file d'attente presque dans nos assiettes et tout , et tout le monde qui attend qui te regarde pendant que tu manges ... bien bien bien ordinaire , je ne retournerai jamais là-bas , même pas pour un take-out ! seul point positif , les sucreries et produits de boulangerie avaient l'air bien .	1109
0	stupid manager kayle did n't let me finish my coffee inside .	491
1	when you get a six month subscription that includes thursday and sunday papers , you ca n't really complain . the thursday edition includes the entertainment guide and also the department store ads for the coming weekend . the sunday edition is huge and includes the coupon section . if you use the coupons , one trip to the grocery store can pay for the entire subscription . overall a decent paper and worth the price when you get a subscription deal .	3511
0	i went to yolanda and was very disappointed.. her schedule was always incorrect . she ran late and i had to sit for up to one half hour . she never gave me full lashes . said i had to continue to come bk and she would add more . which did n't make since.. last appt i left because she booked a wedding party during my scheduled appt . she was always in a hurry.. i would not recommend this shop .	3639
1	went there for the black friday sales as i usually do every year . extremely knowledgeable staff , especially bob with the tool suspenders . staff is very friendly and the sales are good . nice store .	3567
0	i appreciate the one year guarantee on implant crowns , particularly because mine broke just shy of that year ! perhaps it was because the crown was sort of hollow , like a shell ; odd , since it was made to replace a molar . nonetheless , i was pleasantly surprised and grateful angel dentistry eventually honored their verbal guarantee , even if the front desk initially tried to tell me it was past the 1 year guarantee . ( thank god for credit & debit card transaction records ! )	3402
0	finally had reason to create a yelp account . came for a sunday night family dinner but there were 2 wedding receptions booked . competing sound systems with loud music and emcees , slow service , and generally terrible experience . one star for the ok food and sympathy for the wait staff .	0
0	i was n't very happy with the experience nor food . their eggs benni was disgusting . will not be coming back here again . def not top breakfast joint as blog to states .	253
0	the taste of their food is average , but the main problem is that none of the food items is what you would expect from what is depicted in their menu . also we got horribly bad service and rudeness from one particular male staff wearing a black suit walking around ( probably the supervisor ) , but the rest of the staff seems okay	814
0	i stayed for a week at the hard rock and went here 7-10 times . there was never once they did . it screw up an order . they literally said they did not offer ice tea and proceeded to hand me a tea bag . i would say on average of ordering a drink it had to go back three time so they got it right . either it was the wrong size , the wrong tea , or they gave me an ice coffee . i 'm talking serious incompetence .	579
1	thanks cindy and nancy for making our first mom and daughter nail experience so pleasant . we love our nails .	104
1	stopped by while in vegas this last time . chicken tiki masala was amazing , their sag paneer was delicious and the cheese and garlic naan was mouthwatering . all went great with their mango chutney ! ! oh and not to mention their great staff ! ca n't wait to eat there again !	600
0	this place is terrible . the man was completely demeaning and the woman stared at me for 5 minutes before she called someone to help me . i would n't trust these people with any of my 5 dogs . i would n't trust them with a stray , the place is dirty and full of negativity . i truly hope you read this and look into a second option , unless you want to be talked down too and made to feel like you are beneath them all .	3850
1	was n't entirely interested in ever visiting this place , but it was absolutely crucial that we saw the mayweather vs. pacquido fight that night . the place was absolutely packed with barely any room to stand . personal space was of the essence . when i got a chance to make it to the bar through the crowd i was pleased with the decent price with beer . got ta have a heineken . it was a fluke that we even made it for the fight , but i went only because my friend wanted to . not exactly dying to go back as these kind of bars are not my forte . nice place though .	1292
1	another great visit to rtr vegas ! alyssa and rocky went above and beyond despite the fact that they were under staffed . alyssa was working with myself , and a couple other clients , but still managed to assist me with funding jewelry that would compliment my dress for the latin grammy 's .	2153
1	just moved into town and must say the best place to have breakfast and lunch with family . menu had manny good selections and the service was great ! looking forward to come back for lunch : )	134
0	so we were waiting for the family bathroom at scottsdale quarter and some young girl in a cocktail dress and stilettos ushers in front of us and our 3 month old fussy baby by herself and locks the door behind her . making eye contact with all of us ... only to emerge as a juby true employee in uniform ! real classy . maybe they should add a locker room on site or something .	468
1	we had just come back from a naples vacation and were missing korean food . decided to try this place out and were pleasantly surprised to find out the food was awesome ! had the yuk gae jang and the ja bong . probably the best i 've had in toronto . will be going back frequently for sure . you need to go here , this is proper homestyle korean food . no short cuts . but , i really think they should put draft beer on the menu !	298
1	garlic doughnuts and house made jerky a must ! super friendly and not stuck up , which is hard to find on king street ! !	3039
0	this place is a mess . so much potential , and excellent marketing - but the fundamentals are severely lacking . we bought bad chicken four times . four ! it incumbent of me to check the meat quality before purchasing ? ? do n't think so . it 's chicken . people could get really sick ! ! took it up with the owners but they have no accountability . zero fucks given . also ... their main cashier , 'rosalyn ' i think , is perpetually rude and miserable . she berates her staff right in front if their customers but offers no help at all . hope they get their stuff together ...	1639
0	rude , rude , rude . if i could give them a rating lower than a 1 star i would . the lady that answered the phone claimed to be the owner/manager/supervisor and would not connect me to george so that i could complain how rude she was ... do n't see them being in the insurance business for long ! ! !	727
0	stood up two days in a row ! ! excuse first day is they did n't see my info . scheduled second day for a 12-1 appt . even texted my info ! no phone calls or text as to why they were n't showing !	2258
1	we went in the other day and we got wings and pizza ready to go . you may want to call in before heading up there in case they are out . it 's usually ready in minutes . great prices . my son loves the pretzel bread pizza- very good . with so many choices for pizza in this town their prices are best . we love the wings - very moist and we like them with no sauce . very friendly staff .	519
0	i do n't see what all the hype is about this place . i like subway way better . jimmy john 's does n't have spinach or green bell pepper toppings like subway does , for one reason .	1475
1	each and every time i reach out to penguin air my experiences have been fast and professional . i have always felt their technicians were very knowledgeable , honest and helpful in reference to their assessments and recommendations . i will continue to recommend this company to friends , associates and family .	2203
1	great company to work with . their houses are clean and well cared for . repairs are completed by professionals and in a timely fashion . i would definitely recommend leasing a house from them .	3536
1	the first time i went i tried the lemon chicken and it was way to greasy and 90 % breading . the second time i tried the chicken and broccoli , it was ok .. my last trip i had the orange chicken and it was very flavorful . the wonton soup is so tasty . the staff is super friendly and they seem to have a lot of regulars which is a good sign !	1550
0	i went to the camelback store and arrived at 6:59 p.m. to simply return a router . the employee had just locked the doors as i was walking up , and refused to help out my simple return . he said that they were closed and would n't assist me . this is terrible customer service and represents the product that cox offers . please hire employees that seek to aid customers rather than ignore them , otherwise you 'll lose another customers business .	2633
1	frank 's is clean and the service is a lot better than it used to be . if the millvale location did n't exist , this place would get five stars , but it 's just not the same . obviously , the buffalo chicken pizza and ranch are amazing , they are just better in millvale . the chicken and ranch are the same , i think it 's just something about how they do the crust in millvale . either way , you ca n't beat the buffalo chicken pizza and frankie fries .	1509
1	i walked in and this place smelled so great . the people inside were amazingly friendly .	438
1	this venue is beautiful . i attended a wedding here last month ( september ) . they had the ceremony outside at sunset in front of the gorgeous fountain then the ceremony was right inside . the price was not nearly as high as the venues at the casinos on the strip . the food was good . during the 1 hour between ceremony and reception while bridal party took pictures a plethora of free horderves were passed around . the only downfall to this venue was the dance floor was very small .	3869
1	as usual the cooked food was great and the portions still large as usual . what surprised me is that they 've really stepped it up with their sushi ! the rolls were very large and filled with fish rather than 80 % rice like before . i just hope it is n't the odd chef that makes it like that .	516
1	i was glad to find out that there 's an authentic chinese restaurant close by my house ! our waitress was very kind and attentive . i ordered the salt and pepper crab which was so delicious ! the clams with aberdeen sauce was a little spicy , but it was still pretty good . the golden roasted chicken was amazing ; it was very juicy and flavorful . also i was surprised that the food arrived to our table so quick . overall this was truly a pleasant experience and i 'll most likely be coming back to try more of their dishes .	294
0	do n't call these guys . had them look at my water heater and the plumber couldnt find out that was wrong with it ( didnt look very hard ) and said he would start throwing parts at it and that the cost would start at $ 299 . well , i called someone else and it turned out it was just a bad ignitor switch . a $ 10 part . so either their plumbers are clueless or they are just trying to take advantage of customers . also to quote me $ 6700 for a water softener is just laughble . all other quotes were no higher than $ 2800 .	2203
1	if you like your pizza 's crust to be more buttered than donald trump 's butthole , this is the place for you . buttery , flaky , and just down right american inside and out ; this pizza was pretty good .	705
1	there are other locations and i fell in love with this place for a number of reasons . looking chic as a full figured woman for less than lane bryant , avenue , fashion bug or catherine 's is a wonderful feeling when on a tight budget ! however , i am not saying those other stores are not great because they are if you want high quality , but when you need to look good on a dime rainbow has your back and all sizes are available ! definitely a clothing store that does not discriminate !	1833
0	big store , lots of seating and staff , filthy . i really hate stores , especially that serve food , that are filthy . i mean floors not swept , creamer area with what appears to be more than a days worth of spills , staff that takes out garbage and then goes back to serving customers without washing hands .	1934
0	i ordered two shots of espresso with extra ice and a small amount of ice coffee and they wanted to charge me for the ice coffee ? gtfoh i go to starbucks almost everyday ( i live in california ) the smarter thing would to do was to have had them put it in a tall cup vs a grande and use a small amt of iced coffee cmon use your brain cells	2849
1	stopped by to check out this place and loved it . even though we visited a few months ago when it was very new , the service and food were excellent . wonderful outdoor area with lots of comfortable furniture . i 'll be back with more friends .	49
0	straight up scam artist , said they could n't fix my flat so they can sale me a used tire and keep my old one ... i had to drive back to california so i bought the used one and told them i wanted to keep my flat ... $ 40 ... came home and went to my trusted tire shop and they checked out my flat and hardly touch the `` patch up '' work they did and it peeled off ... he also said they did n't balance my the wheel ... he patched up my tires and switched the tires for me ... checked out the tire they sold me and it was already patched up 4 times ...	247
0	it 's a mall . in madison . it 's exactly what you 'd expect . the interior has been spruced up and there are some new stores , but west towne still wins . if you really need to shop , get outta town and head to milwaukee or chicago .	2594
1	i love the prices here . not the cleanest nor the most organized . not in the greatest area either . hoodlums in the area will harass your bike if you lock it here .	3194
0	the questions i had were ignored repeatedly so i withdrew my participation in the process and let my husband deal with them . evidently interacting with women is not their strongpoint . there is a lack of communication . the last straw is that they only have one machine to dig and it will not be available for a week and a half . so again , we are waiting on them . i wish we had gone with another company . they are very unprofessional . if i could rate negative stars i would .	3541
0	impossible to get an appointment that works for me within 2 weeks . and i 've been trying literally for the last 3 months . i 'm sure they do excellent work , but nobody answers the phone and they text you back ... . one time , it was 3 days later . i 'm done trying to get in . my time is valuable , also	1370
0	what does it take to have this guys call me back ? i left two messages and no call back ... ..what is up with that ? they are not taking new customers or something ?	2139
0	worst store ever i was overcharged for a box . 22.00 when everyone else would have charged 10 . overcharged for shipping 77.00 . vs actual ups charge of 42.57 . this ups store lied cheated and stole has poor integrity as they charged for 25x25x25 when actual real box is 20x20x20 . all verified by investigator , you will only get cheated at this store . i am filing a bbb formal complaint . filing a formal ups complaint , lying is not ok ups .	1764
0	your standard i-hop or denny 's style menu . the food was good and they serve large portions and the price is a bit much . i had the biscuits and gravy which came with 2 eggs , hashbrowns and choice of bacon or sausage . i selected the sausage , which was horrible ! next time i will order the bacon . overall good and i would eat there again .	1319
1	my 2 yr old face planted my ipad mini the screen was cracked everywhere . i went into one stop wireless to see if there was hope in replacing the screen without breaking the bank ... ..omg from the moment i walked in it was professional all the way . they were up front , honest , and affordable ... ... when i picked up my device 3 hrs later , it was as if it never was cracked ... .i will def refer them to anyone ... ..and you can just sense their dedication to their customers .	2930
1	superior customer service a few months ago we bought new rims for my rubicon here . have n't had any problems whatsoever . we love them . today i stopped in and asked them for help and they came out and looked under my tk and knew exactly what was wrong . ( it is a dealer warranty problem , not anything installed here ) . thanks for helping me figure out how serious my problem was ( or was n't ) .	2632
1	my so and i were in the area shopping and thought we would give this place a try for lunch . this was the best decision we made all day ! order two different type of hummus and a gyro . everything was absolutely delicious ! we will be returning .	875
1	great show ! very entertaining . got the crowd on their feet basically the whole concert . i liked the mariah carey concert better but i 'm a big mariah carey fan . only bad thing i could say are the people who is constantly video taping the concert on their phones obstructing the views .	1771
0	i 'm going to be straight up and say that the employee kyle was an a**hole today . he showed no interest in helping me with my ups shipping issue . he needs training in customer service and manners . i hope the manager ( god i hope it 's not kyle ) but i hope the manager sees this and gives that boy training . kyle gave the impression that he 's does n't like his job and does n't enjoy helping customers .	1764
1	the sandwiches are good here , it 's just a little pricey . the service was very friendly and it did n't take long to get our food . i 'll probably visit again if i 'm in the mood for subs .	517
0	very mediocre place with no service and ok place . we just ate pizza and the sauce was very sweet .	902
0	if i could give zero or negative stars- i would . this company was dispatched to me through my insurance . they were to be there between 30-60 minutes . after 3.5 hours of calling and getting the run around and lies and excuses in 40 degree weather , they never showed and i was forced to pay out of pocket for a tow . worst ever . stay far away .	2010
1	i like cat she is great with blondes . plus she is very nice . with the store coupons i feel like i get a great deal .	2479
0	called the office to become a new patient and the receptionist was short and down right rude . i 'm still on hold after twenty five minutes , waiting to speak to her manager . it is like this firm has forgotten , or does n't care , that they are there to serve their patients , and that the patients are the customer . absolutely no respect , and clearly no interest in growing their practice . in serious need of new management and a reminder why they are there .	3059
1	had a very good experience w/ bankier a few years ago in champaign , il . my apt was well-maintained , all service requests were done quickly . quiet building , good amenities , and good office staff . i recommend them regularly to people moving down to champaign . if you want quiet , just do n't live anywhere in campustown .	222
1	these guys are great ! came here for some issues with my tires and dashboard lights . service was quick and friendly . thanks , mark ! my car was in a bay in seconds after i signed the estimate . they called to update me and give me choices on the repair , and they were n't at all offended when i decided to do some repairs elsewhere . this was only because my car is european and i 'm wary of doing any major repairs anywhere but a certified volvo shop . i did end up getting an alignment and the issue with my dashboard lights were fixed . their prices were great . i will definitely be coming here again !	2392
1	my first time flying virgin . i 've been hearing great things about it & so my friend recommended it . first class was nice & i heard flying international it 's an even cooler different feel . i love the leg room , so much more than other airlines !	1623
1	had an appt yesterday for spa week and was very impressed by the awesome staff and wonderful medical professional that did my photofacial.they were knowledgeable , friendly and on time.the center was clean and relaxing.definitely a superior center .	582
1	huge selection of gel colors . i 've never been so overwhelmed with choices . dawn did my nails . i was pleased with her because she did a careful job and she knew i was on a time crunch so she worked as fast as she can to get me out of there . convenient because it is down the street from our house in vegas .	655
1	i brought my daughters here for a treat during our visit to charlotte from atlanta . very clean , relaxed atmosphere . the staff is warm and welcoming . we will visit again when we are in town !	2830
0	to tristan , i do not believe it is appropriate to write a review for your own company and give yourself 5 stars . i would consider that very unethical . i also consider it to be very bad business to divulge other people 's personal information to the public . you are a terrible business man and i hope people can see that through your poorly written response , which by the way is completely inaccurate . any reasonable consumer will clearly see that your lack of professionalism and complete disregard for any ownership or accountability for your company 's actions is reason enough to never do business with you .	3761
0	we came here because it was a block from home and we were feeing lazy . did n't want to drive to the normal fro yo place . boy , did we pay for our laziness ! the frozen yogurt was like the ice milk crap that you get at a buffet restaurant . the topping selection was lame and the place was a mess . not sure why this place is so packed all of the time , it sucks .	1903
1	this is my new favorite asian market . i love the food court out in front . they have buddae jiggae ! i did n't expect it . it has all sorts of food to try out . i 'm from colorado , so i would say that this is the closest to hmart that lv has to offer . i go to this place and 168 . check it out !	715
0	i hate coming to this urgent care but because of my insurance and the proximity to my house its my default urgent care . there is no sense of urgency what 's so ever here . some of the medical assistants look like they jut rolled out of bed without showering or laundering their scrubs . the front desk can be very slow . some of the dr 's hate being there . if you have a choice go elsewhere .	121
0	worst company i have ever dealt with , my bad i should have checked them out further before hiring them but i did n't . they hire installers that just do piece work and do n't really care if they scratch furniture , or even cover furniture so its not covered in concrete dust . they say they are going to take care of things and you have to call several times anyway . was also told i would receive cleaning kit with purchase of flooring and its been couple of weeks , no sign of it . like i said i should have checked this company out before , live and learn .	694
0	purchased a small bedroom bench 8 weeks ago . it seemed a little odd to wait 8 weeks for a $ 200 bench , but ok i 'll wait . when i called the service center , i was told my item was on backorder for an additional 8 weeks . do n't know about you folks but that seems pretty unreasonable since they will have had my order ( and my money ) for 4 months .	1640
